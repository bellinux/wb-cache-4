5|$|Miss Honora Sneyd {{would not}} admit the {{unqualified}} {{control of a}} husband over all her actions; she did not feel, that seclusion from society was indispensably necessary to preserve female virtue, or to secure domestic happiness. Upon terms of reasonable equality, <b>she</b> <b>supposed,</b> that mutual confidence might best subsist; she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, {{that she would not}} change her present mode of life, with which she had no reason to be dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to her.|$|E
5|$|From early 1929 Anderson {{lived with}} Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy Park Avenue {{spinster}} happy to host someone <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> to be {{a daughter of}} the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society. Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet, and on one occasion running around naked on the roof. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her to a mental hospital. Before she could be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and the door was broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she remained for slightly over a year. In August 1932, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner Deutschland. Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at Ilten near Hanover. On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane, but as the room was prepaid, and she had nowhere else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.|$|E
2500|$|When Douglass {{was about}} twelve, Hugh Auld's wife Sophia started {{teaching}} him the alphabet. Douglass described {{her as a}} kind and tender-hearted woman, who treated him [...] "as <b>she</b> <b>supposed</b> one human being ought to treat another". Hugh Auld disapproved of the tutoring, feeling that literacy would encourage slaves to desire freedom; Douglass later referred to this as the [...] "first decidedly antislavery lecture" [...] he had ever heard. Under her husband's influence, Sophia {{came to believe that}} education and slavery were incompatible and one day snatched a newspaper away from Douglass. In his autobiography, Douglass related how he learned to read from white children in the neighborhood, and by observing the writings of the men with whom he worked.|$|E
