This can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the deeper, more carbon-rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as calcium carbonate.

5|$|Sperm whales {{increase}} {{levels of}} primary production and carbon export by depositing iron-rich faeces into <b>surface</b> <b>waters</b> of the Southern Ocean. The iron-rich faeces cause phytoplankton {{to grow and}} take up more carbon from the atmosphere. When the phytoplankton dies, it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.|$|E

5|$|As {{the city}} water supply from Aldershawe was {{diminishing}} {{in the early}} 19th century, money was spent diverting <b>surface</b> <b>waters</b> from 'Swan Moggs' into a common conduit. The two streams across it were diverted into underground culverts; the land was raised with silt and mud dredged from Minster Pool. The area was subsequently developed into the formal gardens of Beacon Park by the Lichfield Corporation, but {{paid for by the}} Conduit Lands Trust. The Museum Gardens were opened in 1859 to complement the new Italianate Free Library and Museum. The Recreation Grounds, opened in 1891, is the small area between the Museum Gardens and the wider Beacon Park. The central fountain was unveiled as the central focus of the Museum Gardens in 1871. A bandstand was also installed close to the junction of the Museum Gardens and Recreation Grounds, and was positioned to provide a focus for the avenue through the Museum Gardens.|$|E
5|$|For {{surface water}} {{sources such as}} lakes and reservoirs, the volume {{available}} for dilution of ionic species leached from ash is generally large. The most abundant components of ash leachates (Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cl, F and SO4) occur naturally at significant concentrations in most <b>surface</b> <b>waters</b> and therefore are not affected greatly by inputs from volcanic ashfall, and are also of low concern in drinking water, {{with the possible exception}} of fluorine. The elements iron, manganese and aluminium are commonly enriched over background levels by volcanic ashfall. These elements may impart a metallic taste to water, and may produce red, brown or black staining of whiteware, but are not considered a health risk. Volcanic ashfalls are not known to have caused problems in water supplies for toxic trace elements such as mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) which occur at very low levels in ash leachates.|$|E

5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most <b>surface</b> <b>waters,</b> rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
5|$|Planula larvae exhibit {{positive}} phototaxis, swimming towards {{light to}} reach <b>surface</b> <b>waters,</b> where they drift and grow before descending {{to seek a}} hard surface to which they can attach and begin a new colony. They also exhibit positive sonotaxis, moving towards sounds that emanate from the reef and away from open water. High failure rates afflict many stages of this process, and even though millions of gametes are released by each colony, few new colonies form. The time from spawning to settling is usually two to three days, but can be up to two months. The larva grows into a polyp and eventually becomes a coral head by asexual budding and growth.|$|E

5|$|Common loons {{are mainly}} Nearctic, and breed from 48° N to the Arctic Circle, locally south to 40° N and north to 78° N. During their {{breeding}} season {{in spring and}} summer, most common loons live on lakes and other waterways in the northern United States and Canada, {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland, in Iceland, in Svalbard, in Jan Mayen, and in Bear Island in Norway; and in Alaska, to the west, and very rarely in Scotland, to the east. Their summer habitat ranges from wooded lakes to tundra ponds. The lakes must be large enough for flight take-off, and provide a large population of small fish. Deep lakes with warm <b>surface</b> <b>waters,</b> relatively low biological productivity and low turbidity where their fish prey are easy to see are habitats where breeding loons are more successful in raising young. For protection from predators, common loons favour lakes with islands and coves. They are rare visitors to the Arctic coast. They are known to exhibit high breeding site fidelity.|$|E

The Küttejõu open-pit mine was closed in 1947 and the Küttejõu {{underground}} mine was merged with the Kiviõli mine in 1951. The Ubja mine was closed in 1959. After construction of large oil shale-fired power stations, demand for oil shale increased and consequently new larger mines were constructed: the underground mines Viru (1965) and Estonia (1972) along with the open-pit mines Sirgala (1963), Narva (1970) and Oktoobri (1974; later named Aidu). Correspondingly, several exhausted smaller mines like Kukruse (1967), Käva (1972), No. 2 (1973), No. 4 (1975), and Kiviõli (1987) were closed. The Estonia Mine became the largest oil shale mine in the world. Because {{of the success of}} oil shale-based power generation, Estonian oil shale mining peaked in 1980 at 31.35million tonnes, and in the same year power generation peaked at 18.9TWh. The industry declined during the subsequent two decades. Demand for electric power generated from oil shale decreased following construction of nuclear power stations in the Russian SFSR, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station. At the end of 1988, a fire broke out in the Estonia Mine. The largest underground fire in Estonia, it continued for 81days and caused serious pollution of ground and <b>surface</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|E

40|$|The role of <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> {{drainage}} {{in environmental}} change in Australia is rarely appreciated. Drains can modify <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> hydrology, not only altering flow regimes but also rapidly dispersing contaminants and altering the natural hydrological balance of associated flora and fauna.

The impact of <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> drainage in an inherently saline area of South Australia, the Upper South East, is investigated. <b>Surface</b> <b>water</b> drains were constructed by developers in an attempt to increase the area of land available and viable for agricultural land use.

Multiple existing methods are explored, discussed, {{and some new}} algorithms are introduced to allowvery accurate detection of <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> and surfacewater changes. Themethods range in applicability from the local level to global, and from detecting high-frequency changes to low-frequency changes. Their trade-offs regarding the accuracy and applicability of the <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> detection methods are also discussed. Several applications are presented to test the introduced methods. One of the studies focuses on a long-term global <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> change detection over the past 30 years at 30 m resolution. The other application looks at the generation of a permanent <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> mask for Murray-Darling River Basin in Australia. Additionally, an in-depth validation for a small reservoir in California, USA is presented, to demonstrate performance of the new methods. The algorithms discussed in the thesis were applied and tested to process both passive optical multispectral and active Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data. Combining data fromall freely available satellite sensors requires harmonizations of the satellite data, but also, significant computing resources.
