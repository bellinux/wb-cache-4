The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the <b>spinning</b> <b>motion,</b> several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E

It also makes use of the opening from the Richard Strauss tone poem Also sprach Zarathustra performed by the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Herbert von Karajan. The use of Strauss's Zarathustra may be a reference to the theme of mankind's eventual replacement by supermen (Übermensch) in Nietzsche's work Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

For the analysis, we divided plate motions into two types, <b>spin</b> <b>motion</b> and straight <b>motion.</b> The plate <b>spin</b> <b>motion</b> generates a shear motion at the plate boundary and is associated with toroidal motion, whereas straight plate motion results in poloidal motion at both subduction zones and ridges, and toroidal motion along transform faults. Therefore, the ratio of <b>spin</b> <b>motion</b> to straight motion {{can be used as}} an index of the toroidal/poloidal ratio.|$|R

Creighton, who had thus far {{been used by}} the team {{primarily}} in the infield, was brought on as a substitute pitcher. Using what observers described as a [...] "low, swift delivery," [...] Creighton achieved uncommonly swift velocity. With the balls [...] "rising from the ground past the shoulder to the catcher," [...] the Star batsmen were unable to hit them effectively. Under the rules of baseball at the time, a pitcher was required to deliver the ball underhanded with arm locked straight at the elbow and at the wrist. Another technique he used was to give the baseball <b>spinning</b> <b>motion,</b> making it harder for the batters to hit it squarely. Additionally, he threw a high-arcing slower pitch called a [...] "dew-drop." [...] It was the job of the pitcher to make it easy for the batter to hit the ball as fielding was considered the game's true skill. Star batsmen claimed that Creighton was using an illegal snap of the wrist to deliver the pitch. Although the Star Club prevailed, Creighton joined their club following the game.|$|E

30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to constrain the driving forces of plate motion, especially the plate <b>spin</b> <b>motion,</b> for which we analyzed the relationship between toroidal–poloidal components, plate geometry, plate size, <b>spin</b> <b>motion,</b> and their geographical distribution. The following results were obtained. First, a continuous increase in the toroidal/poloidal ratio at high spherical harmonic degrees (> 20 up to 1000; Fig.  1) arises from an increase in the spin rate of individual plates (Fig.  4), rather than a consequence of geometrical factors (e.g., a systematic change in aspect ratio with plate size; Fig.  3). Second, <b>spin</b> <b>motion</b> of plates without slabs decreases at plate sizes of ∼ 1000  km and greater (Fig.  5), which indicates the strength for plate boundaries (Fig.  6). Third, the geographical distribution of <b>spin</b> <b>motion</b> (Fig.  7) suggests that large plates with subducting slabs drive the <b>spin</b> <b>motion</b> of surrounding smaller plates, similar to gears that transmit the shear stress induced by straight motion of large plates. Finally, from the dynamic equilibrium of <b>spin</b> <b>motion</b> at the critical plate size, we obtain the relationship between the strength of the plate boundary and the viscosity of the asthenosphere. Assuming the viscosity and thickness of the asthenosphere to be 10 ^ 19 – 10 ^ 20  Pa s and 60 – 140  km, respectively, we roughly estimated the strength of the plate boundary to be 3 – 75  MPa, which is comparable to the stress level estimated from several seismological observations, including those in NE Japan associated with the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.|$|R

60|$|There is a toy {{called the}} spiralifer, which is common enough in towns, and which is, doubtless, known to almost every one. It {{consists}} of four flat fans attached to a spindle somewhat after {{the manner of the}} arms of a windmill. It is placed in a hollow tube and made to spin violently by pulling a string wound round the spindle. The result is that the spiralifer leaps out of the hollow tube and ascends powerfully as long as the violent <b>spinning</b> <b>motion</b> continues. If properly constructed, this toy acts with great force and certainty, and if the <b>spinning</b> <b>motion</b> could only be kept up, by any means, the ascent would be continued. The principal here involved is precisely the same as that which causes a windmill to turn, a screw-propeller to drive a ship, and a cork-screw to enter a cork. It is pressure against a resisting medium. Air is the resisting medium {{in the case of the}} mill; water and cork respectively in the other cases. The only difference between the windmill and the spiralifer is, that the first is moved by the air pressing against it, the other by itself, in its rotatory action, pressing against the air. If you turn a bottle upside down, and, while in that position, send a cork-screw up into the cork, you set in motion the same force which is applied in the spiralifer. As the screw screws itself up into the cork, so the spiralifer screws itself up into the air. Of course the screw remains sticking there when the motive power ceases, because of the density of the medium through which it moves, while the spiralifer, when at rest, sinks, because of the fluidity of the air; but the principle of motion in each is the same. The screw-propeller of a ship is just a spiralifer placed horizontally, acting on water instead of air, and having a vessel placed in front of it.|$|E

It was wonderful to see how they whirled about among the fowl, striking one on the head, another on the leg, another on the wing, until they happened to hit one plump on the body; that seemed to stop them. I am sure one of those sticks that I kept my eyes fixed on must have knocked down six birds. I will practice with these things, and if I ever get back home I will teach their use to our people.
