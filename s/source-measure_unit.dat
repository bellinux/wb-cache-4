Such development is motivated by capability of source-measure units to acquire data, generate I-V curves, and otherwise characterize various device performances. As a part of proposed development some considerations concerning high current sources are presented and some aspects of circuit design are treated. Because the circuit traditionally is used only as current generator, in this paper is suggested innovative approach to use this current source as voltage generator. The approach consists basically in implementation of software loop that continuously calculate resistance of device under test and control the output voltage.

(x[*]=[*] 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30) {{thin films}} with {{different}} oxygen vacancies were grown on SrTiO 3 (STO) substrates under different oxygen partial pressures using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The details of film growth {{can be found}} in our previous reports [13, 14, 21, 22]. The laser power and substrate temperature were maintained at 35  mJ and ~ 750  °C, respectively, at a constant frequency of 4  Hz. During thin film growth, the oxygen partial pressure was set at either 100 or 180  mTorr. Therefore, it is expected that the oxygen content differs among the thin films. The thickness of the films was characterized by a surface profilometer. The quality of the thin films was studied in multiple ways, including the lattice parameter, lattice volume, and surface morphology. The crystal structure was characterized by high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD). (Two thin films were characterized using the Bruker D 8 Discover HRXRD system, while the other three films were characterized with the PANalytical X’Pert PRO HRXRD system.) The surface morphology was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). MR was measured by using a cryogen-free cryostat (CMag Vari 9, Cryomagnetics Inc.) and a dual-channel <b>source-measure</b> <b>unit</b> (Keithley 2612 A Standard Measurement Unit) [13].|$|E

The base pressure of the sputtering chamber was below 2 [*]×[*] 10 - 4  Pa, and the working pressure was 3  Pa maintained by a gas mixture of argon. The diameter of the top electrodes was 0.1  mm, and the DC power was 10  W.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of carbon nanotube arrays for field ionization in ion thrusters {{allows for a}} substantial reduction in thruster size and weight. The availability of miniature ion thrusters may enable {{the development of a}} suitable propulsion system for nano- and picosatellites, and can realize substantial weight, volume, and cost savings in existing satellite platforms. This research focuses on the design of a field ionization test chamber {{that can be used to}} determine a comprehensive performance metric for the carbon nanotube field ionization micro-ion thruster (CNTFIMIT). Using the knowledge gathered from two previously employed test chamber designs, a third generation apparatus with higher precision and improved capabilities is constructed. This new design incorporates a mass flow controller for propellant flow rate measurements, a high-voltage <b>source-measure</b> <b>unit</b> for ionization current measurements, and a linear shift with position feedback for adjusting the distance between the carbon nanotubes and the counter electrode during field-ionization. The design emphasizes user-friendly operation by simplifying the sample exchange and by reducing the chamber volume under vacuum for a faster turn-around time between experiments. The proposed design is highly modular, allowing for easy installation of additional analytic capabilities and other future upgrades. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — As process {{technologies}} continually advance, process variation {{has greatly}} increased and has gradually {{become one of}} the most critical factors for IC manufacturing. Further-more, these increasingly complex processes continue to make greater use of stressors for mobility enhancement, thus requiring large volumes of data for extensive characterization of layout-dependent effects (LDE) for validation of both SPICE models and design for manufacturing. Transistor threshold voltage (Vt) is a commonly used parameter both for characterization during process development and for monitoring of volume manufac-turing. To adequately quantify local process variation or LDE, Vt must be measured for a sufficiently large number of device-under-tests (DUTs) to obtain a statistically representative sample population. The number of Vt measurements required to obtain such a statistically significant result, however, requires extremely long testing time, especially for array-based test structure designs including thousands of DUTs. In this paper, we present a very fast threshold voltage measurement methodology using an operational amplifier-based <b>source-measure</b> <b>unit</b> test configuration, which greatly improves testing efficiency and accuracy, and is not sensitive to process variation. The proposed test methodology can improve Vt testing time by a factor of 5 – 10 relative to the commonly used binary-search algorithm, and by a factor of ∼ 2 relative to an optimized interpolation algorithm, and achieves better accuracy (standard deviation of Vt = 0. 15 mV, versus typical accuracy of ∼ 0. 5 mV for the two algorithms mentioned). Furthermore, the layout and configuration of conventional test structures need not be modified to adapt the proposed method-ology. The measured results from the most advanced process technology nodes demonstrate the testing efficiency and accuracy of the proposed test structure in characterizing the large number of DUTs required for quantifying process variation or LDEs...|$|E
