40|$|Abstract <b>Scoping</b> <b>studies</b> {{have been}} used {{across a range of}} {{disciplines}} {{for a wide variety of}} purposes. However, their value is increasingly limited by a lack of definition and clarity of purpose. The UK's Service Delivery and Organisation Research Programme (SDO) has extensive experience of commissioning and using such studies; twenty four have now been completed. This review article has four objectives; to describe the nature of the <b>scoping</b> <b>studies</b> that have been commissioned by the SDO Programme; to consider the impact of and uses made of such studies; to provide definitions for the different elements that may constitute a scoping study; and to describe the lessons learnt by the SDO Programme in commissioning <b>scoping</b> <b>studies.</b> <b>Scoping</b> <b>studies</b> are imprecisely defined but usually consist of one or more discrete components; most commonly they are non-systematic reviews of the literature, but other important elements are literature mapping, conceptual mapping and policy mapping. Some <b>scoping</b> <b>studies</b> also involve consultations with stakeholders including the end users of research. <b>Scoping</b> <b>studies</b> {{have been used}} for a wide variety of purposes, although a common feature is to identify questions and topics for future research. The reports of <b>scoping</b> <b>studies</b> often have an impact that extends beyond informing research commissioners about future research areas; some have been published in peer reviewed journals, and others have been published in research summaries aimed at a broader audience of health service managers and policymakers. Key lessons from the SDO experience are the need to relate <b>scoping</b> <b>studies</b> to a particular health service context; the need for scoping teams to be multi-disciplinary and to be given enough time to integrate diverse findings; and the need for the research commissioners to be explicit not only about the aims of <b>scoping</b> <b>studies</b> but also about their intended uses. This necessitates regular contact between researchers and commissioners. <b>Scoping</b> <b>studies</b> are an essential element in the portfolio of approaches to research, particularly as a mechanism for helping research commissioners and policy makers to ask the right questions. Their utility will be further enhanced by greater recognition of the individual components, definitions for which are provided. </p...|$|R

Following a detailed <b>scoping</b> <b>study</b> undertaken in 1996, Transit New Zealand identified its preferred options for a new crossing - either a new bridge approximately 500 m west of the bridge connecting to the North-Western Motorway (SH16) via a tunnel underneath Ponsonby and Grey Lynn, or a tunnel slightly {{to the east of}} the bridge connecting to the Central Motorway Junction via twin cut-and-cover tunnels under the western CBD / Victoria Park.|$|E

2500|$|To {{take the}} case for {{reinstatement}} forward, a [...] "Central Rail Corridor Board" [...] {{was set up in}} 2004, with members from regional, county and district levels, local MPs and Southern. The Board, led by East Sussex County Council, oversaw the development of initiatives to explore the feasibility of reinstatement and provide guidance on the political, planning and transport policy framework. A free <b>scoping</b> <b>study</b> was prepared by a consortium of transport and engineering consultants, who recommended in March 2005 that there were sufficient grounds for proceeding to a full feasibility study at a cost of £150,000, the funding for which was provided by numerous local authorities in the area.|$|E

40|$|A <b>scope</b> <b>study</b> is {{conducted}} {{to investigate the}} technical and commercial feasibility of converting existing mine haul truck engines to a fuel regime of methane and diesel. A dual fuel engine with two technology options of homogeneous gas charge and high pressure direct injection are considered. The {{results of this study}} show that cost reduction is only possible when methane is available at a cost saving that compensates for the expense of building a new fuel infrastructure, and a clean combustion is expected. In contrast to diesel-only engines, particulate emissions in dual fuel engines are less. However, unburned methane in the exhaust gases or significant methane leakage must be seriously taken into consideration for replacing diesel with methane. This <b>scope</b> <b>study</b> argues that the dual fuel operation with HGC/CNG technology is expected to be feasible even at a relatively small truck fleet size...|$|R

40|$|SERC II re-branded {{the focus}} and intent {{of our group}} to better {{understand}} and advance the role of “The Social Economy in Rural Revitalization and Development. ” This organizing concept provides both a purpose and roadmap for understanding how our work can progress {{over the next five}} years. These initial <b>scoping</b> <b>studies</b> (combined with the broad literature overview currently being conducted) will be grounded in an understanding of sustainable rural development and rural revitalization, yet provide insights into the social economy specifics of different resource sectors. Put differently, our focus is on over-all community development but with specific ‘chapters’ on sectors/enterprises. The studies will also {{play an important role in}} linking our SERC II focus and objectives with the mapping project. The research team will gain a better understanding of the sectors, make connections with any sector-based associations or other research entities, and feed this information to the mapping team. This project will build upon the broad literature review currently being conducted for SERC II, and will focus on the role that social enterprises in specific resource sectors play in sustaining and revitalizing rural communities. This project will consist of two <b>scoping</b> <b>studies</b> – one in each province. Two graduate level students (one from each province), will work with four identified project leads for an initial term of 4 months and, provided their initial work is satisfactory, followed by a further 8 months to complete the <b>scoping</b> <b>studies.</b> Recognizing that we will be researching different sectors over the period of the project, these first studies will look specifically at the following areas: • non-timber forest products; • local and organic food systems; • eco-tourism; • fisheries; and • renewable energy (including biofuels from agricultural crops, forestry and industrial and household waste, wind, small-scale hydro, solar, tidal) ...|$|R
