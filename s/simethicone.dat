50|$|There are {{foods and}} other {{substances}} that {{can interfere with}} absorption of thyroxine. Examples include calcium and iron supplements taken within four hours of levothyroxine, Other substances that reduce absorption are aluminium and magnesium containing antacids, <b>simethicone,</b> sucralfate, cholestyramine, colestipol, and polystyrene sulfonate. Grapefruit juice may delay the absorption of levothyroxine, but based on a study of 10 healthy people aged 20-30 (8 men, 2 women) {{it may not have}} a significant effect on bioavailability in young adults. A study of eight women suggested that coffee may interfere with the intestinal absorption of levothyroxine, though at a level less than eating bran. Certain other substances can cause adverse effects that may be severe. Combination of levothyroxine with ketamine may cause hypertension and tachycardia; and tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants increase its toxicity. On the other hand, lithium can cause hyperthyroidism (but most often hypothyroidism) by affecting iodine metabolism of the thyroid itself and thus inhibits synthetic levothyroxine as well.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) medications {{that can be}} used to treat bloating. Food enzymes can be found in some products that will help break down the sugars found in grains, vegetables and dairy products. They can be taken before food is consumed or added to the food that causes the gas and bloating. Another type of medicine is activated charcoal tablets which decrease the odor from gas. The most common treatment is antacids. These medications have no effect on the gas that is presently in the intestines, but enable gas build-up to be belched away more easily, reducing the amount of bloating that develops. Another treatment is <b>Simethicone,</b> an oral anti-foaming agent that helps the body to expel the gas more quickly.Also combinations of prokinetics, such as domperidone + metoclopramide + diphenhydramine (the latter for the prevention of extrapyramidal reactions, especially acute dystonic reactions) + proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), have dramatic effects on bloaters and belchers especially.|$|E
5000|$|Antacids and {{sucralfate}} {{were found}} to be no better than placebo in a literature review. [...] H2-RAs have been shown to have marked benefit in poor quality trials (30% relative risk reduction), but only a marginal benefit in good quality trials. Prokinetic agents would empirically seem to work well since delayed gastric emptying is considered a major pathophysiological mechanism in functional dyspepsia. [...] They have been shown in a meta-analysis to produce a relative risk reduction of up to 50%, but the studies evaluated to come to this conclusion used the drug cisapride which has since been removed from the market (now only available as an investigational agent) due to serious adverse events such as torsades, and publication bias has been cited as a potential partial explanation for such a high benefit. [...] Modern prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, erythromycin and tegaserod have little or no established efficacy and often result in substantial side effects. [...] <b>Simethicone</b> {{has been found to be}} of some value, as one trial suggests potential benefit over placebo and another shows equivalence with cisapride. [...] So, with the somewhat recent advent of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) class of medications, the question of whether these new agents are superior to traditional therapy has arisen.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Carbamazepine is an {{anticonvulsant}} drug {{and is also}} used {{as a treatment for}} patients with manic-depressive illness, post-herpetic neuralgia or phantom limb pain. The drug itself has many drug interactions. <b>Simethicone</b> is an antifoaming agent and is reported to be an inert material with no known drug interaction with carbamazepine. Case presentation We present a case of a patient who was routinely using carbamazepine 400 mg three times per day and levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily, and experienced carbamazepine overdose after exposure to <b>simethicone.</b> After cessation of <b>simethicone</b> therapy normal drug levels of carbamazepine were obtained again with the standard dose of the drug. The mechanism of interaction is unknown but the risk of overdose should be considered when prescribing <b>simethicone</b> to a patient who is using carbamazepine. Conclusion <b>Simethicone</b> and carbamazepine, when taken together, may be a cause of carbamazepine toxicity. The risk of carbamazepine overdose should be considered when prescribing <b>simethicone</b> to a patient who is using carbamazepine. </p...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of <b>simethicone</b> in enhancing visibility and efficacy during colonoscopy. METHODS: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted. One hundred and twenty-four patients were allocated to receive 2 doses of sodium phosphate plus 240 mg of tablet <b>simethicone</b> or placebo as bowel preparation. Visibility was blindly assessed for the amount of air bubbles and adequacy of colon preparation. Total colonoscopic time, side effects of the medication, endoscopist and patient satisfaction were also compared. RESULTS: Sodium phosphate plus <b>simethicone,</b> compared to sodium phosphate plus placebo, improved visibility by diminishing air bubbles (100. 00 % vs 42. 37 %, P < 0. 0001) but <b>simethicone</b> failed to demonstrate improvement in adequacy of colon preparation (90. 16 % vs 81. 36 %, P = 0. 17). Endoscopist and patient satisfaction were increased significantly in the <b>simethicone</b> group. However, {{there was no difference in}} the total duration of colonoscopy and side effects of the medication. CONCLUSION: The addition of <b>simethicone</b> is of benefit for colonoscopic bowel preparation by diminishing air bubbles, which results in enhanced visibility. Endoscopist and patient satisfaction is also increased...|$|E
40|$|Background Infantile colic (IC) is {{a common}} painful {{disorder}} within early months of life. There is no definitive therapeutics for IC. In present study aimed to assess pain-relieving potential of glucose administration in infantile colic. Materials and Methods This was a double blinded randomized clinical trial performed during May 2015 -June 2017 in pediatric ward of Amir-Al-Momenin Hospital, Zabol city, Iran. Overall, 72 infants {{were randomly assigned to}} either glucose or <b>simethicone</b> groups (36 infants per group). Treatments were continued for 28 days with either 25 % or 30 % glucose solution and 2. 5 mg/kg <b>simethicone.</b> Outcomes were assessed {{at the end of the}} intervention (28 days). Statistical analysis was done in SPSS version 22. 0. Results Males and females constituted 20 (55. 5 %), and 16 (45. 5 %) in glucose administrated, and 23 (63. 8 %) and 13 (36. 2 %, P= 0. 4) in <b>simethicone</b> group respectively. The mean age (days) was 19. 1 ± 3. 8 and 20. 2 ± 4. 9 for glucose and <b>simethicone</b> administrated groups, respectively (P= 0. 2). The crying times per day significantly reduced in both groups (mean reduction in crying times of 3. 7 ± 2. 1, and 6. 3 ± 2. 1 hours in glucose and <b>simethicone</b> groups, respectively). Moreover, 25 % and 44. 4 % of infants in glucose and <b>simethicone</b> groups achieved ≥ 50 % reduction in crying time, respectively (P= 0. 06). According to the glucose dose, infants who received 30 % glucose solution significantly revealed higher ratio of ≥ 50 % reduction in crying time (47. 3 %) than those received 25 % glucose solution in which no cases fulfilled this outcome (...|$|E
40|$|Background: Capsule {{endoscopy}} {{is a novel}} {{non-invasive method}} for visualization of the entire small bowel. The diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy depends {{on the quality of}} visualization of the small bowel mucosa and its complete passage through the small bowel. To date, there is no standardized protocol for bowel preparation before capsule endoscopy. The addition of <b>simethicone</b> in the bowel preparation for the purpose of reducing air bubbles in the intestinal lumen had only been studied by a few investigators. Methods: Sixty-four participants were randomly divided into two groups to receive a bowel preparation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution (Group 1) and both PEG solution and <b>simethicone</b> (Group 2). The PEG solution and <b>simethicone</b> were taken the night before and 20 min prior to capsule endoscopy, respectively. Frames taken in the small intestine were examined and scored for luminal bubbles by two professional capsule endoscopists. Gastric emptying time and small bowel transit time were also recorded. Results: <b>Simethicone</b> significantly reduced luminal bubbles both in the proximal and distal small intestines. The mean time proportions with slight bubbles in the proximal and distal intestines in Group 2 were 97. 1 % and 99. 0 %, respectively, compared with 67. 2 % (P< 0. 001) and 68. 8 % (P< 0. 001) in Group 1. <b>Simethicone</b> had no effect on mean gastric emptying time, 32. 08 min in Group 2 compared with 30. 88 min in Group 1 (P= 0. 868), but it did increase mean small intestinal transit time from 227. 28 to 281. 84 min (P= 0. 003). Conclusion: Bowel preparation with both PEG and <b>simethicone</b> significantly reduced bubbles in the intestinal lumen and improved the visualization of the small bowel by capsule endoscopy without any side effects observed...|$|E
