5000|$|For streamlining, {{distinctive}} {{features of the}} car are the two small [...] "nostrils", headlights and air inlets in the nose. These produced less drag than a typical inlet and flat honeycomb radiator. The engine was cooled instead by a <b>surface</b> <b>radiator</b> wrapped {{around the top of}} the bodywork, {{just in front of the}} driver.|$|R
5000|$|As {{they are}} so {{dependent}} on airspeed, <b>surface</b> <b>radiators</b> are even more prone to overheating when ground-running.

50|$|Blue Bird was rebuilt {{for a third}} time. The chassis, {{engine and}} {{drivetrain}} remained the same, but the bodywork was replaced with one built in Dumfries by Arrol-Aster. This body was lower, requiring a hump around the cockpit where Campbell now sat astride the gearbox. The <b>surface</b> <b>radiators</b> were replaced by a conventional circular nose opening, covered by a distinctive 'birdcage' grille.|$|R

2500|$|The Gloster VI was a low-winged braced monoplane. An obvious {{feature in}} {{photographs}} {{is the way}} that the wing roots tapered so as to reduce in thickness, designed to increase lateral control at low speeds. [...] It retained the Napier Lion engine that had powered the previous Gloster racers, but with power boosted to 1,320hp (985kW) by supercharging. [...] Engine cooling was via thin <b>surface</b> <b>radiators</b> on each wing.|$|R
40|$|A heat {{rejection}} system for space is described which uses a recirculating free stream of liquid droplets {{in place of a}} solid surface to radiate waste heat. By using sufficiently small droplets (100 micron diameter) of low vapor pressure liquids the radiating droplet sheet can be made many times lighter than the lightest solid <b>surface</b> <b>radiators</b> (heat pipes). The liquid droplet radiator (LDR) is less vulnerable to damage by micrometeoroids than solid <b>surface</b> <b>radiators,</b> and may be transported into space far more efficiently. Analyses are presented of LDR applications in thermal and photovoltaic energy conversion which indicate that fluid handling components (droplet generator, droplet collector, heat exchanger, and pump) may comprise most of the radiator system mass. Even the unoptimized models employed yield LDR system masses less than heat pipe radiator system masses, and significant improvement is expected using design approaches that incorporate fluid handling components more efficiently. Technical problems (e. g., spacecraft contamination and electrostatic deflection of droplets) unique to this method of heat rejectioon are discussed and solutions are suggested...|$|R

2500|$|As first built, the NiD 42 was {{a highly}} {{streamlined}} parasol-wing monoplane with a monocoque fuselage [...] and an open cockpit of which a single prototype was built. Soon afterwards, Nieuport-Delage built two examples of a modified version for the 1924 Coupe Beaumont as the NiD 42S, on which the main wings were mounted directly {{to the sides of}} the upper fuselage at shoulder position with a short subsidiary wing fitted around the undercarriage axle.. To further streamline the design, the <b>surface</b> <b>radiators</b> were installed on the upper surface of the wing.|$|R
50|$|The M.39 was {{designed}} by Mario Castoldi (1888-1968) to represent Italy in the 1926 Schneider Trophy race, {{and it was the}} first low-wing monoplane that he designed for Macchi. It was a single-seat, twin-float racing seaplane, of mixed (metal and wooden) construction. The wooden wings were wire-braced, with two-thirds of the upper surfaces used as low drag <b>surface</b> <b>radiators.</b> The pilot sat in an open cockpit parallel with the trailing edge of the wing; the cockpits windscreen was profiled into the fuselage decking to reduce aerodynamic drag. The floats carried fuel.|$|R
50|$|The Macchi M.33 was a single-seat, wooden, shoulder-wing {{monoplane}} {{flying boat}} of very clean aerodynamic design for its time. Its cantilever wing was fairly thick and carried stabilizing floats on each side. Italy lacked competitive racing engines in 1925, so the M.33 was powered with a used 1923 Curtiss D-12 engine rated at 378 kilowatts (507 horsepower) in a steamlined nacelle mounted on struts above the fuselage and driving a two-bladed tractor propeller. The M.33 had a flat-plate radiator, a type that was obsolescent by 1925, rather than modern <b>surface</b> <b>radiators.</b>|$|R
25|$|Early in 1923, a {{decision}} was made to redesign the racer and in the months following, a completely new design emerged with the original landplane being converted into a floatplane. Radical surgery was performed to turn the sesquiplane into a biplane, with strutted wings, wing <b>surface</b> <b>radiators,</b> enlarged tail <b>surfaces</b> and a set of floats also part of the redesign. Fitted with a new, more powerful 700hp Wright T-3, a development of the T-2 and a three-blade propeller, the second of the NW series was designated NW-2 and was entered into the 1923 Schneider Trophy held at Cowes, Isle of Wight.|$|R

50|$|On {{board the}} International Space Station, heat {{transfer}} is mainly performed by active systems.Regarding heat removal, internal loops have been installed that collect heat generated by crew and equipment. They transport {{the heat to}} external loops, which then transfer the heat to <b>surface</b> (<b>radiators)</b> from which it is radiated towards deep space. The active systems are able to work {{across a range of}} operating powers because the application parameters can be changed during the operations by a controller. On the other hand, they have complexity that in space is often reflected in a greater involvement of resources (mass and time of the astronaut) and in a higher probability of malfunction.|$|R

2500|$|Improved {{aerodynamics}} were innovatively {{tested in}} Vickers' wind-tunnel by R.K. Pierson, their Chief Designer. Blue Bird’s body shape was substantially changed, {{with the famous}} coachbuilders Mulliner producing the bodywork. The results were unorthodox. A vertical tail fin was added for stability, a first for Blue Bird and land speed record cars. Open spats behind the wheels also reduced drag. The biggest change was to the radiators, which were moved {{to the rear of}} the car and mounted externally. These <b>surface</b> <b>radiators</b> were made by Fairey Aviation and contained [...] of tube. Removing the nose radiator allowed a low, rounded nose with better streamlining.

5000|$|Following {{the success}} of the Supermarine S.5 in the 1927 Schneider Trophy R.J. Mitchell {{designed}} a successor, the Supermarine S.6 to Specification 8/28. Refining the design of the earlier S.5, Mitchell now used all-metal construction. Although its lineage was evident, the new design had to accommodate a new powerplant. The [...] Napier Lion VIIB engine was judged to be incapable of further development, and the S.6 was to use the new 1,900 hp (1,417 kW) Rolls-Royce R engine. With the problems of cooling attendant on such a high power output, the S.6 had <b>surface</b> <b>radiators</b> built into the floats as well as the wings, and Mitchell even arranged for airflow through the wing internal structure.|$|R

50|$|The Supermarine S.5 was {{designed}} by Reginald Mitchell for the 1927 Schneider Trophy. Following the earlier loss of the S.4 before the 1925 Schneider Trophy event Mitchell designed a new all-metal monoplane racer. Unlike the S.4's all-wood structure, the S.5 featured composite construction with the semi-monocoque fuselage mainly duralumin including the engine cowlings. The S.5 had a low, braced wing with spruce spars and spuce-ply ribs and a plywood skin. The wing <b>surface</b> <b>radiators</b> made up of corrugated copper sheets replaced the Lamblin type radiators of the S.4. Three aircraft were built, one with a direct drive 900 hp (671 kW) Napier Lion VIIA engine, {{and the other two}} with a geared 875 hp (652 kW) Napier Lion VIIB engine.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims to gain {{understanding of}} the key design aspects in using renewable sources (e. g., geothermal and solar) for residential heating. To achieve this aim, a simulation study has been undertaken by using the EnergyPlus™ software Version 8. 1. First {{a brief review of}} the literature was carried out, which covers solar ground-source heat pump, solar-heated water, low-temperature wall and floor <b>surface</b> <b>radiators,</b> types of solar collector, fixed tilt versus solar tracker, and cost versus savings. Then the conceptual design idea and energy simulation process are described. Following this a simulation study of a 30 m 2 one-bedroom simple house, as a case example was carried out. The results show that, with two <b>surface</b> <b>radiators,</b> a 30 m 2 house would remain within the acceptable thermal comfort temperature range in winter. The simulation results also show that the floor radiator, fed with water from U-tube in deep ground warms the concrete-in-ground floor, which would otherwise be cold {{for more than half a}} year. The simulation results also show that the wall radiators, fed with water (stored in a 2 m 3 indoor tank) heated by evacuated tubes make the indoors comfortable throughout the year. Furthermore, the results of additional 3 -dimensional simulation show that, the creation of a thermal mass under the floor, using vertical insulation into the ground along its perimeter, may obviate the need of the floor radiator and borehole. In conclusion, the results of the simulation study show that it is feasible to utilise a combination of the renewable geothermal and solar energy to achieve indoor thermal comfort in houses. Future research is needed which includes validation of these simulations results with actual data collected from the case example and simulation study of more complex and larger scales residential houses...|$|R

We clarified the mechanisms responsible {{for the formation of}} these morphologies by systematically exploring the molecular interactions among the polymer, solvent(s), and water vapor. Our results proved that the formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>surface</b> morphology needed the presence of water vapor, a non-solvent of the polymer, at an appropriate level of relative humidity. The formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>surface</b> morphology was dependent on the speed of evaporation of the solvent(s) (ACE, DMF, and their mixtures), as well as the inter-diffusion and penetration of the non-solvent (water) and solvent(s). The results of N 2 physical adsorption-desorption isotherms showed that the macro-porous fibers (>[*] 300  nm) exhibited the highest specific surface area of 23.31 [*]±[*] 4.30  m 2 /g and pore volume of 0.0695 [*]±[*] 0.007  cm 3 /g, enabling the high oil absorption capacities of 50.58 [*]±[*] 5.47  g/g, 37.74 [*]±[*] 4.33  g/g, and 23.96 [*]±[*] 2.68  g/g for silicone oil, motor oil, and olive oil, respectively. We believe this work may serve as guidelines for the formation of different structures of macro-porous, rough, and grooved nanofibers with interior porosity through electrospinning.|$|R
