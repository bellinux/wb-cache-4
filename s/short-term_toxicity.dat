40|$|BackgroundThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the risks for short-term (≤ 3 months) and long-term (> 3 months) chemotherapy-associated toxicities in a large population-based cohort of patients with non-small cell lung cancer from 1991 to 2002. MethodsThe population consisted of 41, 361 men and 30, 804 women ≥ 65 years identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results—Medicare-linked database. The incidence of 50 toxicity-associated end points was calculated for 14 chemotherapy agents. Short- and long-term toxicities with a ≥ 2 -fold increase in incidence compared with the no-chemotherapy group were defined as chemotherapy-associated toxicities. Hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for the risk of toxicity were calculated for the four most common chemotherapy agents for non-small cell lung cancer: cisplatin/carboplatin, paclitaxel, vinorelbine/vinblastine, and gemcitabine. ResultsThe most common <b>short-term</b> <b>toxicities</b> (9. 2 – 60 %) included acute anemia, nausea, and neutropenia. The most common long-term toxicities (15 – 37 %) included acute anemia, respiratory failure, pulmonary fibrosis, dehydration, neutropenia, nausea, and fever. Multivariate analysis for selected chemotherapies demonstrated that after adjusting for other risk factors and confounders, some <b>short-term</b> <b>toxicities</b> became nonsignificant; however, almost all long-term toxicities remained significant. Long-term toxicity increased over time and was more likely in women, minority populations, those with fewer baseline comorbidities, and across disease stages. ConclusionsThe administration of various chemotherapy agents for non-small cell lung was associated with a number of short- and long-term toxicities. The projected survival benefits of chemotherapy must be weighed against the risk of long-term toxicities...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. Traditional {{designs for}} phase I {{clinical}} trials require each patient (or {{small group of}} patients) to be completely followed before the next patient or group is assigned. In situations such as when evaluating late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents, this may result in trials of imprac-tically long duration. We propose a new method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM), that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It {{is an extension of}} the continual reassessment method (CRM; O’Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990, Biometrics 46, 33 - 48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can be applied to extend other designs for studies of <b>short-term</b> <b>toxicities.</b> We prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method’s accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM’s while the former takes a much shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by the CRM could be reduced to 2 - 4 years by our method...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide, {{regulations}} of chemicals require <b>short-term</b> <b>toxicity</b> data for evaluating hazards and {{risks of the}} chemicals. Current data requirements on the registration of chemicals are primarily based on tonnage and do not yet consider properties of chemicals. For example, short-term ecotoxicity data are required for chemicals with production volume greater than 1 or 10 ton/y according to REACH, without considering chemical properties. Highly hydrophobic chemicals are characterized by low water solubility and slow bioconcentration kinetics, which may hamper the interpretation of <b>short-term</b> <b>toxicity</b> experiments. In this work, internal concentrations of highly hydrophobic chemicals were predicted for standard acute ecotoxicity tests at three trophic levels, algae, invertebrate, and fish. As demonstrated by comparison with maximum aqueous concentrations at water solubility, chemicals with an octanolwater partition coefficient (Kow) greater than 106 {{are not expected to}} reach sufficiently high internal concentrations for exerting effects within the test duration of acute tests with fish and invertebrates, even though they might be intrinsically toxic. This toxicity cutoff was explained by the slow uptake, i. e., by kinetics, not by thermodynamic limitations. Predictions were confirmed by data entries of the OECDs screening information data set (SIDS) (n = 746), apart from a few exceptions concerning mainly organometallic substances and those with inconsistency between water solubility and Kow. Taking error propagation and model assumptions into account, we thus propose a revision of data requirements for highly hydrophobic chemicals with log Kow > 7. 4 : <b>Short-term</b> <b>toxicity</b> tests can be limited to algae that generally have the highest uptake rate constants, whereas the primary focus of the assessment should be on persistence, bioaccumulation, and long-term effects...|$|E

40|$|Local {{treatment}} options for early stage breast cancer include mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy (BCT), the latter consisting of local excision followed by radiotherapy. For all age groups, {{the risk of}} local recurrence after BCT is higher than after mastectomy, with similar survival rates. However, young age is a known risk factor for local recurrence and distant metastases after both BCT and mastectomy. Since local recurrence is possibly a source of distant spread by itself, no consensus exists, whether young women can be treated safely with BCT. Our study confirms that in young women with early stage breast cancer survival after BCT {{is similar to that}} after mastectomy. Furthermore, the occurrence of metastases after local recurrence is not directly associated with the type of local treatment. At our department, radiotherapy as part of BCT consists of whole breast irradiation with an integrated boost to the tumour bed.

Methods: We enrolled 57 eligible patients as group A. These patients received 42. 5 Gy in 16 fractions of 2. 66 Gy each to the whole breast over 3. 2 weeks. A concomitant electron boost of 12 Gy in 16 fractions was also administered which gave an additional 0. 75 Gy daily to the lumpectomy area for a total radiation dose of 54. 5 Gy.

40|$|Abstract Background The use of antilymphocyte agents has {{improved}} patient and graft survival in {{hematopoietic stem cell}} and solid organ transplantation but {{has been associated with}} the development of <b>short-term</b> <b>toxicities</b> as well as long-term complications. Case presentation We report a young female with Fanconi anemia who received antithymocyte globulin as part of the conditioning regimen prior to her planned allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh. She developed sudden and severe hepatotoxicity after receiving the first dose of horse antithymocyte globulin, manifested by marked elevation of serum transaminases and mild elevation of serum bilirubin level. Immediately after withdrawal of the offending agent and shifting to the rabbit form of antithymocyte globulin, the gross liver dysfunction started to subside and the hepatic profile results returned to the pre-transplant levels few weeks later. The patient had her allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant as planned without any further hepatic complications. After having a successful allograft, she was discharged from the stem cell transplant unit. During her follow up at the outpatient clinic, the patient remained very well and no major complication was encountered. Conclusion Hepatotoxicity related to the utilization of antithymocyte globulin varies considerably in severity and may be transient or long standing. There may be individual or population based susceptibilities to the development of side effects and these adverse reactions may also vary with the choice of the agent used. Encountering adverse effects with one type of antithymocyte agents should not discourage clinicians from shifting to another type in situations where continuation of the drug is vital. </p...|$|R

The use of the noni leaves has not been so studied however; {{there are reports of}} its pharmacological benefits. Aims: The objective of this investigation was to assess the genotoxicity, short-term, and subchronic oral toxicity of Morinda citrifolia L leaves aqueous extract. Methods: The genotoxicity of the M. citrifolia extract was investigated by measuring the frequency of micronuclei in mice bone marrow cells. The animals were treated with three doses of the extract (500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg). For <b>short-term</b> <b>toxicity,</b> both sexes Wistar rats received 1000 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Animals were sacrificed for hematological and biochemical evaluation. For the subchronic study, Wistar rats were administered with three doses of M. citrifolia extract (100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg) by oral route for 90 days. Mortalities, clinical signs, body weight changes, food and water consumption, hematological and biochemical parameters, gross findings, organ weights, and histological examination were monitored during the study period. Results: Genotoxicity and <b>short-term</b> <b>toxicity</b> test resulted in absence of toxicity at doses between 500 and 2000 mg/kg.

40|$|In China, it is {{necessary}} to establish short-term biomonitoring methods for evaluating the chronic toxicity of industrial wastewater. In this paper, the aquatic toxicity of four important pollutants in petrochemical wastewater, including acrylonitrile, acetonitrile, sulphocyanic sodium and dimethyl formamide, was studied with fish and amphibian embryo-larval toxicity tests using Cyprinus caprio and Rana nigromaculata as test organisms. The objective is to present some useful data for establishing <b>short-term</b> chronic <b>toxicity</b> test methods used to perform biomonitoring in China. The results indicate that the chronic toxicity of acrylonitrile to fish and amphibians was the highest of the four test pollutants, followed by NaSCN, acetonitrile and DMF. The sensitivity of the carp embryo-larval test to chemicals was greater than that of the R. nigromaculata embryo-larval test. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a sampling program {{to determine the}} potential impact of contaminants in urban runoff introduced to Santa Monica Bay through low flow (dry weather) conditions. A sampling protocol was developed whereby four selected storm drains were sampled and analyzed for conventional water quality parameters (e. g., chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, etc.), and <b>short-term</b> chronic <b>toxicity</b> using three marine organisms (red abalone Haliotus rufescens, purple sea urchin Strongy 1 ocentrotus purpuratus, and giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera). The obtained results show that some of water quality parameters (e. g., chemical oxygen demand) of the selected storm drains were comparable or worse than typical secondary effluents. Several storm drains also exhibited toxicity. However, the most likely source of toxicity varied from metals to organic contaminants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Radiation therapy after {{lumpectomy}} is {{a standard}} part of breast conserving therapy for invasive breast carcinoma. The most frequently used schedule worldwide is 60 Gy in 30 fractions in 6 weeks, a time commitment that sporadically may dissuade some otherwise eligible women from undertaking treatment. The purpose and primary endpoint of this perspective study is to evaluate feasibility and <b>short-term</b> late <b>toxicity</b> in a hypofractionated whole breast irradiation schedule. Methods Between February and October 2008 we treated 65 consecutive patients with operable invasive early-stage breast cancer with a hypofractionated schedule of external beam radiation therapy. All patients were assigned to 39 Gy in 13 fractions in 3 weeks to the whole breast plus a concomitant weekly boost dose to the lumpectomy cavity of 3 Gy in 3 fractions. Results All the patients had achieved a median follow up of 24 months (range 21 - 29 months). At the end of treatment 52 % presented grade 0 acute toxicity 39 % had grade 1 and 9 % had grade 2. At 6 months with all the patients assessed there were 34 % case of grade 1 subacute toxicity and 6 % of grade 2. At 12 months 43 % and 3 % of patients presented with clinical grade 1 and grade 2 fibrosis respectively and 5 % presented grade 1 hyperpigmentation. The remaining patients were free of side effects. At 24 months, with 56 assessed, just 2 patients (3 %) showed grade 2 of late fibrosis. Conclusions The clinical results observed showed a reasonably good feasibility of the accelerated hypofractionated schedule in terms of acute, subacute and <b>short-term</b> late <b>toxicity.</b> This useful 13 fractions with a concomitant boost schedule seems, in selected patients, a biologically acceptable alternative to the traditional 30 days regime. </p...|$|R
