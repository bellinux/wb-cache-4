5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear <b>sounds</b> <b>too</b> faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these <b>sounds</b> <b>too</b> can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E
500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] is a mid-tempo {{dancefloor}} track. The {{song was}} produced by Scott Storch, who took influence from Middle Eastern music. The track samples The Salsoul Orchestra's [...] "Love Break". The production was described by IGN as having a [...] "Middle Eastern tinge" [...] with synthesized strings that [...] "unleash a darkly atonal whirl that <b>sounds</b> <b>too</b> much like something either Timbaland or The Neptunes or Mannie Fresh have concocted". The Guardian wrote that the production contains [...] "wan-sounding imitations of the Neptunes' sparse, breathy funk". PopMatters described the bridge as being [...] "relaxed yet faintly ominous" [...] with 50 Cent and Olivia crooning: [...] "Girl what we do (what we do) / And where we do (and where we do) / The things we do (things we do) / Are just between me and you (oh yeah)." [...] Rolling Stone noted the chorus for 50 Cent's [...] "amateur-sounding tenor croon".|$|E
50|$|Susan Roman voiced James in the film. Originally, he {{was played}} by {{television}} Series UK narrator Michael Angelis, {{who was to}} also voice Percy. Unfortunately, test audiences said he <b>sounded</b> <b>too</b> old, so Susan Roman replaced him. Roman, however, made James <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> feminine, which was something fans have strongly disliked.|$|R

2500|$|... “If {{you want}} {{academic}} credibility, {{if you want}} respect from the established entities, whether they are psychological or medical or whatever, well, {{you have to play}} their game.

2500|$|Two root {{antonyms}} {{are frequently}} encountered: eta (little), and dura (hard [...] ). However, their popularity {{is due to}} their iconicity. Eta {{is derived from the}} diminutive suffix and more properly means slight, but it's a little word, and its use for malgranda (little) is quite common. The reason for the popularity of dura is similar: official malmola simply <b>sounds</b> <b>too</b> soft to mean [...] "hard".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first major}} {{framework}} dichotomises motivations of code-switching in Hong Kong into [...] "expedient mixing" [...] and [...] "orientational mixing". For expedient mixing, the speaker {{would turn to}} English (e.g., form) if the correspondent [...] "low Cantonese" [...] expression is not available and the existing [...] "high Cantonese" [...] expression (e.g., 表格 biu2 gaak3) <b>sounds</b> <b>too</b> formal. In the case of orientational mixing, {{despite the presence of}} both [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low" [...] expression (e.g., for [...] "barbecue", there exists both 燒烤 siu1 haau1 in [...] "high Cantonese" [...] and 燒嘢食 siu2 je5 sik6 in [...] "low Cantonese"), the speaker could still resort to English if the subject is perceived to be inherently more 'Western'. (K.K. Luke 1998: 145–159) (Lee J. 2012:165) The following list elaborates and summaries the distinction between English,"High Cantonese", [...] "Low Cantonese" [...] and Code-Switching.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Robinson of The Observer, {{gave the}} album 5 out of 5 stars, {{summarising}} it as [...] "the cool yet commercial pop queens put a spring in Peter Robinson's step", although saying [...] "only occasionally do the band drop the ball: 'Better' {{is an excellent}} song but <b>sounds</b> <b>too</b> much like Jamelia's 'Thank You'". Nick Southall from Stylus Magazine gave the album a B+, also noting similarities with Aaliyah's single, stating [...] "'Gotta Be You' is disarmingly close to 'Try Again'", further concluding it as [...] "not the best album in the world or even of the year, not obscurantist schizeclecto meta-pop like Annie or M.I.A. or loaded down with po-mo pop.cult. signifiers like Girls Aloud, it doesn't impart a skewed existential narrative like Britney, but 'Taller In More Ways' is absolutely bursting with tunes, and as such it's hard to resist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shannon Larkin {{explained}} how {{the band is}} able to walk the line between staying true to their roots {{and being able to}} satisfy themselves creatively, stating, [...] "Usually the riffs decide how new songs come about, with one of us showing the others a riff, and then the rest of us just jamming along until a song starts to form. If the song <b>sounds</b> <b>too</b> far from our roots (or our sound or style) then we can tell after jamming it a few times, and we either drop it or re-work it to sound more true to our roots. Satisfying ourselves creatively is pretty easy, as we aren't trying to re-invent the wheel musically - we are a blue-collar hard rock band. That said, we do side projects in which we can experiment with different textures and styles and scratch any itches to experiment in different genres." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although early Aramaic (pre-7th century BCE) {{had only}} 22 consonants in its alphabet, it {{apparently}} distinguished {{all of the}} original 29 Proto-Semitic phonemes, including , , , , , [...] and [...] although by Middle Aramaic times, these had all merged with other sounds. This conclusion is mainly based on the shifting representation of words etymologically containing these sounds; in early Aramaic writing, the first five are merged with , , , , , respectively, but later with , , , , [...] (Also note that due to begadkefat spirantization, which occurred after this merger, OAm. t > ṯ and d > ḏ in some positions, so that PS *t,ṯ and *d, ḏ may be realized as either of t, ṯ and d, ḏ respectively.) The sounds [...] and [...] were always represented using the pharyngeal letters [...] , but they are distinguished from the pharyngeals in the Demotic-script papyrus Amherst 63, written about 200 BCE. This suggests that these <b>sounds,</b> <b>too,</b> were distinguished in Old Aramaic language, but written using the same letters as they later merged with.|$|E

50|$|Male vocative {{forms and}} female ones ending in е are used {{regularly}} and their substitution with nominative forms is also considered a gross error (or the speaker may <b>sound</b> <b>too</b> snobbish).|$|R
2500|$|The sequel Blade Runner 2049 was {{released}} in October 2017, which revisited the question while leaving the answer deliberately ambiguous. The film reveals that Deckard was able to naturally conceive a child with Rachael, and this was possible because she was an experimental prototype (designated [...] "Nexus-7"), {{the first and only}} attempt to design a replicant model capable of procreating on its own. [...] The Tyrell Corporation eventually went bankrupt after several replicant rebellions and was bought out by Wallace Corporation, which took over replicant production, but it could not duplicate Tyrell's success with Rachael. [...] Niander Wallace, the sinister CEO of the company, captures Deckard and muses to him about how he met her and fell in love: [...] Wallace thinks it <b>sounds</b> <b>too</b> perfect, and ponders if Deckard himself was [...] "designed" [...] {{to fall in love with}} Rachael, as part of Tyrell's experiment to develop replicants that can procreate (in which case Deckard is a replicant) - but Wallace also admits that with Tyrell dead and the records destroyed, he'll never know, and it is equally possible that Tyrell never planned for Rachael and Deckard to fall in love (in which case, Deckard is probably human).|$|E
2500|$|Little Broken Hearts {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69 based on 27 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album three-and-a-half stars {{out of five}} and found that Jones and Burton are [...] "well matched" [...] and added: [...] "Norah Jones may be pouring her heart out but it's been given an elegantly detailed sculpture that camouflages her pain. Listen closely and its evident, but it takes effort to ignore the alluring haze and hear the songs that lie beneath." [...] American Songwriters review was positive about the album, calling it [...] "the most dramatic and rewarding departure she's [...] made in her career" [...] and said: [...] "Little Broken Hearts is her most commanding and compelling role yet." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave a positive review to the album and rated it four-stars-out-of-five, writing: [...] "It might be dark, but this stunning collection of anguish is the brightest she's shined in a long time." [...] Marcus J. Moore of BBC Music also gave a positive review to the album, mentioned she [...] "never <b>sounds</b> <b>too</b> depressed on this set", and further expanded: [...] "She keeps the mood fairly moderate amongst Burton's fluid soundtrack, setting the pace with a wry bravado that makes this album a dynamic listen." [...] Maerz of Entertainment Weekly gave a B grade to the album and wrote: [...] "With Brian Burton (a.k.a. Danger Mouse) producing, the heavy-lidded-vixen thing works for her here." [...] Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel went in-depth on his review of the album, finally giving it three-and-a-half stars out of five and concluded: [...] "This is a serious indie pop album. Jones and Burton have created something that should fit in the record collection of any Feist-loving indie kid just as easily as that of those soccer moms she won over years ago." ...|$|E
