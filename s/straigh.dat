40|$|A new {{combined}} precoding/shaping {{technique for}} fast digital transmission is proposed. Major advantages of this "dynamics shaping" are: Dynamics {{of the signal}} at the input of the decision device are reduced by a great amount. Thereby, A/Dconversion, adaptive equalization, and symbol timing are rather facilitated. A trade-off between signal dynamics at the transmitter output, decision device input and the SNR-gain by noise whitening is offered. For dynamics limitation relevant in practice, gains up to 6 dB are achieved. Nevertheless, system complexity is lower than in other precoding/shaping techniques. Numerical results are presented for a HDSL-application in the German Telekom subscriber network. 1.

One of the biggest contributing factors to chronic ankle instability (CAI) is the lack of dorsiflexion after lateral ankle sprains and WBV may be an effective way to increase range of motion in this population.

40|$|HMM-based speech {{synthesis}} offers {{a way to}} generate speech with different voice qualities. However, sometimes databases contain certain inherent voice qualities {{that need to be}} parametrized properly. One example of this is vocal fry typically occurring at the end of utterances. A popular mixed excitation vocoder for HMM-based {{speech synthesis}} is STRAIGHT. The standard STRAIGHT is optimized for modal voices and may not produce high quality with other voice types. Fortunately, due to the flexibility of STRAIGHT, different F 0 and aperiodicity measures can be used in the synthesis without any inherent degradations in speech quality. We have replaced the STRAIGHT excitation with a representation based on a robust F 0 measure and a carefully determined two-band voicing. According to our analysis-synthesis experiments, the new parameterization can improve the speech quality. In HMM-based speech synthesis, the quality is significantly improved especially due to the better modeling of vocal fry.

40|$|Accurate {{acoustic}} {{characterization of}} zooplankton species is essential if reliable estimates of zooplankton biomass {{are to be}} made from acoustic backscatter measure-ments of the water column. Much work has recently been done on the forward problem, where scattering predictions have been made based on animal morphology. Three categories of scatterers, represented by theoretical scattering models, have been identified by Stanton et al. (1994) : gas-bearing (e. g. siphonophores), fluid-like (e. g. euphausiids) and hard elastic-shelled (e. g. pteropods). If there are consistent diVer-ences in the characteristic acoustic signatures {{of each of these}} classes of zooplankton, {{it should be possible to}} solve the inverse problem by using acoustic backscatter data to infer mathematically the class of scatterer. In this investigation of the feasibility of inverting acoustic data for scatterer-type, two diVerent inversion techniques are applied to hundreds of pings of data collected from broadband ensonifications (2350 kHz– 750 kHz) of individual, live zooplankton tethered and suspended in a large tank filled with filtered sea water.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mapping method for wide row crop fields. The resulting map shows the crop rows and weeds {{present in the}} inter-row spacing. Because field videos are acquired with a camera mounted {{on top of an}} agricultural vehicle, a method for image sequence stabilization was needed and consequently designed and developed. The proposed stabilization method uses the centers of some crop rows in the image sequence as features to be tracked, which compensates for the lateral movement (sway) of the camera and leaves the pitch unchanged. A region of interest is selected using the tracked features, and an inverse perspective technique transforms the selected region into a bird’s-eye view that is centered on the image and that enables map generation. The algorithm developed has been tested on several video sequences of different fields recorded at different times and under different lighting conditions, with good initial results. Indeed, lateral displacements of up to 66 % of the inter-row spacing were suppressed through the stabilization process, and crop rows in the resulting maps appear <b>straigh...</b>|$|E

Cilia, isolated from Tetrahymena pyriformis by the dibucaine procedure, are attached to a polylysine substratum, and treated with Triton X- 100. Critical point drying maintains three-dimensional structure without embedding. The detergent removes the membrane and many axonemes unroll, always in an organized fashion so that doublets follow one another in sequence, according to the enantiomorphic form of the cilium. The central pair of microtuo bules fall to the side as a unit. The parallel doublet microtubules retain relative longitudinal positions in part by interdoublet or nexin links.

Spatial and temporal steering vectorra transform the data collected in the space-time domain to the angle-Doppler domain. However, the JDL algorithm depends {{on the assumption that}} the spatial and temporal steering vectoni form an orthogonal set. In practice, due to the mutual coupling between antenna elements, the spatial steering vectors do not form an orthogonal set. This paper presents a modification of the JDL algorithm to account for the non-orthogonality of these steering vectors. Examples from the MCARM database demonstrate the improvement in detection capability. The detecti,on of small, slow moving targets by airborne surveillance radar requires the suppression of strong, dynamic and possibly inhomogeneous interference in real time.

40|$|Purpose: This {{comparative}} {{case study}} seeks to describe {{success and failure}} factors for SMEs starting up export/import and production in another country with very limited financial and human resources. Design/methodology/approach: Two cases of business projects that describe Swedish SMEs that started up export/import in Lithuania. Case study units were identified in personal communication. The criteria for selecting these SMEs were that they had some products or ideas that could be of interest for other markets and that they also needed some kind of production or network in other countries {{for being able to}} develop their companies. The model of success/failure factors is connected to those studies and gives some examples of ways of making growth in a SME. The primary study collects answers from direct project with match making in Lithuania and after that deep interviews and meetings for following up. Secondary study has been added from other studies and articles. The study is longitudinal and the process for developing the company for being able to enter new markets is described in this study. Findings: The findings in the comparative case study suggests that the main reason micro SMEs can grow in a new market is relying of the creativity of the owner, networking, connection between consultant, company ownership and insight of lowering costs concerning logistics and production. Illustrations show the network and strategies for handling marketing failures. For micro companies the contact in personal level seems to be important for push the process further on.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we first discuss a {{particular}} approach suggested for feature inspection, namely 'optical back projection', {{and then the}} results of model calculations to determine the robustness of the scheme. One of the tasks specified for the vision group of the RIPR project is {{the implementation of a}} run time inspection cell which is able to identify a small object, and to subsequently inspect it using a single camera, referred to as the inspection camera, attached to a robot arm. As a definite example, we may want to determine whether a hole has been machined on a particular face of the object with the correct radius and at the correct position, at least to within some previously agreed upon tolerance. As has been implied, measurements of features will assumed to be given with respect to some set of accurately known features (referred to as calibration features) on the object (such as its edges), ie the body of the object is taken to have been manufactured accurately, any imperfections are assumed to exist solely in the finer detail. The inspection cell demonstrator will thus be envisaged to be used for feature verification. Optical Back Projection As explained, we wish to determine various properties of some feature which is taken to lie on a given planar surface of the object being inspected. It is convenient to introduce three important reference frames for our discussion, namely the world, the inspection and the camera frames. Figure 1 depicts the experimental set up for the inspection task, where the object is assumed to have been placed at some position in the world frame. The feature to be inspected is assumed to lie in the plane A, referred to as the feature plane. We can see from the figure that the feature plane may be determined simply by choosing three suitable noncollinear points PI, P 2 and P 3. These three points define a plane which the feature lies in, and it is <b>straigh...</b>|$|E
40|$|Some {{time ago}} Mr. J. van Rijn van Alkemade, the Hague, {{presented}} to the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie a most remarkable double tusk of a Sumatran elephant. Mr. Van Rijn van Alkemade could provide us with the following particulars about the specimen. It {{was shot in the}} residency of Palembang before 1906 and the above mentioned double tusk was presented to his father at that time Resident of Palembang. The elephant was a four tusker, the other double tusk, which was of a corresponding shape as the one {{presented to the}} Museum, came into the hands of a Chinese dealer. Double tusks in elephants are reported in more than one occasion and it is also a known fact that sometimes twisted tusks in elephants can occur (cf. Colyer: Variations and diseases of the teeth of animals, 1936, pp. 548 — 551). As far as I am aware a double tusk of which one is about straight, the other twisted around the first has never been reported till now. The tusks have been cut off and, unfortunate enough, the skull has not been preserved, therefore the situtation "in facto" is unknown and every comment upon how these teeth originated must remain speculative. As the first winding of the spiral tusk passes {{on the right side of}} the normal one and the tip of the former is damaged on the same side it is not unlikely that we have the rightsided pair before us. As said above one of the tusks is nearly straight, though it shows at its basal part a slightly upwards directed curve as to give place to the twisted tusk to pass underneath of it. The distal part bends slightly upwards as in normal tusks. The length measured in straight line is 87 cm, height at base 5. 5 cm, breadth at base 6. 5 cm.

Even though the transient hot wire method is presently recognised as a standard technique for the measurement of non conducting fluids, its application to conducting liquids is not <b>straigh</b> forward, because of the usual design of the measuring cell -where a bare metallic wire in contact with the fluid is used simultaneously as a power source and as a resistance sensor, that leads to current leakage and consequently, ambiguity in the knowledge of some fundamental parameters used in thermal conductivity's calculations. To overcome this difficulty, in the present apparatus the conventional platinum wire was replaced by a tantalum wire covered with a thin layer of tantalum pentoxide, assuring in this way the insulation of the sensor from the fluid. This substitution has originated a drastic change in the sensor element resistance and to maintain the precision of the method in the same level of the non conducting fluids, one has to implement a new measurement system to increase the resolution of the automatic Wheatstone bridge, usually employed in the classic instruments. This work was developed in two stages. In the first, the test of the operation and accuracy of the new automatic Wheatstone bridge was performed, using a platinum wire apparatus to measure the thermal conductivity of two fluids recommended by Iupac as standard reference fluids for thermal conductivity - toluene and benzene. The results obtained with a precision of #+-# 0. 1 %, show excellent agreement with others of different authors, with deviations not exceeding #+-# 0. 6 % from the recommended correlation.
