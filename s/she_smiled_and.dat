500|$|San Miguel has {{admitted}} to being offended by criticism of her response. In {{an interview with}} entertainment commentator Ricky Lo {{a week after the}} event, she explained that she did not comprehend the question clearly when she was on stage at the pageant, due to the softness of the questioner's voice. When given another opportunity to answer the same question, <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "My family is my inspiration".|$|E
500|$|When {{the role}} was being cast, actress Annabeth Gish {{received}} a call from her agent, who informed her that the producers of The X-Files were looking for a new female character. Gish applied for the part, but her audition consisted of a meeting with writers Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. Spotnitz considered Reyes to be like Mulder in her optimism, faith and enjoyment of being open to beliefs, while still being somewhat different as she was more spiritual and subscribed to a more New Age-like view than Mulder had. Reyes was seen as different from both Mulder and the other main characters as she was somewhat more neurotic, scattered, and quirky. <b>She</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> laughed more than the other characters, having a nature that writer Frank Spotnitz felt was lighter, sunnier, brighter, warmer and more [...] "overtly sexy".|$|E

60|$|Lor. She is of {{a middle}} stature, dark-coloured hair, the most bewitching leer with her eyes, the most roguish cast! her cheeks are dimpled when <b>she</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> her <b>smiles</b> would tempt an hermit.|$|R
6000|$|PETKOFF. Oh, very well, very well. (They go {{into the}} house {{together}} affectionately. Sergius, left alone with Raina, looks anxiously at her, fearing that she may be still offended. <b>She</b> <b>smiles,</b> <b>and</b> stretches out her arms to him.) ...|$|R
500|$|Little {{was heard}} from Katsura {{for many years}} after the 1961 world championship. McGoorty lamented her retirement, stating various {{theories}} {{that he had heard}} bandied about in billiard circles, such as that her husband (who died in June 1967) kept her from playing for various reasons. In 1976 Katsura made an impromptu appearance at Palace Billiards in San Francisco. She borrowed a cue from someone present and proceeded to run 100 points at straight rail without problem. Prolific pool and billiard author Robert Byrne wrote that after Katsura finished that 100-point run, [...] "without a miss <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> bowed to the applauding crowd, stepping away from the spotlight, and disappeared forever from the American billiard stage." [...] Katsura returned to Japan in or about 1990 to live with her sister, Noriko, where she said she planned to live out her days. Katsura died in 1995. In September 2002 a memorial tournament for Katsura, billed as Katsura Memorial: The First Ladies Three Cushion Grandprix, was held in Japan and aired on SKY PerfecTV! ...|$|E
500|$|At Fotheringhay on {{the evening}} of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be {{executed}} the next morning. She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France. The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution. The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, [...] "I forgive you with all my heart, for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles." [...] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments, revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson-brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church, with a black satin bodice and black trimmings. As she disrobed <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> said that she [...] "never had such grooms before... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company". She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, and stretched out her arms. Her last words were, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum" [...] ("Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E
2500|$|With Democrats facing {{possible}} large {{losses in}} the 2010 midterm elections and President Obama struggling in opinion polls, idle speculation in Washington media circles concerning Obama's chances in the 2012 presidential election led {{to the notion that}} Clinton would take over as Obama's vice-presidential running mate in 2012 to add to his electoral appeal. Some versions of this idea had Vice President Biden replacing her as Secretary of State if Obama won. That it would ever happen was unlikely, but did not stop the chatter; when the job swap idea was mentioned in public to Clinton, <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> shook her head. A couple of months later, Obama shot down the idea, saying the notion was [...] "completely unfounded" [...] and that [...] "they are both doing outstanding jobs where they are." [...] (In late 2011, however, with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley did conduct some research into the idea of Clinton replacing Biden, but the notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama.) ...|$|E

2500|$|After school Evans would {{entertain}} {{customers at}} his various jobs, including Fresh Farm Poultry in the Italian Market on Ninth Street {{and at the}} Produce Market, with songs and jokes. It was his boss at the Produce Market, Tony A., who gave Evans the nickname [...] "Chubby". The store owner of Fresh Farm Poultry, Henry Colt, was so impressed by Ernest's performances for the customers that he, along with his colleague and friend Kal Mann, {{who worked as a}} songwriter for Cameo-Parkway Records, arranged for young Chubby to do a private recording for American Bandstand host Dick Clark. It was at this recording session that Evans got his stage name from Clark's wife, who asked Evans what his name was. [...] "Well", he replied, [...] "my friends call me 'Chubby'". As he had just completed a Fats Domino impression, <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "As in Checker?" [...] That little play on words ("chubby" [...] describing a degree of fatness and [...] "checkers" [...] being, like [...] "dominoes", a game) got an instant laugh, and stuck: from then on, Evans would use the name [...] "Chubby Checker".|$|E
2500|$|MacDonald {{suffered}} in her later years with heart trouble. She worsened in 1963 and underwent an arterial transplant at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas. [...] She had been signed {{to play the}} role of the Mother Abbess in the film version of The Sound of Music, but died before she could fulfill this commitment (the role went to Peggy Wood). [...] Nelson Eddy, in Australia on a nightclub tour, pleaded illness and returned to the States at word of MacDonald's surgery. [...] After the operation, she developed pleurisy and was hospitalized for two-and-a-half months. [...] Her friends kept the news from the press until just before her release. [...] Her large home was sold and she moved into a Los Angeles apartment that would not require so much of her energies. [...] Her husband moved into an adjoining apartment. Nelson Eddy took his own apartment in the opposite building. MacDonald was again stricken in 1964. Nelson Eddy was with her when she was admitted to UCLA Medical Center, where on Christmas Eve, she was operated on for abdominal adhesions. She was able to go home for New Year's, but in mid-January, husband Raymond flew her back to Houston. It was hoped that pioneer heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey, who had recently operated successfully on the Duke of Windsor, could perform the same miracle for her. She checked in on January 12, and a program of intravenous feedings was begun to build her up for possible surgery. MacDonald died two days later on January 14 at 4:32 pm, with her husband at her bedside. According to press reports, MacDonald's last words to Raymond while he massaged her feet were [...] "I love you". [...] He replied [...] "I love you, too"; <b>she</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> succumbed.|$|E

6000|$|There they were--the bailiff--two jondarms with him--Toinette, {{and an old}} waiter.
