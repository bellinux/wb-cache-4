30|$|Clogenson et al. {{developed}} a <b>steerable</b> <b>guidewire</b> compatible with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) [27]. Settecase et al. designed a steering catheter for use with MRI systems. A mathematical model was derived by exploiting the equilibrium between the magnetic and mechanical restorative torque; the equation was expressed in a linear form to simplify modeling. Thus, the model has certain limitations when used to estimate large nonlinear deformations [25]. Thus, we here develop a novel magnetic robot attached to a guidewire that exhibited high-level steerability through multi-angled branches of a blood vessel phantom {{under the influence of}} a low-level magnetic field, improving real-time delivery performance. In this study, an electromagnetic steering system was used to improve the steering performance. Moreover, the proposed guidewire-based microrobot with flexible material is easier to control using external magnetic field compared with the previously reported magnetic catheter in Ref. [21].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our initial}} {{experience with a}} new low-profile balloon "on-a-wire" catheter, the Bijou. The concept of this balloon is to provide an additional side lumen with the advantages of (1) the ability to measure pressure gradient, (2) the possibility of drug infusion, and (3) the ability to advance a <b>steerable</b> <b>guidewire</b> through this side lumen. The balloon has been tested in 15 patients; 14 underwent an elective procedure for stable angina pectoris (with 2 cases of restenosis) and one an emergency angioplasty {{in a case of}} acute myocardial infarction. The stenosis was located on the left anterior descending artery in 11 procedures, on the right in 3, on a marginal branch in 2, on the circumflex and a saphenous vein graft in 1. All stenoses could be dilated successfully (residual stenosis < 25 %). The transstenotic pressure gradient felt from 49 +/- 13 mmHg to 7 +/- 4 mm Hg after angioplasty. Except for an uncomplicated dissection in 3 patients, no other complication was noted. With this new catheter, the double-lumen configuration adds the advantages of an "over-the-wire" to an "on-a-wire" system...|$|E
40|$|The active {{catheters}} conceived for minimal invasive surgery, neurosurgery and gastroenterology {{consist of}} a control system, pressure sensor, micro tool, endoscope, link and sma (shape memory alloy) -actuator. The report summarizes the medical requirements on such a device and gives an overview on the existent technical means to meet these requirements. For the <b>steerable</b> catheder <b>guidewire</b> a TINI sma actuator film is proposed. TINI actuators can be reproducibly prepared as vacuum-deposited films, and they are therefore suited for integration in monolithic microsystems.

40|$|In vitro {{and animal}} {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} the severity of coronary stenoses can be assessed using the continuity equation if the maximal blood flow velocity of the stenotic jet is measured. The large diameter and the low range of velocities measurable without frequency aliasing with the conventional intracoronary Doppler catheters precluded the clinical application of this method for hemodynamically significant coronary stenoses in humans. This article reports the results obtained using a 12 MHz <b>steerable</b> angioplasty <b>guidewire</b> in a consecutive series of 52 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary angioplasty (61 coronary stenoses). The ratio between coronary flow velocity in a reference segment and in the stenosis was used to estimate the percent cross-sectional area stenosis. A Doppler recording suitable for quantitation was obtained in the stenotic segment in only 10 of 61 arteries (16 %). The time-averaged peak velocity increased from 15 +/- 5 to 115 +/- 26 cm/sec from the reference normal segment to the stenosis. Volumetric coronary flow calculated from the product of mean flow velocity and cross-sectional area was similar in the stenosis and in the reference segment (33. 2 +/- 14. 9 vs 33. 5 +/- 17. 0 mL/min, respectively, difference not significant). The percent cross-sectional area stenosis and minimal luminal cross-sectional area derived from the Doppler velocity measurements using the continuity equation and calculated with quantitative angiography were also similar (Doppler, 86. 7 +/- 5. 1 % and 1. 00 +/- 0. 48 mm 2; quantitative angiography, 85. 9 +/- 7. 9 % and 1. 02 +/- 0. 50 mm 2).

40|$|The {{benefits}} of replacing space and energy consuming actuators and sensors with so-called “active” materials {{have been well}} known for decades. One such material, shape memory alloys (SMAs), inspire particularly novel applications because of their unmatched power density, high force output, and ability to be multifunctional – acting simultaneously as both actuator and sensor. Recently, improved material processing techniques by companies such as Dynalloy have enabled repeatable, low-cost production of small-diameter (< 100 µm) SMA wires capable of being actuated with minimal power at rates faster than 1 Hz. Additionally, a multifunctional power controller has been developed at North Carolina State University to simultaneously control the heating power input to SMA wires while measuring their changing electrical resistance. Advances such as these have enabled new applications {{to be considered in}} academia, such as <b>steerable</b> catheters and <b>guidewires</b> for use inside the human body, light-weight actuator systems for micro-air-vehicles, energy-efficient linear actuators to replace traditional solenoid or coil driven motors, and a multifunctional sensor-actuator system to control an adaptive Smart Inhaler nozzle without disrupting a delicate laminar air flow. Despite the obvious advantages and an abundance of novel application concepts, very few SMA-wire-based applications are commercially available. This development gap is caused by a number o...|$|R
