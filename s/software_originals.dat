5000|$|The {{software}} {{is named after}} the composer Jean Sibelius. Ben and Jonathan Finn, the <b>software's</b> <b>original</b> creators, said they couldn't remember why they used his name, but it was probably because Sibelius was a 'Finn' (i.e. Finnish), {{as well as being}} one of their favourite composers. The original Acorn version of the software was called Sibelius 7, but the '7' was not a version number; it was reminiscent of Sibelius's final symphony (no. 7).http://www.sibeliusblog.com/news/an-interview-with-ben-finn-part-1/ ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} two {{software modules}} {{of the general}} structure and implementation features of the <b>original</b> <b>software</b> for command {{and control of the}} anthropomorphic gripper for robots. The software has three modules: RoboVISION, RoboSIM and RoboCOMMANDER. RoboVISION is a software module for tracing, visualization, shape recognition, measurement, and efficiency evaluation for 3 D model generation of objects to grip by an anthropomorphic gripper. It was presented in another paper. This paper describes RoboSIM and RoboCOMMANDER. RoboSIM product is an advanced <b>original</b> <b>software</b> module that aims primarily to reduce achievement time of functional simulation of anthropomorphic grippers. RoboCOMMANDER is an <b>original</b> <b>software</b> module for controlling a three-fingered anthropomorphic robotic hand in both virtual and real environments. The approach is using a multimodal interface based on voice commands, remote manipulation, and smart, remote controlling mobile devices...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} written to replace the <b>original</b> <b>software</b> of Racal Storeplex Delta tape recorders, which are still used at Stennis Space Center but have been discontinued by the manufacturer. Whereas the <b>original</b> <b>software</b> could be activated by a command-line interface only, the present software offers the option of a command-line or graphical user interface. The present software also offers the option of batch-file operation (activation by a file that contains command lines for operations performed consecutively). The present software is also more reliable than was the original software: The <b>original</b> <b>software</b> was plagued by several deficiencies that {{made it difficult to}} execute, modify, and test. In addition, when using the <b>original</b> <b>software</b> to extract data that had been recorded within specified intervals of time, the resolution with which one could control starting and stopping times was no finer than about a second (or, in some cases, several seconds). In contrast, the present software is capable of controlling playback times to within 1 / 100 second of times specified by the user, assuming that the tape-recorder clock is accurate to within 1 / 100 second...|$|R
