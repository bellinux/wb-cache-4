Alain Bernard, who succeeded Vallaeys, says: [...] "We have succeeded in that. Today, the association looks after the maintenance of these paths of legend, working with local administrations to preserve them. But alongside that, we also do other things to preserve the value of the race, building up an impressive collection of documents, holding exhibitions, honouring former winners, holding tours of the route." ...|$|E

Oakley <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot of work put into {{the design of the}} gremlin in [...] "Terror at 5½ Feet" [...] to make him scary [...] "within The Simpsons universe". Mirkin said he felt the gremlin was well-done because he looked scary and [...] "yet it looks like a completely organic Simpsons character". Üter, a character from Germany, makes his first appearance on the show in this segment; he was conceived as a one-time joke, but reappeared in later episodes because Mirkin felt he was [...] "such a perfect stereotype".|$|E
