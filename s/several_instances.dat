5|$|The {{final element}} of the {{protection}} scheme of the first dreadnoughts was the subdivision of the ship below the waterline into several watertight compartments. If the hull were holed—by shellfire, mine, torpedo, or collision—then, in theory, only one area would flood and the ship could survive. To make this precaution even more effective, many dreadnoughts had no doors between different underwater sections, so that even a surprise hole below the waterline need not sink the ship. There were still <b>several</b> <b>instances</b> where flooding spread between underwater compartments.|$|E
5|$|The fog of war led to <b>several</b> <b>instances</b> {{where the}} Royal Navy misidentified several vessels as Roon in 1916. On 16 February 1916, Roon was mistakenly {{reported}} {{as having been}} captured by a British cruiser in the North Atlantic. The ship was also mistakenly reported to have taken part in the Battle of Jutland as the flagship of the screening force for {{the main body of}} the High Seas Fleet. This mistake appeared in historical works published shortly after the First World War, but later works have corrected it.|$|E

In the 1970s, the Gophers were in a violent brawl with the Ohio State Buckeyes and were barred from post-season appearances for two seasons after an incident involving the illegal resale of tickets.

The most studied case of MAP is 3 -AP, though the problems with larger values of s have also a number of applications. In this paper we consider four fast construction heuristics for MAP.

There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since the joke was not in the Japanese version. The team found difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they wanted to keep the localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E

Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. That person was arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. In <b>several</b> <b>instances,</b> he intervened on behalf of his colleagues; this leniency towards the persecuted may have been one reason why he was selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR.|$|E
