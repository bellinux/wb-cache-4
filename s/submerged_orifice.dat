A large magnitude of hydrologic events can often result in <b>submerged</b> <b>orifice</b> flow (also called pressure flow) or embankment and bridge overtopping flow, in which the foundation of a bridge is subjected to severe scour at the sediment bed. This phenomenon can cause bridge failure during large floods. However, current laboratory studies have focused on only cases of free-surface flow conditions, and they do not take bridge submergence into account. In this study, abutment scour experiments were carried out in a compound channel to investigate the characteristics of abutment scour in free-surface flow, <b>submerged</b> <b>orifice</b> flow, and overtopping flow cases. Detailed bed contours and three components of velocities and turbulent intensities were measured by acoustic Doppler velocimeters. The results show that the contracted flow around an abutment because of lateral and/or vertical contraction and local turbulent structures at the downstream region of the bridge are the main features of the flow responsible for the maximum scour depth around an abutment. The effects of local turbulent structures on abutment scour are discussed in terms of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles measured {{in a wide range of}} flow contraction ratios. The experimental results showed that maximum abutment scour can be predicted by a suggested single relationship even in different flow types (i. e., free, <b>submerged</b> <b>orifice,</b> and overtopping flow) if the turbulent kinetic energy and discharge under the bridge can be accurately measured.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model has been}} developed {{as an extension of}} single orifice bubble formation to investigate the growth and detachment of vapor/gas bubbles formed at two adjacent <b>submerged</b> <b>orifices</b> in inviscid fluids. The mathematical model treats the two bubbles as an expanding control volume moving to the line of centers above a wall. The movement of the bubbles is obtained by application of force balance acting on the bubble and accounts for surface tension, buoyancy, steam momentum and liquid inertia effects. The liquid inertia effects are determined by applying inviscid and irrotational flow assumptions to allow potential flow theory to calculate the liquid velocity field which then allows the pressure distribution to be calculated. The model is extended to include the mass and energy equations to model the steam bubble formation in sub-cooled water. The theoretical results are compared with the available experimental data of bubble formation during constant mass flow steam bubble formation at two <b>submerged</b> upward facing <b>orifices</b> in sub-cooled water.

Home to five species of {{anadromous}} Pacific salmon, the nine mainstem dams on the Columbia River and four on the Snake River were constructed with fishways to enable salmon to return upstream to natal spawning areas. Most of these dams were constructed with two fishways; one adjacent to each riverbank. The fishways have overflow weirs with <b>submerged</b> <b>orifices</b> and some vertical slot structures. Fish lifts constructed at Bonneville Dam in the 1940 s were used to pass white sturgeon upstream but their use was discontinued in the 1950 s because the lifts were ineffective for passing adult salmon. Fish counting stations were constructed in all fishways. White sturgeon, a resident migratory species native to the Columbia Basin, was not mandated to be counted until 2006 despite knowledge of their presence in fishways {{dating back to the}} 1940 s. However, due to their charismatic appearance and relative scarcity in fishways, the people counting the fish voluntarily enumerated them and often estimated their size and noted direction of movement within the fishways. Daily passage of white sturgeon from 1998 through present are now available in digital format and I used the data to address specific questions regarding upstream passage by white sturgeon. Mean lengths and peak of timing of white sturgeon counted suggests that current upstream passage is not related to a spawning migration. Differences in white sturgeon lengths and differences in timing of counts between fishways at individual dams suggest that physical or hydraulic conditions influencing approach, attraction, entry, and ultimately passage differ among sites. These findings suggest that further study could provide information on ways to improve upstream passage of white sturgeon...|$|R

A total of 33 tests (100 fish per test) that lasted from 24 to 48 hr were completed from 1994 through 1995. Passage rate depended on both fish size and bypass configuration. For fry/fingerling spring chinook salmon, {{there was no difference}} in passage rate through the three bypass configurations (2 -in. orifice, 6 -in. orifice, or overflow weir). Subyearlings moved sooner when the 6 -in. orifice was used, with more than 50 % exiting through the fish bypass in the first 8 hr. Smolts exited quickly and preferred the 6 -in. orifice, with over 90 % of the smolts exiting through the bypass in less than 2 hr.

This is achieved through a novel experiment of testing juvenile salmon in a scale model fish-passes with a range of small structures including vertical slots, orifices, weirs and combinations of all three. Direct comparisons of the efficiency of each type of fish pass in terms of upstream migration. Two identical physical models were constructed, one at the Fisheries Research Services Freshwater Laboratory at Almondbank, Perth, Scotland where observations were made of fish behaviour. The other model at the University of Glasgow, Glasgow tested only hydraulic conditions. The physical models were simplified representations of a reach of a river downstream of a dam, weir or any other obstruction to fish migration. A removable cross wall incorporating one of the types of pass tested divided the flume into two pools. A significantly higher proportion of fish moved through <b>submerged</b> <b>orifices</b> or vertical slots than through weirs for a given flow rate and velocity. The orifice and vertical slot passing efficiencies are directly correlated to the velocities existing in their vicinity. To reach the weir/slot/orifice devices, salmon parr tended also to stay {{near the bottom of the}} flume and followed a path along the sides of the arena, which provided them with low velocities and cover. In the vicinity of the weir/orifice/slot devices, the movements of salmon parr were consistent with energy-conserving strategies. Clearly, the extrapolations of results from the behaviour of small to large salmon remains cautious, the intention of this research being to characterise the behaviour of small salmon and to develop clear testable hypotheses about how large salmon may respond to water flow.

The particular situation of this fish pass, which contains both weirs and orifices, allows a comparison between the two.

40|$|Fish {{behaviour}} over space, time, {{life cycle}} needs and ecohydraulic conditions {{may affect the}} effectiveness of upstream and downstream passage systems. The spacial extent of migratory movements may depend on whether available and suitable habitat which meets the life cycle needs of specific species exists only below or only above a barrier, or in both locations. Highly effective passage systems have the following characteristics: a) their use is compelled by the migratory needs of specific species;b) are easy to locate by the migratory fish community as they offer topographical and flow conditions that species seek rather than avoid; and c) combine morphological features and hydrodynamic conditions which match their biomechanical capabilities and are suitable for efficient transport. These factors relate to species motivation (required versus tentative movements), attraction or guidance efficiency (probability that fish will locate the upstream fishway entrance or be actively guided downstream), and passage efficiency (probability fish will move through passage system), respectively. Any one of these factors or any combination of the three may limit overall system passage effectiveness. Field assessments for several species and many passage systems around the globe, supplemented by controlled laboratory studies, have demonstrated considerable variation in attraction or guidance efficiency, as well as passage efficiency. Not surprisingly, biological factors, such as migratory, morphological or ecological characteristics of different species, species abilities, salmonids vs non-salmonids, as well as passage system design features, such as dimensions, velocities, turbulence and appropriate flows, are important. Although available field assessments are based on limited and often non-standardized data, they provide evidence that attraction or guidance efficiency may depend more (but not exclusively) on biological factors. Field and laboratory studies indicate that passage efficiency may depend more (but not exclusively) on passage system design features, particularly when biological requirements and hydraulic conditions are well matched. Although frequently not well understood or quantified, species motivation and use of habitat below or above barriersmay also affect attraction, guidance and passage efficiency, as fish may utilize fish passage systems for tentative rather than required movements. Innovative fish tracking techniques in field and laboratory studies are providing ways to quantify motivation, attraction/guidance, and passage factors. Ecohydraulic approaches, which integrate improved biological assessments with advanced hydraulics, enhance understanding of fish behaviour and the factors affecting passage effectiveness. Responses of downstream moving fish associated with spillway re-design, bypasses, and bar racks or upstream moving fish associated with habitat use, attraction efficiency to fishway entrances and passage efficiency through <b>submerged</b> <b>orifices</b> or surface weirs or different turbulence characteristics in pools are highlighted. Results of such ecohydraulic studies are invaluable in calibrating numerical simulations and enhancing biological ground-truthing of CFD modeling for 1, 2 or 3 dimensions. Such modeling may provide additional insights about turbulent flow and fish behaviour. Much more effort on ecohydraulic studies is needed {{in the field and}} in the laboratory to quantify responses of species with different migratory needs and biomechanical capabilities. This effort is needed to further improve knowledge, validate fish behaviour assumptions, ground-truth models and assist the development of more robust and effective fish passage systems...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{advances}} in cavitation modeling require experimental measurements to validate them. For this purpose an oil cavitation test rig {{was designed to}} generate experimental data of a <b>submerged</b> cavitating <b>orifice</b> in oil. An important feature of the test section was the ability to have optical access while preserving structural integrity. ^ Experiments showed that visible inception occurred coincidently with both noise detection and the point where flow starts to undershoot predicted values. With cavitation at constant flow {{it was observed that}} upstream pressure was strongly independent of downstream pressure compared to single-phase flow where the two are linked. A serendipitous aside of related measurements was the notion that the traditional definition of cavitation number may not be valid for confined flows because of its tie to flow rate. Using experimental data and two different approaches, a new definition was proven to be unaffected by the existence of cavitation and shown to closely match theoretical values. Dynamic pressure data showed that higher back pressures led to higher frequency noise and the suppression of lower frequency noise; data was collected that shows the spectral shift at 1 bar decrements. ^ Particle Image Velocimetry was used to capture instantaneous and average velocity fields. Entrainment and recirculation were evident in all the flow fields. Under certain flow conditions, the entire cavitating jet velocity could be resolved using bubbles as tracer particles. With high speed imagery, the jet length was observed to shorten with increased pressures while the averaged flow fields remained broadly uninfluenced by the pressure. ...|$|R
40|$|The major {{technical}} {{objectives of}} this program are threefold: (1) to develop the design tools and a fundamental understanding of the fluid dynamics of a slurry bubble column reactor to maximize reactor productivity, (2) to develop the mathematical reactor design models and {{gain an understanding of}} the hydrodynamic fundamentals under industrially relevant process conditions, and (3) to develop an understanding of the hydrodynamics and their interaction with the chemistries occurring in the bubble column reactor. Successful completion of these objectives will permit more efficient usage of the reactor column and tighter design criteria, increase overall reactor efficiency, and ensure a design that leads to stable reactor behavior when scaling up to large-diameter reactors. Washington University's work during the reporting period involved the implementation of the automated calibration device, which will provide an advanced method of determining liquid and slurry velocities at high pressures. This new calibration device is intended to replace the original calibration setup, which depended on fishing lines and hooks to position the radioactive particle. The report submitted by Washington University contains a complete description of the new calibration device and its operation. Improvements to the calibration program are also discussed. Iowa State University utilized air-water bubble column simulations in an effort to determine the domain size needed to represent all of the flow scales in a gas-liquid column at a high superficial velocity. Ohio State's report summarizes conclusions drawn from the completion of gas injection phenomena studies, specifically with respect to the characteristics of bubbling-jetting at <b>submerged</b> single <b>orifices</b> in liquid-solid suspensions...|$|R
