30|$|The {{drainage}} {{pattern is}} dendritic as common in basement areas characterised by high contrast in relief. In a dendritic drainage pattern, tributary streams generally join at an acute angle forming Y-shaped junctions. The river network consists of primary rivers, namely Iworo, Ayin, Afo-Ape, Opeki and Aboluku sourced from the highlands terrain underlain by crystalline rocks. River Ofiki {{is the major}} river that drains the gneissic and granitic terrains, and it runs into River Ayin (<b>secondary</b> <b>river)</b> at the SW region. It is remarkable {{to note that the}} primary rivers in the area run along the rock boundaries and coincide with the major structural NNW–SSE and NNE–SSW trends development in the area. Other streams are intermittently connected to the primary rivers forming in orthogonal and oblique manners. This drainage pattern is more or less a design that separates the entire study area into interfluvial regions.|$|E

The <b>secondary</b> {{suspended}} <b>river</b> in {{the lower}} of Yellow River has been developing seriously, Possibility of floods running along the main dike toe in the parts of reach, even the “rolling flow” maybe appear, the security of dike has been threaten greatly. To {{solve the problem of}} the <b>secondary</b> suspended <b>river,</b> the key method is to reduce elevation difference between the main river channel and the toe of the main dike. The control measure is extracting the sands from main channel and beach to the “dike river”, which means the toe of the dike, by adopting machines. In this paper, by using the 2 -D hydrodynamic mathematical model to analyze the change of the flow velocity in the dike river after filling with various schemes, it is necessary for us to find a reasonable scheme {{to solve the problem of}} the <b>secondary</b> suspended <b>river</b> by utilizing the calculation results of the 2 -D hydrodynamic mathematical model...|$|R

40|$|The river {{ecosystem}} in the Hai River Basin (HRB), {{an important}} economic region in China, is seriously degraded. With {{the aim of}} river restoration in the HRB, we developed a method to assess the river's ecological status and conducted a preliminary application of the method. The established method was a predictive model, which used macroinvertebrates as indicator organisms. The river's ecological status was determined by calculating the ratio of observed to expected values (O/E). The method included ecoregionalization according to natural factors, and the selection of reference sites based on combinations of habitat quality and macroinvertebrate community. Macroinvertebrate taxa included Insecta, Crustacea, Gastropoda, and Oligochaeta, with 39 families and 95 genera identified in the HRB. The HRB communities were dominated by pollution tolerant taxa, such as Lymnaeidae, Chironomus, Limnodrilus, Glyptotendipes, and Tubifex. The average Shannon-Wiener index was 1. 40 +/- 0. 5, indicating a low biodiversity. In the river length of 3. 31 x 10 (4) km, 55 % of the sites were designated poor, with a bad ecological status. Among nine <b>secondary</b> <b>river</b> systems, Luan and Zi-ya had {{the best and worst}} river conditions, respectively. Only 17 reference site groups were selected for river management in the 41 ecoregions examined. This study lays the foundation for river restoration and related research in the HRB, and we anticipate further developments of this novel method.

40|$|Aim: To {{test the}} invasibility of aquatic {{ecosystems}} by an exotic species, {{we used the}} invasive macrophyte Urochloa arrecta, which has invaded many Neotropical waterbodies and has reduced biodiversity in these habitats. The extensive growth of this macrophyte {{can be related to}} its affinity for mud-rich sediments, which occur primarily in <b>secondary</b> <b>river</b> channels and lentic habitats. MethodsTo test this hypothesis, we cultivated U. arrecta in trays with different percentages of mud and we measured the sprout length and biomass of the plants after 75 days. ResultsOur results showed a positive and significant relationship between sediment mud percentage and nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter. Both plant length and biomass increased significantly and continuously with increasing mud content, indicating that the growth of this species is not limited even {{at the highest levels of}} mud, which is shown to be toxic for other species of macrophytes. Thus, it is probable that sand-rich sites, such as river shores, are less vulnerable to invasion by this species than relatively mud-rich sites, such as lakes. ConclusionsThis finding indicates that relatively mud-rich ecosystems should be prioritised in monitoring programs to prevent invasion by this species. In addition, the slow development of this species in sandy sediments opens a potential window for its management, at least on small spatial scales. However, despite the reduced growth of U. arrecta in sand-rich sediments, this grass is able to grow in several types of sediments, which explains its spread in a variety of habitats in Neotropical freshwater ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to climate}} change the water level in the Dutch rivers will rise the next century. In the current {{situation}} flood defence systems have reached their maximum capacity. The Deltacommissie (2008) recommends measurements {{in most parts of}} the river landscape. The trend is to give the rivers more space instead of strengthening the water defence. This leads to a paradox in urban areas, where the built environment takes up the space close to the river. For a river city the experience of the water is important, it gives identity to the place. So is there a way to strengthen the relation between the city and the water and keep the river cities dry? The location of the project is the river city Zutphen, a medium sized city with 50, 000 inhabitants in the eastern part of the Netherlands. Zutphen is located on the east bank of the river IJssel, where the Berkel flows into the IJssel. On the west bank is a small settlement, a neighborhood of Zutphen, with enough space for floodplains. The two riverbanks are totally opposite, an urban- and a natural riverfront. Aim of the project is to give the city more experience of the water by integrating the public quay with the inner-city and surrounding areas. A former industry area in the north of Zutphen, along the river, will be redeveloped with inner-city functions. How can these future developments contribute to more experience of the water in the city? Many river cities have the same circumstances as the project location: same urban structure, presence of <b>secondary</b> <b>river,</b> future developments along the river. Four of these cities are studied, the aim is to find which urban elements contribute to an open relation between the city and the water.

40|$|International audienceErosional surfaces, {{mainly in}} {{quartzites}} of Neoproterozoic age, have been sampled for 10 Be Cosmic Ray Exposure (CRE) dating {{in different places}} of the Mayombe Massif (SW Congo). Four types of occurrences have been studied: 1 / denuded and abraded horizontal surfaces sampled at different altitudes along the flanks of the Kouilou valley; 2 / vertical cliffs at different heights in the topographic profile; 3 / incised river banks; 4 / large boulder in a surficial breccia (Stone line). Three groups may be distinguished according to their 10 Be concentrations. A first group of ten samples displays 10 Be concentrations ranging from ~ 18 000 to 60 000 at/g. These samples were collected from erosional surfaces on the Kouilou valley and incised bank on a <b>secondary</b> <b>river.</b> A second group displays 10 Be concentrations ranging from ~ 80 000 to 330 000 at/g. These samples are from vertical cliffs located in the summit part of an abrupt mountain and massive rocks forming the bed and banks of the Loukoulariver. A third group with a 10 Be concentration of ~ 1 500 000 at/g includes the unique quartzite boulder sampled in the Stone line. After correction of the topographic shielding effect, the equation expressing the 10 Be concentration {{as a function of}} the CRE duration and of the denudation rate has been solved for each sample assuming no inherited 10 Be. For the first group, this calculation implies a recent (i. e. 30 m/Ma). For the second group, it is consistent with steady state conditions operating under moderate denudation rates (~ 5 - 10 m/Ma). For the quartzite boulder, the 10 Be concentration implies that this rock was exposed to cosmic rays for at least 1 Ma. The results on the first group are consistent with the occurrence of a very efficient and recent denudation event having affected the valley flanks and caused incision along thehydrographic system. It is suggested that this event should be the same that caused the formation of the Stone line by erosion and reworking of pre-existing alteration profilesless than 10 ka ago. The results obtained from the second group suggest that this event did not affect some parts of the landscape. The result obtained from the boulder shows that this rock fragment was probably displaced a long time ago, with no relation with the recent denudation event...|$|E

40|$|The loss {{of habitat}} in rain forests for anthropics actions inspires {{research}} {{to evaluate the}} impacts {{to them and to}} consider solutions for the landscapes that are found to be highly modified. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influences of the intensification of the use of the soil for agricultural proposes on the loss of Caatinga in the Maniçoba Irrigation Perimeter. The area is situated in the low medium region of the São Francisco river (Juazeiro/BA-Petrolina/PE). Previous researches point out the limitation in the service of pollinators in the area, indicating an association of this problem with the quality of the natural habitat. The study was carried out based on the conception of a LUCC (Land Use/Land Cover Change) model in order to relate it to the processes of global environmental changes. The characterization of the trends of the occurred changes was produced, through the dynamic modeling of the landscape and also by observing the influences of the static variables: Main <b>river,</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>rivers,</b> roads and urban areas. The model lead to the estimation of the occurred changes in the landscape. The results have showed loss of 47 % of the Native Vegetation for the expansion of crop areas, in 30 years of analysis, leading to the fragmentation of the Caatinga. The results are significant in the proposal of recovery of parts of the Caatinga in Maniçoba Perimeter. That will, consequently, improve the ecosystemic services, in special the polinization one.

40|$|Background: Native Amazonian populations {{managed forest}} {{resources}} in numerous ways, often creating oligarchic forests dominated by useful trees. The scale and {{spatial distribution of}} forest modification beyond pre-Columbian settlements is still unknown, although recent studies propose that human impact away from rivers was minimal. We tested the hypothesis that past human management of the useful tree community decreases with distance from rivers. Methodology/Principal Findings: In six sites, we inventoried trees and palms with DBH >= 10 cm and collected soil for charcoal analysis; we also mapped archaeological evidence around the sites. To quantify forest manipulation, we measured the relative abundance, richness and basal area of useful trees and palms. We found a strong negative exponential relationship between forest manipulation and distance to large rivers. Plots located from 10 to 20 km from a main river had 20 - 40 % useful arboreal species, plots between 20 and 40 km had 12 - 23 %, plots more than 40 km had less than 15 %. Soil charcoal abundance was high in the two sites closest to <b>secondary</b> <b>rivers,</b> suggesting past agricultural practices. The shortest distance between archaeological evidence and plots was found in sites near rivers. Conclusions/Significance: These results strongly suggest that past forest manipulation {{was not limited to}} the pre-Columbian settlements along major rivers, but extended over interfluvial areas considered to be primary forest today. The sustainable use of Amazonian forests will be most effective if it considers the degree of past landscape domestication, as human-modified landscapes concentrate useful plants for human sustainable use and management today...|$|R
