All lines would have passed through the city centre. In May 2004, a 15-year operating contract was awarded to Transdev, to operate and maintain the tram network. This contract was cancelled in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Although it lost {{usefulness}} {{for long}} distances, the National Roads system has acquired local importance: EN13 that cuts {{the city in}} half, in a north-south direction, is used by commuters originating from the northern <b>suburbs</b> <b>and</b> from Vila do Conde, in the south, to travel downtown.

5|$|Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had an {{economic}} downturn beginning in the mid-20thcentury. The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills, population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to <b>suburbs</b> <b>and</b> to Syracuse, and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased tax base. With its low cost of living, the city has become a melting pot for refugees from war-torn countries around the world, encouraging growth for its colleges and universities, cultural institutions and economy.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield {{is made up}} of many <b>suburbs</b> <b>and</b> neighbourhoods, many {{of which}} {{developed}} from villages or hamlets that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew.

5|$|The Don Valley Parkway, {{along with}} the Gardiner Expressway, is one of Toronto's busiest {{municipal}} routes. It is the sole north–south expressway into Toronto's downtown, a role it was not designed to support. The parkway was planned {{as one of a}} series of expressways to provide commuter routes to downtown from the expanding suburbs. Two other un-built expressways were planned: the Scarborough Expressway, expected to handle traffic between downtown and the eastern <b>suburbs,</b> <b>and</b> the Spadina Expressway, expected to serve traffic from the north-west.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War devastated {{much of the}} East End, {{with its}} docks, {{railways}} and industry forming a continual target for bombing, especially during the Blitz, leading to dispersal of the population to new <b>suburbs</b> <b>and</b> new housing being built in the 1950s. Many East Enders went further than the eastern suburbs, leaving London altogether, notably to the Essex new towns of Basildon and Harlow {{and a number of}} expanded towns in south Essex and elsewhere.|$|E

The low sex ratio is partly because of the large number of male migrants who come to the city to work.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range. In Germany and elsewhere in central Europe, it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded, first into farmland, and then to <b>suburbs</b> <b>and</b> urban parks. The reasons for this expansion are unclear. In areas of intensive farming, such as eastern England, arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats.|$|E
