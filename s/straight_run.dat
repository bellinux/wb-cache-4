25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a <b>straight</b> <b>run,</b> and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E
25|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, {{instructors are}} encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement.

25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again. The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a <b>straight</b> <b>run</b> and learning to stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E

500|$|During the {{following}} season, Johnson averaged 19.0points and 4.1assists, {{appeared in his}} second All-Star Game and {{was named to the}} All-Defensive First Team and All-NBA Second Team. The Sonics, however, lost in the Western Conference Finals to the Lakers, who had Hall of Famers Jamaal Wilkes, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Because of the abundance of talent on the Sonics team, Johnson later called this loss one of the worst disappointments of his professional career. [...] The Sonics may well have won a 2nd straight championship in a third <b>straight</b> <b>run</b> to the finals, but point guard Gus Williams held out that season. [...] He sought $1 million for a season, a paltry sum by today's standards, but the Sonics refused to pay, and it ultimately cost them their last shot at the finals for 17 more seasons. Coach Wilkens grew tired of Johnson, who often clashed with him and was perceived as a growing liability to the team. At the end of the season, Johnson was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Paul Westphal and draft picks. The Sonics finished 22games worse in the next season despite the addition of Westphal.|$|E

2500|$|The Nelson gear proved {{reliable}} and accurate, {{but it was}} expensive to produce and the necessity for its cable {{to be given a}} <b>straight</b> <b>run</b> could create difficulties when it was to be installed in a new type. By 1929 the latest model (the E-4 gear) had a new and simplified impulse generator, a new trigger motor, and the impulse cable was enclosed in a metal tube, protecting it, and permitting shallow bends. While the basic principle of the new gear remained unchanged: virtually all the components had been redesigned, and it was no longer officially referred to as the [...] "Nelson" [...] gear. The gear was further modernised in 1942 as the E-8. This final model had a modified impulse generator that was easier to adjust and was controlled from the cockpit by an electrical solenoid rather than a Bowden cable.|$|E

60|$|They {{were now}} in the Knob Channel, and the sea, {{although}} still heavy, was more regular. As they passed the Mouse Light-ship there were several large steamers at anchor there, but it was now a <b>straight</b> <b>run</b> down to the Nore and they held on.|$|E
50|$|Also, the {{carriage}} is slowed down on bends but travels faster on <b>straight</b> <b>runs.</b> This means {{a more complex}} control system. Modern controls have small microprocessors which “learn” {{the characteristics of the}} journeys and keep the data in memory. They also record the number of journey and direction. This assists service engineers on maintenance calls.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{practice}} run is called the [...] "Lap Exhibition" [...] (shūkai tenji). During this stage, the competitors practice their <b>straight</b> <b>runs</b> and cornering, after which they conduct a timed run of 150 meters which is announced. An announcement is also made if competitors replace their propellors or any boat engine parts.|$|R
50|$|However, Vermont's Logan Pierce {{added to}} the Mountaineer RBI total with a single prior to Johnny Mishu driving in another giving Mountaineers hitters four <b>straight</b> <b>runs</b> batted in and pushing the West's lead to 7-3. In the seventh, Cole Peragine hit the second long ball of the night for the West on a solo shot to left field off Newport's Mitch Horacek.|$|R
60|$|Shouldering the useless wheel, he trudged on. In {{time he came}} to {{the stone}} wall, and, half disbelieving his experience, he sought in the road for tracks, and found them--moccasin tracks, large ones, deep-bitten into the dust at the toes. It was while bending over them, examining, that again he heard the eery chant. He had seen the thing pursue the coyote, and he knew he had no chance on a <b>straight</b> <b>run.</b> He did not attempt it, contenting himself with hiding in the shadows on the off side of the road.|$|E
6000|$|The mate {{pulled a}} pin {{out of the}} chart, and, {{measuring}} with the dividers, stuck it in again. [...] "You're not quite so much out as I expected you would be," [...] he said. [...] "It's a <b>straight</b> <b>run</b> to the Isleta, Grand Canary. Whether you'll ever get there with the compass and the patent log is another matter, though, of course, {{if you go on}} long enough, you'll fetch some part of America. I don't want to be unduly inquisitive, but you will have lost, at least, an hour of our time before I put Pills on board again, and I really think there is a little you should tell me." ...|$|E
60|$|Their {{powers of}} {{endurance}} are remarkable. Once, on the Restigouche, we started a brood of little ones {{late in the}} afternoon. We were moving along in a good current, looking for a camping ground, and had little thought for the birds, which could never get far enough ahead to hide securely. For five miles they kept ahead of us, rushing out at each successive stretch of water, and fairly distancing us in a <b>straight</b> <b>run.</b> When we camped they were still below us. At dusk I was sitting motionless near the river when a slight movement over near the opposite bank attracted me. There was the mother bird, stealing along up stream under the fringe of bushes. The young followed in single file. There was no splashing of water now. Shadows were not more noiseless.|$|E
50|$|The Second was {{the name}} given to a small {{settlement}} located along what was the Second Concession of the township, now Froom and Scott roads. The concession line, instead of lying <b>straight,</b> <b>ran</b> parallel to the St. Lawrence River shoreline leading to {{a break in the}} road and oddly shaped lots; the Second Concession was thus known locally as the “Broken Second”.|$|R

60|$|And now {{the force}} had a <b>straight</b> <b>run</b> in before it, for it had outpaced any further force of Boers {{which may have}} been {{advancing}} from the direction of Magersfontein. The horses, which had come a hundred miles in four days with insufficient food and water, were so done that it was no uncommon sight to see the trooper not only walking to ease his horse, but carrying part of his monstrous weight of saddle gear. But in spite of fatigue the force pressed on until in the afternoon a distant view was seen, across the reddish plain, of the brick houses and corrugated roofs of Kimberley. The Boer besiegers cleared off in front of it, and that night (February 15th) the relieving column camped on the plain two miles away, while French and his staff rode in to the rescued city.|$|E
6000|$|At last our contemptible {{ship was}} ready; to sea we went, bound for Honolulu and the letter-bag, on Christmas Day; {{and from then}} to now have {{experienced}} every sort of minor misfortune, squalls, calms, contrary winds and seas, pertinacious rains, declining stores, till we came almost to regard ourselves {{as in the case}} of Vanderdecken. [...] Three days ago our luck seemed to improve, we struck a leading breeze, got creditably through the doldrums, and just as we looked to have the N.E. trades and a <b>straight</b> <b>run,</b> the rains and squalls and calms began again about midnight, and this morning, though there is breeze enough to send us along, we are beaten back by an obnoxious swell out of the north. Here is a page of complaint, when a verse of thanksgiving had perhaps been more in place. For all this time we must have been skirting past dangerous weather, in the tail and circumference of hurricanes, and getting only annoyance where we should have had peril, and ill-humour instead of fear.|$|E
6000|$|After a {{pleasant}} breezy night upon the brown waters, on September 1st we hove anchor betimes {{and made for}} Scotchman's Head, a conspicuous mangrove bluff forming a fine landmark on the left bank. The charts have lately shifted it some two miles west of its old position. Six or seven miles beyond it rise the blue uplands of the [...] "Earldom of Sonho." [...] On our right, in mid-stream, lay a [...] "crocodile bank," [...] a newly fixed grass islet, a few square feet of green and gold, which the floods will presently cover or carry away. To the left, above the easternmost [...] "Mombang" [...] and the network of islands behind it, opens the gape of the Malela River, a short cut to French Point, found useful when a dangerous tide- rip {{is caused by the}} strong sea-breeze meeting the violent current of the Thalweg. Above it lies a curious formation like concentric rings of trees inclosing grass: it is visible only from the north-east. Several slave factories now appear on either shore, single-storied huts of wood and thatch, in holes cut out of the densest bush, an impenetrable forest whose sloppy soil and miry puddles seem never to dry. The tenements serve as videttes and outposts, enabling cargoes to ship without the difficulties of passing Palm Point, and thus to make a <b>straight</b> <b>run</b> down stream. There are three on the north bank, viz. M. Rágis (aîné), now deserted, Sr. Lima Viana, and Sr. Antonio Fernandez; and three on the left side, Sr. Alessandro Ferreira, Sr. Guilherme, and Sr. Fonseca. Those on the southern or left bank facilitate overland transit to Mangue, Ambrizette, and other dépôts. At present it is [...] "tiempo seco" [...] (dull time), and the gérants keep their hands in by buying ground-nuts and palm oil. The slave trade, however, makes 500, not 50, per cent., and the agents are naturally fond of it, their mere salaries being only some 150 francs a month.|$|E

25|$|Lightning {{protection}} systems {{are designed to}} mitigate the effects of lightning through connection to extensive grounding systems that provide a large surface area connection to earth. The large area is required to dissipate the high current of a lightning strike without damaging the system conductors by excess heat. Since lightning strikes are pulses of energy with very high frequency components, grounding systems for lightning protection tend to use short <b>straight</b> <b>runs</b> of conductors to reduce the self-inductance and skin effect.|$|R
50|$|The first {{informal}} races {{took place}} on snow-covered roads. Formal competitions started in 1884 at St. Moritz. It is not known how much the original track evolved {{in the early years}} as the three sports matured and stabilized. The first club formed in 1897, and the first purpose-built track solely for bobsleds opened in 1902 outside St Moritz. Over the years, bobsleigh tracks evolved from <b>straight</b> <b>runs</b> to twisting and turning tracks. The original wooden sleds gave way to streamlined fiberglass and metal ones.|$|R
