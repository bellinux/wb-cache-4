5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E
5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E

5|$|The first {{discussion}} of a bridge in a public forum was in 1954, when Anton P. Torsvik proposed a bridge to the major and municipal engineer of Fjell. Torsvik lived in Oslo and had worked with public relations for various other bridge projects. The issue was discussed in the municipal councils of Fjell and Sund, but they both concluded {{that there were more}} pressing needs on the islands' road network, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not want to prioritize a bridge. National Road 555 was completed in 1957, and the following years various road projects were completed.|$|E
5|$|Several emu {{specimens}} {{belonging to}} the different subspecies were sent to France, both live and dead, {{as part of the}} expedition. Some of these exist in European museums today. Le Naturaliste brought one live specimen and one skin of the mainland emu to France in June 1803. Le Géographe collected emus from both King and Kangaroo Island, and at least two live King Island individuals, assumed to be a male and female by some sources, were taken to France in March 1804. This ship also brought skins of five juveniles collected from different islands. Two of these skins, of which the provenance is unknown, are presently kept in Paris and Turin; the rest are lost. In addition to rats, cockroaches, and other inconveniences aboard the ships, the emus were incommoded by the rough weather which caused the ships to shake violently; some died as a result, while others had to be force fed <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not starve to death. In all, Le Géographe brought 73 live animals of various species back to France.|$|E
5|$|Neil and Merv {{retained}} {{their positions}} for Victoria’s first two matches of the 194748 season, against India and South Australia respectively. Again, Merv was out before Neil came in, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not bat together. The brotherly selection pairing was broken up for Victoria’s next match, as Neil {{was rewarded with}} selection for an Australian XI for a Test trial match against the Indians, while Merv continued to represent the state. Neil returned to the Victorian team for the match against New South Wales at the SCG the following week, and Ray was selected to make his first-class debut, so three Harveys were in the state team for the first time. Merv opened, while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships. Merv opened and made 45 before being dismissed at 2/99, prompting Neil's entrance to replace him at the crease. Neil then top-scored with 61 before falling at 4/200, and Ray then came in at 5/208 to make 43. Victoria ended with 331 and the Harvey brothers had scored almost half the runs. New South Wales were forced to follow on, and Victoria were set 51 for victory. After the fall of Fred Freer at 1/24, captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3, allowing two Harveys to bat {{together for the first}} time at first-class level. Ray and Merv put on an unbeaten partnership of 27 to take Victoria to a nine-wicket win. Merv and Ray ended unbeaten on 12 and 22 respectively.|$|E

Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father Conrad Pepler, also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.|$|E

Northern Darfur's capital is Al Fashir; Southern Darfur's is Nyala; and West Darfur's is Geneina. The {{division}} {{was the idea of}} Ali al Haj, Minister of Federal Affairs, who hoped that by dividing the Fur <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not form a majority in any state that it would allow Islamist candidates to be elected.|$|E
25|$|The Vulcan railcars had a driver's {{compartment}} at each end, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not need}} to be turned at the terminus for the return journey. They originally had 28 and 22 seats in the two passenger compartments. In the mid-1950s the smaller compartment in each vehicle was reduced by 2 seats and replaced with a small guard's compartment, thus reducing the total number of passengers from 50 to 48. A luggage compartment had space for about 1 ton of luggage, and an onboard toilet was provided.|$|E

25|$|The airline has its {{background}} {{in a group}} of parachuters who in 1968 established Paralift Air Service. The intention was to establish a company to own and operate an aircraft <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have to rent an aircraft each time they were parachuting. It took delivery of a Cessna 180 in February 1969, which it kept until August that year. It then took over a Cessna 182. These aircraft were both tailored as parachute-only aircraft. The following year the fleet was doubled with the arrival of a Cessna 310.|$|E
25|$|Casey's line buckled {{with some}} men retreating, but fought {{fiercely}} {{for possession of}} their earthworks, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. The Confederates only engaged four brigades of the thirteen on their right flank that day, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not hit with the power {{that they could have}} concentrated on this weak point in the Union line. Casey sent for reinforcements but Keyes was slow in responding. Eventually the mass of Confederates broke through, seized a Union redoubt, and Casey's men retreated to the second line of defensive works at Seven Pines.|$|E
25|$|In 13 April 2016, Jordanian police raided {{and shut}} the Muslim Brotherhood {{headquarters}} in Amman. This comes {{despite the fact that}} the Jordanian branch cut ties with the mother Egyptian group in January 2016, a designated terrorist organization, a move that is considered to be exclusively cosmetic by experts. Jordanian authorities state that the reason of closure is because that the Brotherhood is unlicensed and is using the name of the defectors' licensed group. This comes after the Jordanian senate passed a new legislation for the regulation of political parties in 2014, the Muslim Brotherhood did not adhere by the regulations of the new law and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not renew their membership.|$|E

25|$|Butterfield {{was also}} the person who {{primarily}} managed people as they met with Nixon. This included ensuring people arrived on time, {{and that they were}} manipulated <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not stay too long. Butterfield also oversaw Nixon's often-distant relationship with his wife, Pat. Late in 1970, the president's aides lost confidence in Constance C. Stuart, Pat Nixon's staff director and press secretary, and Butterfield was assigned responsibility for overseeing the First Lady's events and publicity. The day after the 1972 presidential election, Pat Nixon confronted her husband over what she perceived to be Oval Office interference with her staff. The deputy assistant to the president, Dwight Chapin, and later Butterfield, were appointed to act as liaison between the two staffs.|$|E

England {{came back to}} win the second and fourth Tests, and draw the third and fifth, to win the Ashes {{for the first time}} since 1986–87. It was the 72nd test series between the two sides with England finally winning 2-1. Andrew Flintoff {{dominated}} with both bat and ball for England, scoring 402 runs – more than any Australian – and taking 24 wickets – more than any Australian bar Shane Warne. Warne also had a spectacular series, with 40 wickets at a bowling average of 19.92, and 249 runs, but most of his efforts came in losing causes – such as making 42 with the bat in the second innings of the second Test.|$|E

On 15 September 2001 he escaped from the hospital and was at large until early 2003. On the night of his escape, Sajal Barui hosted a beer party to which he invited the two police constables that had been put on guard to watch him. He often offered beer to the constables after it had been smuggled in by his girlfriend, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not suspect his motives. On that night, however, he spiked the two bottles of beer with sleeping pills and watched them fall asleep. He then {{walked out of the}} hospital unhindered.|$|E
