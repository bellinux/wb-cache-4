5000|$|Various tax {{reforms were}} {{introduced}} to bring about greater progressivity in the tax system.New tax scales were introduced, which reduced taxes married taxpayers earning under $6,000 per annum, while New Zealanders earning over $12,000 per annum saw {{a slight increase in}} their tax burden. In addition, a new property <b>speculation</b> <b>tax</b> was introduced. According to Brian Easton, however, “the Labour Government’s reduction of taxation on low income recipients while inflation raised taxation on many earners had the effect of raising taxes on single-income families, who tend to be poorer, but perhaps lowering taxation on multiple -income families.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The Golden Horseshoe {{has been}} {{recognised}} as a geographic region since the 1950s, {{but it was}} only on July 13, 2004 that a report from the provincial Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal entitled Places to Grow coined the term Greater Golden Horseshoe, extending the boundaries west to Waterloo Region, north to Barrie/Simcoe County, and northeast to the county and city of Peterborough. [...] A subsequent edition released February 16, 2005, broadened the term further, adding Brant, Haldimand and Northumberland Counties to the now quasi-administrative region. The Greater Golden Horseshoe region is officially designated in Ontario Regulation 416/05 under the Places to Grow Act. The designation Greater Golden Horseshoe has legal significance with respect to taxation: In April 2017, the Government of Ontario announced plans to impose a 15 per cent Non-Resident <b>Speculation</b> <b>Tax</b> (NRST) on non-Canadian citizens, non-permanent residents and non-Canadian corporations (with exceptions or rebates for refugees, qualifying students and certain people working in Ontario) buying residential properties containing one to six units in the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH).|$|E
5000|$|New Home Ownership Accounts were {{introduced}} to encourage people on low and middle incomes to save towards housing. Savers were entitled to a tax concession of 25% if savings were retained in the account {{for at least three}} years and were then put towards the purchase or construction of a first house or apartment. A Property <b>Speculation</b> <b>Tax</b> was introduced in 1973 in an attempt to control speculative dealing in property, and in 1974 building restrictions were imposed on commercial building and the construction of larger houses. A land tax was also introduced to control profit-making on rezoned land. Improvements were made in the design and planning of State housing accommodation, with additions such as carports, driveways, tree-planting, and landscaping. In addition, an amendment to the Public Works Act provided more generous arrangements for those whose property had been taken under the Act, while other legislation ensured that a joint family home was exempted from death duties on the death of whichever spouse died first. Additional house lending was later provided in the 1975 budget. Local authorities were authorised, under the Local Government Act of 1974, [...] "to provide housing loans and subdivide council-owned land for housing," [...] and could also [...] "sell or lease allotments and apply to their local authority’s loans board to borrow to purchase land for subdivision." ...|$|E

A securities <b>speculation</b> <b>tax</b> would reduce speculation in the markets and increase stability. Noble Prize winning economist James Tobin proposed a similar tax on currency transactions (The Tobin Tax). As economist Dean Baker points out, the securities <b>speculation</b> <b>tax</b> would make the tax code more fair since most financial speculation is conducted {{either directly or indirectly}} by wealthy people. "Just as poor and moderate income people pay taxes when they gamble at a casino or buy a state lottery ticket, a financial transactions tax would simply be applying a comparable tax to gambling in financial markets, " Baker observed.

40|$|The city of Vancouver {{has seen}} record high home prices in recent months. The housing price {{inflation}} {{has led to}} the city becoming one of the least affordable cities in {{the world in terms of}} housing. The rapid price increase has been blamed on various supply and demand side issues. This paper argues that foreign capital is playing a significant role in driving up home prices in Vancouver and proposes a series of policy options to mitigate the impact of foreign capital. Using secondary data analysis, the paper demonstrates that factors such as income, population growth, and supply of homes have not influenced home prices at a significant level. The paper provides evidence that influx of large sums of foreign capital and investment activity of High Net Worth Individuals are the primary drivers of housing prices in the city. Keeping this in mind, the policy options in the paper have been developed through substantive background research, expert interviews, jurisdictional scan and secondary data analysis. Policy options are evaluated using a criteria and measures matrix, which reflects the societal and government management objectives of effectiveness, budget impact, and stakeholder acceptance. The paper recommends using a Progressive Property Tax in conjunction with a <b>Speculation</b> <b>Tax</b> to mitigate some of the effects of foreign capital...|$|E

He also founded a grammar school, Winchester College, in Winchester, obtaining a papal bull in 1378 and a royal licence in 1382. Construction work began in Oxford in 1380, and in Winchester in 1387, under the architect William Wynford. At both colleges, William stipulated daily prayers for Richard II and his queen, William and his parents, and his former patrons, Sir Ralph Sutton, Sir John Scures, and Thomas Foxley. The funds to endow the colleges, and pay for the building works, came from William's lucrative church positions, discounting of exchequer tallies (that is, <b>speculation</b> on <b>tax</b> revenues due to the king), exporting wool, and using his influence to obtain papal approval for the acquisition of the income of the [...] "alien priories" [...] that belonged to monasteries in France, which were confiscated by the crown during the Hundred Years' War.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{methodology}} to stabilize the financial markets using Game Theory, specifically the Complete Study of a Differentiable Game. Initially, we intend to make a quick discussion of peculiarities and recent development of derivatives, and then we move on to the main topic of the paper: forwards and futures. We illustrate their pricing and the functioning of markets for this particular derivatives type. We also will examine the short or long hedging strategies, used by companies to try to cancel the risk associated with market variables. At this purpose, we present a game theory model. Specifically, we focus on two economic operators: a real economic subject and a financial institute (a bank, for example) with a big economic availability. For this purpose, we discuss about an interaction between the two above economic subjects: the Enterprise, our first player, and the Financial Institute, our second player. We propose a tax on financial transactions with speculative purposes in order to stabilize the financial market, protecting it from <b>speculations.</b> This <b>tax</b> hits only the speculative profits and we find a cooperative solution that allows, however, both players to obtain a gain...|$|R
40|$|Douglas Comer, {{archaeologist}} {{with the}} National Park Service, offers unique interpretations about {{the relationships among}} Anglo, Hispanic, and Indian Americans at Bent 2 ̆ 7 s Fort on the north bank of the Arkansas River during the 1830 s and 1840 s in southeastern Colorado. Long on theory and short on fact, much of this volume is developed from speculation rather than solid evidence. It is more {{about the importance of}} ritual than the history of Bent 2 ̆ 7 s Fort. Comer argues that various rituals, including those traditional to the cultures involved and those developed to enhance their trade relations, help explain Bent 2 ̆ 6 St. Vrain Company 2 ̆ 7 s economic success. This seems plausible even though evidence offered is meager. Rituals develop to govern most human relationships, but the examples Comer presents to support this claim are drawn from other cultures and eras with little or no relevance to Bent 2 ̆ 7 s Fort. Comer concludes that Bent 2 ̆ 7 s Fort introduced capitalism and inspired other changes that made Anglo conquest of the Indians and the Hispanic Southwest easier than it otherwise would have been. A stronger case could be made for the commerce that passed over the Santa Fe Trail playing a more significant part in that transformation. Some theories and <b>speculations</b> <b>tax</b> the credulity of serious scholars. It requires an enormous stretch, for example, to see ceremonial similarities between the rituals at Bent 2 ̆ 7 s Fort and the symbolism of English gardens in eighteenth- century Annapolis, Maryland (186 - 189). The history presented of Bent 2 ̆ 7 s Fort and environs, based largely on secondary sources, contains errors of fact and interpretation. Some of the premises are false. No evidence is cited to support the conjecture that Bent 2 ̆ 7 s Fort 2 ̆ 2 encouraged raids 2 ̆ 2 by Indians on New Mexican settlements, resulting in 2 ̆ 2 destabilization 2 ̆ 2 of that province which 2 ̆ 2 helped pave the way 2 ̆ 2 for US conquest in 1846. The same is true of the contention that Indian resistance to Anglo traders 2 ̆ 2 peaked in the 1820 s 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 diminished 2 ̆ 2 in the 1830 s because of Bent 2 ̆ 7 s Fort. The Santa Fe trade was not 2 ̆ 2 almost entirely connected with Bent 2 ̆ 7 s Old Fort, 2 ̆ 2 nor was the fort the 2 ̆ 2 agency by which all this [trade and conquest] was accomplished. 2 ̆ 2 The Santa Fe Trail is confused with the Oregon Trail in Wyoming (228) ...|$|R

A massive loss of confidence, both in the business sector and the consumers, both responding byrestricting spending, is in full progress. The world's financial and economic crisis is largely the resultof greed, of unjust gain, of financial <b>speculation,</b> of <b>tax</b> evasion worldwide. We live in a world wherepeople are seeking more temporary material wealth than spiritual wealth of the Faith and eternal life,and in addition to more severe material poverty, we see spiritual poverty and weakening of faith, acooling brotherly love and a decrease in good deeds and philanthropy.

60|$|Thus ended this unparalleled transaction. The author, I believe, {{will not}} claim {{any part of}} the glory of it: he will leave it whole and entire to the authors of the measure. The money was the voluntary, free gift of the Company; the rescinding bill was the act of legislature, to which they and we owe submission: the author {{has nothing to do with}} the one or with the other. However, he cannot avoid rubbing himself against this subject merely for the {{pleasure}} of stirring controversies, and gratifying a certain pruriency of taxation that seems to infect his blood. It is merely to indulge himself in <b>speculations</b> of <b>taxing,</b> that he chooses to harangue on this subject. For he takes credit for no greater sum than the public is already in possession of. He does not hint that the Company means, or has ever shown any disposition, if managed with common prudence, to pay less in future; and he cannot doubt that the present ministry are as well inclined to drive them by their mock inquiries, and real rescinding bills, as he can possibly be with his taxes. Besides, it is obvious, that as great a sum might have been drawn from that Company, without affecting property, or shaking the constitution, or endangering the principle of public credit, or running into his golden dreams of cockets on the Ganges, or visions of stamp-duties on Perwannas, Dusticks, Kistbundees, and Husbulhookums. For once, I will disappoint him in this part of the dispute; and only in a very few words recommend to his consideration, how he is to get off the dangerous idea of taxing a public fund, if he levies those duties in England; and if he is to levy them in India, what provision he has made for a revenue establishment there; supposing that he undertakes this new scheme of finance independently of the Company, and against its inclinations.|$|R
