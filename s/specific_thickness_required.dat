40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} correlating acoustic emission (AE) {{activity and the}} <b>specific</b> film <b>thickness</b> () for operational spur gears.

It is concluded that the level of AE activity is dependent on the <b>specific</b> film <b>thickness</b> and the source of AE during meshing is predominately due to asperity contact.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{model of}} the fully penetrated {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW) weld pool was established to investigate how the melt-through takes place. Analyses show that the forces acting on the liquid metal column which locates in the center of weld pool, whose undersurface and altitude are the bottom surface and thickness of weld pool respectively, determine whether the melt-through occurs. A criterion is set up for judging whether the workpiece will melt through with a <b>specific</b> <b>thickness</b> and selected welding parameters. Factors influencing the melt-through are studied theoretically, and the magnitude and scale of forces that acting on the liquid metal column in a quasi-steady state weld pool are calculated numerically. By using the established criterion, welding currents suitable for a workpiece with <b>specific</b> <b>thickness</b> are predicted. For the numerical simulation on heat transfer in fully penetrated Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) weld pools, most studies focus on the prediction of surface deformation, calculation of heat and fluid fields, as well as interactions between arcs and weld pools.
