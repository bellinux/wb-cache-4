50|$|Phyllic {{alteration}} typically {{forms in}} the base-metal zone of a porphyry system. Alteration assemblages vary with depth and with degree of fluid interaction. In deep environments, the most highly altered areas are veins and thin <b>selvages,</b> or halos, that surround them. The <b>selvages</b> are generally <10 cm in diameter and composed of major sericite and minor quartz. Vein orientation is preserved from original rock, but minerals within are mostly replaced by pyrite. With decreasing depth, <b>selvages</b> widen (10 cm - 1m) and contain more quartz and pyrite.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Micaceous {{quartzites}} from a subvertical {{shear zone}} in the Tauern Window contain abundant quartz clasts derived from dismembered quartz-tourmaline veins. Bulk plane strain deformation affected these rocks at amphibolite facies conditions. Shape changes suggest net shortening of the clasts by 11 – 64 %, with a mean value of 35 %. Quartz within the clasts accommodated this strain largely via dislocation creep processes. On the high-stress flanks of the clasts, however, quartz was removed via solution mass transfer (pressure solution) processes; the resulting change in bulk composition allowed growth of porphyro-blastic staurolite + chlorite ± kyanite on the clast flanks. Matrix SiO 2 contents decrease from c. 83 wt% away from the clasts to 49 – 58 % in the <b>selvages</b> on the clast flanks. The chemical changes are consistent with c. 70 % volume loss in the high-stress zones. Calculated shortening values within the clast flanks {{are similar to the}} volume-loss estimates, and are greatly in excess of the shortening values calculated from the clasts themselves. Flow laws for dislocation creep versus pressure solution imply large strain-rate gradients and ⁄ or differential stress gradients between the matrix and the clast <b>selvages.</b> In a rock containing a large proportion of semirigid clasts, weakening within the clast flanks could dominate rock rheology. In our samples, however, weakening within the <b>selvages</b> was self limiting: (1) growth of strong staurolite porphyroblasts in the <b>selvages</b> protected remaining quartz from dissolution; and (2) overal...|$|R

Factories have {{increased}} the mechanical equipment on a mass scale {{as a result of}} quick growth of global industry, and the unbearable sounds that machines create while operating become noise. Therefore, versatility of building materials that are highly correlated to human habitat has been gaining attention. This study combines and then needle-punches fire-retardant polyester (PET) fibers and recycled Kevlar <b>selvages</b> to make PET/Kevlar nonwoven fabrics, which are then combined with Polyurethane (PU) foams, a product yielded after Polyol and Isocyanate (MDI) foam and cure, to form PET/Kevlar/PU foam composite boards. During the process, PET fibers and Kevlar fibers are blended with various ratios and the density of the PU foams is varied. The resilience rate, burst strength, and sound absorption of the resulting composite boards are tested. The test results show that increasing Kevlar <b>selvages</b> can heighten the resilience rate but decreases the burst strength of the composite boards...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Finite {{strain and}} geochemical {{variations}} along strain gradients {{were used to}} study cleavage development in carbonates in the Lost River Range, Idaho. Deformation accommodating layer-parallel shear was partitioned into thin deforma-tion zones during folding of Willow Creek anticline. Cleavage intensity is strong to very strong in deformation zones and weak in surrounding rocks. Strain magnitudes range from es 0. 32 (1. 15 : 0. 93 : 0. 73; x, y, z, principal axes of strain) outside, to es 0. 64 (1. 29 : 0. 80 : 0. 52) inside, deformation zones. We found a positive linear correlation between strain, cleavage development, and negative dilation. Volume loss, at a cubic centimeter scale, ranges from 12 percent to 49 percent. Cleavage <b>selvages</b> are depleted in Ca and 18 O and enriched in other elements relative to microlithons and less deformed protolith carbonates. Mass-balance considerations indicate that cleavage was formed by incongruent pressure solution leading to a passive concentration of less soluble components during Ca loss and metasomatic additions of Si, Al, and K to produce authigenic clay minerals in <b>selvages.</b> Data for the Willow Creek locality {{and elsewhere in the}} Lost River Rang...|$|R
