40|$|In thyrocytes, cell {{polarity}} is {{of crucial}} importance for proper thyroid function. Many intrinsic mechanisms of <b>self-regulation</b> <b>control</b> how {{the key players}} involved in thyroid hormone (TH) biosynthesis interact in apical microvilli, so that hazardous biochemical processes may occur without detriment to the cell. In some pathological conditions, this enzymatic complex is disrupted, with some components abnormally activated into the cytoplasm, {{which can lead to}} further morphological and functional breakdown. When iodine intake is altered, autoregulatory mechanisms outside the thyrocytes are activated. They involve adjacent capillaries that, together with thyrocytes, form the angiofollicular units (AFUs) that can be considered as the functional and morphological units of the thyroid. In response to iodine shortage, a rapid expansion of the microvasculature occurs, which, in addition to nutrients and oxygen, optimizes iodide supply. These changes are triggered by angiogenic signals released from thyrocytes via a reactive oxygen species/hypoxia-inducible factor/vascular endothelial growth factor pathway. When intra- and extrathyrocyte autoregulation fails, other forms of adaptation arise, such as euthyroid goiters. From onset, goiters are morphologically and functionally heterogeneous due to the polyclonal nature of the cells, with nodules distributed around areas of quiescent AFUs containing globules of compact thyroglobulin (Tg) and surrounded by a hypotrophic microvasculature. Upon TSH stimulation, quiescent AFUs are activated with Tg globules undergoing fragmentation into soluble Tg, proteins involved in TH biosynthesis being expressed and the local microvascular network extending. Over time and depending on physiological needs, AFUs may undergo repetitive phases of high, moderate, or low cell and tissue activity, which may ultimately culminate in multinodular goiters...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Self-regulation is {{the ability}} to control inner states or {{responses}} with respect to thoughts, emotions, attention, and performance. As such, it is a critical aspect of development and fundamental to personality and behavioral adjustment. In this review, we focus on attentional, cognitive, and emotional control as we discuss the genetic mechanisms and brain mechanisms that contribute to individual differences in self-regulation. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for deviations in the development of this complex construct and suggestions for future research.

Studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between personality hardiness and stress. However, few studies have explored the relationship between personality hardiness, stress, and psychological resources on career transitions. This study focused on the influences of personality hardiness, stress and psychological resources on the length of time it takes persons to resolve a career transition. The population in this study was comprised primarily of persons receiving services who had completed a career transition within the last 10 years (1998 - 2008) from two university alumni career services centers. This research was based on the hypothesis that individuals with higher levels of personality hardiness and psychological resources will resolve their unemployment in less time than other individuals and experience lower levels of perceived stress. Higher levels of personality hardiness will correlate with higher levels of psychological resources and lower levels of stress. Conversely, lower levels of personality hardiness will correlate with lower levels of psychological resources, higher levels of stress and more time in resolving career transitions. This relationship was assessed using the Personal View Survey (PVS III-R) to measure personality hardiness, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T-Anxiety) to measure psychological distress, and the Career Transitions Inventory (CTI) to measure psychological resources. Finally, the length of time it takes the participants to resolve their career transition was assessed using the Career Transitions Questionnaire. A multi-variant data analysis of the results was conducted using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient and multi-linear regression models. The results of the regression demonstrated partial support of the hypothesis that individuals with higher levels of personality hardiness and psychological resources will resolve their unemployment in less time than other individuals and experience lower levels of perceived stress. Although results showed that total personality hardiness was not significant to the length of time in a career transition, PVSIII-R subscales Commitment and Control were found to be significant. CTI subscale Confidence had the highest correlation with the dependent variable length of time in a career transition. Trait anxiety was not a significant predictor of the length of time in a career transition. This study confirmed that resilience factors such as confidence (self-efficacy), commitment (perseverance) and <b>self-regulation</b> (<b>control)</b> helped to produce the sustained efforts needed to resolve a career transition. These results contribute to the debate regarding the strength of PVIII-R Commitment and Control subscales and the notion of personality hardiness and confidence as career transition resources...|$|E

The article explains the importance of the emotional abilities (empathy, reflection, <b>self-regulation</b> and <b>control</b> feelings and emotions of other people) in the personal structure of the educational psychologist. Specificity of educational psychologist’s professional activity is that he must confront his professional challenges and manage his emotional state. The foreign analogue of the concept “emotional competence ” is “emotional intelligence”. Based on the analysis of conjugate concepts of “emotional ability”, “emotional intelligence ” there is provided a definition of “emotional competence”.

As part of emotional competence there are four basic components and their functions: <b>self-regulation</b> (impulse <b>control</b> and management of emotions, expression of emotions, blocking negative emotional states); regulation of relationships (social skills, ability to build relationships with others); reflection (self-awareness, rational understanding of emotions, and identifying one’s own motivation); empathy (emotional and cognitive decentering).

He {{coined the}} term [...] "ego depletion" [...] to describe the evidence that humans' ability to self-regulate is limited, and after using it there is less ability (or energy) to self-regulate.

A corollary to this analogy, supported by his research, is that self-control can be strengthened over time, much like a muscle.

Recent {{research has demonstrated}} that depletion of self-regulatory resources can impair executive function through restriction of working memory capacity. The current work explored whether the mere perception of resource depletion (i. e., illusory fatigue) is sufficient to directly produce these deficits in executive control. To manipulate illusory fatigue, participants were exposed to a depleting or nondepleting task before being presented with false feedback about the effects of the initial task on their state of resource depletion. Participants then completed a well-established index of working memory capacity.

Severely obese women (BMI 35 - 50 kg·m- 2) were randomized into 26 -week treatments of exercise supported by cognitive-behavioral methods paired with either nutrition education (n = 114) or cognitive-behavioral methods applied to controlled eating (n = 121).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine IBD patients’ subjective experiences of the daily impact of IBD, and categorize dimensions of their HRQoL affected by IBD, as identified by the patients themselves. Methods Two hundred and eighty-two patients with IBD provided answers to the qualitative question “How has IBD affected your daily activities?” A content analysis using NVivo 2. 0 was conducted on the participants’ responses to this question to reveal dimensions of their HRQoL.
