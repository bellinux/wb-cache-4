5|$|Though slavery persisted, {{some aspects}} of the {{relationship}} changed with the French administration. Escaped slaves could find official protection by French authorities in the cities for a limited time. Slaves could sometimes renegotiate the terms of their <b>servitude</b> in the changed political situation. Some were willing to agree to remain in <b>servitude</b> if they received control over their family life and some land to pass to their children. In addition, the French administration actively worked to end slave raiding and the most clear manifestations of the slave trade, greatly reducing those means of acquiring slaves. However, for many decades after the 1905 abolition of slavery, the practice continued in much of French Sudan.|$|E

40|$|The legal {{doctrine}} on <b>servitudes</b> {{has long}} been viewed as a Byzantine tangle of doctrine emanating from property law, contract law, and courts of equity. This paper explains {{the structure of the}} law governing <b>servitudes</b> on land using key ideas from the economics of information, focusing on easements and covenants and the rules governing their formation and application. We develop a model of land markets that incorporates asymmetric information (adverse selection) and specialization in ownership and use this to offer a rationale for the seemingly ad hoc limits on the use of <b>servitudes.</b> We stress the inability of sellers of land credibly to assure buyers that land is not encumbered by <b>servitudes.</b> Our model explains variations in legal doctrine over time and across jurisdictions, particularly comparing <b>servitudes</b> in the United States and in England.

5|$|Castelli {{set up his}} {{government}} in Chuquisaca, where he presided over the change of regime for the entire region. He planned the reorganization of the Mines of Potosi, and a reform at the University of Charcas. He proclaimed the end of native slavery and <b>servitude</b> in Upper Peru, and the natives were granted political rights equal {{to those of the}} criollos. Castelli forbade the establishment of new convents and parishes to avoid the common practice that, under the guise of spreading Christian doctrine, the natives were forced into <b>servitude</b> by religious orders. He authorized free trade and redistributed land expropriated from the former workers of the mills. The decree was published in Spanish, Guarani, Quechua, and Aymara; he established several bilingual schools as well. Several Indian chiefs participated in {{the first anniversary of the}} May Revolution, celebrated in Tiahuanaco, where Castelli paid tribute to the ancient Incas and encouraged the people to rise against the Spanish. Despite their welcome, however, Castelli was aware that most of the aristocracy supported the auxiliary army out of fear instead of genuine support.|$|E

5|$|In 1803 Harrison asked Congress {{to suspend}} the anti-slavery clause of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years. Harrison claimed it was {{necessary}} to increase the territory's population more quickly and attract new settlers. Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so that the federal government would not longer have to financially support it. In 1803 the entire territory's population numbered less than 5,000. That year the legislature—which was appointed by Harrison—passed legislation reintroducing indentured <b>servitude.</b>|$|E

The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.|$|E

The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system.
