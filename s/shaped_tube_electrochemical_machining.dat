40|$|This thesis {{presents}} numerical {{and experimental}} investigations into <b>Electrochemical</b> <b>Machining</b> (ECM). The {{aim is to}} develop a computer program to predict the shape of a workpiece machined by the ECM process. The program is able to simulate various applications of EC machining which are drilling, milling, turning and <b>shaped</b> <b>tube</b> <b>electrochemical</b> drilling (STED). The program has been developed in a MATLAB environment. In this present work, EC-drilling, EC-milling and EC-turning are analysed as three-dimensional problems whereas STED is simulated in two-dimensions. Experiments have been carried out to verify the accuracy of the predicted results in the cases of EC-milling and EC-turning. The ECM modeller is based on the boundary element method (BEM) and uses Laplace's equation to determine the current distribution at nodes on the workpiece surface. In 3 D, the surfaces of the tool and the workpiece are discretised into continuous linear triangular element types whereas in 2 D, the boundaries of the tool and workpiece are discretised into linear elements. The ECM modeller is completely self-contained, i. e. it does not rely on any other commercial package. The program contains modules to automatically discretize the surfaces/boundaries of the tool and workpiece. Since the simulation of the ECM process is a temporal problem, several time steps are required to obtain the final workpiece shape. At the end of each time step, the shape of the workpiece is calculated using Faraday's laws. However, the workpiece's shape changes with progressing time steps causing the elements to become stretched and distorted. Mesh refinement techniques are built in the ECM modeller, and these subdivide the mesh automatically when necessary. The effect of time step on the predicted 3 D shape of a hole in EC-drilling is investigated. The effect of discontinuity in the slope between neighbouring elements is also studied. Results obtained from the ECM modeller are compared with 2 D analytical results to verify the accuracy that can be obtained from the ECM modeller. Milling features ranging from a simple slot to a pocket with a complex protrusion were machined {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of the EC milling process. These features were machined on a 3 -axes CNC machine converted to permit EC milling. The effect of tool geometry, tool feed rate, applied voltage and step-over distances on the dimensions, shape and surface finish of the machined features were investigated. A pocket with a human shape protrusion was machined using two different types of tool paths, namely contour-parallel and zig-zag. Both types resulted in the base surface of the pocket being concave and the final dimensions of the pockets are compared with the design drawing to determine the effect of tool path type on the accuracy of machining. The ECM modeller was used to simulate the machining of a thin-walled turned component. The machining parameters, i. e. initial gap, rotational speed, and applied voltage, were specified by the collaborating company. Since only a small amount of material had to be removed from the thin-walled component, the tool was held stationary i. e. a feed in the radial or longitudinal direction was not required. By taking advantage of the axi-symmetric nature of a turned component, only a sector of the component was analysed thereby reducing the computing time considerably. The accuracy of the modeller was verified by comparing the predicted time to machine the thin-walled component with the actual machining time. The initial investigations in STED were both experimental and numerical in nature and they studied the effect of applied voltage, tool feed rate and electrolyte pressure on the dimensions of the holes. Later investigations were numerical and an iterative methodology has been developed to calculate a set of feed rates which could machine a specified turbulator shape.

A recast layer containing numerous micropores and microcracks is easily generated during the electrodischarge machining process due to the rapid heating and cooling effects, which restrict the wide applications of noncircular holes in aerospace and aircraft industries. Owing to the outstanding advantages of pulse <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining,</b> electrodischarge machining–pulse <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> combined technique is provided to improve the overall quality of electrodischarge machining-drilled holes. The influence of pulse <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> processing parameters {{on the surface}} roughness and the influence of the electrodischarge machining–pulse <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> method on the surface quality and accuracy of holes have been studied experimentally. The results indicate that the pulse <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> processing time for complete removal of the recast layer decreases with the increase in the pulse <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> current.

40|$|<b>Electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> is a {{relatively}} new technique, only being introduced as a commercial technique within the last 70 [*]years. A lot of research was conducted in the 1960 s and 1970 s, but research on electrical discharge machining around the same time slowed <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> research. The main influence for the development of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> came from the aerospace industry where very hard alloys were required to be machined without leaving a defective layer in order to produce a component which would behave reliably. <b>Electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> was primarily used for the production of gas turbine blades or to machine materials into complex shapes that would be difficult to machine using conventional machining methods. Tool wear is high and the metal removal rate is slow when machining hard materials with conventional machining methods such as milling. This increases the cost of the machining process overall and this method creates a defective layer on the machined surface. Whereas with <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> there is virtually no tool wear even when machining hard materials and it does not leave a defective layer on the machined surface.

In order to ensure the mask is in close contact with the workpiece, we need to arrange many compaction circular cylinders within the flow channel. The influences on electrolyte flow of compaction circular cylinders were investigated. The distribution of the compaction circular cylinders affects the electrolyte flow state, thereby affecting the processing. By analyzing the electrolyte flow state for the different distributions of compaction circular cylinders, one can find the best distribution of compaction circular cylinders for the required processing...|$|R

40|$|In the Collaborative Research Centre SFB 692 HALS at Technische Universität Chemnitz several {{academic}} institutions work on high-strength Al-based lightweight materials for safety components. One field of investigation {{is focused on}} particle reinforced aluminium matrix composites (AMCs). AMCs are difficult to machine conventionally by cutting {{due to the fact}} that the ceramic particles raise the wear of the tool. For facing these challenges, a part of the SFB collaboration investigates the machining of AMCs with <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> (ECM). One of the applied technologies is pulsed <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> (PECM), which is investigated with the intention to generate complex 3 -D precision geometries. The AMCs consist of an aluminium matrix and SiC particles. The aluminium is easily to machine with PECM, but the SiC particles cannot be dissolved during the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> process applying neutral electrolytes. Therefore, the influence of the particles related to the dissolution characteristics and the surface layer were analysed in previous studies [1 – 3]. This study presents results of further experiments applying an established method for the determination of the material removal characteristics in pulsed <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> of AMCs [4].
