5|$|Between 2007 and 2012 {{an average}} of 30,000 {{visitors}} came to the tower each year, with non-English speaking visitors making up a high proportion.

He used his convicts to convert the buildings into a temporary prison. Meanwhile, Henderson was looking for a <b>site</b> <b>to</b> build a permanent convict establishment. Whilst he favoured Mount Eliza due to its height, which gave it pleasing vistas and supposedly healthier air, Governor Charles Fitzgerald rejected that proposal. Henderson ultimately settled on the current site on a hill overlooking Fremantle.|$|E

The men of the 150 (Yorkshire) Transport Regiment also spent a day performing repairs at the magazine. Gomez aspires to open the <b>site</b> <b>to</b> the public.|$|E

40|$|In our work, photoemission {{electron}} microscopy (PEEM) {{was employed to}} real-time and in situ study CO adsorption on the O-saturated Ag/Pt(110) composite surface.
