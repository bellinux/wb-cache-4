50|$|In the Incident the German tanker rammed {{her with}} the stern in an angle of about 30° at the {{altitude}} of her bridge and pressed the destroyer towards the fiord wall. The Norwegian officers present later reported, that only the mass of ice piled up averted the destroyer to crash onto the rocky shore. The powerful engines of the destroyer made her escape from the squeeze possible. Cossack arrived at Leith on 17 February with the 299 freed prisoners. She had to be docked for her propellor and A-brackets to be checked in case they had been damaged by the thick ice in the fiord. They were unharmed, but her <b>stern</b> <b>plating</b> had to be repaired {{where it had been}} bumping against Altmark.|$|R
25|$|The {{main task}} for these vessels {{will be for}} {{maritime}} security and fisheries enforcement off Canada's Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Secondary tasks will be marine search and rescue and marine pollution control. Four of the vessels are planned to provide security on the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The first vessel, Private Robertson V.C. entered service in 2012 and the last, Captain Goddard M.S.M. in 2014. In November 2015, G. Peddle S.C. {{was taken out of}} service for two months due to issues with the lifeboat system. In May 2016 Corporal McLaren M.M.V. was taken out of service to address corrosion on <b>stern</b> <b>plates.</b> In February 2017, a government report claiming poisoned water aboard some Canadian Coast Guard vessels named Private Robertson V.C., Corporal Teather C.V. and Constable Carrière among them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first days}} were uneventful. On 15 July, Flamingo {{anchored}} for the night, as was usual practice, {{to the north}} of the minefield. During the ensuing evening hours, strong winds and currents caused herto drag her anchor. She slowly worked southward from her original position. The next morning, when Flamingo weighed anchor to get underway, she discovered that she had drifted into the minefield and had fouled one of the mines in her anchor cable. The mine was trailing just beneath the fantail of the ship and exploded beneath Flamingo′s stern. The underwater blast badly damaged the rudder, disabled the capstan and generator, and dished in the ships <b>stern</b> <b>plating</b> in several places. [...] (Minesweeper No. 17) lent assistance and towed Flamingo to Invergordon, Scotland, for drydocking and repairs on 17 July 1919.|$|R

50|$|She made port at Saint John, New Brunswick, {{where her}} <b>stern</b> was <b>plated</b> over. On 23 May 1943, Saguenay was {{transferred}} to Halifax, to serve with the Western Ocean Escort Force working from Halifax and St. John's, Newfoundland. In October 1943 Saguenay was towed to Digby, Nova Scotia, as a tender assigned to , the Royal Canadian Navy's training depot for new entries (recruits). She was used for teaching seamanship and gunnery until 30 July 1945, paid off in late 1945, and broken up in 1946.|$|R
2500|$|The {{two ships}} around the tanker {{were joined by}} HMS Bramham and by Ledbury (the latter {{returning}} from her search for Manchester). Meanwhile, Rye had again begun to tow Ohio with the newly arrived Ledbury acting as a stern tug. With less pull from Ledbury, a fair speed was maintained, but steering proved impossible. A stabilising factor was needed, thus Commander Swain edged Penn to the starboard side of Ohio. Rye, joined by Bramham, slowly got under way once more, with Ledbury acting as a rudder. Another Axis air attack began just as the group of ships was moving at six knots. At 10.45 AM {{the first wave of}} dive-bombers came low over the water. Only one oil bomb landed close to Ohios bow, showering her with burning liquid. Then came three more echelons of German planes. This time, [...] close air support from Malta was available. Sixteen Spitfires, of 249 and 229 Squadrons from Malta, had sighted the enemy. The first enemy formation wavered and broke. The second formation also broke, but one section of Junkers 88s succeeded in breaking free, making for the tanker. These were swiftly followed by the Spitfires. Three of the German planes were shot down or manoeuvred to evade the Spitfires; nonetheless one bomber held its course, and a 1,000-pound bomb landed in the tanker's wake. Ohio was flung forward, parting Ryes tow, buckling the <b>stern</b> <b>plates</b> of the tanker and forming a great hole.|$|R

King {{made to the}} Superior Shipbuilding Company’s drydock {{for repairs}} of a twisted, broken <b>stern,</b> {{seventeen}} shell <b>plates</b> and frames destroyed, interior forward decks buckled, and numerous angles and stringers that required replacement, Captain Nelson ordered that no {{member of the crew}} was to discuss the accident with anyone but representatives of the vessel’s owner or agents.|$|R
50|$|On 15 November 1942, Saguenay was rammed by the Panamanian {{freighter}} Azra off Cape Race, Newfoundland. The {{impact of}} the collision set off Saguenays depth charges, which blew off her stern. She made port at Saint John, New Brunswick, where her <b>stern</b> was <b>plated</b> over. On 23 May 1943, Saguenay was transferred to Halifax, to serve with the Western Ocean Escort Force working from Halifax and St. John's, Newfoundland.

2500|$|The wooden hulled Aetna {{class had}} [...] "straight {{vertical}} sides and a flat bottom {{with a very}} bluff bow and <b>stern.</b> Their armour <b>plates,</b> nominally 4in [...] {{but in many cases}} rolled 0.25-0.5in under thickness, were locked together with tongue and groove joints." [...] The iron armour was supported by [...] thick oak sides. The wooden upper deck was [...] thick. [...] There were two conning towers protected by [...] wrought iron plate.|$|R
25|$|The wreck {{is located}} at , lying in 7 metres of water on a reef bottom with the bow facing to shore. It appears the vessel may have broken in two {{amidships}} with two sections of deck framing off centre. Several sections stand proud of the sea-bed. The hull has largely disintegrated with only the vessel's floors and the <b>stern</b> section recognisable. <b>Plating,</b> frames and stringers are strewn throughout the wreckage with one deck winch and sections of windlass the only machinery apparent.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 February, Duchess joined {{units of}} the Home Fleet on the Spring Training Cruise. The cruise {{included}} multi-national exercises in the Mediterranean, a port visit to Oran, and a joint Home-Mediterranean Fleets exercise. Duchess returned to Portsmouth on 23 March. On 29 April, the destroyer departed for Gibraltar to meet the royal yacht Britannia, which was carrying Queen Elizabeth II on the final legs of her Commonwealth Tour. Duchess {{was part of the}} escort force until Britannia reached the Thames Estuary on 13 May. The destroyer then proceeded to Invergordon for Home Fleet exercises. On 19 June, Duchess and sister ship [...] were detached for a three-week flag-showing cruise around the Baltic Sea. Port visits were made to Oslo, Copenhagen, and Stockholm before Duchess returned to Portsmouth. On 31 August, the ship was paid off and recommissioned. She was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, and sailed on 10 September for Malta. On 15 October, Duchess was part of a demonstration of naval power for the Emperor of Ethiopia. The rest of the year was spent on exercises, including NATO exercise Novex 54, along with port visits to Elba with the cruiser [...] in November. In early January 1955, Jamaica and Duchess made a formal visit to Algiers, which was then followed by more exercises. On 24 March, while moored at Naples, Duchess was rammed by the United States merchant ship SS Excambion. Damage to the destroyer included punctured hull plating on the starboard bow, impact damage to the starboard <b>stern</b> <b>plates</b> where the collision forced them into the wharf, and damage to the superstructure. Temporary repairs were effected, and the destroyer was able to sail to the Malta Dockyard on 30 March. Repairs took most of April, and it was not until 22 May that the ship was deployed again, on a cruise to the eastern Mediterranean. Duchess visited Istanbul, Alexandria, and Cyprus before returning to Malta's Grand Harbour on 22 June. Two days later, with her Mediterranean deployment at an end, Duchess departed for Portsmouth via Gibraltar. On her 1 July arrival, the destroyer was docked for maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|The vessels sighted {{each other}} about ten minutes before the {{collision}} and exchanged steam whistle signals. Captain Sawyer of the Superior City and Captain Nelson of the Willis L. King offered conflicting statements about {{the weather and the}} whistle signals prior to the collision. Captain Sawyer said that the weather was clear {{at the time of the}} accident while Captain Nelson said that the night had been foggy and hazy. Captain Sawyer maintained that the two vessels exchanged one blast signals indicating the conventional port-to-port passing signal. Captain Nelson asserted that the vessels exchanged two blast signals for a starboard-to-starboard passing. At the time impact, the Superior City was swinging across the King’s bow while Captain Nelson swung his bow hard aport and rang the telegraph to stop and then full astern. The estimated speed at the time of impact was 12 mi per hour for the King, and 10.5 mi per hour for the Superior City.The accident was investigated by U.S. Steamboat Inspectors Gooding and Hanson of Marquette, Michigan. [...] After their initial statements, both captains communicated only in depositions to the proctors-in-admiralty representatives of the owners of the vessels. Officers and crew of the nearby J.J. Turner and the Midvale witnessed the collision and heard the exchange of passing signals. It was determined that although very early in the night there had been haze and some fog, at the time of the collision the night was crystal clear with unlimited visibility.When the Willis L. King made to the Superior Shipbuilding Company’s drydock for repairs of a twisted, broken <b>stern,</b> seventeen shell <b>plates</b> and frames destroyed, interior forward decks buckled, and numerous angles and stringers that required replacement, Captain Nelson ordered that no member of the crew was to discuss the accident with anyone but representatives of the vessel’s owner or agents.|$|R
