As chalconas são de uma classe de produtos naturais pertencentes ao grupo dos flavonoides. Este grupo tem despertado o interesse dos pesquisadores por apresentarem várias atividades biológicas incluindo: antitumoral, antiparasitárias, antimalária, anti-inflamatória, entre outras. Os flavonoides tem sido alvo de estudos por apresentarem grande potencial farmacológico e, do ponto de vista sintético, há um grande interesse para o desenvolvimento de estruturas análogas, buscar novas moléculas e realizar uma investigação biológica para o tratamento de diversas patologias. A busca de novos medicamentos, despertou nosso interesse em desenvolver alguns compostos nitroderivados para serem testados em diversas doenças parasitárias. No entanto, a síntese das chalconas com o grupo nitro (NO 2) ligado ao anel aromático, é de grande interesse e amplamente utilizadas como fármacos. Portanto, para viabilizar o processo de síntese das chalconas, foi utilizado o <b>safrol</b> como matéria-prima, e depois seguida de uma reação de isomerização e convertido em {{piperonal}} que depois foi submetido a uma reação de nitração aromática. A síntese da chalcona é baseada na reação de condensação de Claisen-Schimidt, empregando um catalisador básico (NaOH), solvente polar (EtOH), acetofenona e nitropiperonal. Todas as chalconas foram caracterizadas por análise de ressonância magnética nuclear (RMN), obtido o ponto de fusão e realizados os ensaios biológicos. A chalcona que tem o grupo nitro (NO 2) ligado ao anel aromático apresentou um melhor resultado contra o parasita Schistosoma mansoni, responsável pela doença esquistossomose. The chalcones are a {{class of}} natural products belonging {{to the group of}} flavonoids. This group has aroused the interest of researchers because they have several biological activities including: anti-tumor, anti-parasitic, anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory, among others. Flavonoids have been investigated for having great pharmacological potential, and the synthetic point of view, there is great interest for the development of similar structures, seek new molecules and perform a biological research for the treatment of various diseases. The search for new drugs, aroused our interest in developing some nitroderivatives compounds to be tested in several parasitic diseases. However, the synthesis of chalcones with the nitro group (NO 2) attached to the aromatic ring, is of great interest and widely used as drugs. Therefore, to facilitate the process of synthesis of chalcones it was used safrole as a raw material, and then followed by an isomerization reaction and converted into piperonal which was then subjected to a reaction for aromatic nitration. The synthesis of chalcone is based on the reaction Claisen-Schmidt Condensation, using a basic catalyst (NaOH), polar solvent (EtOH), acetophenone and nitropiperonal. All chalcones were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (NMR), the melting point obtained and biological tests conducted. The chalcone having nitro group (NO 2) attached to the aromatic ring presented a better result against the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, responsible for the disease schistosomiasis. In this sense, the analysis by spectroscopy in the infrared region, indicated that no changes {{in the structure of the}} nanostructured chemical pulp, after sonication. Thermal analysis showed stability of nanostructured sonicated above the pulp fiber and untreated fiber obtained via chemical hydrolysis, indicating the possibility of use as matrix polymers with melting temperatures higher than those polyolefins. Since the morphological analysis showed a reduction in fiber dimensions and good dispersion of the fibers after compression molding cycles. Thus, the mechanical traction results are comparable to those observed in the literature for similar composites obtained by the extrusion process which allows better mixing and dispersion of the composite. The nanostructured cellulose obtained proved to be interesting for application in polymeric composites...|$|E
40|$|Substances {{of natural}} and {{synthetic}} origin were studied using analytical, bioassay guided isolation, metabolomics and medicinal chemistry techniques. In a section focused on the plant family Marcgraviaceae, a validated method for the quantification of six pentacyclic triterpenes (α and β Amyrin lupeol, ursolic acid, betulin and betulinic acid) in the Souroubea spp was developed. Quantification of the triterpenes in the crude extracts was achieved using HPLC-APCI mass selective detection. The calibration curves for the five triterpenes evaluated were highly linear (r 2 > 0. 993) and percentage recovery from spiked samples were greater than 94 % for all compounds. The LOD for betulinic acid was 0. 01 µg for betulinic acid on column and LOQ was 0. 03 µg. The method was successfully applied to 41 crude extracts from leaf and stem of Souroubea spp, from two locations in Costa Rica. The method is suitable for quality control of raw materials used {{in the manufacture of}} natural health products. The use of modern metabolomic techniques, UHPLC-QTOF allowed the identification of five putative makers that can potentially be used in distinguishing between the two Souroubea species. The validated method was used in the quantification of the above triterpenes in a total of thirteen Marcgraviaceae species collected in Costa Rica. It was established that betulinic acid and β- Amyrin could be used as makers for this family of tropical vines. These same thirteen plants extracts were evaluated in antifungal and quorum sensing inhibition bioassays. Marcgravia nervosa was the only species that showed significant activity in both bioassays. Bioassay guided fractionation of the crude ethanolic extract of M. nervosa led to the identification of 2 -methoxynaphthoquinone as the bioactive compound responsible for the bioactivity. The crude leaf ethanolic extract from M. nervosa showed a significant inhibition of QS comparable or somewhat better than D. pulchra extracts with the M. nervosa extract showing stronger inhibiting QS with a halo of 21. 8 mm, more than D. pulcra extracts which generated a halo of 15. 9 mm. The active quinone has a MIC of 85 µM against Saccharomyces cerevisiaBY 4741 (haploid) and 100 µM against Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY 4743 (diploid) compared to berberine (positive control) with a MIC 600 µM for both strains. This quinone is not present in any of the other twelve species of Marcgraviaceae available to us. In work focusing on organic synthesis, a total of 57 semi-synthetic derivatives of dillapiol, <b>safrol</b> and piperonal were prepared and evaluated for their inhibitory activity in a CYP 3 A 4 bioassay to assess their potential use as pesticide synergists. The synergistic activity of dillapiol has been improved 45 fold; analog 31 has an IC 50 = 0. 2 µM compared with dillapiol IC 50 = 9. 18 µM. A number of other compounds structurally related to 31 showed similar levels of activity. A screening of a compound library identified the amino sulfoxide 3 as a potential lead for the design of a selective connexin blocker with potential application in the treatment of spinal cord injuries. The use of X-ray crystallography permitted the correction of the original structure assigned to 3. Once the structure was corrected a total of 6 analogs were prepared. Compound 3 has the highest inhibition of GJIC whereas compound 8 and compound 2, reduced anionic hemi-channel activity. Compound 2 also reduced the cationic activity of the hemi-channels...|$|E
