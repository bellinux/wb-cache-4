40|$|The {{authority}} of the <b>saints</b> is, in a sense, presupposed by the tradition, and yet, formulating this presupposition proves to be awkward. This dissertation is an exploration into the nature, the grounding {{and the limits of}} the {{authority of}} the <b>saints,</b> with reference to the theology of the <b>saints</b> in the work of Hans urs von Balthasar. My argument is that, in his use of the <b>saints,</b> Balthasar does not merely interpret the <b>saints</b> as a resource for theologians and for the Magisterium. For Balthasar, theology and the Magisterium are there to serve the <b>saints,</b> since the <b>saints</b> are the real witnesses whose testimony requires dynamic paraphrase and vigorous rendition. My argument will be that Balthasar wants to avoid the theory of multiple teaching offices, but that – while avoiding the theory of multiple offices – also attributes to the <b>saints</b> an authority that is analogical to that of the Magisterium. Balthasar uses the <b>saints,</b> not only to teach other theologians but also to teach the official Magisterium, thus handling the <b>saints</b> as if they were themselves a Magisterium. Four dimensions – the existential, the epistemological, the pneumatological and the ecclesiological – are identified and used to elucidate the nature, the grounding and the function of the {{authority of the}} <b>saints.</b> It will be argued that authority of the <b>saints</b> is grounded within each one of these dimensions and that these are the dimensions within which the <b>saints</b> function authoritatively. I will defend my own construal of Balthasar, argue for the credibility of Balthasar’s defence of the authority of the <b>saints,</b> as well as, locate and criticise some of the contradictions that are found in Balthasar in this regard, and identify some of the consequences of Balthasar’s position concerning the authority of the <b>saints,</b> for his own theology, for theology in general, and for the Church...|$|R
