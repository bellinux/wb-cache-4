5|$|In 2011, an Australian ant allergy venom <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted,</b> <b>with</b> {{the goal}} of {{determining}} which native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis. It showed that the jack jumper ant {{was responsible for the}} majority of patients' reactions to Myrmecia ant stings. Of the 265 patients who reacted to a sting from an ant belonging to the Myrmecia genus, 176 were from the jack jumper. 15 from M. nigrocincta and three from M. ludlowi, while 56 patients had reacted to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four native species of Australian ants caused anaphylaxis. Apart from Myrmecia species, the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) was also responsible for several systemic reactions.|$|E
25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits {{is not a new}} notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently. The <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>with</b> a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper. Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years. Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.|$|E

2500|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1988, John S. Michael reported that Samuel G. Morton's original 19th-century <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>with</b> less bias than Gould had described; that [...] "contrary to Gould's interpretation ... Morton's {{research was conducted}} with integrity". Nonetheless, Michael's analysis suggested that there were discrepancies in Morton's craniometric calculations, that his data tables were scientifically unsound, and he [...] "cannot be excused for his errors, or his unfair comparisons of means". Michael later complained that some authors, including J. Philippe Rushton, selectively [...] "cherry-picked facts" [...] from his research to support their own claims. He lamented, [...] "Some people have turned the Morton-Gould affair into a all or nothing debate in which either one side is right or {{the other side is}} right, and I think that is a mistake. Both men made mistakes and proving one wrong does not prove the other one right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once formed, first {{impressions}} {{tend to be}} stable. A {{review of the literature}} on the accuracy and impact of {{first impressions}} on rater-based assessments found that raters' first impressions are highly correlated with later scores, but it is unclear exactly why. One study tested stability by asking participants to form impressions people based purely on photographs. Participants' opinions of the people in photographs did not significantly differ after interacting with that person a month later. One potential reason for this stability is that one's first impressions could serve as a guide for his/her next steps, such as what questions are asked and how raters go about scoring. More research needs to be done on the stability of first impressions to fully understand how first impressions guide subsequent treatment, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the halo effect. Assessment tools can influence impressions too, for example if a question provides only a dichotomous [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] response or if a rater uses a scale (ratio). Although this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>with</b> the intention of improving rating methods in medical education, the literature review was sufficiently broad enough to generalize.|$|E
2500|$|Asian {{elephant}} (Elephas maximus): [...] In a study {{performed in}} 2006 three female Asian elephants {{were exposed to}} a large mirror to investigate their responses. Visible marks and invisible sham-marks were applied to the elephants' heads to test whether they would pass the MSR test. [...] One of the elephants showed mark-directed behaviour, though the other two did not. An earlier study failed to find MSR in two Asian elephants; it was claimed this was because the mirror was too small. The <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>with</b> the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) using elephants at the Bronx Zoo in New York. All three Asian elephants {{in the study were}} {{standing in front of a}} 2.5m-by-2.5m mirror—they inspected the rear and brought food close to the mirror for consumption. Evidence of elephant self-awareness was shown when one (and only one) elephant, Happy, repeatedly touched a painted X on her head with her trunk, a mark which could only be seen in the mirror. Happy ignored another mark made with colorless paint that was also on her forehead to ensure she was not merely reacting to a smell or feeling. Frans De Waal, who ran the study, stated, [...] "These parallels between humans and elephants suggest a convergent cognitive evolution possibly related to complex society and cooperation." ...|$|E
