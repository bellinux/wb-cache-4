40|$|In rhesus macaques, classic <b>systemic</b> <b>infection,</b> {{characterized}} by persistent viremia and seroconversion, occurred after multiple low-dose (103 50 % tissue culture infective doses) intravaginal (IVAG) inoculations with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strain SIVmac 251. Monkeys developed classic SIV infections after a variable number of low-dose IVAG exposures to SIVmac 251. Once established, the <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> was identical to SIV infection following high-dose IVAG SIV inoculation. However, occult <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> {{characterized by}} transient cell-associated or cell-free viremia consistently occurred {{early in the}} series of multiple vaginal SIV exposures. Further, antiviral cellular immune responses were present prior {{to the establishment of}} a classic <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> in the low-dose vaginal SIV transmission model...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on {{the rate of}} <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Chu-Baek) by Potato virus Y (PVY) was studied in growth chambers. <b>Systemic</b> <b>infection</b> of PVY was observed only within the temperature range of 16 °C to 32 °C. Within this temperature range, the time required for a plant to become infected systemically decreased from 14 days at 20 °C to 5. 7 days at 28 °C. The estimated lower thermal threshold was 15. 6 °C and the thermal constant was 65. 6 degree days. A <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> model was constructed based on experimental data, using the infection rate (Lactin- 2 model) and the infection distribution (three-parameter Weibull function) models, which accurately described the completion rate curves to <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> and the cumulative distributions obtained in the PVY-potato system, respectively. Therefore, this model was useful to predict the progress of <b>systemic</b> <b>infections</b> by PVY in potato plants, and to construct the epidemic models...|$|R
40|$|The present {{prospective}} {{study showed that}} incidence of <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> in severe burn patients was 30. 9 %. Toxic shock and multiple organ failure (MOF) developed in all patients with uncontrolled <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> Both morbidity and mortality of MOF were 76. 5 %. In the infection group, plasma TXB 2 and TXB 2 / 6 -keto-PGF 1 α ratio increased markedly. Their changes were closely correlated with the clinical course and deterioration of <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> Circulatory platelet aggregate ratio decreased significantly, while myocardiac enzyme spectrum greatly increased. Thrombi were observed in visceral tissues from patients dying of <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> These suggested that TXA 2 /PGI 2. imbalance promoting microaggregate and thrombus formation {{may be one of}} the pathogenic effects of toxic shock and MOF in burn patients...|$|R

40|$|Activated microglia, the {{resident}} macrophages of the brain, are {{a feature of}} Alzheimer’s disease. Animal models suggest that when activated microglia are further activated by a subsequent <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> this results in significantly raised levels of interleukin 1 ß within the CNS, which may in turn potentiate neurodegeneration. This prospective pilot study in Alzheimer’s disease subjects showed that cognitive function can be impaired {{for at least two}} months after the resolution of a <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> and that cognitive impairment is preceded by raised serum levels of interleukin 1 ß. These relations were not confounded by the presence of any subsequent <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> or by baseline cognitive scores.

40|$|Viral {{determinants}} {{involved in}} <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> of hosts by monocot-infecting plant viruses are poorly understood. Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV, genus Tritimovirus, family Potyviridae) exclusively infects monocotyledonous {{crops such as}} wheat, oat, barley, maize, triticale, and rye. Previously, we reported that WSMV CP amino acids 36 – 84 are expendable for <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> of wheat, maize, barley and rye. In this study, the role of coat protein (CP) in <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> of oat by WSMV was examined by using a series of viable deletion mutants. WSMV bearing deletions within or encompassing all of amino acids 36 – 57 efficiently infected oat, indicating that these amino acids are dispensable for <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> of oat. However, WSMV mutants lacking CP amino acids 58 – 84 or 85 – 100 failed to systemically infect oat. Furthermore, green fluorescent protein-tagged WSMV mutants lacking CP amino acids 58 – 100 elicited local foci in oat but failed to enter the vasculature. These data suggest that CP amino acids 58 – 100 are required for <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> of oat by WSMV by specifically facilitating virus long-distance transport in oat...|$|R
40|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV) is {{the most}} destructive citrus pathogen. The knowledge about how its infectivity is accomplished, time in which CTV causes <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> after transfer to the host plant and the relation between virus invasion and CTV pathogenicity is very scarce. The main objective {{of this study was}} to analyse whether different CTV genotypes vary in efficiency to cause <b>systemic</b> viral <b>infection.</b> Three weeks post-inoculation, set of seven host-plant citrus species were checked for CTV <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> Among seven CTV isolates tested, six of them were monophyletic according to the p 25 gene and previously biologically characterised. For one polyphyletic virus isolate the pathogenicity was established in this study. Our results showed that the transmission of virus and <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> is correlated with pathogenicity of CTV isolates, namely stem-pitting syndrome (SP). In three weeks CTV-SP isolates achieved <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> detectible by DTBA serological test. Polyphyletic isolate (composed of Gp 3 b and Gp 5) that caused 100 % infection, after biological characterization showed severe form of SP-syndrome. Monophyletic isolates belonging to Gp 4, Gp 3 a and Gp 2, which were determined as SP-CTV isolates, also achieved high percentages of <b>systemic</b> <b>infection,</b> respectively. On the contrary to severe SP isolates, isolates that are not related to appearance of SP disease symptoms were less efficient in accomplishing <b>systemic</b> virus <b>infection.</b> These results lead us to consider the aggressiveness of SP-CTV isolates as an important factor in processes of accomplishing early <b>systemic</b> plant <b>infection...</b>|$|R
40|$|A Carnation ringspot virus (CRSV) variant (1. 26) was {{identified}} that accumulates virions but {{is incapable of}} forming a <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> The 1. 26 capsid protein gene possesses a Ser→Pro mutation at amino acid 282. Conversion of 1. 26 amino acid 282 to Ser restored <b>systemic</b> <b>infection,</b> while the reciprocal mutation in wild-type CRSV abolished <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> Similar mutations introduced into the related Red clover necrotic mosaic virus capsid protein gene failed to induce the packaging but nonsystemic movement phenotype. These results provide additional support for the theory that virion formation is necessary but not sufficient for systemic movement with the dianthoviruses...|$|R

40|$|Yersinia enterocolitica is one {{of three}} {{pathogenic}} Yersinia species that share a tropism for lymphoid tissues. However, infection of an immunocompromised host is likely to result in a <b>systemic</b> <b>infection,</b> which is often fatal. Little is known about the bacterial proteins needed to establish such an infection. The genes that encode these virulence factors are likely to be active only during <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> A library of random cat fusions was used to inoculate BALB/c mice. Fusions expressed during a <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> were enriched by the adminis-tration of chloramphenicol-succinate. Y. enterocolitica isolates recovered from the mice were tested for chlor-amphenicol resistance in vitro. Fusions that were inactive in vitro were analyzed further and found to represent 31 allelic groups. Each was given a sif (for <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> factor) designation. Based on homology to known proteins, the sif genes are likely to encode proteins important for general physiology, transcription regulation, and other functions. During <b>systemic</b> <b>infections,</b> 13 of the sif-cat fusions were able to outcompete the wild type in the presence of chloramphenicol-succinate, confirming that the fusions were active. The in vitro expression of several sif genes was determined, showing modest changes in response to various growth conditions. A mutation in sif 15, which encodes a putative outer membrane protein, caused attenuation during <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> but not during colonization of the Peyer’s patches. Comparisons between the Y. enterocolitica sif genes and the previously identified hre genes imply that very different groups of genes are active during a systemi...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHuman {{adenovirus}} (HAdV) infections {{constitute a}} major cause of morbidity in paediatric haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. New antiviral treatments offer promising perspectives. However, it remains challenging to identify patients at risk for disseminated infection, and who should receive early antiviral intervention. We conducted a longitudinal study of allogeneic HSCT recipients, including weekly HAdV monitoring, to determine the risks factors associated with HAdV infection and dissemination, and to assess whether HAdV loads in stools may be used as surrogate markers for HAdV dissemination. Between September 2010 and December 2011, out of 72 patients, the cumulative incidence rates at day 100 of HAdV digestive <b>infection,</b> <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> and related disease were 35. 9 %, 24. 0 %, and 18. 3 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for HAdV digestive and <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> were cord blood and in vitro T-cell depletion. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade > 2 was also associated with <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> In patients with HAdV digestive shedding, GVHD grade > 2 and HAdV load in stools were the only risk factors for <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> The median peak levels of HAdV in stool were 7. 9 and 4. 0 log 10 copies/mL, respectively, in patients with HAdV <b>systemic</b> <b>infection</b> and in those without. HAdV monitoring in stools of paediatric HSCT recipients receiving cord blood or in vitro T-cell depleted transplants helps to predict patients at risk for HAdV <b>systemic</b> <b>infection.</b> Our results provide a rationale for randomized controlled trials to evaluate the benefit of anti-HAdV pre-emptive treatments based on HAdV DNA levels in stools...|$|R
