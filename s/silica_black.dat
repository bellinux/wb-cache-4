40|$|Hollow core {{photonic}} bandgap fibers (HC-PBGFs) are a {{class of}} optical fibers which guide light in a low index core region surrounded by a triangular lattice of air holes separated by a delicate silica web. The precise nature of this cladding structure requires extremely fine control of the fabrication parameters. While HC-PBGFs have found wide range of exciting research applications the initially anticipated potential for ultralow loss below that of single mode fiber (SMF) {{has yet to be}} realized. To date loss figures as low as 1. 7 dB/km have been reported, however surface roughness at the core cladding interface limited further loss reduction. The loss of HC-PBGFs can potentially be decreased further by increasing the core dimensions and through optimisation of the fabrication process. To date, the manufacture of HC-PBGFs is reliant upon the two stage stack and draw process. To target ultralow loss below what has been reported to date it has become necessary to ensure repeatability and uniformity in the labor intensive stack and draw process. Repeatability is ensured through rigorous cleanliness throughout preform preparation and by precise fabrication control at each stage of manufacture. Figure 1. a) Scanning electron micrograph of a 19 cell core defect HC-PBGF, b) Attenuation scaling of the photonic bandgap (PBG) versus central guidance wavelength of 19 cell core defect HC-PBGF. Greater than 1 km lengths of HC-PBGF (Fig. 1 a) can now be drawn with typical attenuations of the order of 2 - 3 dB/km and with significantly improved optical bandwidth (~ 100 nm) compared with previously reported. These developments open up HC-PBGF for a range of applications such as telecommunications, laser power delivery, gas sensing and strong light matter interactions, for which they have a clear advantage over conventional fibers. The attenuation scaling of the photonic bandgap (PBG) (solid curves) with central operating wavelength has been investigated in 19 cell core defect fibres (Fig. 1 b). The expected attenuation proportional to lambda[- 3] relationship (dashed red curve) is observed until the infrared absorption edge of <b>silica</b> (<b>black</b> dot dash curve) is breached and the attenuation increases (green curve). Through strategic fabrication improvements we have achieved repeatable low loss manufacture of HC-PBGFs. Future developments in fabrication control and fiber design will allow the realization of ultralow loss HC-PBGF...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} diversity of newly engineered nanoparticles, {{it is important}} to consider the hazards of these materials. Very little is known regarding the potential toxicity of relatively new nanomaterials. However, beginning with several historical accounts of nanomaterials applications [...] -chrysotile asbestos and silver [...] -it was assumed that these examples would provide some awareness and guidelines for future nanomaterial and nanotechnology applications, especially health effects. In this study in vitro assays were performed on a murine alveolar macrophage cell line (RAW 264. 7), human alveolar macrophage cell line (THB- 1), and human epithelial lung cell line (A 549) to assess the comparative cytotoxicity of a wide range of manufactured (Ag, TiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, ZrO 2, black carbon, two different types of multiwall structures and chrysotile asbestos as the toxicity standard) and anthropogenic nanoparticulates. ^ There are several parameters of nanoparticulates that are considered to trigger an inflammatory response (particularly respiratory) or cause toxicity. These parameters include: particle size, shape, specific surface area, transition metals in particulates, and organic compounds. Therefore, a wide variety of manufactured and anthropogenic nanoparticulates having different morphologies, sizes, specific surface area and chemistries as noted were tested. To determine the nanoparticulates 2 ̆ 7 size and morphology, they were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, where it was observed that the commercial multiwall carbon nanotube aggregate had an identical morphology to chrysotile asbestos and combustion-formed carbon nanotubes, i. e.; those that form from natural gas combustion. Light optical microscopy was used to determine cell morphology upon exposure to nanoparticulates as an indication of cell death. Also, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content of the collected nanoparticulates was analyzed and correlated with cytotoxic responses. ^ For toxicity evaluation, cytokine production, mitochondrial function (MTT assay), reactive oxygen species generation (ROS), were assessed after 48 and 336 hours under control and exposed conditions. A simple, direct-contact assay was developed to evaluate the toxicity of anthropogenic particulate matter (PM), without removing it from high volume filter collections and exposing collected PM by direct contact with the human epithelial (A 549) cells in culture. ^ The cell viability data revealed that the manufactured nanomaterials exhibit cytotoxic response for the murine alveolar and human macrophage cell line, but in particular to the human epithelial cell line. Assay results for the direct-contact of filter-collected carbonaceous nanoparticulate, showed toxicity for all PM, but with various natural gas combustion PM being the most toxic. Light optical microscopy examination of affected human epithelial cells confirmed quantitative results. These nanoparticulate soots also produced the most reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the A 549 cell culture as well as along with the Fe 2 O 3, MWCNT-N, and black carbon (BC). Comparison of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content and concentration for the carbonaceous PM showed no PAH correlation with relative cell viability after 48 h. In addition, there was no correlation of cytotoxic response with specific surface area in the manufactured nanoparticulate materials. ^ In conclusion, the manufactured as well as the anthropogenic nanomaterials were observed to generate large amounts of ROS and cytokines. This study suggests that the mechanism of toxicity is likely due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Also, the comparative assessments presented, should be viewed as a precaution when considering the inhalation of the corresponding nanoparticulate materials in concentrations approaching those identified to be dangerous for recognized pathogens such as <b>silica,</b> <b>black</b> carbon, and asbestos. Humans should avoid breathing these nanoparticulate materials, although there are anthropogenic nanoparticulate materials such as MWCNT aggregates produced by natural gas stoves in homes which can provide low dose, long-term exposure prospects. Lastly, the implementation of nanomaterials or nanotechnology requires societal and ethical considerations as a principal part of design implementation, manufacturing, or life-cycle and re-cycle issues. ...|$|E

The current, voltage, and lifespan of batteries produced using different electrolyte additives, copper plate cathodes, and (usually) aluminium plate anodes were compared to identify the optimum design, components, and proportions to increase power output and longevity. Parameters examined include water/cement ratio, anode to cathode surface area ratio, electrode material, electrode spacing, {{and the effect of}} sand, aggregate, salts, carbon <b>black,</b> <b>silica</b> fume, and sodium silicate on the electrolyte. The results indicate that the greatest and longest lasting power can be achieved using high proportions of water, carbon black, plasticiser, salts, and silica fume in the electrolyte and using a magnesium anode and copper cathode. This cell produced an open-circuit voltage of 1. 55 [*]V, a resistor-loaded peak current over 4 [*]mA, maintaining over 1 [*]mA for 4 days, and a quasi steady current of 0. 59 [*]mA with a lifespan of over 21 days...|$|R
