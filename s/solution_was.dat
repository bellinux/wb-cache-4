5|$|An {{additional}} <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> to fit twin balanced rudders {{behind each}} inner shaft, {{in contrast to}} the single central rudder used on earlier ships. This greatly increased the effectiveness of the rudder and substantially decreased the turning circle of the Invincibles in comparison to earlier ships of their size.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe two matrix {{equations}} Xs+ATX−tA=In and Xs−ATX−tA=In are studied. Based on the fixed-point theory, {{the existence}} of the symmetric positive definite <b>solutions</b> <b>are</b> proved. Sensitivity analysis of the maximal <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> presented. Some elegant estimates of the positive definite <b>solutions</b> <b>are</b> obtained. Three iterative methods for computing the positive <b>solutions</b> <b>are</b> proposed...|$|R

5|$|A large {{broadcasting}} {{tower was}} {{needed in the}} Kantō region after NHK, Japan's public broadcasting station, began television broadcasting in 1953. Private broadcasting companies began operating {{in the months following}} the construction of NHK's own transmission tower. This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city. The proposed <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region. Furthermore, because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse.|$|E
5|$|After Germany surrendered, the Allies {{partitioned}} Berlin and Germany's remaining territory {{into four}} military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 {{to form the}} Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany. East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasize its stance that the two-state <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> an artificial and temporary status quo.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century progressed, the {{increasing}} need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues {{charged by the}} Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> to build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which {{was at the time}} the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began.|$|E

5|$|Bus chassis {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to {{the front end of}} the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located at the back of the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> found, VAT produced ten more rear-engined chassis called type VAT-5200.|$|E
5|$|Dowding's {{insistence on}} waiting for AI led {{directly}} to his dismissal on 24 November 1940. Many historians and writers, including Bowen, have suggested his dismissal was unwise, and that his identification of AI radar as the only practical <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> ultimately correct. While this may be true, the cat's eye force did result {{in a number of}} kills during the Blitz, although their effectiveness was limited and quickly overshadowed by the night fighter force. In May 1941 cat's eye fighters claimed 106 kills to the night fighters' 79, but flew twice as many sorties to do so.|$|E

40|$|Travelling-wave {{solutions}} of the Degasperis-Procesi equation <b>are</b> investigated. The <b>solutions</b> <b>are</b> {{characterized by}} two parameters.

5|$|In 1914 {{the college}} hired noted {{landscape}} architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. with bigger buildings like Olds and Agriculture Halls being built Olmsted faced {{the challenge of}} maintaining the informal character of campus while minimizing walking distance.

5|$|In 1942, {{trying to}} solve the problem of lack of a {{suitable}} mobile 152mm howitzer, the design bureau headed by F. F. Petrov started to work privately on a new howitzer, based on the carriage of the M-30 and the barrel of the M-10 (which was fitted with a muzzle brake in order to reduce the recoil and thus prevent damage to the lighter carriage). The approach allowed production to begin on the new howitzer almost immediately from the stockpile of parts for both earlier guns. Given the war situation and shortages of artillery, this <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> both elegant and expedient.|$|E

Another potential <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
