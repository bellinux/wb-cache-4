5|$|MacArthur now {{bypassed}} the Japanese forces at Hansa Bay and Wewak, and assaulted Hollandia and Aitape, which Willoughby {{reported to be}} lightly defended based on intelligence gathered in the Battle of Sio. MacArthur's bold thrust by going 600 miles up the coast had surprised and confused the Japanese high command, who had not anticipated that MacArthur would take <b>such</b> <b>risks.</b> Although {{they were out of}} range of the Fifth Air Force's fighters based in the Ramu Valley, the timing of the operation allowed the aircraft carriers of Nimitz's Pacific Fleet to provide air support. Though risky, the operation turned out to be another success. MacArthur caught the Japanese off balance and cut off Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi's Japanese XVIII Army in the Wewak area. Because the Japanese were not expecting an attack, the garrison was weak, and Allied casualties were correspondingly light. However, the terrain turned out to be less suitable for airbase development than first thought, forcing MacArthur to seek better locations further west. While bypassing Japanese forces had great tactical merit, it had the strategic drawback of tying up Allied troops to contain them. Moreover, Adachi was far from beaten, which he demonstrated in the Battle of Driniumor River.|$|E

25|$|After the nasolabial flap {{has been}} emplaced, the flap donor-site wound is sutured closed. For a wound of the lateral nasal wall {{that is less}} than 15mm wide, the flap donor-site can be closed primarily, with sutures. For a wound wider than 15mm—especially a wound that comprehends the alar lobule and the lateral wall of the nose—primary closure is not indicated, because such a wound closure imposes {{excessive}} stresses upon the skin flap, thereby risking either blanching (whitening) or distortion, or both. <b>Such</b> <b>risks</b> are avoided by advancing (moving) {{the skin of the}} cheek towards the nasofacial junction, where it is sutured to the deep tissues. Furthermore, a narrow wound, less than 1mm wide can be allowed to heal by secondary intention (autonomous re-epithelialisation).|$|E

500|$|Farlow {{and colleagues}} (1995) {{have argued that}} a Tyrannosaurus {{weighing}} [...] to [...] would have been critically or even fatally injured if it had fallen while moving quickly, since its torso would have slammed into the ground at a deceleration of 6g (six times the acceleration due to gravity, or about 60meters/s²) and its tiny arms could not have reduced the impact.

2500|$|Menopausal {{hormone therapy}} with {{replacement}} dosages of estrogens and progestogens {{has been associated}} with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events such as VTE. However, <b>such</b> <b>risks</b> have been found to vary {{depending on the type of}} estrogen or progestogen and the route of administration. The risk of VTE is increased by approximately 2-fold in women taking oral estrogen for menopausal hormone therapy. However, this research has not distinguished between CEEs and estradiol, and CEEs have been found to be more resistant to hepatic metabolism than estradiol and to increase clotting factors to a greater extent. In accordance, a recent case-control study found that oral CEEs were associated with a significantly greater increase in risk of cardiovascular events including venous thrombosis (2-fold) and myocardial infarction (2-fold) relative to oral estradiol. However, these findings need to be confirmed. In any case, another study found that oral CEEs were associated with an increase in risk of VTE but that oral esterified estrogens were not ( [...] = 1.65 and 0.92, respectively; [...] = 1.78 for the difference). In contrast to oral estrogens as a group, transdermal estradiol has not been found to increase the risk of VTE or other cardiovascular events.|$|E

[...] Yuwen initially suggested that Emperor Yang fight {{his way out of}} the siege, but Su opposed taking <b>such</b> <b>risks,</b> and eventually, under the advice of Emperor Yang's brother-in-law Xiao Yu, Emperor Yang sought aid from Ashina Duojishi's wife Princess Yicheng (the daughter of a Sui imperial clansman). [...] After Princess Yicheng falsely informed Ashina Duojishi that Tujue was under attack from the north, Ashina Duojishi lifted the siege. [...] With the northern empire under the effects of agrarian rebellions, Su subsequently advised Emperor Yang to return to the capital Chang'an, and Emperor Yang initially agreed. [...] However, Yuwen suggested going to the eastern capital Luoyang instead, and Emperor Yang went to Luoyang, and would never again go to Chang'an in his lifetime. [...] Subsequently, when Su was examining the proposed promotions to soldiers based on their contributions defending Yanmen against the siege, he reviewed them strictly and promoted few of them, a decision that Emperor Yang agreed with, which brought much dissension among the army ranks.|$|E
