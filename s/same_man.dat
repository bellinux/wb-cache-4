60|$|Another {{thing was}} done {{by some of the}} <b>same</b> <b>men</b> who framed the Constitution, and {{afterwards}} adopted as their own the act by the first Congress held under that Constitution, of which many of the framers were members, that prohibited the spread of slavery into Territories. Thus the <b>same</b> <b>men,</b> the framers of the Constitution, cut off the supply and prohibited the spread of slavery, and both acts show conclusively that they considered that the thing was wrong.|$|R
50|$|These {{groups may}} overlap, and the <b>same</b> <b>men</b> {{may serve as}} assault divers and work divers, such as the Australian Clearance Diving Branch (RAN).|$|R

60|$|The cheer followed--that was {{a matter}} of course; but it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these <b>same</b> <b>men</b> were {{plotting}} for our blood.|$|R
60|$|This <b>same</b> {{generation}} of <b>men,</b> and mostly the same individuals {{of the generation}} who declared this principle, who declared independence, who fought the war of the Revolution through, who afterward made the Constitution under which we still live--these <b>same</b> <b>men</b> passed the Ordinance of '87, declaring that slavery should never go to the Northwest Territory.|$|R
5|$|The Reverend Francis Willmore Dixon was {{the head}} pastor of Lansdowne Baptist Church in Bournemouth, England, and his youth pastor, Peter Culver, had become a Christian {{as a result of}} meeting Jenner on George Street on 2 September 1945. In 1952, at an All Nations Bible College event, Dixon and Culver heard Noel Stanton's Christian testimony, which {{included}} the episode in which Stanton had met Jenner.

5|$|When Macdonald {{returned}} to Nova Scotia in 1945, {{he was only}} 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald's leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives {{for the first time}} since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had trouble making decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, but because he was not well.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{the same}} year in which her husband's body was reburied, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Gill's story {{was reported in the}} Boston Herald twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 at exactly the moment that the sexton Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, ready to throw them away as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The <b>same</b> <b>man</b> who served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.|$|E

60|$|But {{yet it is}} hard to {{conceive}} that Socrates, the <b>same</b> individual <b>man,</b> should be two persons. To help us a little in this, we must consider what is meant by Socrates, or the <b>same</b> individual <b>MAN.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But {{when the}} <b>same</b> <b>men</b> (Ussher, Williams, Morton, &c.) saw that greater [...] things were aimed at, and episcopacy itself in danger, or their [...] {{grandeur}} and riches at least, {{most of them}} turned against the [...] Parliament.|$|R
5|$|Aurora {{debuted in}} Sleeping Beauty (1959) as the newborn only {{daughter}} of King Stefan and Queen Leah. Angered by not receiving {{an invitation to}} her christening, the princess is cursed by an evil fairy named Maleficent, who dooms her to die when she pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. However, one of three good fairies named Merryweather alters the curse so that Aurora will instead sleep until she is awoken by a kiss from her true love. Merryweather and the two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, take extra precautions by raising the princess in a secluded cottage under the alias Briar Rose {{to protect her from}} Maleficent until her birthday arrives. Several years later, a 16-year-old Aurora meets a handsome man in the forest. Unaware that he is actually a prince named Phillip, to whom she has been betrothed since infancy, the two fall in love and agree to meet again. However, the fairies finally reveal Aurora's true identity to her and thus forbid her from seeing him because they plan on returning the heartbroken princess to her parents. While alone at their castle, Aurora is hypnotized by Maleficent, who causes her to prick her finger and fulfill Merryweather's prophecy. She was then placed in the highest tower to sleep peacefully until the spell was broken. Meanwhile, Maleficent has captured Phillip, who the fairies release upon realizing that he is in fact the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> Aurora met in the forest earlier that day. Helping him defeat Maleficent, Aurora is successfully awoken by Phillip's kiss, and finally reunited with her parents.|$|E

25|$|The {{move was}} controversial, as the {{coalition}} parties denied their votes to the <b>same</b> <b>man</b> they had elected Chancellor {{a month before}} and whom they wanted to re-elect after the parliamentary election. However, this step was condoned by the German Federal Constitutional Court as a legal instrument, and was again applied by SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in 2005.|$|E
