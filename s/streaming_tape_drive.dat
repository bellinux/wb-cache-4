40|$|A tape {{subsystem}} {{consists of}} a controller and a tape drive. Tapes are used for backup, data interchange, and software distribution. The backup operation is addressed. During a backup operation, data is read from disk, processed in CPU, and then sent to tape. The processing speeds of a disk subsystem, CPU, and a tape subsystem {{are likely to be}} different. A powerful CPU can read data from a fast disk, process it, and supply the data to the tape subsystem at a faster rate than the tape subsystem can handle. On the other hand, a slow disk drive and a slow CPU {{may not be able to}} supply data fast enough to keep a tape drive busy all the time. The backup process may supply data to tape drive in bursts. Each burst may be followed by an idle period. Depending on the nature of the file distribution in the disk, the input stream to the tape subsystem may vary significantly during backup. To compensate for these differences and optimize the utilization of a tape subsystem, a cache or buffer is introduced in the tape controller. Most of the tape drives today are streaming tape drives. A <b>streaming</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> goes into reposition when there is no data from the controller. Once the drive goes into reposition, the controller can receive data, but it cannot supply data to the tape drive until the drive completes its reposition. A controller can also receive data from the host and send data to the tape drive at the same time. The relationship of cache size, host transfer rate, drive transfer rate, reposition, and ramp up times for optimal performance of the tape subsystem are investigated. Formulas developed will also show the advantages of cache watermarks to increase the streaming time of the tape drive, maximum loss due to insufficient cache, tradeoffs between cache and reposition times and the effectiveness of cache on a <b>streaming</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> due to idle times or interruptions due in host transfers. Several mathematical formulas are developed to predict the performance of the tape drive. Some examples are given illustrating the usefulness of these formulas. Finally, a summary and some conclusions are provided...|$|E

40|$|Data {{storage and}} {{transfer}} operations {{at a new}} image processing facility are described. The equipment includes high density digital magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> and specially designed controllers to provide an interface between the <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> and computerized image processing systems. The controller performs the functions necessary to convert the continuous serial data <b>stream</b> from the <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> to a word-parallel blocked data stream which then goes to the computer-based system. With regard to the tape packing density, 1. 8 times 10 to the tenth data bits are stored on a reel of one-inch tape. System components and their operation are surveyed, and studies on advanced storage techniques are summarized...|$|R
50|$|In early <b>tape</b> <b>drives,</b> non-continuous data {{transfer}} was normal and unavoidable. Computer processing power and amounts of available memory were usually insufficient {{to provide a}} constant <b>stream,</b> so <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> were typically designed for so called start-stop operation. Early drives used very large spools, which necessarily had high inertia and did not start and stop moving easily. To provide high start, stop, and seeking performance, several feet of loose tape was played out and pulled by a suction fan down into two deep open channels {{on either side of}} the tape head and capstans. The long thin loops of tape hanging in these vacuum columns had far less inertia than the two reels and could be rapidly started, stopped and repositioned. The large reels would occasionally move to take up written tape and play out more blank tape into the vacuum columns.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1993 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaHigh-performance {{telemetry}} systems traditionally store prime {{and processed}} data on disk drives {{attached to a}} host computer. Bandwidth performance of host minicomputer and disk drives {{limit the amount of}} data archived to aggregate rates of a few hundred kilobytes per second. Over the years, several approaches have been used to increase performance from pre-recorded analog tape, but real-time storage still required a large host and expensive proprietary parallel disk technology. The advent of distributed architecture system networks divorced the front-end telemetry processor from direct 'DMA' connections to the host. Today's technology moves data storage to the front end for the highest performance and outward to the network for less demanding archival rates. This paper explores several schemes and implementations for increased digital data archival performance in a distributed architecture Telemetry Ground Station. It goes on to discuss the variety of industry-standard devices and media available for storage at tens of megabytes per second on Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) to slower but much less expensive optical and <b>streaming</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> on both the front end and network computing resources.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 33) This report {{covers the}} design and development of a diagnostic test system for a <b>streaming</b> magnetic <b>tape</b> machine manufactured by Pertec Computer company. The <b>streaming</b> magnetic <b>tape</b> machine represents {{a new approach to}} recording in the field of tape storage. As the name implies, it was designed to accept a continuous stream of data instead of the conventional short bursts. The report outlines {{the design and}} development of a test system in three consecutive phases. 'Bottom up' design programming technique was incorporated in all three phases. 'Bottom up' design is an evolutionary process which initially encompasses primitive elements including initial specifications, basic program definitions and minimal hardware. As the system design progresses the primitive elements expand with the integration of further primitives to evolve into a final sophisticated system. The project includes writing the functional specifications and designing the test system software package. Associated tasks include the determination of the host computer requirements and the design of a high speed input/output driver {{as an integral part of}} the test system. This test system, as of September 1983, has been used successfully on the <b>streaming</b> magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> production line at Pertec...|$|R
