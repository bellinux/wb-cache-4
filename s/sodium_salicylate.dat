5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the bark of trees.

Aspirin was synthesised to replace the <b>sodium</b> <b>salicylate</b> derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and <b>sodium</b> <b>salicylate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose. NaCl {{has proven}} to be an {{effective}} bitterness inhibitor, but the reason remains unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the influence of a variety of cations and anions on the bitterness of selected oral pharmaceuticals and bitter taste stimuli: pseudoephedrine, ranitidine, acetaminophen, quinine, and urea. Method. Human psychophysical taste evaluation using a whole mouth exposure procedure was used. Results. The cations (all associated with the acetate anion) inhibited bitterness when mixed with pharmaceutical solutions to varying degrees. The sodium cation significantly (P < 0. 003) inhibited bitterness of the pharmaceuticals more than the other cations. The anions (all associated with the sodium cation) also inhibited bitterness to varying degrees. With the exception of salicylate, the glutamate and adenosine monophosphate anions significantly (P < 0. 001) inhibited bitterness of the pharmaceuticals more than the other anions. Also, there were several specific inhibitory interactions between ammonium, <b>sodium</b> and <b>salicylate</b> and certain pharmaceuticals. Conclusions. We conclude that sodium was the most successful cation and glutamate and AMP were the most successful anions at inhibiting bitterness. Structure forming and breaking properties of ions, as predicted by the Hofmeister series, and other physical-chemical ion properties failed to significantly predict bitterness inhibition. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{pathologic}} change and molecular regulation in cell proliferation and apoptosis of gastric mucosa in rats with chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), {{and evaluate the}} possible mechanisms. Methods: Rats were administered with 60 % alcohol or 2 % <b>salicylate</b> <b>sodium,</b> 20 mmol/L deoxycholate sodium and 0. 1 % ammonia water to establish chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) models. The gastric specimens were prepared for microscopic view with hematoxylin and eosin (H-E) and alcian blue (A-B) stain. The number of infiltrated inflammatory cells, {{the thickness of the}} mucosa gland layer (μm) and the number of gastric glands were calculated. The damage of barrier in mucosa with erosion or ulceration, and the thickness of mucin were examined by scanned electron microscope (SEM). The levels of PGE 2, EGF (epiderminal growth factor) and gastrin in the serum were measured with radioimmunoassay or ELISA method. The immunohistochemistry method was used to observe the number of G cells, the expression of protein of EGFR (EGF receptor), C-erbB- 2, p 53, p 16 and bcl- 2 in gastric tissue. Results: Under SEM observation, the gastric mucosa was diffused erosion or ulceration and the thickness of mucin was decreased. Compared with normal rats, the grade of inflammatory cell infiltration in CAG rats was elevated, whereas the thickness and number of gastric gland were significantly lower (P< 0. 05). Compared with normal level of (0. 61 ± 0. 28) μg/L, EGF in CAG (2. 24 ± 0. 83) μg/L was significantly higher (P< 0. 05). The levels of PGE 2 and gastrin in serum were significantly lower in CAG rats than that in normal rats (P< 0. 05). Immunohistochemistry detection showed that the number of G cell in antrum was lower in CAG group (P< 0. 05). Immuno-stain showed EGFR protein expression in the basal and bilateral membrane, and the cytoplasma in atrophic gastric gland, while negative expression was observed in normal gastric epithelial cells. Positive staining of p 53 and p 16 protein was localized in the nucleus of epithelial cells. The former was higher positively expressed in atrophic gland, while the later was higher positively stained in normal gastric tissue. bcl- 2 protein was positively stained in the cytoplasma in atrophic gastric gland, while very weakly stained in normal gastric tissue. Conclusion: The pathological findings in gastric gland accorded with the Houston diagnostic criteria of antrum-predominant CAG. CAG in rats was related with the damage of barrier in gastric mucosa and the misbalance of cell proliferation and apoptosis. There was high protein expression of oncogene, while inhibitor of suppressor gene in CAG rats indicated high trend of carcinogenesis...|$|R

In 1859 an Austrian chemist, Hugo von Gilm, obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid (which he called acetylierte Salicylsäure, acetylated salicylic acid) by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride. In 1869 Schröder, Prinzhorn and Kraut repeated both Gerhardt's (from <b>sodium</b> <b>salicylate)</b> and von Gilm's (from salicylic acid) syntheses and concluded that both reactions gave the same compound—acetylsalicylic acid.
