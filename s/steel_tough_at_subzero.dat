40|$|Psychrotolerance as an {{adaptation}} to survival in extreme environments is widespread among {{many of the}} mesophilic microorganisms. Red-ox potential, pH and salinity could significantly alter the features of ecosystems by providing liquid water <b>at</b> <b>subzero</b> temperatures. Furthermore, organisms can respond to temperature changes by several known mechanisms, including changing the conformation capacities of constitutional proteins or by the synthesis of mucopolysaccharides around the cell wall and membrane.

40|$|Deuterium NMR {{relaxation}} and intensity {{measurements of the}} 2 H-labeled H 2 O/dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine bilayer were performed to understand the molecular origin of the freezing event of phospholipid headgroup and the structure and dynamics of unfrozen water molecules in the interbilayer space <b>at</b> <b>subzero</b> temperatures. The results suggest that about one to two water molecules associated with the phosphate group freeze during the freezing event of phospholipid headgroups, whereas about five to six waters near the trimethylammonium group behave as a water cluster and remain unfrozen at temperatures as low as - 70 degrees C. In addition, temperature-dependent T 1 and T 2 relaxation times suggest that dynamic coupling occurs not only between the phosphate group and its bound water, but also between the methyl group and the adjacent water molecules. Based on these observations, the primary hydration shell of phosphatidylcholine headgroup <b>at</b> <b>subzero</b> temperatures is suggested to consist of two distinct regions: a clathrate-like water cluster, most likely a water pentamer, near the hydrophobic methyl group, and hydration water molecules associated with the phosphate group...|$|R

40|$|Although {{biogeochemical}} models {{designed to}} simulate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in high-latitude ecosystems incorporate extracellular parameters, molecular and biochemical adaptations of microorganisms to freezing remain unclear. This knowledge gap hampers estimations of the C balance and ecosystem feedback in high-latitude regions. To analyze microbial metabolism <b>at</b> <b>subzero</b> temperatures, soils were incubated with isotopomers of position-specifically 13 C-labeled glucose at three temperatures: + 5 (control), - 5, and - 20 °C. 13 C was quantified in CO 2, bulk soil, microbial biomass, and {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) after 1, 3, and 10 days and also after 30 days for samples at - 20 °C. Compared to + 5 °C, CO 2 decreased 3 - and 10 -fold at - 5 and - 20 °C, respectively. High 13 C recovery in CO 2 from the C- 1 position indicates dominance of the pentose phosphate pathway at + 5 °C. In contrast, increased oxidation of the C- 4 position <b>at</b> <b>subzero</b> temperatures implies a switch to glycolysis. A threefold higher 13 C recovery in microbial biomass at - 5 than + 5 °C points to synthesis of intracellular compounds such as glycerol and ethanol in response to freezing. Less than 0. 4 % of 13 C was recovered in DOC after 1 day, demonstrating complete glucose uptake by microorganisms even at - 20 °C. Consequently, we attribute the fivefold higher extracellular 13 C in soil than in microbial biomass to secreted antifreeze compounds. This suggests that with decreasing temperature, intracellular antifreeze protection is complemented by extracellular mechanisms to avoid cellular damage by crystallizing water. The knowledge of sustained metabolism <b>at</b> <b>subzero</b> temperatures {{will not only be}} useful for modeling global C dynamics in ecosystems with periodically or permanently frozen soils, but will also be important in understanding and controlling the adaptive mechanisms of food spoilage organisms...|$|R

Methods developed to hydrate GCLs to specific water contents (60 %, 90 %, 120 %) and subject them to subzero temperatures without the additional uptake of water are described. Results indicate {{that there are two}} main mechanisms that affect the {{hydraulic conductivity}} of Jet Fuel A- 1. For a constant bulk void ratio, as the water content increases, the hydraulic conductivity with respect to Jet Fuel A- 1 decreases. Similarly, for a constant water content, as bulk void ratio decreases, the hydraulic conductivity with respect to Jet Fuel A- 1 decreases.

40|$|The most claimed {{advantage}} of high-pressure food processing {{as compared to}} thermal processing is that pressure acts instantaneously and uniformly through a mass of food independently of its size, shape or composition. Nevertheless, thermal gradients are established in the products after compression and cause inhomogeneities in the pursued pressure effect. Modelling heat transfer in high-pressure food processes can be a useful tool to homogenise and optimise these treatments. The main difficulty {{is the lack of}} appropriate thermophysical properties of the processed materials under pressure. When modelling high-pressure processes <b>at</b> <b>subzero</b> temperatures, pressure/temperature phase transition data and latent heat are also needed. Those for water are known, but there is a total lack for those corresponding to components relevant to foods.
