Most are entirely surrounded by a <b>sheath,</b> but in some the <b>sheath</b> is open. The prisms are slightly curved toward the outer surface of the tooth. Between the prisms, and oriented at an angle of about 45° to them, are crystals of interprismatic material. On average, the prisms are 6.57μm apart, so that there are about 27,247 per mm2.|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} {{mechanisms of}} starch degradation in rice leaf <b>sheaths</b> at the post-heading stage, we investigated {{the function of}} OsBAM 2 and OsBAM 3, which encode plastid-targeted active β-amylase isoforms, in starch remobilization in leaf <b>sheaths.</b> The starch content in the second leaf <b>sheaths</b> below the flag leaf (the third leaf <b>sheaths)</b> peaked at the flag leaf emergence stage and gradually decreased until 15  days after heading. The mRNA levels of OsBAM 2 and OsBAM 3 in the third leaf <b>sheaths</b> increased from the flag leaf emergence stage to the heading stage when the starch content began to decrease. However, these mRNA levels did not always remain high during post-heading. Overexpression of OsBAM 2 or OsBAM 3 markedly repressed starch accumulation in the third leaf <b>sheaths,</b> showing that OsBAM 2 and OsBAM 3 function in starch degradation in rice leaf <b>sheaths.</b> In contrast, {{no significant differences in}} starch content in the third leaf <b>sheaths</b> were detected between knockdown plants of OsBAM 2 or OsBAM 3 and non-transgenic wild-type plants. Our results suggest that reduced expression of the individual genes, OsBAM 2 or OsBAM 3, does not result in excess accumulation of starch in the leaf <b>sheaths,</b> probably because of the complementary function of another gene or the action of other genes encoding starch-degrading...|$|R

5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny <b>sheath</b> in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the <b>sheath</b> would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering. A 2015 study of the shapes and sizes of Hespersaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females.|$|E
40|$|An ultrastructural and cytochemical {{investigation}} {{of the development of}} Rigidoporus lignosus, a white-rot fungus inoculated into wood blocks, was carried out to gain better insight into the structure and role of the extracellular <b>sheaths</b> produced by this fungus during wood degradation. Fungal <b>sheaths</b> had a dense or loose fibrillar appearance and were differentiated from the fungal cell wall early after wood inoculation. Close association between extracellular fibrils and wood cell walls was observed at both early and advanced stages of wood alteration. Fungal <b>sheaths</b> were often seen deep in host cell walls, sometimes enclosing residual wood fragments. Specific gold probes were used to investigate the chemical nature of R. lignosus <b>sheaths.</b> While labeling of chitin, pectin, β- 1, 4 - and β- 1, 3 -glucans, β-glucosides, galactosamine, mannose, sialic acid, RNA, fucose, and fimbrial proteins over fungal <b>sheaths</b> did not succeed, galactose residues and laccase (a fungal phenoloxidase) were found to be present. The positive reaction of <b>sheaths</b> with the PATAg test indicates that polysaccharides such as β- 1, 6 -glucans are important components. Our data suggest that extracellular <b>sheaths</b> produced by R. lignosus during host cell colonization {{play an important role in}} wood degradation. Transportation of lignin-degrading enzymes by extracellular fibrils indicates that alteration of plant polymers may occur within fungal <b>sheaths.</b> It is also proposed that R. lignosus <b>sheaths</b> may be involved in recognition mechanisms in fungal cell-wood surface interactions...|$|R
40|$|Endoscopic <b>sheaths</b> {{covering}} the laryngoscope {{are advised to}} prevent cross contamination, but might hamper visualization {{as the most important}} tool in the diagnostic approach of laryngeal disease. We evaluated whether endoscopic <b>sheaths</b> change image quality and diagnostic accuracy of flexible distal chip laryngoscopy (DCL) and flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FOL). Twelve healthy volunteers underwent a flexible laryngoscopy using a distal chip and a fiberoptic laryngoscope with and without endoscopic <b>sheaths,</b> and in this way 48 images were collected. To determine diagnostic accuracy, the 48 images were mixed with images of 40 patients. All images were randomly shown to four experts in the field of laryngology and head and neck oncology. Observers were asked to validate image quality, choose a diagnosis, and express their confidence level of that diagnosis. Image quality was validated better in DCL as compared to FOL (p < 0. 05) both with or without endoscopic <b>sheaths.</b> Endoscopic <b>sheaths</b> worsened image quality in DCL (p < 0. 05) but not in FOL. No differences were observed between DCL and FOL with or without endoscopic <b>sheaths</b> in diagnostic accuracy (79 - 89 %). Confidence levels (7. 7 - 8. 1) were comparable in DCL and FOL and not influenced by endoscopic <b>sheaths.</b> Image quality in DCL is superior to FOL, but significantly hampered by the use of endoscopic <b>sheaths.</b> In FOL the image quality is already low and not further diminished by endoscopic <b>sheaths...</b>|$|R

5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve <b>sheath</b> fenestration.|$|E
5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always {{ensures that the}} external <b>sheath</b> on the plug makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle before {{any of the four}} connectors within make electrical contact. The external metallic <b>sheath</b> is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for electrically safe hot-swapping.|$|E
5000|$|Functionally {{equivalent}} myelin-like <b>sheaths</b> {{are found}} in several invertebrate taxa including Oligochaete, Penaeid, Palaemonid, and Calanoids. These myelin-like <b>sheaths</b> share several structural features with the <b>sheaths</b> found in vertebrates including multiplicity of membranes, condensation of membrane, and nodes. However, the nodes in vertebrates are annular; i.e., they encircle the axon. In contrast, nodes found in the <b>sheaths</b> of invertebrates are either annular or fenestrated; i.e., they are restricted to [...] "spots." [...] It is notable that the fastest recorded conduction speed (across both vertebrates and invertebrates) {{is found in the}} ensheathed axons of the Kuruma shrimp, an invertebrate.|$|R
40|$|Similarities in {{structural}} {{organization of}} the culm in Poaceae, Juncaceae, and Cyperaceae such as leaf <b>sheaths</b> {{and the presence of}} intercalary meristems at every node suggest the same mechanical properties and, accordingly, the same functionality. Meristems are zones of tissue formation, which constitute areas of weakness along the entire culm and provide the basis for rapid shoot elongation. Leaf <b>sheaths</b> clasp the culm preventing the shoot from breaking, ensuring the rigidity to grow erectly and to avoid damage of the meristematic tissue. The mechanical influence of leaf <b>sheaths</b> was investigated in members of Poaceae, Juncaceae, and Cyperaceae in the flowering stage. Mechanical properties of Poa araratica, Bromus erectus, Arrhenatherum elatius (Poaceae), Luzula nivea (Juncaceae), and Carex arctata (Cyperaceae) were determined in three-point bending before and after the removal of leaf <b>sheaths.</b> The presence of leaf <b>sheaths</b> results in smoothing the distribution of flexural rigidity and therefore avoids stress peaks. The achieved maxima of relative contribution of leaf <b>sheaths</b> to entire flexural rigidity ranged from 55 % up to 81 % for Poaceae, 72 % for C. arctata, and 40 % for L. nivea. Across the investigated families, the mechanical role of leaf <b>sheaths</b> could be verified as essential for culm stability during development and beyond...|$|R

5|$|The nerve {{dysfunction}} in Guillain–Barré {{syndrome is}} caused by an immune attack on the nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system and their support structures. The nerve cells have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the neuromuscular junction where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a <b>sheath</b> of Schwann cells that contain myelin. Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain–Barré syndrome feature different types of immune attack. The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the myelin <b>sheath</b> by white blood cells (T lymphocytes and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation {{of a group of}} blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant is mediated by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to assess the {{relevance}} and the potential of Posidonia oceanica as a tracer of past mercury contamination. Shoots were collected on two sites, an impacted site, Rosignano (Tuscany, Italy), and a pristine site, Tonnara (Corsica, France). Lepidochronology was used to measure mercury concentrations in living <b>sheaths</b> and in the corresponding dead <b>sheaths.</b> The results show that there is an overestimation of mercury concentrations in dead <b>sheaths</b> (because of the degradation of this tissue due to its ageing), overestimation which stabilizes itself from the third lepidochronological year onwards (trend significant only for Rosignano). Thus, it is possible to estimate previous mercury concentrations and to date a contamination, by measuring mercury concentration in the dead <b>sheaths</b> of a given lepidochronological year and by taking into account the degradation of the <b>sheaths.</b> Therefore, Posidonia oceanica can be used to reconstruct the evolution of the past mercury contaminatio...|$|R

It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective <b>sheath</b> for underwater cables.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. One row (row A; possibly the lingual one) includes four cusps, the other (row B) includes at least two, but is damaged. In row A, {{there are three}} ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending {{from the tip of}} the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three ridges, of which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and may represent the same tooth position as 249, though it would come from {{the opposite side of the}} mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The enamel prisms are straight, small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica, and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates.
