By mid-December, when southern hemisphere summer temperatures are favorable for the mosquito vector, the incidence began to rise dramatically into the first two months of 2006. The number of reported cases was thought to be underestimated. The French government sent several hundred troops to help eradicate mosquitoes. Although confirmed cases were much lower, some estimates based on extrapolations from the number detected by sentinel physicians suggested that as many as 110,000 of Réunion's population of 800,000 people may have been infected.

50|$|Clouds {{have also}} been found over the south polar region. While {{typically}} covering 1% of Titan's disk, outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands {{to as much as}} 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the Titanean summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is {{complicated by the fact that}} cloud formation has been observed not only post-summer solstice but also at mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. There had been summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs the moon's motion, tilted the northern hemisphere towards the Sun. When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.Research models that match well with observations suggest that clouds on Titan cluster at preferred coordinates and that cloud cover varies by distance from the surface on different parts of the satellite. In the polar regions (above 60 degrees latitude), widespread and permanent ethane clouds appear in and above the troposphere; at lower latitudes, mainly methane clouds are found between 15 and 18 km, and are more sporadic and localized. In the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> frequent, thick but sporadic methane clouds seem to cluster around 40°.|$|E
50|$|The {{first term}} in (3) {{on the right}} is the global mean of the exospheric {{temperature}} (of the order of 1000 K). The second term P20 represents the heat surplus at lower latitudes and a corresponding heat deficit at higher latitudes (Fig. 2a). A thermal wind system develops with wind toward the poles in the upper level and wind away from the poles in the lower level. The coefficient ΔT20 ≈ 0.004 is small because Joule heating in the aurora regions compensates that heat surplus even during quiet magnetospheric conditions. During disturbed conditions, however, that term becomes dominant, changing sign so that now heat surplus is transported from the poles to the equator. The third term (with P10 = sin φ) represents heat surplus on the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere</b> and is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the summer into the winter hemisphere (Fig. 2b). Its relative amplitude is of the order ΔT10 ≃ 0.13. The fourth term (with P11(φ) = cos φ) is the dominant diurnal wave (the tidal mode (1,−2)). It is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the daytime hemisphere into the nighttime hemisphere (Fig. 2d). Its relative amplitude is ΔT11≃ 0.15, thus on the order of 150 K. Additional terms (e.g., semiannual, semidiurnal terms and higher order terms) must be added to eq.(3). However, they are of minor importance. Corresponding sums can be developed for density, pressure, and the various gas constituents.|$|E

30|$|The {{behavior}} of the 5 -day and 16 -day waves in the mesopause region is examined by using a general circulation model. The results are as follows. The 5 -day wave is largely unaffected by the zonal mean zonal wind distribution, and the symmetric structure about the equator is clearly seen in the mesopause region. The amplitude of the 16 -day wave in the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of the stratosphere is small. However, above the upper mesosphere, the 16 -day wave appears {{not only in the}} winter hemisphere but also in the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> The penetration of the 16 -day wave from the winter hemisphere to the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere</b> occurs near the mesopause region. The 16 -day wave is mainly excited by heating due to the moist convection in the troposphere, and the vertical penetration into the middle atmosphere occurs. Furthermore, a correlation between the geomagnetic variation and the wind variation associated with the 5 -day and 16 -day waves is discussed.|$|E
30|$|Another {{interesting}} feature {{observed during}} this storm is the well-pronounced hemispheric asymmetry in the nighttime Ne and VTEC enhancement in both ~ 23 and 01 LT sectors. The asymmetry is usually {{explained by the}} seasonal impact due to the seasonal changes in the thermospheric circulation. It is known that in summer the daytime background (solar-induced) circulation is directed equatorwards, and it is poleward in the winter hemisphere (e.g., Fuller-Rowell et al. 1996; Fuller-Rowell 2011). With the onset of a geomagnetic storm, the high-latitude heating drives a global wind surge from both polar regions toward the equator. Consequently, in the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere</b> the storm-time daytime circulation coincides with the background one, and it opposes in the winter hemisphere. The storm-time changes in the global circulation lead {{to changes in the}} neutral composition and the expansion of the neutral composition bulge to low latitudes (e.g., Fuller-Rowell 2011). On the nightside, the background and the storm-induced circulations are both directed equatorward, which leads {{to the fact that the}} composition disturbance can reach much lower latitudes. These storm-time alterations are known to often provoke ionospheric positive storms in the winter hemisphere, whereas negative storms occur more often in the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere</b> (e.g., Prölss 1995; Danilov 2013). However, the June 2015 storm occurred just during the summer solstice time, but we observed stronger effect in the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> which is contrary to the commonly observed features. One can notice in Figs.  2, 3, and 4 that the quiet-time levels also show the hemispheric asymmetry, with slightly larger VTEC and Ne values in the NH (i.e., the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere)</b> than in the SH (i.e., the winter hemisphere). This may confirm the seasonal feature of the observed asymmetry.|$|E
40|$|We used bottomside ground {{observations}} and topside sounding {{data from the}} Intercosmos- 19 satellite to study a Travelling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) that occurred in response to Large-Scale Internal Gravity Wave (LSIGW) propagation during a substorm on November 30, 1979. We built a global scheme for the wavelike ionospheric variations during this medium substorm (AEmax 800 nT). The area where the TID was observed looks like a wedge since it covers the nighttime hours at subauroral latitudes but contracts to a 02 h local sector at low latitudes. The ionospheric response is strongly asymmetric because the wedge area and the TID amplitude are larger in the winter hemisphere than in the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> Clear evidence was obtained indicating that the more powerful TID from the Northern (winter) hemisphere propagated across the equator into the low latitude Southern (<b>summer)</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> Intercosmos- 19 observations show that the disturbance covers the entire thickness of the topside ionosphere, from hmF 2 up to at least the 1000 km satellite altitude at post-midnight local times. F-layer lifting reached 200 km, Ne increases in the topside ionosphere by up to a factor of 1. 9 and variations in NmF 2 of both signs were observed. Assumptions are made concerning {{the reason for the}} IGW effect at high altitudes in the topside ionosphere. The relationship between TID parameters and source characteristics determined from a global network of magnetometers are studied. The role of the dayside cusp in the generation of the TID in the daytime ionosphere is discussed. The magnetospheric electric field effects are distinguished from IGW effects.

40|$|An interhemispheric plasma {{transport}} {{model has been}} used to study the flow characteristics of H+, He+, and O+ along closed geomagnetic field lines for solstice conditions at noon local time. The calculations were carried out for the flux tube that passes through Millstone Hill. Both symmetric and asymmetric neutral winds in the conjugate ionospheres were considered. Initially, the flux tube content was partially depleted, and the subsequent refilling was studied until a steady state flow was established between the winter and summer hemispheres. The main conclusion to be drawn from this study is that H+-He+ counterstreaming can be expected along a large segment of a plasmaspheric flux tube at solstice. For both symmetric and asymmetric wind patterns, the He+ flow is from the winter to the summer ionosphere not only in the steady state, but during flux tube refilling owing to the winter helium bulge and the depletion of N 2. For symmetric poleward neutral winds in both hemispheres, H+ and O+ flow up from the conjugate ionospheres during flux tube refilling, which leads to large-scale H+-He+ counterstreaming in the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> In the steady state, both H+ and He+ flow from the winter to the summer ionosphere and no light-ion counterstreaming occurs. When the neutral wind in the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere</b> is set to zero, which acts to reduce the F region ‘winter anomaly,’ H+-He+ counterstreaming occurs in the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere</b> during refilling and along the entire flux tube in the steady state.

40|$|Observational {{studies have}} shown that the Asian-Australasian monsoon system {{exhibits}} variability over a wide-range of space and time scales. These variations range from intraseasonal (20 – 40 days), annual, biennial (about 2 years), longer term interannual (3 – 5 years) and interdecadal. Despite this range of variability, the South Asian monsoon (at least as described by Indian precipitation) exhibits a smaller range of variability during its summer pluvial phase than variability exhibited in other climate systems of the tropics. For example, drought or flood rarely extend to multiple years, with rainfall oscillating biennially from slightly above average to slightly below average precipitation. We argue that variability of the monsoon is regulated by negative feedbacks between the ocean and the atmosphere. The annual cycle of the heat balance of the Indian Ocean is such that there is an ocean heat transport from the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere</b> from the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere</b> resulting principally from wind-driven Ekman transport.

40|$|Potential {{influence}} of a midlatitude SST frontal zone on the zonally symmetric variability in the extratropical atmosphere is assessed through idealized aqua-planet experiments with a general circulation model. In one experiment with a midlatitude frontal SST gradient as sharp as that observed in the Southwestern Indian Ocean, the annular mode is well reproduced in the model <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> As actually observed in the Southern Hemisphere, the model annular mode represents a north-south seesaw in westerly wind speed around the climatological joint axes of a midlatitude westerly jet and storm track, with intensified (weakened) midlatitude westerlies under the enhanced (reduced) eddy momentum transport. This essential feature of the annular mode is retained also over the winter hemisphere, although its structure is somewhat distorted owing to the seasonal intensification of a subtropical jet (STJ). In the other experiment, elimination of the frontal SST gradient results in an equatorward shift of westerly wind anomalies associated with the annular mode in the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> in step with a shift of the mean joint axes of the jet and storm track.

40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{effect of}} an {{artificial}} lateral boundary (the wall) at the Equator on a simulated atmospheric circulation was studied numerically. By comparing the solutions of two 30 -day integrations {{of a global}} model with and without the wall, {{we found that the}} discrepancies of the wind and temperature at the middle and high latitudes became appreciable at approximately 8 days and serious at approximately 12 days. This suggests that the wall (hemispheric) model may be applied as a forecast model for a maximum of about 12 days. The disagreement in the wind between the two cases starts just below the tropo-pause level at the Equator and spreads toward the higher latitudes. Eventually, the middle latitudes respond to this equatorial effect, and the disagreement is amplified to the natural variability level. Insertion of the wall considerably increases the condensation of water vapor in the Tropics for the winter hemisphere; the reverse is true for the <b>summer</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> The result is that, in the winter hemisphere, the tropical troposphere and the stratosphere are cooler and the higher latitude troposphere is warmer in the wall case than in the control case.
