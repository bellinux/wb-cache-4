40|$|A class II Tn 3 -type transposable element, {{designated}} Tn 5393 {{and located}} on plasmid pEa 34 from streptomycin-resistant strain CA 11 of Erwinia amylovora, was identified by {{its ability to}} move from pEa 34 to different sites in plasmids pGEM 3 Zf(+) and pUCD 800. Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that Tn 5393 consists of 6, 705 bp with 81 -bp terminal inverted repeats and generates 5 -bp duplications of the target DNA following insertion. Tn 5393 contains open reading frames that encode a putative transposase (tnpA) and resolvase (tnpR) of 961 and 181 amino acids, respectively. The two open reading frames are separated by a putative recombination site (res) consisting of 194 bp. Two streptomycin resistance genes, <b>strA</b> and <b>strB,</b> were identified {{on the basis of}} their DNA sequence homology to streptomycin resistance genes in plasmid RSF 1010. StrA is separated from tnpR by a 1. 2 -kb insertion element designated IS 1133. The tnpA-res-tnpR region of Tn 5393 was detected in Pseudomonas syringae pv. papulans Psp 36 and in many other gram-negative bacteria harboring <b>strA</b> and <b>strB.</b> Except for some strains of Erwinia herbicola, these other gram-negative bacteria lacked insertion sequence IS 1133. The prevalence of <b>strA</b> and <b>strB</b> could be accounted for by transposition of Tn 5393 to conjugative plasmids that are then disseminated widely among gram-negative bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the structure of}} the resistance region in an IncHI 1 plasmid conferring resistance to multiple antibiotics, including gentamicin, recovered from a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolate from a horse. Methods: Plasmids were recovered by conjugation. The plasmid type, resistance genes and their context were identified by PCR, cloning, hybridization and DNA sequencing. The sequence was compared using bioinformatic tools with available resistance region sequences. Results: In isolate SRC 27, an IncI 1 plasmid, pSRC 27 -I, conferred streptomycin resistance via the <b>strA</b> and <b>strB</b> genes contained within Tn 5393 a. An IncHI 1 plasmid, pSRC 27 -H, was found to carry the aacC 2 gentamicin re-sistance gene within a 34. 6 kb multiple antibiotic resistance region that included nine further antibiotic resist-ance genes, aadA 2, aphA 1, blaTEM, catA 1, dfrA 12, <b>strA</b> and <b>strB,</b> sul 2 and tetA(B), conferring resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin, kanamycin and neomycin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, strep...|$|R
30|$|Non-pathogenic {{environmental}} bacteria such as Lactococcus chungangensis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Chryseobacterium lactis, Aeromonas allosaccharophila and Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana {{showed the}} prevalence of <b>strA,</b> <b>strB,</b> aacA 4, IntI and 3 ′-CS genes in the various STM exposures (0 – 50  mg L− 1) and subsequently obtained STM resistance (>  256  µg mL− 1) in the corresponding STM exposures. These results reveal that long-term increasing doses of STM can lead to non-pathogenic bacteria becoming perfect reservoirs of ARGs, which they might transfer to another bacterium via gene transfer, resulting in an abundance of MDR bacteria in WWTPs (Rizzo et al. 2013; Balcazar et al. 2015; Wellington et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|We sequenced a novel conjugative multidrug {{resistance}} IncF plasmid, p 42 - 2, isolated from Escherichia coli strain 42 - 2, previously identified in China. p 42 - 2 is 106, 886 bp long, {{composed of a}} typical IncFII-type backbone (∼ 54 kb) and one distinct acquired DNA region spanning ∼ 53 kb, harboring 12 antibiotic resistance genes [blaCTX-M- 55, oqxA, oqxB, fosA 3, floR, tetA(A), tetA(R), <b>strA,</b> <b>strB,</b> sul 2, aph(3 ′) -II, and ΔblaTEM- 1]. The spread of these {{multidrug resistance}} determinants on the same plasmid is of great concern and, because of coresistance to antibiotics from different classes, is therapeutically challenging...|$|E
30|$|At {{the same}} time, Aeromonas allosaccharophila and Aeromonas veronii were not {{resistant}} to STM (<  8  µg mL− 1) {{and did not}} contain any ARGs naturally (0  mg L− 1). Subsequently, however, they became resistant to STM and ARGs were found (aacA 4, <b>strA,</b> <b>strB,</b> aadA, 3 ′-CS, and Int 1) in the corresponding STM exposures. This result indicates that STM resistance was promoted by stepwise increased STM concentrations, which might have occurred by the horizontal transfer of plasmids or transposons containing ARGs (Lekunberri et al. 2017; Van Overbeek et al. 2002; Rizzo et al. 2013; Czekalski et al. 2012). Interestingly, Bacillus anthracis was present and dominant in all six STM exposures (0 – 50  mg L− 1), but the MIC results showed high sensitivity to STM (<  6  µg mL− 1) {{and they were not}} grown in the growth agar media with low added STM dose (0.1  mg L− 1). Surprisingly, this bacterial strain exhibited <b>strA,</b> <b>strB,</b> aadA, aacA 4, Int 1 and 3 ′-CS as confirmed by conventional PCR. Bacillus anthracis is a spore-forming bacteria and the causative agent of anthrax disease. In general, spores of Bacillus sp. are dormant and resistant to unfavorable conditions such as extreme temperature, radiation, and antibiotics (Tetz et al. 2016; Severson et al. 2009; Nicholson et al. 2000). Previous findings revealed that bacterial spores can maintain their complete genome and antibiotic resistance genes might be involved in the horizontal transfer of ARGs to other bacterial species (Tetz and Tetz 2017; Barra-Carrasco et al. 2014). Furthermore, some ARGs are not expressed in the bacterial spores, but {{will be part of the}} resistome. In our study, we believed that spores might be produced under low STM exposure (0.1  mg L− 1) and persist until the high STM exposure (>  25  mg L− 1). However, further studies are needed to determine, whether the spores of B. anthracis play an important role in delivering STM resistance.|$|E
40|$|Actinomycetes were {{isolated}} from soybean rhizosphere soil collected as two field sites in Brazil. All the isolates {{were identified as}} Streptomyces species and were screened for streptomycin production {{and the presence of}} two genes, <b>strA</b> and <b>strB</b> 1, known to be involved in streptomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus. Antibiotic resistance profiles were determined for 53 isolates from cultivated and uncultivated sites, and approximately half the strains were streptomycin resistance. Clustering by the unweighted pair group method with averages indicated the presence of two major clusters, with the majority of resistant strains from cultivated sites being placed in cluster 1. Only representatives from this cluster contained strA. Streptomycetes containing <b>strA</b> and <b>strB</b> 1 were phenotypically diverse, and only half could be assigned to known species. Sequence comparison of 16 S rRNA and trpBA (tryptophan synthetase) genes revealed that streptomycin- producing streptomycetes were phylogenetically diverse. It appeared that a population of streptomycetes had colonized the rhizosphere and that a proportion of these were capable of streptomycin production...|$|R
30|$|It is {{interesting}} that the responses of every culturable wastewater bacterial strain to the stepwise increasing doses of STM were variable and unambiguous. Chryseobacterium lactis and Comamonas testosteroni naturally (0  mg L− 1) possessed STM resistance genes (<b>strA</b> and <b>strB)</b> and a class I integron gene (3 ′-CS) (Table  3; Additional file 1 : Table S 7), and showed high MIC values against STM (>  256  µg mL− 1) in the exposure without STM (Additional file 1 : Table S 5). Meanwhile, Lactococcus chungangensis, Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana and Lactococcus raffinolactis also naturally (0  mg L− 1) possessed STM resistance genes (<b>strA</b> and <b>strB)</b> and an integron gene (3 ′-CS), but showed low MIC values against STM (<  6  µg mL− 1) under the exposure without STM. Subsequently, however the above isolates obtained STM resistance under the lower doses of STM (0.1, 1, or 5  mg L− 1). A similar previous observation suggested that the distribution of streptomycin MICs was influenced and controlled by STM resistance genes in E. coli (Sunde and Norstrom 2005). Furthermore, parameters such {{as the presence of}} selected gene cassettes and integron genes located on low copy number plasmids and their placement in 3 ′-conserved segments might lead to variable STM MIC results (Bryan 1984; Levesque 1994). We believe that the above parameters might be controlled by the threshold concentrations of selected antibiotics, which mostly fall in minimal dose ranges.|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} {{streptomycin}} (STM) {{on the development}} of antibiotic resistance in an aerobic-biofilm reactor was explored by stepwise increases in STM doses (0 – 50  mg L− 1), over a period of 618  days. Totally 191 bacterial isolates affiliated with 90 different species were harvested from the reactor exposed to six STM exposures. Gammaproteobacteria (20 – 31.8 %), Bacilli (20 – 35.7 %), Betaproteobacteria (4.5 – 21 %) and Actinobacteria (0 – 18.2 %) were dominant, and their diversity was not affected over the whole period. Thirteen dominant isolates from each STM exposures (78 isolates) were applied to determine their resistance prevalence against eight classes of antibiotics. Increased STM resistance (53.8 – 69.2 %) and multi-drug resistance (MDR) (46.2 – 61.5 %) were observed in the STM exposures (0.1 – 50  mg L− 1), compared to exposure without STM (15.3 and 0 %, respectively). Based on their variable minimum inhibitory concentration results, 40 differentiated isolates from various STM exposures were selected to check the prevalence of nine aminoglycoside resistance genes (aac(3)-II, aacA 4, aadA, aadB, aadE, aphA 1, aphA 2, <b>strA</b> and <b>strB)</b> and two class I integron genes (3 ′-CS and IntI). STM resistance genes (aadA, <b>strA</b> and <b>strB),</b> a non-STM resistance gene (aacA 4) and integron genes (3 ′-CS and Int 1) were distributed widely in all STM exposures, compared to the exposure without STM. This new culture-based stepwise increasing antibiotic approach reveals that biological systems treating wastewater with lower STM dose (0.1  mg L− 1) could lead to notably increased levels of STM resistance, MDR, and resistant gene determinants, which were sustainable even under higher STM doses (>  25  mg L− 1).|$|R

The qPCR were reproducible and consistent whether the DNA was extracted directly from bacteria, plant and soil samples inoculated with bacteria or soil samples prior to and after manure slurry treatment. The genes most frequently identified in soils pre- and post-slurry treatment were strB, aadA, tetB and tetM. All genes tested were detected in soils pre-slurry treatment, {{and a decrease in}} relative concentrations of tetB and the streptomycin resistance genes was observed in samples taken post-slurry treatment.

30|$|In this study, {{most of the}} STM {{resistant}} strains {{from the}} reactor treated with various doses of STM (0 – 50  mg L− 1) consisted of a 3 ′ conserved segment (3 ′-CS) of the clinically important class 1 integron gene and class I integrase (Int 1) gene (85 – 92.5 %). In addition, amino glycoside resistance genes aacA 4, <b>strA,</b> <b>strB</b> and aadA (67.5 – 82.5 %) were also distributed in most STM resistant strains from all STM exposures. These amino glycoside genes and integron genes were notably observed under the lowest STM dose (0.1  mg L− 1). Therefore, minimum doses of STM might strongly induce the gene cassette of amino glycoside resistance genes among the wastewater bacterial community related to the clinical class I integron and class I integrase enzymes. Subsequently, these class I integrons might induce the dissemination of STM resistance to other wastewater bacteria through horizontal mobile gene transfer, which might then be maintained even under higher doses of STM (Mokracka et al. 2012; Masarikova et al. 2016; Said et al. 2016; Stalder et al. 2013; Nemec et al. 2004).|$|E

In October 2011, streptomycin-resistance was confirmed in four apple blocks in Wayne and Ontario Counties. We conducted a statewide survey in 2012 to locate and characterize any additional resistant bacterial populations. A total of 174 samples were collected. Erwinia amylovora was isolated from 129 of these and 15 of these isolates were resistant to streptomycin (11. 6 %). Preliminary phylogenetic results show that all streptomycin-resistant isolates carry the streptomycin resistance genes, <b>strA</b> and <b>strB,</b> on transposon Tn 5393 which resides on the non-conjugative plasmid, pEa 29, meaning that the isolates had to be spread physically.

40|$|Background: Multidrug {{resistance}} in Acinetobacter baumannii has dramatically increased {{in recent years}} worldwide. Thus, last-line antibiotics like carbapenems are increasingly being used which in turn further augments selection pressure for resistant strains. Resistance to carbapenems in A. baumannii is frequently mediated by carbapenemases, particularly OXA- 23 and OXA- 58. Carbapenemase-producing bacteria are mainly described in human patients and the intestinal tract represents a common source for such pathogens. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the genome of A. baumannii IHIT 7853, a carbapenem-resistant, OXA- 23 producing strain isolated from cystitis in a cat in 2000 in Germany. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that IHIT 7853 belonged to the globally distributed international clone IC 1 and MLST type ST 1 /ST 231 (Pasteur/Oxford MLST scheme). A phylogenetic tree based on the maximum common genome of 18 A. baumannii isolates placed IHIT 7853 close to human clinical isolates, such as the multidrug-resistant (MDR) outbreak strain AYE that was isolated from a patient with pneumonia and cystitis in 2001 in France. The OXA- 23 plasmid sequence could be determined as 53, 995 bp in size, possessing resistance genes <b>strA</b> and <b>strB</b> in addition to bla OXA- 23.

It is unclear, whether increased doses of STM modified the aacA 4 gene to encode STM-modifying enzymes or if it accelerated an unknown STM resistance mechanism.

In conclusion, our present work reveals that the wide bacterial diversity among the indigenous bacteria from WWTPs exposed to long-term stepwise increasing doses of STM could become an enhanced and stable reservoir {{for the development of}} STM resistance. Here we concluded that stepwise increasing doses of antibiotics will expose a number of unanswered questions related to antibiotic resistance among the wastewater bacterial community. We therefore suggest that the current new approach could apply and extended in future studies to better understand the risk assessment of WWTPs.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} differences in antibiotic-resistant soil bacteria {{and the presence}} and quantity of resistance genes in soils {{with a range of}} management histories. We analyzed four soils from agricultural systems that were amended with manure from animals treated with erythromycin and exposed to streptomycin and/or oxytetracycline, as well as non-manure-amended compost and forest soil. Low concentrations of certain antibiotic resistance genes were detected using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), with tet(B), aad(A), and str(A) each present in only one soil and tet(M) and tet(W) detected in all soils. The most frequently detected resistance genes were tet(B), tet(D), tet(O), tet(T), and tet(W) for tetracycline resistance, <b>str(A),</b> <b>str(B),</b> and aac for streptomycin resistance, and erm(C), erm(V), erm(X), msr(A), ole(B), and vga for erythromycin resistance. Transposon genes specific for Tn 916, Tn 1549, TnB 1230, Tn 4451, and Tn 5397 were detected in soil bacterial isolates. The MIC ranges of isolated bacteria for tetracycline, streptomycin, and erythromycin were 8 to > 256 μg/ml, 6 to > 1, 024 μg/ml, and 0. 094 to > 256 μg/ml, respectively. Based on 16 S rRNA gene similarity, isolated bacteria showed high sequence identity to genera typical of soil communities. Bacteria with the highest MICs were detected in manure-amended soils or soils from agricultural systems with a history of antibiotic use. Non-manure-amended soils yielded larger proportions of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but these had lower MICs, carried fewer antibiotic resistance genes, and did not display multidrug resistance (MDR) ...|$|E
40|$|A plasmid {{containing}} the qnrS quinolone resistance determinant and the gene encoding the SHV- 2 β-lactamase {{has been discovered}} from a clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in Taiwan. The complete 98 -kb sequence of this plasmid, designated pK 245, was determined by using a whole-genome shotgun approach. Transfer of pK 245 conferred low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in electroporant Escherichia coli epi 300. The sequence of the immediate region surrounding qnrS in pK 245 is nearly identical (> 99 % identity) to those of pAH 0376 from Shigella flexneri and pINF 5 from Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis, the two other qnrS-carrying plasmids reported to date, indicating a potential common origin. Other genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides (aacC 2, <b>strA,</b> and <b>strB),</b> chloramphenicol (catA 2), sulfonamides (sul 2), tetracycline (tetD), and trimethoprim (dfrA 14) were also detected in pK 245. The dfrA 14 gene is carried on a class I integron. Several features of this plasmid, including three separate regions containing putative replicons, a partitioning-control system, and a type II restriction modification system, suggest {{that it may be}} able to replicate and adapt in a variety of hosts. Although no critical conjugative genes were detected, multiple insertion sequence elements were found scattered throughout pK 245, and these may facilitate the dissemination of the antimicrobial resistance determinants. We conclude that pK 245 is a chimera which acquired its multiple antimicrobial resistance determinants horizontally from different sources. The identification of pK 245 plasmid expands the repertoire of the coexistence of quinolone and extended-spectrum-β-lactam resistance determinants in plasmids carried by various species of the family Enterobacteriaceae in different countries...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Despite a 97 % {{reduction}} in clinical sulphonamide usage, {{the prevalence of}} sulphonamide resistance among Escherichia coli has remained constant in the UK. Genetic linkage of sulphonamide resistance to other resistances is thought important for this maintenance, but the finding also implies that sulphonamide resistance exerts little fitness cost. To test this hypothesis, we examined the fitness impact of four naturally occurring sul 2 -coding plasmids upon their hosts. Methods: The fitness impact of the plasmids upon E. coli was determined by pairwise growth competition in a minimal medium. The DNA sequence of plasmid p 9123 was obtained by primer walking and PCR. Results: Three of the four sul 2 -coding plasmids studied imposed fitness costs on their hosts. The fourth plasmid, a 6. 2 kb resistance element carrying sul 2, <b>strA</b> and <b>strB</b> designated p 9123, conferred a 4 % fitness advantage upon its original clinical host and also on E. coli K 12 JM 109. The complete sequence of p 9123 revealed eight open reading frames, including five of unknown function. There was no obvious gene to which the fitness advantage might be attributed. Conclusions: The novel finding that p 9123 can improve host fitness may explain why this plasmid and its close relatives are so widespread among enteric bacteria. In addition to other factors such as co-selection of sulphonamide resistance by other agents, the fitness advantage conferred by plasmids such as p 9123 {{may have contributed to}} the maintenance of sulphonamide resistance in the UK in the absence of clinical selection pressure. These data indicate that once antibiotic resistance has been established on mobile genetic elements, it may be difficult to eliminate...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the genetic and plasmid diversity within natural populations of Pseudomonas syringae isolated from three ornamental pear nurseries in eastern Oklahoma. The bactericide spray regimen differed at each nursery; copper and streptomycin, only copper, and no bactericides were applied at nurseries I, II, and III respectively. Resistance to copper (Cur) {{and resistance to}} streptomycin (Smr) were determined for 1, 938 isolates of P. syringae; isolates from nurseries I and II were generally Cur Sms; whereas most isolates from nursery III were Cus Sms. The plasmid profiles of 362 isolates were determined, and six, one, seven, and four plasmid profiles were obtained for Cur, Smr, Cur Smr, and Cus Sms isolates, respectively. All Smr plasmids contained sequences homologous to the <b>strA</b> and <b>strB</b> Smr genes from broad-host-range plasmid RSF 1010 and were associated with Smr transposon Tn 5393. Plasmids were placed into two groups {{on the basis of}} hybridization to the oriV and par sequences from pOSU 900, a cryptic plasmid in P. syringae pv. syringae. A total of 100 randomly chosen P. syringae isolates from nurseries I and III were analyzed for genetic diversity by using the arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) technique. An analysis of chromosomal genotypes by AP-PCR revealed a high degree of genetic diversity among the isolates, and the results of this analysis indicated that the isolates could be clustered into two distinct groups. The plasmid profiles were specific to isolates belonging to particular AP-PCR groups. Within each AP-PCR group, identical plasmid profiles were produced by isolates that had different chromosomal genotypes, implying that plasmid transfer has {{played an important role in}} the dissemination of Cur and Smr within the populations studied...|$|R
40|$|Multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serovar Newport strains are {{increasingly}} isolated from animals and food products {{of animal origin}} and have caused septicemic illness in animals and humans. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the occurrence and the epidemiologic, phenotypic, and genotypic characteristics of S. Newport of animal origin that may infect humans, either via the food chain or directly. During the 1993 – 2002 period, the Office International des Épizooties Reference Laboratory for Salmonellosis in Guelph, Ontario, received 36 841 Salmonella strains for serotyping that had been isolated from animals, environmental sources, and food of animal origin in Canada. Of these, 119 (0. 3 %) were S. Newport. Before 2000, none of 49 S. Newport strains was resistant to more than 3 antimicrobials. In contrast, between January 2000 and December 2002, 35 of 70 isolates, primarily of bovine origin, were resistant to at least 11 antimicrobials, including the extended-spectrum cephalosporins. The blaCMY- 2, flost, <b>strA,</b> <b>strB,</b> sulII, and tetA resistance genes were located on plasmids of 80 to 90 MDa that were self-transmissible in 25 % of the strains. Conserved segments of the integron 1 gene were found on the large MDR-encoding plasmids in 3 of 35 strains additionally resistant to gentamicin and spectinomycin or to spectinomycin, sulfamethoxazole– trimethoprim, and trimethoprim. Resistance to kanamycin and neomycin was encoded by the aphA- 1 gene, located on small plasmids (2. 3 to 6 MDa). The increase in bovine-associated MDR S. Newport infections is cause for concern since it indicates an increased risk of human acquisition of the infection via the food chain...|$|E
40|$|An str {{gene cluster}} {{containing}} {{at least four}} genes (strR, <b>strA,</b> <b>strB,</b> and strC) involved in streptomycin biosynthesis or streptomycin resistance or both was self-cloned in Streptomyces griseus by using plasmid pOA 154. The strA gene was verified to encode streptomycin 6 -phosphotransferase, a streptomycin resistance factor in S. griseus, by examining the gene product expressed in Escherichia coli. The other three genes were determined by complementation tests with streptomycin-nonproducing mutants whose biochemical lesions were clearly identified. strR complemented streptomycin-sensitive mutant SM 196 which exhibited impaired activity of both streptomycin 6 -phosphotransferase and amidinotransferase (one of the streptomycin biosynthetic enzymes) due to a regulatory mutation; strB complemented strain SD 141, which was specifically deficient in amidinotransferase; and strC complemented strain SD 245, which was deficient in linkage between streptidine 6 -phosphate and dihydrostreptose. By deletion analysis of plasmids with appropriate restriction endonucleases, {{the order of the}} four genes was determined to be strR-strA-strB-strC. Transformation of S. griseus with plasmids carrying both strR and strB genes enhanced amidinotransferase activity in the transformed cells. Based on the gene dosage effect and the biological characteristics of the mutants complemented by strR and strB, it was concluded that strB encodes amidinotransferase and strR encodes a positive effector required for the full expression of strA and strB genes. Furthermore, it was found that amplification of a specific 0. 7 -kilobase region of the cloned DNA on a plasmid inhibited streptomycin biosynthesis of the transformants. This DNA region might contain a regulatory apparatus that participates in the control of streptomycin biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates from 300 meat products (raw beef, chicken meat and street foods). A total of 88 non-duplicate Salmonella from 66 (22. 0) retail meat and 22 (7. 5) street food samples were recovered and 11 serovars were identified. Among the 88 Salmonella isolates, the highest resistance was to tetracycline (73. 8), followed by sulfonamide (63. 6), streptomycin (57. 9), nalidixic acid (44. 3), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (19. 3), ampicillin (17. 0), chloramphenicol (10. 2), cephalotin (8. 0), kanamycin (6. 8), ciprofloxacin (2. 2) gentamycin (2. 2), cefoxitin (2. 2), amoxicillin-clavulanate (1. 0) and amikacin (1. 0). Sixty-seven {{percent of the}} isolates (59 / 88) were multidrug resistant (MDR). Ten out of 17 resistance genes (bla(TEM- 1), <b>strA,</b> <b>strB,</b> aadA, sull, sulll, tetA, tetB, floR, cmlA) were detected. Twelve of the 59 MDR Salmonella isolates from serovars Typhimurium (6), Newport (3), Agona (1), Albany (1) and Weltevreden (1) had class 1 integrons. The gene cassettes identified were dfrA 1, dfrV, dfrA 12, aadA 2, sul 1 genes and an open reading frame orfC of unknown function. Four integron-positive isolates could transfer resistance phenotypes to the recipient strain, E. coli J 53 via conjugation. These data revealed that the Salmonella isolates recovered from the retail meats and cooked street foods were resistant to multiple antimicrobials, which can be transmitted to humans through food products. The occurrence of mobile genetic elements such as integrons reiterates the roles of food of animal origins as a reservoir of MDR Salmonella. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the context {{and location of}} antibiotic resistance genes in carbapenem- and aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii global clone 2 (GC 2) isolates carrying a class 1 integron. Methods: Isolates were from Sydney hospitals. Resistance to antibiotics was determined by disc diffusion. BLAST searches identified relevant DNA fragments in a draft genome sequence. PCR was used to assemble fragments and map equivalent regions. Results: In two isolates belonging to GC 2, WM 99 c and A 91, the blaTEM gene, the class 1 integron carrying the aacC 1 -orfP-orfP-orfQ-aadA 1 cassette array and sul 1 gene, and the aphA 1 b gene in Tn 6020 were each in segments flanked by IS 26. These, together with a fourth IS 26 -flanked segment, formed a 19. 5 kb genomic resistance island (GRI), designated AbGRI 2 - 1, containing five copies of IS 26. Part of this island was identical to part of the multiple antibiotic resistance region of AbaR-type islands found in global clone 1 (GC 1). AbGRI 2 - 1 has replaced a 40. 9 kb segment found in the AB 0057 genome. Related GRIs were identified in the same location in published GC 2 genomes and appear to have arisen from AbGRI 2 - 1 via IS 26 -mediated deletions. Like A 91, WM 99 c carries ISAba 1 upstream of ampC and Tn 6167, an AbGRI 1 -type island in the chromosomal comM gene containing sul 2, tet(B), <b>strA</b> and <b>strB</b> genes and blaOXA- 23 in Tn 2006.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to elucidate the accuracy of the current streptomycin epidemiological cut-off value (ECOFF) for Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. A total of 236 Salmonella enterica and 208 E. coli isolates exhibiting MICs between 4 and 32 ¿mg/L were selected from 12 countries. Isolates were investigated by polymerase chain reaction for aadA, <b>strA,</b> and <b>strB</b> streptomycin resistance genes. Out of 236 Salmonella isolates, 32 (13. 5 %) yielded amplicons for aadA (n¿=¿ 23), strA (n¿=¿ 9), and strB (n¿=¿ 11). None of the 60 Salmonella isolates exhibiting MIC 4 ¿mg/L harbored resistance genes. Of the Salmonella isolates exhibiting MICs 8 ¿mg/L, 16 ¿mg/L, and 32 ¿mg/L, 1. 6 %, 15 %, and 39 %, respectively, tested positive for one or more genes. For most monitoring programs, the streptomycin ECOFF for Salmonella is wild type (WT) = 32 or = 16 ¿mg/L. A cut-off value of WT = 32 ¿mg/L would have misclassified 13. 5 % of the strains as belonging to the WT population, since this proportion of strains harbored resistance genes and exhibited MICs = 32 ¿mg/L. Out of 208 E. coli strains, 80 (38. 5 %) tested positive for aadA (n¿=¿ 69), strA (n¿=¿ 18), and strB (n¿=¿ 31).

Based on the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines (ECOFF = 16 ¿mg/L), 25 % of the E. coli strains presenting MIC = 16 ¿mg/L would have been incorrectly categorized as belonging to the WT population. The authors recommend an ECOFF value of WT = 16 ¿mg/L for Salmonella and WT = 8 ¿mg/L for E. coli...|$|R
