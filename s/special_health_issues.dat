40|$|IntroductionThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the views of general practitioners (GP) on pollution in infant's home. MethodsFour semi-structured focus group with 31 general practitioners (GP) were conducted in two french departments in November 2009, February, March and April 2010. The focus group meetings were analysed using a general thematic analysis. ResultsPerinatal care is a <b>special</b> <b>health</b> <b>issue</b> and a time of privileged sensitisation. The attitude of health risks are well known in the case of traditionally toxic substances. In the case of emerging environmental exposure, these attitudes depend on the knowledge, beliefs and experience specific to each practitioner. GPs were acquiring a new role in the field of environmental health, whilst at the same time coming to grips with their own strengths and limitations. The implementation of prevention depends on factors which are specific to the practitioner, but also related to the parents and the organisation of the medical practice. DiscussionThe sensitisation of GPs to environmental medicine, promotion of eco-citizen education, development of research, and the distribution of information, are some of the means which need to be implemented to prevent harmful exposure of the infant...|$|R

Despite its promise, the factors that distinguish CER from other types of evidence remain mysterious to many oncolo-gists. One concern is whether CER studies will improve deci-sionmaking in oncology or only add to themassive amount of research information that decision makers must sift through {{as part of their}} professional responsibilities. In this report, we highlight several issues that distinguish CER from the most common way evidence is generated for cancer therapy— phase I–III clinical trials. To identify the issues that are most relevant to busy decisionmakers,weassembled apanel of ac-tive professionalswith awide rangeof roles in cancer care de-livery. This panel identified five themes that they considered most important for CER in oncology, as well as fundamental threats to the validity of individual CER studies—threats they termed the “kiss of death ” for their applicability to practice.

WHO has evaluated related loading of 25 risk factors that 7 of these are environmental factors. With regard to the lack of comprehensive studies, this survey was carried out in Tehran to investigate the knowledge of the citizens on environmental pollutions, related health effects and their information sources. Materials and methods: Present survey was carried out on 1596 individual upper than 18 years old. Samples were taken randomly. Data was collected by phone interview. In order to determine correlation between qualitative variables, Chi -square test was used. In necessary condition OR index was used. Reliability of questions in any part was tested by principal component analysis. Results: Results of this survey showed that in general 54. 2 % of people have a good knowledge about environmental pollution and health effects. The knowledge of women, youths (18 - 20 years old), university educated people (PhD), westerns and northern, and those who had got their information from radio / TV is more than others. The knowledge of people about the environmental pollution and their health effects with education level and source of information had a significant difference. After elimination the effect of variables that probably interfere with knowledge of people, logistic regression was done. In this case, there was a correlation between education level and information sources. More than 80 % of people got their information from radio and TV. Newspaper and social conversation were the next important sources, respectively. Conclusion: Although Tehran citizen knowledge about some environmental problems and related institutions was low, in general, Tehran citizens knowledge about the problem and <b>special</b> <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> resulted from air pollution was good. With regard to importance of environmental factors in public health because of machinery life especially in large cities of our country, more research should be accomplished to identify and how to control them...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the Wetlands and Human <b>Health</b> <b>special</b> <b>issue</b> and an overview of the papers. It identifies the disjunct that can exist between managing wetland health and human health. There is a need to resolve the potential conflict between managing wetlands for their values and managing them for positive human health outcomes. All authors have used the Ramsar definition of wetlands and the World Health Organization definition of human health. The papers (several are reviews) cover a range of wetlands and diseases from mosquitoborne to snail or pathogen vectors. Mosquito management is a common theme, illustrating, for the eastern USA, that wetland damage from the early to mid twentieth century can be ameliorated by careful restoration and, for Australia, that damage may be avoided. Constructed wetlands provide an opportunity to create ecosystem services and wetland value such that careful design and operation can minimise mosquito risks. Although the papers focus on negative health impacts of wetlands they deal with these to minimise health risks while restoring or maintaining wetland function or by exploring knowledge needs that would facilitate wise management.
