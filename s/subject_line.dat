40|$|Research on advance {{organizers}} {{demonstrates the}} importance of memoran dum <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> for reader comprehension and, by implication, reinforces {{the notion that a}} relationship exists between writer choice and communica tion context. Yet, existing pedagogy presents memorandum <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> with no regard for context. This article introduces a taxonomy for subject-line com position that takes context into account by classifying memorandum <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> as either neutral or directed. Analysis of 483 memorandum <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> {{led to the development of}} this taxonomy. Findings from this analysis, as well as findings from several follow-up exercises which tested the usefulness of the taxonomy, indicate that writers compose memorandum <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> much as pedagogical materials recommend and that these <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> are usually neutral. However, when given alternatives, writers actually prefer directed sub ject linesforsomesituations. While the study focuses on <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> in mana gerial memorandums, the proposed taxonomy and findings on writer choice may be more broadly applied and have important implications for pedagogy and research on managerial writing...|$|R

Users can also create strings of text for Spam Alert to look for when classifying e-mail. In PC Magazine testing, Spam Alert mistakenly classified 2.8 percent of legitimate e-mail as spam. 47 percent of spam slipped past the filter. Although false positive rate was low, the feature did not fare well at finding actual spam.|$|E

40|$|The {{writings}} of Saussure, Peirce, Barthes, Eco and others express theories that symbols, signs, and signals are integral {{elements in the}} assignation of meaning within general human communication. Email marketing specialists such as Stephanie Miller, Andy Goldman, and Jeannieay Mullen opine {{that it is the}} email recipient’s inferences regarding the words in the address or <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> that are the primary determinants in the decision whether or not to first open and subsequently respond to a commercial email. It would then seem that email marketers would be well served by understanding what forms these inferences {{in the minds of the}} recipients and what responses are more likely when email recipients view the symbols, signs, and signals placed in <b>subject</b> <b>lines.</b> A series of 219 commercial emails from a national chain retailer were evaluated comparing the recipient response rate (the percentage of emails actually opened) with the presence of terms deemed to be relational in nature. Those emails with relationships related terms in their <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> exhibited a 6. 2 % higher open rate than those not containing those types of terms. This study’s purpose was to determine if there could be a demonstrable relationship between the word-driven symbolic (semiotic) content of the <b>subject</b> <b>lines</b> and the percentage of those emails that are opened by the recipients. To accomplish its purpose, the study reviewed the positions of 13 semiotic theorists and applied certain of their theories in an analysis of the open rates of these commercial emails...|$|R

The user then sets up rules in the mail client to sort the mail based on the <b>subject</b> <b>line</b> modification.
