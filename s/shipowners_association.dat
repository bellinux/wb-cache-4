40|$|The Swedish {{merchant}} fleet has declined sharply since the 1970 s, {{largely because of}} the lack of competitive conditions compared with many other countries, for instance Denmark. A large number of ships flagged out from Sweden, some shipping companies have even closed down offices and moved abroad which meant jobs being lost as a result. To prevent ships from flagging out, Sweden introduced various support measures such as subsidies for shipping and TAP agreements, which would reduce the crew costs for Swedish flagged vessels. These measures have not completely slowed down the flagging out, as it has continued to do so in recent years. Other European countries, such as Denmark and Norway, chose to adopt more parts of the Commission's State Aid Guidelines, for instance the international ship register and tonnage tax, which has increased their competitiveness against Sweden. To prevent further vessels from flagging out and promote regrowth in Swedish shipping, Sweden has decided to introduce tonnage tax in the summer of 2016, which has made the shipping industry very happy. The report was written in 2016 to find out what the Swedish shipping companies require to flag into Sweden, and if the tonnage tax will affect shipping companies to register their ships in Sweden. To find out, six shipping companies were interviewed, as well as the industry organization Swedish <b>Shipowner’s</b> <b>Association</b> and one of the unions. Overall the shipping companies are satisfied with some of the actions that has been adopted, including tonnage tax and the delegation of flag state inspections from the Transport Agency to classification societies. However, they demand long-term and reliable maritime transport politics, as well as that the Swedish Transport Agency should continue to improve, for example, their customer service and the procedure of flagging into Sweden. Furthermore, some of the companies want to see that the Maritime Officers' Association provides temporary or permanent exception from the requirements to have a Swedish master and chief engineer. In the Swedish Government Official Reports, SOU 2010 : 73, parts of the proposed actions have been implemented. The net wage model has been increased and the Swedish Transport Agency has appointed a supervisor to handle the matters regarding the registration of ships. However, the TAP agreement has not become a central contract or been increased...|$|R

50|$|Millis' {{alliance}} with Leiserson also overturned {{a number of}} the NLRB's more radical precedents and established a more moderate labor policy. Where the Madden Board had issued wide-ranging decisions approving multi-plant locals in <b>Shipowners</b> <b>Association</b> of the Pacific Coast, 7 NLRB 1002 (1938) and Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company, 10 NLRB 1470 (1939) (decisions that favored industrial unions like the CIO), Millis worked with Leiserson to overturn these precedents in <b>Shipowners</b> <b>Association</b> of the Pacific Coast, 32 NLRB 668 (1941) and Libbey-Owens Ford, 31 NLRB 243 (1942). The Millis-led Board also issued a number of decision that turned the bar on representation petitions during the term of the contract into a tool for ensuring the security of incumbent unions. Although the Madden Board had held in A. Sartorious, 10 NLRB 403 (1938), that strikebreakers were not eligible to participate in union organizing elections, the Millis Board voted in In Rudolph Wurlitzer Co., 32, NLRB 163 (1941) to overturn that precedent. The Madden Board had held in Inland Steel, 9 NLRB 783 (1938) that a company was responsible for actions of its foremen, but the Millis Board overturned this decision in Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 32 NLRB 1056 (1941). The Madden Board had ruled several times that an employer could be held guilty of NLRA violations no matter the circumstances, but in New York and Porto Rico S.S. Co., 34 NLRB 1028 (1941), the Millis-led Board said the employer was absolved of guilt if it had been forced to act under union economic pressure. These and other critical decisions by the Millis Board were strongly approved of by Secretary of Labor Perkins and President Roosevelt.|$|E

Thus new friction was created, as {{the leaders of the}} two main Nortraship offices did not cooperate well. It was so severe that the Minister of Supply and Shipping, Trygve Lie, had to forward it to the government for a formal resolution. On 25 October the Norwegian government stated that the two offices were [...] "parallel enterprises, each working independently with its ships". This also resulted in a tally of ships; on 21 November 1940 London administered 570 ships while New York had 282 (whaling ships not included).|$|E
5000|$|When Norway was {{invaded by}} Germany on 9 April 1940, the {{merchant}} fleet {{had been at}} war for seven months. Norway was neutral, but lost 58 ships and around 400 sailors. During these months much of the framework that Nortraship was to operate within was created, most importantly the Norwegian-British tonnage agreement. Called the Scheme Agreement, this stated that {{a percentage of the}} Norwegian fleet, including two-thirds of the tanker tonnage, was to go on charter to Britain. In return Norway would receive important commodities. This agreement alleviated the British problem of access to the Norwegian fleet, especially the tankers, which they regarded as of [...] "exceptional importance". To protect Norwegian neutrality, the agreement was negotiated between the British government and the Norwegian <b>Shipowners</b> <b>Association.</b>|$|E

40|$|Since {{nitrogen}} oxides, NOx are {{harmful to}} {{human health and the}} environment, the International Maritime Organization, IMO has proposed reductions of the allowed amount of NOx-emissions from vessels in certain areas. The Swedish <b>Shipowners</b> <b>Association</b> together with others are critical to the suggestion. They are afraid that the cost for the installation of the reduction technique will be so expensive that the shipping business would lose competitiveness and that the goods will find other ways. In this paper different alternatives, such as NOx-reduction techniques, economical instruments of control, alternative fuels etc. to reduce NOx- emissions are described and analysed. Some alternatives are relativley new and unrealible, while others not have the potential to meet the future demands. The alternatives which are tested and proven are quite expensive and space demanding, but all alternatives can contribute...|$|E
