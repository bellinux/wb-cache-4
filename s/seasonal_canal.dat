50|$|By {{the turn}} of the century it was more {{efficient}} and economical to ship coal by rail, and the <b>seasonal</b> <b>canal</b> became obsolete. Portland cement replaced blue stone in building and paving. As less material was shipped the port of Rondout declined.|$|E
50|$|As far as {{the climate}} of the town is {{concerned}} it is of the semi arid in nature, {{most of the time}} moderate. It is hottest in June, and July. Rainy in Monsoon season. Foggiest in November, December and January. Rice crop is mostly dependent on rains as well as on <b>seasonal</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The next largest canal is Rohri Canal which though {{slightly}} shorter {{in length}} than Nara Canal is yet taking discharge {{much more than}} the former. It has cultivable area of 2.6 million acres settled for Irrigation. Cotton, wheat and sugar-cane are the main crops grown on this canal system. All the four canals on the left and two canals on the right bank of River Indus are perennial canals, delivering Irrigation supplies all the year round. The seventh canal namely, Rice Canal on the right side is a <b>seasonal</b> <b>canal</b> which flows only in Kharif Season and is designed for rice cultivation. The N.W. Canal on the right bank provides perennial Irrigation for an area of 965,000 (0.965 million) acres out of which 184,000 acres are situated in Baluchistan Province.|$|E
50|$|Devizes has a {{small and}} steady economy, mainly made up of manufacturing, retail, {{services}} and {{a small amount of}} tourism. Devizes has always been a market town and the market square exists today; markets are held every Thursday. The town attracts some tourism due to its proximity to Avebury, Stonehenge and Salisbury. Local attractions include Wiltshire Museum, Caen Hill Locks, the Kennet and Avon <b>Canal,</b> <b>seasonal</b> crop circles, and the White Horse. The Wadworth Brewery, with its shire horses, operates a visitor centre.|$|R

Some travelled for months at a time, others made journeys once or twice a year. These forms of travel were ways of life, but they also constituted a radical idea that could be threatening and/or desirable to the majority sedentary population. Travellers were, apparently, different. Their arrival, stay, and departure were recorded in newspapers, fiction, drawings, engravings, paintings, pamphlets, and on the stage and in song. That they had come from elsewhere in Britain, that they brought alternative behaviours with them, and their need or urge to travel at all, made them worthy of comment. They represented, simultaneously, escape and privation, freedom and poverty, timelessness and anachronism, colour and danger, dirt and entertainment...|$|R
