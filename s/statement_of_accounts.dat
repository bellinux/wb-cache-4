5|$|Undismayed by {{the loss}} of his papers, Bottomley {{embarked}} on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the Hansard reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, floated on the London Stock Exchange with a capital of £500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the Lord Mayor-elect of London, Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London Evening News, and Sir Roper Lethbridge, the Conservative MP for Kensington North. This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses—he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions. He also persuaded the board to give him £75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired. These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts,</b> in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of £40,877, and declared a dividend of eight per cent.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1931, rumours {{spread that}} Kreuger & Toll and other {{companies}} in Kreuger's empire were financially unstable. In February 1932, Kreuger turned to Sveriges Riksbank {{for the second time}} in his life to support him in raising a large increase in his loans. At this time his total loans from Swedish banks were estimated at about half of the Swedish reserve currency, which had started to have negative effects on the value of the Swedish currency in the international financial market. In order to grant him more loans, the government required that a complete <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> of Kreuger's entire company group be presented, as the bank's (Sveriges Riksbank) own calculations showed that Kreuger & Toll finances were far too weak to give him more loans.|$|E

6000|$|... 333 In {{his last}} {{edition of his}} “Manual,” Professor Fawcett thus [...] {{describes}} a co-operative experiment in agriculture: “The one that [...] has attracted the most attention was made nearly forty years since [...] by Mr. Gurdon, on his estate at Assington, near Sudbury, in Suffolk. [...] Mr. Gurdon was so much impressed with the miserable condition of the [...] agricultural laborers who were employed on his estate, that he was [...] prompted to do something on their behalf. When, therefore, one of [...] his farms became vacant, he offered to let it at the ordinary rent, [...] £150 a year, to the laborers who worked upon it. As they, of course, [...] had not sufficient capital to cultivate it, he {{in the first instance}} [...] loaned them the requisite stock and implements. The laborers were, [...] in fact, formed into a company in which there were eleven shares, [...] and no laborer was permitted to hold more than one share. The plan [...] was so eminently successful that in a few years sufficient had been [...] saved out of the profits to repay all that had been advanced, and [...] the stock and implements became the property of the laborers. Each [...] share greatly increased in value. Mr. Gurdon was so much encouraged, [...] not only by the pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers, but [...] also by the general improvement effected in their condition, that [...] some years afterward he let another and a larger farm on similar [...] terms. Although no <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> has ever been published, [...] the remarkable pecuniary advantages secured to the laborers is [...] proved by the fact that, after enjoying at least as high wages as [...] were paid in the district, they were able in a few years to become [...] the owners of a valuable property, consisting of the stock and [...] implements on the farms. One of the most significant and hopeful [...] circumstances connected with the experiment is, that it was not [...] carried out by a picked body of men; and if so much could be done by [...] laborers who were probably among the worst educated in the country, [...] it maybe fairly concluded, that when the intelligence of our rural [...] population has been better developed, co-operation may be applied in [...] a more complete form to agriculture, and with even more striking [...] results than were obtained at Assington.... In the description which [...] has been frequently given of the system of peasant proprietorship, [...] it is shown how powerfully the industry of the laborer is stimulated [...] by the feeling of property. When he cultivates his own plot of [...] ground, he exerts himself to the utmost, because he knows that he [...] will enjoy all that is yielded by his labor. Each year, with the [...] extended use of machinery in agriculture, it is becoming more [...] advantageous to carry on farming on a large scale. When, therefore, [...] co-operative agriculture becomes practicable, land may be cultivated [...] by associations of laborers, and thus many of the advantages [...] associated with the system of peasant proprietorship may be secured, [...] {{while at the same time}} the disadvantages of small farming may be [...] avoided. The progress toward co-operative agriculture will no doubt [...] be slow and gradual.” ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to find the {{relationship}} between the purely representational aspects <b>of</b> the <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> and the everyday lived experiences of those who were directly affected by the Bhopal Gas Tragedy in India in 1984. The paper seeks to consider the rhetorical force of photography in capturing the tragic and to compare this with the position adopted by Union Carbide in accounting for the catastrophe. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews the Bhopal Gas Tragedy and draws on the works of Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Julia Kristeva to examine the relationship between photographic representation and <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>account.</b> Findings – The rhetorical character of the ways in which the tragedy has been represented and the impact of the photographic image when set against the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> is considered. The photographic image is an attempt to restore the body to the text, to bear in mind that, in the face of inevitable abstract, it is important to remember the body, albeit with the caveat that the image too succumbs to the force of rhetoric. Nonetheless, the image reminds one that one is dealing not only with figures and statements but also with life and death. Originality/value – The paper contributes to discussions about the need for a dialogic approach to accounting. Frequently, in disaster analysis, the co-existence of multiple perspectives and fragmented stories i. e. a dialogic approach, is paramount to gaining an insight into the complexity of the system which has failed. The paper demonstrates how images can complement cosy, coherent, monologic <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> and help to retain the human character <b>of</b> disaster. <b>Accounting,</b> India, Man-made disasters, Narratives, Photographs, Visual media...|$|R
