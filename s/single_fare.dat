25|$|From Durres {{the rate}} for a <b>single</b> <b>fare</b> is 480 Albanian Lek.|$|E
25|$|Numerous special fares were {{introduced}} to encourage travel, develop niche markets and overcome competitors. The cheap day return ticket offered return travel at a price usually equivalent to the <b>single</b> <b>fare,</b> although in areas with rival bus services they were sometimes offered at less than the <b>single</b> <b>fare.</b> Companies holding large freight accounts with the LMS received reduced price season tickets for nominated employees, while commercial travellers, anglers and conveyors of racing pigeons were all tempted with special offers.|$|E

25|$|A further {{report on}} fares {{was made by}} the Manager, this time on the {{question}} of cheap early facilities. He was against the issue of certain workmen’s returns on account of the difficulties experienced on other systems. Consequently, return tickets at <b>single</b> <b>fare</b> where the latter exceeded 2d. were introduced.|$|E

25|$|By 1859, further {{reductions}} {{were available}} for parties of eight or more travelling to destinations such as Shane's Castle, Masserene Park, Toomebridge, Moyola Park, the Giant's Causeway and Dunluce Castle. As always, the seaside was a popular destination with excursion tickets to Portstewart and Portrush via the neighbouring Belfast, Ballymena, Coleraine and Portrush Junction Railway (BBC) and valid for seven days being offered at normal <b>single</b> <b>fare</b> rates.|$|E

Period ticket offers unlimited travel for the dates paid for. Value is {{used to pay for}} one trip, which may contain changes. The price of a single trip is lower when paid with the travel card instead of buying a <b>single</b> <b>fare</b> ticket.|$|E

25|$|A two-tier {{flat fare}} {{structure}} is in operation within the West Midlands county boundary; {{there is a}} standard <b>single</b> <b>fare</b> for any distance and a cheaper short-hop fare. Cash fares can be bought from the driver on the bus, but as with some other urban operators, no change is given for security and speed of boarding. Child fares are available at half the adult cost. Graduated fares apply on some services outside the West Midlands. In 2015, NXWM started taking fares on the Transport for West Midlands(previously Centro) Swift smart card.|$|E
25|$|Cash fares are distance-related. The {{scale was}} {{originally}} intended to be broadly comparable with buses, but this proved to be unfinanceable. In January 2013 the adult <b>single</b> <b>fare</b> from Birmingham to Wolverhampton was £2 by bus and £3.60 by tram, although the tram journey is much quicker even when the bus routes are congestion-free. By 2016 the tram fare had risen to £4. In November 2013 Birmingham City Council indicated plans to introduce a smart-card system (similar to Transport for London's Oyster Card) to improve access, alongside a range of measures including a new Tube-style map and electric bus networks. This has now launched and is called the Swift card.|$|E
25|$|The joint Hunting—Airwork Safari/colonial coach {{service from}} London to Nairobi routed via Malta, Wadi Halfa, Khartoum, Juba and Entebbe. It {{utilised}} single-class 27-seat Vikings, which took {{three days to}} complete the journey. Although this compared unfavourably with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), whose regular scheduled services took only 24 hours, load factors averaged 93% during {{the first nine months}} of operation. Hunting-Clan and Airwork continued to achieve very high average load factors of 85-90% because their £98 <b>single</b> <b>fare</b> was £42 cheaper than the comparable BOAC fare. These load factors were much higher than BOAC's, as a result of which the independents doubled the flight frequency on their London-Nairobi Safari/colonial coach route to once-a-week. This service proved to be so popular that a second weekly frequency was eventually added, which was operated alternately by each airline.|$|E
50|$|The song became Williams' {{first single}} {{not to make}} the top twenty in the United Kingdom when it peaked at number twenty-two, the single fell off the charts in just three weeks.
