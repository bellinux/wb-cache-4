They examined the inclusion of examples of inappropriate elements, by explicitly depicting problematic aspects of the problem presented to the students through example designs. They tested non-expert participants on three problem conditions: with <b>standard</b> <b>instruction,</b> fixated (with inclusion of problematic design), and defixated (inclusion of problematic design accompanied with helpful methods). They were able to support their hypothesis by finding that a) problematic design examples produce significant fixation effects, and b) fixation effects can be diminished with the use of defixating instructions.|$|E

40|$|Results on cardiac {{awareness}} in panic disorder are inconsistent. The present study attempted to clarify whether differences in instructions or {{the inclusion of}} patients taking antidepressant medication could account for these inconsistencies. 112 patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia were compared to 40 normal controls on the heartbeat perception task developed by Schandry (1981) [Schandry, R., Psychophysiology, 18, 483 - 488] using a <b>standard</b> <b>instruction</b> ("count all heartbeats you feel in your body") and a strict instruction ("count only those heartbeats about which you are sure"). Superior heartbeat perception for patients was only found with the <b>standard</b> <b>instruction.</b> Similarly, only with the <b>standard</b> <b>instruction,</b> patients taking medication affecting the cardiovascular system performed worse than patients without medication, as expected based {{on the relationship between}} stroke volume and heartbeat perception. The pattern of group differences indicates that agoraphobic patients have a better feeling for how fast their heart is beating than controls although these differences may be due to a tendency to interpret weak sensations as heartbeats. Furthermore, we tested in a subgroup of 40 patients whether cardiac awareness changes with exposure treatment. No changes in heartbeat perception were observed...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Often radical constructivists {{are confronted}} with {{arguments}} why radical constructivism is wrong. The present work presents a radical constructivist alternative to such arguments: {{a comparison of the}} results of two instructional practices, the standard, realistbased instruction and a radical constructivist-based instruction, both in physics courses. Design: Evidence from many studies of student conceptions in <b>standard</b> <b>instruction</b> (Duit 2004) is taken into account. In addition, diagnostic data, pre and post instruction, were collected from over 1, 000 students in multiple institutions across the U. S. over a period of about 15 years via an established diagnostic of conceptual understanding of motion and force. Findings: Evidence from many studies of student conceptions in <b>standard</b> <b>instruction</b> (Duit, 2004) is that little or no change in student conceptions happens in <b>standard</b> <b>instruction.</b> About half the students in the particular study reported, all science and engineering majors, experienced standard, realist-based instruction and show an average effect size of 0. 6 standard deviations and an average normalized gain of 15 %. The other half of the students, none of whom were science and engineering majors, experienced radical constructivist- based instruction and show an average effect size over 2. 5 standard deviations and an average normalized gain over 60 %. Diagnostic pre scores were nearly the same for both groups. Practical implications: The outcome, that students, neither science nor engineering majors, made changes in understanding foundational topics in physics far greater than science and engineering students, poses (1) an ethical challenge to the continued adherence to standard, realist-based instructional practices and (2) an intellectual challenge to the usefulness and appropriateness of the elitist-realist paradigm on which such <b>standard</b> <b>instruction</b> is based. Conclusions: This radical constructivist argument uses the effect of paradigms to judge their pragmatic value, not their truth-value. Based on pragmatic value, radical constructivism results in superior outcomes when applied to physics instruction. The approach to instruction can be applied generally in education...|$|E

Purpose: This study tests a brief, computer-delivered social norm message for increasing pain tolerance.

They received <b>standard</b> <b>instructions</b> or <b>standard</b> <b>instructions</b> plus a message that contained artifically elevated information about typical performance of others. Results: Those receiving a social norm message displayed significantly higher pain tolerance, F(1, 255) = 26. 95, p. 05.
