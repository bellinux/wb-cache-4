5000|$|Septage or <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> <b>sludge</b> {{refers to}} the {{partially}} treated sludge stored in a septic tank. It is one type of fecal sludge. Septage is a by-product from the pretreatment of household wastewater in a septic tank where it accumulates over time. Septage is pumped out of a septic tank or onsite sewage facility with a vacuum truck. The septic tanks can be residential or non-residential. Non-residential sources can include wastewater from commercial/industrial development, grease interceptor {{as well as other}} sources such as portable toilet, RV, and boat waste.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Septic</b> <b>tank</b> <b>sludge</b> or septage {{is in fact}} a {{specific}} type of [...] "fecal sludge" [...] - a term nowadays widely used in the context of developing countries. Fecal sludge includes the fecal sludge or septage from septic tanks as well as fecal sludge from pit latrines or from public toilets that are not connected to a sewer. Fecal sludge management is a challenge for many cities in developing countries where a large fraction of the population is using on-site sanitation systems. Fecal sludge needs to be managed safely.|$|E
50|$|Septic {{tank and}} drain field {{microorganisms}} have very limited capability for catabolizing petroleum products and chlorinated solvents, and cannot remove dissolved metals; although some may sorb onto <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> <b>sludge</b> or drain field soils, and concentrations may be diluted by other groundwater {{in the vicinity}} of the drain field. Cleaning formulations may reduce drain field efficiency. Laundry bleach may slow or stop microbial activity in the drain field, and sanitizing or deodorizing chemicals may have similar effects. Detergents, solvents and drain cleaners may transport emulsified, saponified or dissolved fats into the drain field before they can be catabolized to short-chain organic acids in the septic tank scum layer.|$|E
40|$|Whatever {{the method}} used to supply air during composting, the {{maintenance}} of aerobic conditions requires large energy inputs and use of costly equipment. On the other hand, suboxic or anaerobic conditions may not grant a sufficient speed of stabilization and sanitization of waste materials and {{the growing number of}} rural families that use <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> toilets in Viet Nam, urgently requires new safe ways to recycle <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> <b>sludge,</b> avoiding direct application to farmland. This work compared a conventional anaerobic system with a low oxygen input treatment for composting rice straw together with <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> biosolids or cow dung. Composting was carried out for 75 days, in open concrete biocells protected from rainfall, after inoculation with selected micro-organisms. The partially aerobic treatment maintained a significantly higher temperature than the anaerobic one, during the whole composting period. Organic C decreased from 32 % to 25 - 27 % at the end of process, remaining slightly higher in the anaerobic piles; on the opposite humic C showed a linear increase up to 8 mg g- 1, reaching the highest values in the aerobic piles. Both composting systems were able to sanitize the organic wastes since no viable intestinal parasite eggs were found {{at the end of the}} process. Compost made from <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> biosolids represents a valuable source of P, but has lower N and K than compost from cow dung. Anaerobic composting is a viable alternative to conventional aerobic systems to recycle organic residues and safely treat <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> <b>sludge</b> biosolids in rural areas of Viet Nam...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The present paper {{analyzes}} {{the feasibility of}} using <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> <b>sludge</b> subsequently treated in an anaerobic pond as raw material in the ceramic industry. An experiment was conducted involving the manufacture of 500 bricks using 6. 5 % (dry weight) of sludge at a ceramic plant in the Northeast of Brazil. To reproduce the methodologies, the same conditions and methods used by the local ceramic industry were adopted. To evaluate the bricks produced and environmental risk, compressive strength, water absorption and lixiviation tests were carried out, obeying current Brazilian norms, according to international standards. Results show the technical feasibility of using sludge as raw material in the red ceramic industry, highlighting the firing temperature of the bricks as a determinant variable.

40|$|The {{anaerobic}} digestion of "human waste" was studied at Mlalakuwa residential settlement in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania at ambient tropical temperatures (24 - 31 degrees C). This settlement experiences a high water table with flooding {{during the rainy}} season, resulting in a very costly emptying of the latrines once per month. To improve the situation, two plastic tanks (while one is in use, {{the other one is}} on stand-by) of 3000 l capacity each, named as Improved Pit-Latrines Without Urine Separation (IMPLWUS), were used as latrine pits. They received faeces + urine + wash water; basically, an accumulation system. <b>Septic</b> <b>tank</b> seed <b>sludge</b> was used. The dissolved chemical oxygen demand (CODdis) remaining when the reactor was closed after 380 days was about 8 g COD/l, volatile fatty acids were 100 mg COD/l and total ammonium nitrogen was about 2. 8 g N/l, implying the possibility of methanogenesis inhibition. Stability results indicated a need for more degradation time after reactor closure. Estimated biogas production from wastewater generated by 10 people was 544 g COD-CH 4 /day, not enough for cooking purposes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Disposal of the pumped {{contents}} of septic tanks (septage) represents a possible means of dissemination of enteric pathogens including viruses, since persistence of enteroviruses in <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> <b>sludge</b> for greater than 100 days has been demonstrated. The risk {{of exposure to}} potentially infectious agents can be reduced by disinfecting septages before their disposal. Of the septage disinfectants examined (technical and analytical grade glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, heat treatments, and a combination of heat and hydrogen peroxide), the treatment including hydrogen peroxide (5 mg, plus 0. 33 mg of trichloroacetic acid, per ml of septage) and 55 degrees C killed virtually all the bacteria in septage within 1 h, whereas 55 degrees C alone inactivated inoculated polioviruses within 30 min. Virus was the most sensitive to heat, whereas fecal coliforms {{appeared to be the}} most sensitive to all chemical treatments. The responses of fecal streptococci and virus to both grades of glutaraldehyde (each at 1 mg/ml) were similar. Virus was more resistant than either fecal streptococci or total bacteria to low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (1 to 5 mg/ml); however, virus and fecal streptococci were more labile than total bacteria to the highest peroxide concentration (10 mg/ml) examined. It is possible that the treatment combining heat and hydrogen peroxide was the most effective in reducing the concentrations of all bacteria, because catalase and peroxidases as well as other enzymes were heat inactivated, although catalase seems the most likely cause of damage. However, this most effective treatment {{does not appear to be}} practical for on-site use as performed, so further work on septage disinfection is recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{described}} here has been (a) to obtain some evidence on catalase (an oxidative enzyme) and protease, urease and phosphatase (hydrolytic enzymes) in sewage, activated sludge and <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> <b>sludge,</b> and (b) to use this evidence, as a new approach, {{to find out the}} relationship between the main groups of the micro-organisms (bacteria and protozoa) and their relative influence on the purification process. To make a rapid assessment of the enzyme activities in these systems in the course of three weeks, as an experimental measure, rat tissues were added, which might serve as an additional or a ‘shock’ load of organic matter to follow broadly the development of bacteria and protozoa and the changes in the enzyme activities in the different systems. A control system with sewage alone was also run. The results showed that the initial decomposition of the fresh organic matter added to sewage and sludges was almost entirely due to bacterial activity and the later oxidative changes and removal of the suspended solids, including the bacteria, were largely due to the protozoa, such as Epistylis articulata. Analysis of the enzyme activities in the different materials showed, among other things, that the activated sludge, with its mized bacteria, protozoa and other organisms, as a whole, contained about twenty times more protease activity than an equivalent amount of the protozoan E. articulata, and that this protozoan contained five times more catalase activity than the activated sludge. The significance of these observations is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Large {{volumes of}} sludge are {{produced}} from onsite sanitation systems in densely populated areas (e. g. slums and emergency settlements) and wastewater treatment facilities that contain high amounts of pathogens. There {{is a need}} for technological options which can effectively treat the rapidly accumulating sludge under these conditions. This study explored a pilot-scale microwave (MW) based reactor as a possible alternative for rapid sludge treatment. The reactor performance was examined by conducting a series of batch tests using centrifuged waste activated sludge (C-WAS), non-centrifuged waste activated sludge (WAS), faecal sludge (FS), and <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> <b>sludge</b> (SS). Four kilograms of each sludge type were subjected to MW treatment at a power of 3. 4  kW for various time durations ranging from 30 to 240  min. During the treatment the temperature change, bacteria inactivation (E. coli, coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis) and sludge weight/volume reduction were measured. Calorific values (CV) of the dried sludge and the nutrient content (total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)) in both the dried sludge and the condensate were also determined. It was found that MW treatment was successful to achieve a complete bacterial inactivation and a sludge weight/volume reduction above 60 %. Besides, the dried sludge and condensate had high energy (≥  16  MJ/kg) and nutrient contents (solids; TN ≥  28  mg/g TS and TP ≥  15  mg/g TS; condensate TN ≥  49  mg/L TS and TP ≥  0. 2  mg/L), having the potential to be used as biofuel, soil conditioner, fertilizer, etc. The MW reactor can be applied for the rapid treatment of sludge in areas such as slums and emergency settlements.

40|$|International audienceIn Urban {{areas of}} Burkina Faso, there are {{essentially}} on-site sanitation systems, constituted of latrines and <b>septic</b> <b>tanks.</b> Faecal <b>sludge</b> produced by these utilities are actually rarely treated and just spilt in the environment. So, {{there is a}} need to develop sustainable treatment solutions, to preserve local populations health, water resources and environment. In order to investigate rustic sludge treatment, 12 experimental sludge treatment reed bed systems, planted with two local species: Oryza longistaminata (OL) and Sporobolus pyramidalis (SP), were constructed and monitored in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The goal was to assess the potential of OL and SP planted beds to treat fecal sludge in Sahelian climate. A hydraulic load of 20 – 26 cm/week corresponding to 15. 8 – 21. 1 kg TSS/m 2 /year (62. 6 – 83. 5 kg DM/m 2 /year) was applied on all the beds for 120 days. The characterization of raw fecal sludge was assessed using physicochemical parameters (DM, TSS, NO 3 −-N, NO 2 −-N, NH 4 +-N, PO 43 −-P, TP, and COD). Allometric parameters of plants on each bed were also monitored. The high contents of COD, nutrients and salinity could be particularly associated with the plants wilting and death, especially for OL. The threshold values of 1900 mg/L for COD, 174. 5 mg/L for NH 4 +, 19. 9 mg/L for PO 43 − and 4400 mS/cm for conductivity induced sensitive variation of plant behaviors were highlighted for Oryza longistaminata...|$|R

40|$|Once a {{septic tank}} and {{absorption}} field are installed, {{you can do}} several things to prolong their life, thus protecting an investment which may cost 2500 or more. Here are several tips you can follow. Often overlooked or neglected {{is the fact that}} septic tanks should be inspected at least once annually. In every properly functioning <b>septic</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>sludge</b> accumulates in the bottom. This sludge is composed of solid materials and must be removed periodically. If the sludge is not removed, the accumulated solids will build up in the septic tank and will begin to wash out into the absorption field. Allowing solids from the septic tank to wash out into the absorption field will eventually clog it to the point where a new field will be needed. Most authorities agree that for a typical three-bedroom home, a 1, 000 -gallon (3, 800 I) septic tank will need to have the solids removed every three to five years. Smaller tanks must be pumped more often. Septic tank additives that 2 ̆ 2 clean 2 ̆ 2 the tank are available, but these are generally not recommended. Some additives may cause the solids to be flushed from the septic tank into the absorption field, causing clogging problems. Other compounds may produce a septic tank effluent which will destroy soil structure and cause premature failure of the soil absorption system. To determine if your septic tank needs pumping, the thickness of the sludge can be measured as illustrated in Figure 1. To measure the depth of the sludge, wrap a long stick with a piece of rough, white toweling and tie it securely. Lower the stick through the inlet tee (to avoid the scum) {{to the bottom of the}} tank. Wait about 30 seconds and remove the stick slowly and carefully. Black particles will cling to the towel indicating the depth of the sludge. The sludge should be removed if its depth is equal to one third or more of the liquid depth. Occasionally, a floating scum layer may develop in septic tanks. This scum layer can also cause clogging and should be checked annually. The scum layer thickness can be measured with a stick and hinged flap device (Figure 1). Push the stick through the scum until the hinged flap falls into the horizontal position. Raise the stick until you feel the bottom of the layer. Mark the stick to indicate the depth of the scum layer. Now use the same procedure to locate the lower end of the submerged inlet pipe. If the bottom side of the scum layer is within three inches (7. 6 em) of the lower end of the submerged inlet, the septic tank should be pumped. Most communities have contractors who pump septic tanks. It may cost 50 or more, but it is necessary for maintaining the life of the absorption field. The contractors pump the contents into a tank truck and dispose of it at an approved treatment site or by proper land application. Be sure the workman who cleans your tank mixes the liquid, sludge and scum before pumping so that all of the material can be removed, not just the liquid. It is not recommended to wash, scrub or disinfect the septic tank when pumping. Similarly, it is not necessary to leave solids in the septic to 2 ̆ 2 start 2 ̆ 2 it again. Normally, as the septic tank fills, the natural processes begin. Products to 2 ̆ 2 seed 2 ̆ 2 the system with desirable bacteria are available, but they are also not necessary...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{report is}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2014. The Secondary Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project {{was approved by the}} Asian Development Bank on 26 October 2006 for a total amount of $ 71. 1 million. The Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) under the Local Government Division (LGD) of Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MLGRDC) was the executing agency (EA) of the Project. The Project was required to use a demand and performance driven approach to extend water supply and sanitation to approximately 8, 53, 000 people of 16 selected Pourashavas named Brahmanbaria, Choumuhani, Jessore, Jhenaidah, Joypurhat, Kishorganj, Lakshmipur, Madaripur, Moulvibazar, Mymensingh, Narsingdi, Natore, Netrokona, Pirojpur, Sirajganj and Sherpur. This project use some unique project management methodology and Project Performance, Monitoring & Evaluation (PPME) techniques to overcome the limitation of traditional project management framework used in government sector. The Project was highly relevant to ADB’s sector strategy for urban water supply and sanitation in Bangladesh & consistent with the Government’s policies of decentralization and beneficiary participation. The overarching outcome of the Project was aimed at providing sustainable access to improved and safe water and sanitation services in the project areas. More specific outcomes included (i) increase of quantity and quality of water supply; (ii) increase of sanitation coverage; (iii) improvement of community awareness of the link among proper hygiene, sanitation, and health; (iv) improvement of the capacity of Pourashavas to implement, operate, manage, and maintain water supply and sanitation investments; (v) adoption of improved management practices consistent with the Sector Development Program-Water Supply and Sanitation Sector in Bangladesh (SDP-WSSB) for greater efficiency and sustainability of local water utilities; and (vi) improvement of the capacity of DPHE to plan, design, supervise, monitor, and provide technical assistance to Pourashavas and local water utilities Water supply improvements under STWSSP had been implemented in two phases. In the first phase the existing piped water supply system within the Pourashava was rehabilitated and restored to its original capacity including 184. 69 km water mains, 6 AIRP, 22 OHT, 1 SWTP and regeneration of 48 Production Well as well as 15, 354 no. s house connections. As for instance, before rehabilitation total household connections were 45, 567 no. s, which increased to 49, 930 after the completion of phase- 1 and the total meter installed were 36, 811 no. s in 16 Pourashavas. In Phase 2, the capacity and geographic coverage of the piped water supply systems were expanded to cover additional areas that are financially feasible. In this regard 85 production tube wall, 8 AIRP, 4 SWTP, 16 OHT were newly constructed. This increased both the Production capacity from 5, 894. 67 m 3 /hr to 13, 604 m 3 /hr and production time form 8 - 10 hrs/day to 10 - 15 hrs/day. Also 708 Km new distribution line and 101 Km of new transmission line were laid to increase the geographic coverage of the Pourashavas’s pipe water supply. An increase of 49856 new water connection and 64954 water meters installed increase the revenue financial health of the Pourashavas. The sanitation condition were improved by 62 new public toilet, 315 new community latrines, 160 new school latrine and 914 household latrines under the second phase. Also 26 <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> <b>sludge</b> removal equipment and the construction of 11 sludge treatment plant increase the sanitation condition of the poura people Thus The Project well achieved its purposes, which were to improve health conditions, enhance urban household life quality, and accelerate commercial development through increasing availability of and access to safe water and improved environmental sanitation services, septage sludge management and facilities. The Project covered more than an additional 853, 000 people in 16 Pourashavas; increased sanitation coverage from 74 % to 100 %; integrated physical facilities with hygiene education and community participation; and strengthened DPHE and Pourashava institutional capabilities. Pourashavas enhanced their technical capability for municipal facilities supervision and O&M and improved their financial performance, especially in tax assessment and collection. The future sustainability of operations of completed project facilities was supported through training of operations staff members at Pourashavas. Staff member training covered key operational areas, such as technical matters, maintenance issues, record keeping, and operations management. Particular attention was given to each SWTP and IRP installation, where close and frequent monitoring, to guard against river water level fluctuation, water quality and iron buildup in pumps, valves, and flow meters, was very important. In addition, extensive training was provided to upgrade Pourashavas’ administrative and financial capacities, to help them become financially self-sufficient and guarantee the sustainability of investments made under the Project. As reflected in the overall comparatively better income to expenditure ratios and observed by the project management team during implementation, training efforts for administrative and financial management need to be continued Considering the overall achievement of project objectives and benefits to the urban poor, the Project can be rated as successful...|$|E

This study was focused on domestic sludge from four types of sewage treatment plants, namely activated sludge, oxidation pond, and aerated lagoon and community <b>septic</b> <b>tank.</b> This <b>sludge</b> were then applied to agricultural land by surface spraying to application cells of 0. 091 m 2 area at different application rates of 0 £ 1 m 2, 2 £ 1 m 2, 4 £/m 2, 6 £ 1 m 2, 8 £ 1 m 2 and 10 £ 1 m 2 • These cells were then planted with three different types of plants, ipomoea aquatica, spinacia oleracea and brassica juncea and were placed in the open with a transparent roof to simulate the natural environment while allowing control of soil moisture at 60 %. Three different cross sections such as roots, stems and leaves were separately analyzed for heavy metal absorption by the plants. Analysis were conducted using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) showed that these domestic sludge contain aluminium (AI), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn). The study of uptake of metals by the plants at various rates of sludge application showed that the relationships between the parameters studied are polynomial. Higher concentrations of metals were found in the roots compared to the other parts of plants. In general, this study has succeeded in determining heavy metal contents of domestic sludge from several treatment sources. The use of plants has helped in reducing metal content both in the sludge and agricultural land under study...|$|R
40|$|A {{properly}} designed, installed ao 1 d maintained <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> {{system is}} an approved method of sewage treatment for private residences in rural or urban areas where public sewage treatment {{systems are not}} available. The components of a septic system are the house sewer, the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> and the absorption field, as illustrated in Figure 1. Sewage flows to the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> through the house sewer. In the <b>septic</b> <b>tank,</b> the solids are separated from the liquids, undergo anaerobic digestion and are stored as sludge {{at the bottom of}} the <b>tank.</b> The liquid (<b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> effluent) flows to the absorption field where it percolates into the soil. The soil acts as a final treatment by removing bacteria, pathogens and fine particles. All household wastes and normal amounts of cleaning materials, including soaps, detergents, bleaches, drain cleaners and other mild chemical preparations, can be tolerated by a septic system. Roof drains and foundation drains should not be connected to the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> system. These sources of clear water only overload the septic system and may cause premature failure of the absorption field. <b>Septic</b> <b>Tank</b> Location The site of a <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> is usually determined by the location of major bathroom and kitchen plumbing within the home and by the slope of the land. Locate <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> at least 15 feet (4. 5 m) from the foundation walls and approximately straight out from the point where the house sewer pipe goes through the wall. Table 1 gives minimum distances between the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> system and water lines, property lines and surface water supplies. Locate the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> out of high traffic areas where excessive loads may damage the tank top. Keep clear of areas subject to flooding, ponding or surface drainage from surrounding areas. The location should be accessible to a driveway or other acceptable route so a tank truck can be driven close enough to pump out the sludge and clean the tank. Do not locate <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> under sidewalks or patios where the tank is inaccessible for pumping. Consider the possibility of future expansion and locations for additions, such as sidewalks, patios, garages and storage buildings, before selecting the tank site. Sizing and <b>Septic</b> <b>Tank</b> Construction The minimum <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> size for any installation is 1, 000 gallons (3, 800 I). For more than 3 bedrooms, add an additional capacity of 250 gallons (950 I) per bedroom. Garbag 3 disposals add an extra load to the system, requiring about 25 percent additional tank capacity. Minimum tank capacities are listed in Table 2. <b>Septic</b> <b>tanks</b> must be watertight and constructed of sound and durable materials that are not subject to excessive corrosion, frost damage, cracking or buckling due to settlement or back filling. Common construction materials include concrete, fiberglass and steel. Minimum liquid depth of the tank should be 4 feet (1. 2 m). The inlet should not be less than 2 inches (5 cm) above the liquid level. Many <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> shapes are satisfactory and the shape may depend on the type of material used. Figure 2 illustrates a typical <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> with sanitary tees used as baffles on the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> inlet and outlet...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. <b>Septic</b> <b>tank</b> systems are commonly used for treating domestic wastewater and {{an essential part of}} decentralized wastewater management systems. Many studies have considered <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> in terms of their design, performance and their impact on the environment. However, studies that have modelled <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> to test their performance for the removal of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) are scant. This paper presents an approach to model <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> using the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM). The developed approach has been then applied to assess the influence of <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> design configurations on pollution reduction.

40|$|<b>Septic</b> <b>tanks</b> {{and soil}} {{adsorption}} fields are a commonly used {{wastewater treatment system}} in unsewered areas. The biological processes on which they rely were considered in detail and their operating requirements established along with the assumptions underlying {{the design of the}} treatment system. The principal regions in which <b>septic</b> <b>tanks</b> and adsorption fields are used in Tasmania were also established and the environmental conditions in these areas were compared with the operating and design conditions of <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> and adsorption field systems. From this the suitability of <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> wastewater treatment in the particular areas of use was predicted. In highland areas <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> and adsorption field systems were considered to be unsuitable for wastewater treatment whilst in lowland areas their suitability is dependent upon site characteristics. No region of <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> and adsorption field use in Tasmania was considered to be completely suitable for this form of wastewater treatment. The environmental conditions of two dissimilar sites, Mt. Mawson and Carlton, were characterised and the performance of <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> and adsorption field systems under them assessed. The behaviour of the treatment systems was consistent with the predictions made earlier. Within this study several deficiencies in <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> and adsorption field design and operation, both in Tasmania generally and specifically at the two study sites, were highlighted.

It was found out that the performance of the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> depended on the degree of its cleanliness: when the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> was clean and retention time was three days, SS and BOS 7 removal efficiency was 77 ± 10 % and 67 ± 14 % respectively, whereas two months later, after <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> desludging, SS removal efficiency decreased to 53 ± 22 % and BOD 7 to 32 ± 31 %. The performance of the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> also depended on theoretical wastewater retention time: when some amount of solids was accumulated {{at the bottom of the}} <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> and wastewater retention time was one day, SS and BOS 7 removal efficiency was 45 ± 40 % and 33 ± 16 % respectively; when retention time was three days, SS removal efficiency increased to 53 ± 22 % but BOD 7 removal efficiency remained similar to one day retention time, i. e. 32 ± 31 %.
