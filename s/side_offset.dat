50|$|The first Twyford station {{opened on}} 1 July 1839 {{and was the}} {{terminus}} of the GWR until 30 March 1840, pending the completion of Sonning Cutting. It was a timber building {{to the north of}} the line at right angles to the track. The actual platform was on a loop off the running line and served trains running in either direction, of which there were nine per weekday. Just to the west was a temporary engine shed, moved here from Maidenhead, the first terminus. After the opening to Reading the shed was removed and a platform was provided on the south <b>side</b> <b>offset</b> to the west. The line was crossed by a footpath between the platform ends.|$|E

5000|$|In 1914, Sundback {{developed}} a version based on interlocking teeth, the [...] "Hookless No. 2", {{which was the}} modern metal zipper in all its essentials. In this fastener each tooth is punched to have a dimple on its bottom and a nib or conical projection on its top. The nib atop one tooth engages in the matching dimple {{in the bottom of}} the tooth that follows it on the other side as the two strips of teeth are brought together through the two Y channels of the slider. The teeth are crimped tightly to a strong fabric cord that is the selvage edge of the cloth tape that attaches the zipper to the garment, with the teeth on one <b>side</b> <b>offset</b> by half a tooth's height from those on the other side's tape. They are held so tightly to the cord and tape that once meshed there is not enough play to let them pull apart.

50|$|The {{historically}} indifferent {{performance of}} the senior <b>side</b> was <b>offset</b> {{by the success of}} the club's youth team, which captured a national championship in the under-18's in 1993, being the last non-Bundesliga club to do so.

With Schuhmann's departure for Bayern Munich, the golden age of FCA youth football ended and the club could not quite achieve so highly again. With the formation of the Under 19 Bundesliga (2004) and Under 17 Bundesliga (2007), the club's youth teams slipped to second division status but recovered and, in 2013-14, the youth teams played in the Under 19 Bundesliga and Under 17 Bundesliga, the first tier of youth football in Germany at their respective age levels.|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of visual}} {{obstruction}} on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) include enhanced vigilance and flight-initiation distances. Prior work suggests that artificial visual barriers might enhance perceived risk of predation to deer. During 2008 – 2010 at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Plum Brook Station (Erie County, OH), {{we tested the}} hypotheses that visual obstruction of winter feeding stations would result in fewer white-tailed deer visiting treatment stations and increased vigilance exhibited relative to deer using control stations. When feeding stations were bounded on 3 sides by a 22. 5 -m-long, 1. 5 -m-high, continuous, polyethylene visual barrier (including a 5 -m opening on the fourth <b>side),</b> and <b>offset</b> from the food resource by 22. 5 m, we observed no differences in deer use or vigilance compared with control stations (4. 5 -cm mesh, snow fencing only). In a second experiment, feeding stations bounded by individual, 1. 5 -m-high, polyethylene visual barriers, positioned on 3 <b>sides</b> only and <b>offset</b> from the food resource by only 7. 6 m each, were characterized by 1) fewer deer, 2) increased alert behavior (e. g., head held above horizontal, ears erect, body posture noticeably stiff and animal paused, directed attention, tail flagging, or fleeing) by deer using the stations, and 3) fewer deer using stations at night, relative to control stations. Visual barriers offset at most by 7. 6 m from a food resource (e. g., crops), or located randomly within target areas frequented by deer can offer temporary and easily manipulated means of diminishing deer use of resources on unfenced General Aviation airports or depredation of agricultural crops, and ready integration with other management methods.

40|$|A vernier offset is {{detected}} at once among straight lines, and reaction times are almost {{independent of the}} number of simultaneously presented stimuli (distractors), indicating parallel processing of vernier offsets. Reaction times for identifying a vernier <b>offset</b> to one <b>side</b> among verniers <b>offset</b> to the opposite side increase with the number of distractors, indicating serial processing. Even deviations below a photoreceptor diameter can be detected at once. The visual system thus attains positional accuracy below the photoreceptor diameter simultaneously at different positions. I conclude that deviation from straightness, or change of orientation, {{is detected}} in parallel over the visual field. Discontinuities or gradients in orientation may represent an elementary feature of vision...|$|R
50|$|Grand Avenue was {{a station}} on the {{demolished}} BMT Fulton Street Line. It opened on April 24, 1888, and had two tracks and two <b>offset</b> <b>side</b> platforms.
