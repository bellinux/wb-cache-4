5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E
5|$|All these controversies {{have led}} {{ethnic groups in}} Macedonia to use terms in {{conflicting}} ways. Despite {{the fact that these}} terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> region in general.|$|E
5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus learnt that Galba {{had been}} murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E

5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle {{and the amount of}} trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|In Dark Forces II, {{the player}} has {{the option of}} a third-person view, plus an option to switch {{automatically}} to third-person when the lightsaber is the selected weapon. Three types of Force powers are introduced in this game: Light powers provide non violent advantages, Dark powers provide violent ones, while Neutral powers enhance athletic abilities. The game has two endings, {{depending on whether the}} player chooses to focus on the Light <b>Side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Dark Side.|$|E
5|$|Spicer took {{written and}} oral {{testimony}} {{from a number}} of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory.

A defensive attitude involves lying {{flat on the ground}} or crouching with wings spread out.|$|E
5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The {{smoke from the}} black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses {{who did not know}} the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} their strategy in the battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, {{but once he}} took office, {{he had to come}} down on one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|Mysteries of the Sith is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, but offers {{the choice of a}} third-person view. Unlike Dark Forces II, where the player's actions within the game dictate whether the story ends with the light <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> dark side ending, Mysteries of the Sith has a single, morally positive course. The player progresses through the game in a linear fashion; there are fourteen levels and each has set objectives that the player must complete before being able to continue to the next level. Within each level the player can encounter both hostile and non-hostile non-player characters (NPCs). As well as including some enemies that featured in Dark Forces II, Mysteries of the Sith adds twenty new monsters, including a rancor. Some non-hostile NPCs may help the player by attacking enemies.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, the {{retreating}} Patriot force held drumhead courts-martial of Loyalists on various charges (treason, desertion from Patriot militias, incitement of Indian rebellion). Passing through the Sunshine community {{in what is}} now Rutherford County, N.C., the retreat halted on the property of the Biggerstaff family. Aaron Biggerstaff, a Loyalist, had fought in the battle and been mortally wounded. His brother Benjamin was a Patriot and was being held as a prisoner-of-war on a British ship docked at Charleston, S.C. Their cousin John Moore was the Loyalist commander at the earlier Battle of Ramsour's Mill (modern Lincolnton, N.C.), in which many of the combatants at Kings Mountain had participated on one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E
5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether {{the wind is blowing}} from one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other. When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Salter Path, North Carolina {{and along}} the Outer Banks near that community, where (despite being only a Category 1 storm) many buildings suffered significant damage {{as a result of}} the storm surge, which has been described as worse than Hurricane Isabel in 2003 and even compared to Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Nearly all of the significant damage occurred on the sound <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> side facing the mainland. In addition, several piers and many boats were damaged or destroyed by Ophelia's storm surge. Damage was generally lighter on the mainland, and overall structural damage was relatively light, although there was considerable flooding reported in the Wilmington area. Damage was initially estimated to be about $1.6billion, but in final analysis was dropped to only $70million (2005USD; $77.3million 2008USD). On October7, President George W. Bush declared a state of emergency for ten counties in North Carolina as a result of Ophelia.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June 68, amidst growing {{opposition}} of the Senate and the army, Nero committed suicide, and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors, during which the four most influential generals in the Roman EmpireGalba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasiansuccessively vied for the imperial power. News of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of Jerusalem. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of Hispania Tarraconensis (modern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor. Before reaching Italy however, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt, and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
