The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.|$|E

25|$|The {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} Navier–Stokes equations for turbulent flow is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales {{that are involved in}} turbulent flow, the stable solution of this requires <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation or direct numerical simulation. Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Some models include the Spalart–Allmaras, –, –, and SST models, which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations. Large eddy simulation (LES) {{can also be used to}} solve these equations numerically. This approach is computationally more expensive—in time and in computer memory—than RANS, but produces better results because it explicitly resolves the larger turbulent scales.|$|E

25|$|The nodes of {{this network}} can {{represent}} genes, proteins, mRNAs, protein/protein complexes or cellular processes. Nodes that are depicted as lying along vertical lines {{are associated with}} the cell/environment interfaces, while the others are free-floating and can diffuse. Edges between nodes represent interactions between the nodes, that can correspond to individual molecular reactions between DNA, mRNA, miRNA, proteins or molecular processes through which the products of one gene affect those of another, though the lack of experimentally obtained information often implies that some reactions are not modeled at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> level of detail. These interactions can be inductive (usually represented by arrowheads or the + sign), with an increase in the concentration of one leading to an increase in the other, inhibitory (represented with filled circles, blunt arrows or the minus sign), with an increase in one leading to a decrease in the other, or dual, when depending of the circumstances the regulator can activate or inhibit the target node. The nodes can regulate themselves directly or indirectly, creating feedback loops, which form cyclic chains of dependencies in the topological network. The network structure is an abstraction of the system's molecular or chemical dynamics, describing the manifold ways in which one substance affects all the others to which it is connected. In practice, such GRNs are inferred from the biological literature on a given system and represent a distillation of the collective knowledge about a set of related biochemical reactions. To speed up the manual curation of GRNs, some recent efforts try to use text mining, curated databases, network inference from massive data, model checking and other information extraction technologies for this purpose.|$|E

2500|$|Justice O'Connor, {{presenting}} the (4-5) dissenting opinion, {{stated that the}} historical evidence was not uniform in rejecting Atwater's proposed rule and reasoned that the Fourth Amendment required a balancing of interests {{in the case of}} an arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor. [...] The court dissent in Atwater precluded the sole use of probable cause in Whren v. United States, , where the Court had held that, on balance, it was reasonable to allow the police to make a traffic stop whenever they spied a violation of the traffic laws, although a traffic stop was a seizure. But, because of the length of the typical traffic stop and the fact that most drivers are free to go after it is done, such a seizure was commensurate with the magnitude of the violation and sufficient to ensure that the offender would appear later in court if necessary. [...] The dissent elucidated, “probable cause” and “extraordinary” circumstances as delineated in Terry v. Ohio, Whren v. United States, etc., have also proved less than problematic. [...] Strong argument to the contrary also remains as to the merit of the majority opinion that “personal § 1983 liability for the misapplication of a constitutional standard…would guarantee increased litigation.” In Atwater, the dissent further argued that Atwater could not have been characterized as a possible flight risk by the arresting officer, since she was known to him and was an established member of the community and that respondents failed to substantiate any demonstrable merit for the arrest decision. They further noted that arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor was not reasonable because sending someone to jail for up to 48 hours (the time necessary to get him or her before a magistrate to be released) was too great an intrusion upon the personal liberty interests of anyone who had committed a relatively minor offense as would only merit <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> as punishment.|$|E
