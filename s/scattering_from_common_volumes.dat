The feasibility of employing intersecting beams to evaluate the atmospheric turbulent motion was also investigated.

30|$|Recently, Xu et al. (2013) showed {{longitudinal}} {{variations of}} the thermospheric temperature from satellite observations with SABER and Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) and simulations with TIE-GCM. Their simulations clarified that auroral heating would cause the observed longitudinal temperature variations. In addition, the satellite observations indicated that impacts of auroral heating on the neutral atmosphere can penetrate down to about 105  km. The lidar observations are quite useful to study thermospheric disturbances in the MLT region. For example, Chu et al. (2011) observed temperature enhancements caused by Joule heating and fast gravity waves propagating from the lower atmosphere in the neutral Fe layers (110 to 155  km) in Antarctica. Tsuda et al.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{analytic}} {{results for the}} phase shifts delta_{l}(k) in non-relativistic <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> a spherical well. The conditions {{for the existence of}} resonances are established in terms of time-delays. Resonances are shown to exist for p-waves (and higher angular momenta) but not for s-waves. These resonances occur when the potential is not quite strong enough to support a bound p-wave of zero energy. We then examine relativistic scattering by spherical wells and barriers in the Dirac equation. In contrast to the non-relativistic situation, s-waves are now seen to possess resonances in <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> both wells and barriers. When s-wave resonances occur for <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> a well, the potential is not quite strong enough to support a zero momentum s-wave solution at E = m.

40|$|New optical {{arrangements}} with two single-mode input fibers and a fiber-optic coupler are devised {{to measure the}} instantaneous velocity difference and local velocity. The fibers and the coupler are polarization-preserving to guarantee a high signal-to-noise ratio. When the two input fibers are used to collect the scattered light with the same momentum transfer vector but from two spatially separated regions in a flow, the obtained signals interfere when combined via the fiber-optic coupler. The resultant light received by a photomultiplier tube contains a cross-beat frequency proportional to the velocity {{difference between the two}} measuring points. If the two input fibers are used to collect the <b>scattered</b> light <b>from</b> a <b>common</b> <b>scattering</b> region but with two different momentum transfer vectors, the resultant light then contains a self-beat frequency proportional to the local velocity at the measuring point. The experiment shows that both the cross-beat and self-beat signals are large and the standard laser Doppler signal processor can be used to measure the velocity difference and local velocity in real time. The new technique will have various applications in the general area of fluid dynamics. Comment: Patent number: 67437 for associated information on the hardware, see [URL]...|$|R
