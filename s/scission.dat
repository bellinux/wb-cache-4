25|$|The {{degradation}} of polymers to form smaller molecules may proceed by random <b>scission</b> or specific <b>scission.</b> The {{degradation of}} polyethylene occurs by random scission—a random breakage of the bonds that hold the atoms of the polymer together. When heated above 450°C, polyethylene degrades to form a mixture of hydrocarbons. Other polymers, such as poly(alpha-methylstyrene), undergo specific chain <b>scission</b> with breakage occurring only at the ends. They literally unzip or depolymerize back to the constituent monomer.|$|E

Previously reported chain <b>scissioning</b> polysulfone resists were able to achieve enhanced sensitivity by incorporation of absorbing repeat units, but these groups also inhibited the depolymerization reaction, which could further enhance sensitivity.

40|$|International audienceThis paper reports an {{investigation}} of the thermal degradation of a poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-methyl methacrylate) triblock terpolymer compared with those of butadiene rubbers and poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate). According to sol-gel properties changes, it was proposed that polybutadiene blocks undergo mainly crosslinking. However, these latter coexist with chain <b>scissions</b> occurring in polybutadiene blocks, which generates poly(butadiene-b-methyl methacrylate) and poly(butadiene-b-styrene) diblock chains, and possibly chain <b>scissions</b> occurring in polystyrene and poly(methyl methacylate) blocks. The consequences of the degradation on the self-assembly of triblock terpolymer were studied through the annealing kinetics monitored by Atomic Force Microscopy. It appears that at low conversion degrees, chain <b>scissions</b> induce a faster self-assembly kinetics. At higher oxidation degrees, crosslinking of butadiene phase combined with <b>scissions</b> induces a “frozen” state at high annealing times characterized by a macrophase separation...|$|R

25|$|Polymer {{degradation}} is {{a change}} in the properties—tensile strength, color, shape, or molecular weight—of a polymer or polymer-based product under the influence of one or more environmental factors, such as heat, light, chemicals and, in some cases, galvanic action. It is often due to the <b>scission</b> of polymer chain bonds via hydrolysis, leading to a decrease in the molecular mass of the polymer.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, it {{was found}} that PTFE could be {{radiation}} cross-linked above its melting point in an oxygen-free environment. Electron beam processing is one example of radiation processing. Cross-linked PTFE has improved high-temperature mechanical properties and radiation stability. This was significant because, for many years, irradiation at ambient conditions has been used to break down PTFE for recycling. This radiation-induced chain <b>scission</b> allows it to be more easily reground and reused.|$|E

40|$|The {{action of}} the dimer-specific {{endonuclease}} V of bacteriophage T 4 was studied on UV-irradiated, covalently-closed circular DNa. Form I ColE 1 DNA preparations containing average dimer frequencies ranging from 2. 5 to 35 pyrimidine dimers per molecule were treated with T 4 endonuclease V and analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. At all dimer frequencies examined, the production of form III DNA was linear with time and the double-strand <b>scissions</b> were made randomly on the ColE 1 DNA genome. Since the observed fraction of form III DNA increased with increasing dimer frequency but the initial rate of loss of form I decreased with increasing dimer frequency, it was postulated that multiple single-strand <b>scissions</b> could be produced in {{a subset of the}} DNA population while some DNA molecules contained no <b>scissions.</b> When DNA containing an average of 25 dimers per circle was incubated with limiting enzyme concentrations, <b>scissions</b> appeared at most if not all dimmer sites in some molecules before additional strand <b>scissions</b> were produced in other DNA molecules. The results support a processive model for the interaction of T 4 endonuclease V with UV-irradiated DNA...|$|R

25|$|Polymer {{oxidation}} {{has caused}} accidents involving medical devices. One {{of the oldest}} known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain <b>scission</b> when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural rubber and nitrile rubber. They possess double bonds in their repeat units which are cleaved during ozonolysis. Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and cause fuel leakage. If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.|$|E
25|$|The {{catalytic}} cracking process involves {{the presence of}} acid catalysts (usually solid acids such as silica-alumina and zeolites) which promote a heterolytic (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C-C <b>scission</b> in position beta as in cracking, and intra- and intermolecular hydrogen transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding reactive intermediates (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism.

25|$|In {{semiconductor}} {{research and}} industry, PMMA aids as a resist in the {{electron beam lithography}} process. A solution consisting of the polymer in a solvent is used to spin coat silicon and other semiconducting and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this {{can be made by}} an electron beam (using an electron microscope), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard photolithography process), or X-rays. Exposure to these creates chain <b>scission</b> or (de-cross-linking) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA's advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made. Smooth PMMA surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured PMMA surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a molecular dynamics {{study on the}} change in Young's modulus of semi-crystalline polymers during degradation by chain <b>scissions,</b> which is relevant {{to the study of}} mechanical properties of biodegrading polymers. Using a simple polymer model whose structural and mechanical properties are similar to that of a commonly used biodegrading polymer poly(glycolic acid), we combine molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo to model a system of two polymer crystals separated by an amorphous region between them. The polymer chains in the amorphous region are cut randomly to mimic hydrolysis chain <b>scissions.</b> In a series of virtual tensile tests, the systems with various numbers of chain <b>scissions</b> are subjected to a unidirectional deformation. We find that at temperatures below the glass transition temperature of the model polymer, the Young's modulus of the system reduces quickly with the number of chain <b>scissions,</b> while at temperatures above the glass transition temperature, the Young's modulus reduction lags behind the polymer chain <b>scissions.</b> This observation supports the entropy-spring model of amorphous polymers proposed by Wang et al., which suggests that Young's modulus above the glass transition temperature is dominated by the internal energy of the system, while below the glass transition temperature it is dominated by the entropy of the amorphous phase. The numerical study therefore provides a molecular understanding of the widely observed behaviours of semi-crystalline biodegradable polymers. 10088...|$|R

25|$|Nonribosomal peptide {{synthesis}} occurs through distinct modules {{that can}} load {{and extend the}} protein by one amino acid through the amide bond formation at the contact sites of the activating domains. Each module typically consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain, and a condensation (C) or elongation domain. In the A domain, the specific amino acid is activated by converting into an aminoacyl adenylate enzyme complex attached to a 4'phosphopantetheine cofactor by thioesterification The complex is then transferred to the PCP domain with the expulsion of AMP. The PCP domain uses the attached 4'-phosphopantethein prosthetic group to load the growing peptide chain and their precursors. The organization of the modules necessary to biosynthesize Vancomycin is shown in Figure 1. In the biosynthesis of Vancomycin, additional modification domains are present, such as the epimerization (E) domain, which isomerizes the amino acid from one stereochemistry to another, and a thioesterase domain (TE) {{is used as a}} catalyst for cyclization and releases of the molecule via a thioesterase <b>scission.</b>|$|E
