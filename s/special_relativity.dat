5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of <b>special</b> <b>relativity</b> hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in <b>special</b> <b>relativity.</b> The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of <b>special</b> <b>relativity</b> hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein {{published}} his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about <b>special</b> <b>relativity.</b> Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject.

Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so he could work with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.|$|E

In an addenda, we also comment on the physical importance of a phase factor that the whole literature on the subject has missed and present a brief critique of SR 2. In addition, we remark that the most natural and physically viable SR 2 shall require momentum-space and spacetime to be non-commutative with the non-commutativity determined by the spin content and C, P, and T properties of the examined representation space. Therefore, in a physically successful SR 2, the notion of spacetime {{is expected to be}} deeply intertwined with specific properties of the test particle. Comment: Int. J. Mod. Phys. D (in press).

5|$|To {{these rules}} we must add a further one for closed loops that implies an {{integration}} on momenta , since these internal ("virtual") particles are not constrained to any specific energy–momentum – even that usually required by <b>special</b> <b>relativity</b> (see this article for details).|$|E
5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of <b>special</b> <b>relativity.</b> Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for <b>special</b> <b>relativity,</b> in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} can {{be understood}} by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description.

25|$|Today, <b>special</b> <b>relativity's</b> {{predictions}} {{are routinely}} confirmed in particle accelerators {{such as the}} Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.

50|$|Under <b>special</b> <b>relativity's</b> {{simplified}} model Einstein {{assumes that}} light-dragging effects do not occur, {{and that the}} speed of light is independent of the speed of the emitting body's motion. However, the <b>special</b> theory of <b>relativity</b> does not deal with particulate matter effects or gravitational effects, nor does it provide a complete relativistic description of acceleration. When more realistic assumptions are made (that real objects are composed of particulate matter, and have gravitational properties), under general relativity's more sophisticated model the resulting descriptions include light-dragging effects.|$|R

5000|$|For {{images of}} passing objects, the {{apparent}} contraction of distances between {{points on the}} object's transverse surface could then be interpreted as being due to an apparent change in viewing angle, {{and the image of}} the object could be interpreted as appearing instead to be rotated.

5|$|In {{that same}} year, {{which has been}} called Einstein's annus mirabilis (miracle year), he {{published}} four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, <b>special</b> <b>relativity,</b> and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were {{to bring him to}} the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.|$|E
5|$|<b>Special</b> <b>relativity</b> {{has many}} {{counterintuitive}} and experimentally verified implications. These include the equivalence of mass and energy , length contraction (moving objects shorten), and time dilation (moving clocks run more slowly). The factorγ by which lengths contract and times dilate {{is known as}} the Lorentz factor and is given by , where v is the speed of the object. The difference of γ from 1 is negligible for speeds much slower thanc, such as most everyday speeds—in which case <b>special</b> <b>relativity</b> is closely approximated by Galilean relativity—but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as v approaches c. For example, a time dilation factor of γ=2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (v=.866c). Similarly, a time dilation factor of γ=10 occurs at v=99.5%c.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) is the relativistic {{quantum field theory}} of electrodynamics.

5000|$|When using <b>special</b> <b>relativity's</b> {{relativistic}} Doppler {{relationships to}} calculate the change in energy and frequency (assuming no complicating route-dependent effects such as those caused by the frame-dragging of rotating black holes), then the gravitational redshift and blueshift frequency ratios are the inverse of each other, suggesting that the [...] "seen" [...] frequency-change corresponds to the actual difference in underlying clockrate.

5|$|Lie {{groups are}} of {{fundamental}} importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, {{as well as}} translations {{in space and time}} are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in <b>special</b> <b>relativity.</b> The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in <b>special</b> <b>relativity</b> and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory.|$|E

5|$|The same {{experimental}} data shows that time {{as measured by}} clocks in a gravitational field—proper time, to give the technical term—does not follow the rules of <b>special</b> <b>relativity.</b> In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski metric. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The metric tensor that defines the geometry—in particular, how lengths and angles are measured—is not the Minkowski metric of <b>special</b> <b>relativity,</b> it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).|$|E
