40|$|The main aim of {{scheduling}} large {{manufacturing processes}} is to minimise the time taken to manufacture the product {{from start to}} finish, and maximise the utilisation of machinery/ personnel. However, {{as the number of}} tasks increases it becomes more difficult to find good schedules within a reasonable time. This paper explains the development of a Multiple Criteria Genetic Algorithm (MCGA) scheduler which evolves good schedules based on several criteria. The system is then demonstrated using a shipyard <b>steel-shop</b> problem. INTRODUCTION In most large scale engineering projects production scheduling {{plays an important role in}} making efficient use of resources and reducing manufacturing time. Research in scheduling has traditionally concentrated on using heuristics, ordered search or applying mathematical algorithms. However, as the size of the scheduling task increases so does the difficulty of finding good solutions within a reasonable time. It is common to split the task into a hierarch [...] ...|$|E
