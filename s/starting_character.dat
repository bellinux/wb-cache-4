5|$|Similar to Capcom's various Street Fighter titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a 2D {{fighting}} game {{in which}} players control various characters to engage in one-on-one combat, attempting to knock out the opponent by depleting their health. It is the first formal installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series and features dual-character selection and tag team battles. Instead of the typical best-of-three round format, matches consist of a single round. Players select two characters {{at the beginning of}} a match, each sporting their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> can tag in the off-screen character at any time during the fight. The dormant character will also slowly recover a portion of their vitality while the current character is fighting. If one character loses all of their vitality, then the tag partner will automatically come into play. The match continues until both characters on either team are defeated. If the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, then the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VI {{features}} fourteen permanent playable characters, {{the most}} of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. The <b>starting</b> <b>character,</b> Terra Branford, is a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire, thanks to a mind-controlling device, and is unfamiliar with love. Other primary characters include Locke Cole, a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women; Celes Chere, a former general of the Empire, who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices; Edgar Roni Figaro, a consummate womanizer and the king of Figaro, who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners; Sabin Rene Figaro, Edgar's brother, who fled the royal court in order to pursue his own path and hone his martial arts skills; Cyan Garamonde, a loyal knight to the kingdom of Doma who lost his family and friends as a result of Kefka poisoning the kingdom's water supply; Setzer Gabbiani, a habitual gambler and thrill seeker and owner of the world's only airship; Shadow, a ninja mercenary, who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners at various stages throughout the game; Relm Arrowny, a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers; Strago Magus, Relm's elderly grandfather and a Blue Mage; Gau, a feral child surviving since infancy in the harsh wilderness known as the Veldt; Mog, a Moogle from the mines of Narshe; Umaro, a savage but loyal sasquatch also from Narshe, talked into joining the Returners through Mog's persuasion; and Gogo, a mysterious, fully shrouded master of the art of mimicry.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the memory}} {{limitations}} of the PlayStation, both the graphics and gameplay of the port were altered. Several frames of character sprite animations were removed {{to reduce the amount}} of RAM usage. Most notably, the tag team combat was omitted. Instead of being able to switch between characters at will, the second character only comes into play during certain attacks, such as Variable Combinations and Variable Counters. In addition, the one-round battles used in the arcade and Sega Saturn versions were extended to a two-out-of-three round setup. The PlayStation version includes a code that allows players to compete in [...] "pseudo-tag team matches", provided that each player uses their opponent's <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> as their partner. For example, if Player 1 is controlling Ryu and Player 2 is controlling Wolverine, then Player 1's partner will be Wolverine and Player 2's partner will be Ryu.|$|E
50|$|Dragonica Mobile SEA {{features}} 6 different <b>starting</b> <b>characters,</b> {{each with}} their own unique attributes and playstyles, from magic cheesing Warlocks and Wizards, sneaky Thiefs and Assassins, to plain dash-and-brawl Knights and Gladiators.|$|R
50|$|The player {{starts the}} game with a party of four {{characters}}, who can be either the default characters or ones created by the player. Alternatively, the player may import characters from The Bard's Tale trilogy into Dragon Wars. During the game, the seven character slots can be filled with any combination of the <b>starting</b> <b>characters,</b> recruited characters, and summoned creatures.|$|R
2500|$|A {{condensed}} {{version of}} the film's plot becomes an add-on [...] "playset" [...] in the toys-to-life game Disney Infinity 3.0, with Finn and Rey becoming its <b>starting</b> <b>characters.</b> Poe Dameron and Kylo Ren are also playable add-on characters.|$|R
500|$|Winning battles may award {{the player}} money (GP) and items. Enemy monsters {{occasionally}} drop meat, {{which can be}} consumed by monster-class characters. Mutant classes may [...] "evolve" [...] at this point, randomly gaining either increased statistics or a new random magic spell or ability, possibly overwriting an existing one. Party members that lose HP during combat can have them restored via curative items, spells, inns, or elements of the world such as healing fountains. If a party member other than the <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> is defeated in battle, he or she loses a [...] "heart" [...] and must be resurrected in a town via the building with a large heart-shaped symbol on it. Defeated characters with no remaining hearts cannot be revived. An item can be bought at significant expense to restore a heart to a character. Alternatively, a fallen party member can also be replaced completely with a new character recruited from a town guild, regardless {{of the number of}} hearts they have remaining.|$|E
50|$|Bold denotes {{characters}} {{that may be}} chosen for the first mission. (A pre-order bonus also allows Opoona to be chosen as the <b>starting</b> <b>character.)</b> Hero Battles that unlock characters not in the starting roster (the <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> {{as well as the}} characters unlocked after the second mission as a result) are generally restricted to the characters associated faction (for example, Zhao Yun may only be unlocked through a Hero Battle if Sophie, Opoona, or ÅŒka is the <b>starting</b> <b>character),</b> though some characters (such as Honoka or Mitsunari Ishida) have Hero Battles that are available regardless of the chosen faction.|$|E
50|$|In 4th edition Tieflings {{have the}} same {{alignments}} choices as any other <b>starting</b> <b>character.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{character}} point {{values for}} Celestial characters in GURPS In Nomine {{are very high}} in relation to most other GURPS settings. <b>Starting</b> <b>characters</b> can easily exceed 800 points, and more experienced characters are likely to exceed 1500 points.|$|R
5000|$|A {{condensed}} {{version of}} the film's plot becomes a add-on [...] "playset" [...] in the toys-to-life game Disney Infinity 3.0, with Finn and Rey becoming its <b>starting</b> <b>characters.</b> Poe Dameron and Kylo Ren are also playable add-on characters.|$|R
5|$|There {{are nine}} playable stages in Versus mode, eight based {{on each of}} the <b>starting</b> <b>characters</b> (such as Princess Peach's Castle for Mario, Zebes for Samus, and Sector Z for Fox) and the unlockable Mushroom Kingdom, based around motifs from the {{original}} Super Mario Bros., even containing original sprites and the original version of the Overworld theme from that game.|$|R
50|$|The <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> of Omikron is Kay'l, {{a detective}} with amnesia. He later gets killed when leaving the first city.|$|E
5000|$|Characters do {{not have}} a printed Power cost or Lesson type and thus do not require Lessons to play, {{although}} they do require two Actions. Characters stay on the table and have special abilities that can be used by the player; some also provide Power. Each player must have a <b>starting</b> <b>Character</b> to represent them: the <b>starting</b> <b>Character</b> begins the game on the table and cannot be discarded from play. Only Characters with the [...] "Witch" [...] or [...] "Wizard" [...] keyword designation can be used as starting Characters.|$|E
5000|$|Some cards (including all Characters) {{have the}} keyword [...] "Unique", which {{indicates}} that {{only one of them}} can be in play at a time (for either player). The only exception is if both players have the same <b>starting</b> <b>Character.</b>|$|E
50|$|Might and Magic V uses a game engine {{based on}} that used by Might and Magic III: Isles of Terra. General {{gameplay}} is very similar. Because {{it is designed to}} be played alongside Might and Magic IV, with characters that have obtained some levels and other enhancements through play in Clouds of Xeen, gameplay is considerably more challenging for <b>starting</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|R
50|$|MR {{determines the}} odds of a hostile spell missing a <b>character.</b> <b>Characters</b> <b>start</b> with a base MR of 0. AC determines how much damage is reduced when dealt to a <b>character.</b> <b>Characters</b> <b>start</b> with a base AC of 100. HIT determines the {{likelihood}} of an assail skill hitting. DMG increases the damage of assail skills. <b>Characters</b> <b>start</b> with a base hit of 0.|$|R
50|$|There {{are nine}} playable stages in Versus mode, eight based {{on each of}} the <b>starting</b> <b>characters</b> (such as Princess Peach's Castle for Mario, Zebes for Samus, and Sector Z for Fox) and the unlockable Mushroom Kingdom, based around motifs from the {{original}} Super Mario Bros., even containing original sprites and the original version of the Overworld theme from that game.|$|R
50|$|Ceremonies are rituals {{to achieve}} {{specific}} effects. All ceremonies are extended actions, and {{all have a}} target number of successes equal to 2+ ceremony rating, unless otherwise stated. Purchase of this merit, however, is only important at character creation. The number of dots in this merit are equal to {{the total number of}} dots for ceremonies a <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> can have. For example, a <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> with 3 dots in the ceremony merit may have one 3-dot ceremony, three 1-dot ceremonies, or one 1-dot and one 2-dot ceremony. After this, ceremonies may be purchased at 2 xp per dot. The number of dots in the ceremony merit does not indicate a cap on how high a level ceremony you may purchase, and the new ceremonies are not treated as an expansion of the merit.|$|E
50|$|The game {{presents}} a <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> {{with the choice}} of various classes: returner (time traveler), homunculus (artificial humanoid), psychic, overlander (plane-shifter), dhampir, machinehead (animate machine like as Transformers) and intelligent weapon (including Chamber staff) etc. The setting is inspired by recent Japanese games, novels and animations, including Fate/stay night, Lyrical Nanoha and Haruhi Suzumiya series.|$|E
50|$|The Player's Handbook also {{introduced}} the Bard as a sixth base class; however, its usage in 1st edition was {{more akin to}} what would be called a prestige class in later editions, as {{it was not a}} legal choice for a <b>starting</b> <b>character.</b> Instead, a character had to start as a Fighter, change classes to a Thief, and finally switch classes once more to become a Bard.|$|E
5000|$|Combat and {{psychology}} of the characters is very detailed; similar to Dwarf Fortress, every colonist has a different personality. Initially, the player starts with three in-game characters.If the player does not like one of their character's attributes, they can keep generating new characters until they find a character they like. The initial <b>starting</b> <b>characters</b> can be renamed if the player wishes.|$|R
50|$|As {{the example}} right shows, the barcode {{consists}} of a <b>start</b> <b>character,</b> the postcode, the Delivery Point Suffix (DPS), a checksum character, and a stop character. The DPS is a two-character code ranging from 1A to 9T, with codes 9U to 9Z being accepted as default codes when no DPS has been allocated. The DPS {{can be found in}} Royal Mail's Postcode Address File.|$|R
50|$|Link {{has also}} made several cameo {{appearances}} in a few Mario games. He is a playable character via DLC in the newest installment to the Mario Kart series of games, Mario Kart 8. (He is available without a download in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.) He is also a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series, {{being one of the}} eight original <b>starting</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|R
50|$|First of all, {{a player}} chooses between a warrior or a mage {{for his or}} her <b>starting</b> <b>character.</b> On his journey he (or she) will meet a few more companions. There will be hirelings {{available}} for a fee should a player find any mission too challenging and need reinforcements. Each mission takes place in a game map generally full of enemies. Mission type ranges from rescue to escort to exterminate villains to treasure hunting.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{character}} progresses in levels, the skills become more refined. For instance, a <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> casting spells will acquire {{points in the}} skill called [...] "magic". After level 20, points are accumulated in either [...] "offensive magic" [...] or [...] "defensive magic", and attack spells will add points to the former, while healing spells add to the latter category. At later levels, these are also split, allowing higher level characters to specialize.|$|E
50|$|Starting with King of Fighters XIII, sets of UFS {{have been}} {{structured}} {{to allow for}} drafting to be a feasible format. Players draft using 6 packs, and build 40 card decks. After the draft, they may select any character card from the set to use as their <b>starting</b> <b>character.</b> The only special gameplay rules are that mulligans are shuffled into the deck, and only 3 cards are removed from the game upon cycling.|$|E
50|$|Escape {{characters}} {{are part of}} the syntax for many programming languages, data formats, and communication protocols. For a given alphabet an escape character's purpose is to <b>start</b> <b>character</b> sequences (so named escape sequences), which have to be interpreted differently from the same characters occurring without the prefixed escape character. An escape character may not have its own meaning, so all escape sequences are of two or more characters.|$|R
5000|$|...,+Read first <b>{{character}}</b> and <b>start</b> outer <b>character</b> reading loop -Skip forward if {{character is}} 0 >>++++>++++++++<->>>-+ End character reading loop ...|$|R
5000|$|In Be-Music Script, every {{command line}} starts with #. Lines <b>starting</b> with <b>characters</b> other than # {{are treated as}} comments.|$|R
50|$|Rubrication {{may also}} be used to {{emphasize}} the <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> of a canto or other division of text; this was often important because manuscripts often consist of multiple works in a single bound volume. This particular type of rubrication is similar to flourishing, wherein red ink is used to style a leading character with artistic loops and swirls. However, this process is far less elaborate than illumination, in which detailed pictures are incorporated into the manuscript often set in thin sheets of gold to give the appearance of light within the text.|$|E
50|$|World of Warcraft uses {{a repair}} system {{to act as}} a dynamic money sink. For a <b>starting</b> <b>{{character}},</b> repair costs are very small. As the character progresses, repair costs get more expensive to counter the increased money gain.Another example of a dynamic money sink is the fee charged to use the auction house. A percentage of the sale price on all auction house purchases is taxed by the game, removing that money from the system. Because it is a percentage, in times of inflation more money will be removed from the system, helping to curb the inflation.|$|E
5000|$|Limits on <b>starting</b> <b>character</b> {{classes and}} races All new {{characters}} {{were required to}} start at 1st level. Originally only races and character classes found in the Players Handbook were allowed. This was later modified to include some new character classes such as favoured soul and hexblade. Occasionally access to new races was granted under particular circumstances. For example, if a player chose to play the first adventure of the [...] "Bright Sands" [...] story arc, centaur could be chosen as a race. In another instance, a special card issued by RPGA allowed the player holding the card to create a kobold character.|$|E
50|$|Black Magic is a {{rare and}} shunned school that is persecuted by civilized folks. It is {{typically}} only learned by finding a copy of Ye Olde Book of Black Magick, written by Frater Pephedro, presumably a black wizard from ages long past. Black magic allows for communicating with the recently deceased, commanding undead creatures, and even wracking a target's soul with pain. The rulebook recommends not allowing <b>starting</b> <b>characters</b> {{to have access to}} Black Magic.|$|R
50|$|Pesina {{appeared}} in a videogame-based comedy film entitled Press <b>Start.</b> His <b>character</b> is named Lei Gong, the Chinese equivalent of Raiden.|$|R
50|$|<b>Starting</b> <b>characters</b> get {{a number}} of Dots to add to their Attributes. The player must choose primary, {{secondary}} and tertiary attribute categories, getting {{a large number of}} dots to assign to primary Attributes, a moderate number to assign to secondary Attributes and a small number for tertiary Attributes. The first Dot of each attribute is free, the 2nd to 4th Dots cost one Dot each, and the 5th Dot costs 2 Dots to fill in. The primary, secondary and tertiary designations have no effect after character creation.|$|R
