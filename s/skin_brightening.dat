5000|$|Koreans {{generally}} apply makeup {{every day}} {{because it offers}} sun protection, a major concern. A big focus of Korean skincare is skin lightening, [...] which is why many Korean cosmetic products have brightening properties. <b>Skin</b> <b>brightening</b> {{is not the same}} as skin bleaching, also known as skin whitening, which is a reduction of melanin in the skin. Instead, skin lightening is focused on treating hyperpigmentation.|$|E
40|$|Two {{concentrated}} and well-characterized fucoidan-rich extracts {{were investigated}} {{to determine their}} benefits in topical applications. An Undaria pinnatifida extract, containing 85 % fucoidan, and a Fucus vesiculosus co-extract, containing 60 % fucoidan and 30 % polyphenol, were assessed {{in a number of}} in vitro assays to measure the effect of the extracts on enzyme inhibition, glycation, antioxidant activity and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1) protein expression. Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies were also conducted to measure soothing, protection, wrinkle depth, brightness and skin spot intensity. Both extracts demonstrated marked inhibitory effects on processes linked to skin aging, including the increased expression of SIRT 1 in vitro. Clinical testing established the efficacy of the extracts in a range of the tested applications, relative to placebo. The Fucus vesiculosus extract with high polyphenol content demonstrated additional in vitro antioxidant activity, as well as improved efficacy in <b>skin</b> <b>brightening</b> applications, relative to placebo. The major effects of the Undaria pinnatifida extract aided skin immunity, soothing and protection, while the Fucus vesiculosus extract most significantly affected age spot reduction and increased brightness, soothing and protection...|$|E
40|$|The spa {{industry}} has achieved staggering growth over recent years. In 2015, there were 21, 020 U. S. spa locations, most common being day spas followed by resort/hotel spas. In 2002, the first hard {{data on the}} number of U. S. resort/hotel spa facilities was revealed to the public. Since that time, the number of resort/hotel spa facilities has grown an additional 56 %. Regardless of the staggering growth and size of the resort spa market, there are very few studies to help increase our understanding of this promising industry. As the industry expands and the spa-goer becomes savvier, {{it is important to know}} the range of spa menu offerings. Fourteen data sets of industry and member reports by the International Spa Association were collected, analyzed, and appropriate data extracted to create a comprehensive overview of U. S. resort spa menu offerings. Findings reveal that all resort spas offered massage, skin care and body services in 2016. Salon services were offered by 90 % of all resort spas, followed by fitness or sports activities (62 %), mind, body and spirit (56 %), hydrotherapy (47 %), complementary therapies (29 %), wellness programs (13 %) and medically supervised services (11 %). Most common menu offerings included Swedish, pregnancy, deep tissue, and stone massages; anti-aging, sensitive <b>skin,</b> <b>brightening,</b> exfoliating and men’s facials; body wraps and scrubs and nail services. The report provides a comprehensive look at the most recent descriptive data on resort spa offerings...|$|E

50|$|Although {{most artists}} differ over the {{significance}} of selecting an exact match to the wearer's skin tone, intentionally using a mismatch can achieve a desired result. An excessively red complexion can be minimised by using a clear (meaning neither yellow nor pink) beige toned foundation. A sallow or dull complexion can be brightened with a rose to red tint, mature skin that has lost its color and appears pale and dull can be brightened with a tint of clear pink, and olive or ashy <b>skin</b> can be <b>brightened</b> with a shot of peach. A crucial point in selecting a foundation shade is to recognise that {{the appearance of the}} shade in the container may not accurately gauge the colour impact on the skin — a foundation that appears very yellow in the bottle may go on much less yellow, or not appear yellow at all.|$|R
