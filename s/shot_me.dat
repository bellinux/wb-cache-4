25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they <b>shot</b> <b>me</b> in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

500|$|In Cheek to Cheek, Gaga sings solo on [...] "Lush Life", [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby <b>Shot</b> <b>Me</b> Down)" [...] and [...] "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye", while Bennett's solo {{includes}} [...] "Don't Wait Too Long" [...] and [...] "Sophisticated Lady". According to Gaga, [...] "Lush Life" [...] and [...] "Sophisticated Lady" [...] complemented each other; for Bennett, the complement {{came from}} the fact that Duke Ellington wrote [...] "Sophisticated Lady" [...] and later collaborated with Strayhorn for [...] "Lush Life". Gaga sang [...] "Lush Life" [...] in her school choir, but it was only later she understood the lyrical interpretation of the track, about failure and heartache. While recording Cheek to Cheek she was emotionally upset about her professional and personal conflicts encountered during the Artpop era; Bennett had to support and guide her through the process. Newman recalled that [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby <b>Shot</b> <b>Me</b> Down)" [...] was recorded during the taping of the duo's show at Lincoln Center. Gaga had informed the musicians about performing the song, and piano player Alex Smith made the necessary musical arrangements the night before the concert.

[...] Erin Strecker from Billboard reviewed Gaga's performance of [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby <b>Shot</b> <b>Me</b> Down)" [...] calling her rendition as [...] "incredible" [...] and saying that her [...] "version is all big notes and dramatic tension.

Chér, also released in 1966, contains the Burt Bacharach and Hal David composition [...] "Alfie", which {{was added to the}} credits of the American version of the 1966 film of the same name and became the first stateside version of the popular song.

Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand, Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun. Virgil and Wyatt were now firing. Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground.

500|$|Cher gained {{popularity}} in 1965 as {{one-half of the}} folk rock husband-wife duo Sonny & Cher after their song [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] reached {{number one on the}} American and British charts. By the end of 1967, they had sold 40million records worldwide and had become, according to Time magazine, rock's [...] "it" [...] couple.

500|$|In 1980, Sinatra's {{first album}} {{in six years}} was released, , a highly ambitious triple album that {{features}} an array of songs from both the pre-rock era and rock era. It was the first studio album of Sinatra's to feature his touring pianist at the time, Vinnie Falcone, and {{was based on an}} idea by Sonny Burke. The album garnered six Grammy nominations– winning for best liner notes– and peaked at number 17 on Billboards album chart, and spawned yet another song that would become a signature tune, [...] "Theme from New York, New York". That year, as part of the Concert of the Americas, he performed in the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which broke records for the [...] "largest live paid audience ever recorded for a solo performer". The following year, Sinatra built on the success of Trilogy with She <b>Shot</b> <b>Me</b> Down, an album that was praised for embodying the dark tone of his Capitol years. Also in 1981, Sinatra was embroiled in controversy when he worked a ten-day engagement for $2million in Sun City, in the internationally unrecognized Bophuthatswana, breaking a cultural boycott against apartheid-era South Africa. President Lucas Mangope awarded Sinatra with the highest honor, the Order of the Leopard, and made him an honorary tribal chief.|$|E
