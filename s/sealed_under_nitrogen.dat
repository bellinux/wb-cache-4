The initial {{degree of crystallinity}} was calculated {{as a function of}} time and recrystallisation circa 20 degrees C below T-g was demonstrated. Slow cooled material in pinholed or hermetic pans (<b>sealed</b> <b>under</b> <b>nitrogen)</b> showed a T-g at 25. 1 degrees C, two exothermic transitions at circa 80 - 85 degrees C and 120 - 130 degrees C followed by melting at 156. 9 degrees C; a single exotherm at 83 degrees C was observed for material sealed in hermetic pans under ambient conditions. Hot stage microscopy yielded complementary information on crystal growth and transformation profile. A transformation scheme is proposed which indicates that amorphous paracetamol may transform into Form 111, 11 or I depending on the thermal history and the gaseous environment in which recrystallisation takes place. The study has demonstrated that the thermal history and encapsulation method may profoundly influence the polymorphic forms generated from amorphous paracetamol. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

The formation of {{conjugated linoleic acid}}s (CLAs) has been observed during thermal induction of the above-mentioned triacylglycerols at 250, 280 and 320 A degrees C.

Such a mixture would give researchers a reference standard that can be used in the identification of CLAs in GC analyses of relevant samples. Fifteen-microlitre portions of the triacylglycerol samples containing 9 c 11 t/ 10 t 12 c fatty acid were placed in micro-glass ampoules, <b>sealed</b> <b>under</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and then subjected to thermal treatment.

The results show that the thermally induced glyceride samples of 9 c 11 t/ 10 t 12 c fatty acids gave CLA profiles containing isomers ranging from 7 t 9 c to 12 t 14 t. However, the concentrations of the isomers are different depending on the duration of the thermal induction. It appears that [1, 5] sigmatropic rearrangements and positional isomerisations take place in the heated mixtures.

Twenty two ampoules of ERM-AE 670 containing isotopically enriched methyl mercury chloride (CH 3 (202 Hg) Cl) in 2 % ethanol/water solution were used as starting material. Each ampoule contained approximately 5 g of solution. The content of ERM-AE 670 ampoules was gravimetrically diluted with 2 % ethanol/water solution to create enough material for 220 new units. The diluted CH 3 (202 Hg) Cl solution was filled into quartz ampoules which were flame sealed. Between-unit homogeneity was quantified and stability during dispatch and storage were assessed in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006 [[ii]]. The certified value {{was obtained from the}} gravimetric preparations, taking into account the amount of content and isotopic composition of the base material. The certified values were confirmed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry as independent verification method measurements within the scope of accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 [[iii]]. Uncertainties of the certified values were calculated in compliance with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) [[iv]] and include uncertainties related to possible inhomogeneity, instability and characterisation. The main purpose of the material is to be used as spike isotopic reference material for determination of CH 3 Hg content in an unknown samples by species-specific isotope dilution through a measurement of the mercury isotope amount ratio R(B) = n(200 Hg) /n(202 Hg) of CH 3 Hg, in a blend.

[URL] of conjugated linoleic acid from 7 t 9 c through 12 t 14 t can be induced by thermal treatment of triacylglycerol samples of 9 c 11 t or 10 t 12 c fatty acids in glass tubes. The formation of conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) has been observed during thermal induction of the above-mentioned triacylglycerols at 250, 280 and 320 A degrees C. The concentrations of isomers formed in the mixture varied depending on the temperature and duration of the heating experiments. The objective {{of this study was to}} find a suitable thermal induction temperature and time that can produce most of the isomers of CLAs from the above-mentioned triacylglycerols. Such a mixture would give researchers a reference standard that can be used in the identification of CLAs in GC analyses of relevant samples. Fifteen-microlitre portions of the triacylglycerol samples containing 9 c 11 t/ 10 t 12 c fatty acid were placed in micro-glass ampoules, <b>sealed</b> <b>under</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and then subjected to thermal treatment. The glass ampoules were removed at regular time intervals, cut open, and part of the samples was analysed by infrared spectroscopy using attenuated internal reflectance technique. The remainder of the samples was subjected to derivatisation into their methyl esters. The methyl esters of the isomerised fatty acids were then analysed by gas chromatography after appropriate dilution in heptane. The results show that the thermally induced glyceride samples of 9 c 11 t/ 10 t 12 c fatty acids gave CLA profiles containing isomers ranging from 7 t 9 c to 12 t 14 t. However, the concentrations of the isomers are different depending on the duration of the thermal induction. It appears that [1, 5] sigmatropic rearrangements and positional isomerisations take place in the heated mixtures. The rearrangements and positional isomerisations are accelerated by increasing temperature. The glyceride samples heated to 325 A degrees C form isomers within 30 min and provide a mixture of CLA isomers that can be used as reference sample containing the methyl esters of CLAs...|$|E
