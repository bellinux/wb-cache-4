500|$|The {{earliest}} {{model of}} the transmission line was probably described by Georg Ohm (1827) who established that resistance in a wire is proportional to its length.*John C. Shedd, Mayo D. Hershey, [...] "The history of Ohm's law", The Popular Science Monthly, pp.599-614, December 1913 ISSN 0161-7370. The Ohm model thus included only resistance. Latimer Clark noted that signals were delayed and elongated along a cable, an undesirable form of distortion now called dispersion but then called retardation, and Michael Faraday (1853) established that {{this was due to}} the capacitance present in the transmission line. Lord Kelvin (1854) found the correct mathematical description needed in his work on early transatlantic cables; he arrived at an equation identical to the conduction of a heat pulse along a metal bar. This model incorporates only resistance and capacitance, but that is all that was needed in undersea cables dominated by capacitance effects. Kelvin's model predicts a limit on the telegraph <b>signalling</b> <b>speed</b> of a cable but Kelvin still did not use the concept of bandwidth, the limit was entirely explained in terms of the dispersion of the telegraph symbols. The mathematical {{model of the}} transmission line reached its fullest development with Oliver Heaviside. Heaviside (1881) introduced series inductance and shunt conductance into the model making four distributed elements in all. This model is now known as the telegrapher's equation and the distributed elements are called the primary line constants.Heaviside, O, Electrical Papers, vol 1, pp.139-140, Boston, 1925 ...|$|E

Thresholds for coherent motion perception were measured for different combinations of <b>signal</b> and noise <b>speeds.</b> Previous research [Edwards, M., Badcock, D. R., & Smith, A. T. (1998).

On {{the basis of this}} evidence two independent speed-tuned systems were proposed: one for slow and one for fast-motion. However, in those studies only two <b>signal</b> <b>speeds</b> were used. We expanded the results by measuring threshold-curves for four different <b>signal</b> <b>speeds.</b> Considerable overlap of the threshold-curves was found between conditions.

5000|$|Permalloy was {{initially}} {{developed in the}} early 20th century for inductive compensation of telegraph cables. [...] When the first transatlantic submarine telegraph cables were laid in the 1860s, {{it was found that}} the long conductors caused distortion which reduced the maximum <b>signalling</b> <b>speed</b> to only 10-12 words per minute. The right conditions for transmitting signals through cables without distortion were first worked out mathematically in 1885 by Oliver Heaviside. [...] It was proposed by Carl Emil Krarup in 1902 in Denmark that the cable could be compensated by wrapping it with iron wire, increasing the inductance and making it a loaded line to reduce distortion. However, iron did not have high enough permeability to compensate a transatlantic-length cable. After a prolonged search, permalloy was discovered in 1914 by Gustav Elmen of Bell Laboratories, who found it had higher permeability than silicon steel. [...] Later, in 1923, he found its permeability could be greatly enhanced by heat treatment. [...] A wrapping of permalloy tape could reportedly increase the <b>signalling</b> <b>speed</b> of a telegraph cable fourfold.|$|E

Conventional methods to equip 8 - 17 with fluorescent signaling property usually involve covalent attachment of two dyes at nucleotide positions {{that are far}} away from the catalytic core, such that the bulky dye structures would not affect the deoxyribozyme activity. However, the maximum fluorescent enhancement associated with these 8 - 17 constructs is typically ≤ 10 -fold, due to a high fluorescent background.

Our results have indicated that 8 - 17 is able to cleave almost every modified substrate, including those that have chromophores only 1 nt away from the cleavage site. Most importantly, almost all of these substrates are able to generate 15 - to 85 -fold signal enhancement within 10 min.
