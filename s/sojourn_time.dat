40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} {{a model of}} multiple make-to-order suppliers, which compete based on their promised <b>sojourn</b> <b>times.</b> A fixed penalty is imposed on the suppliers for failing the promised delivery time requirement at an agreed service level. The demand is allocated to the suppliers according to the promised <b>sojourn</b> <b>times,</b> using either supplier-selection (SS) approach or supplier-allocation (SA) approach as proposed in Benjaafar etal. (2007, Outsourcing via service competition, Management Science, 53 (2), 241 - 259). Their framework and results are then applied to obtain the competition outcome. It {{was found that the}} buyer can orchestrate the competition to induce the suppliers to offer lower promised <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> and select higher service capacities through restricting the suppliers to choose promised <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> above a certain level. The SS approach is also found to induce a better service quality than the SA approach. The role of the penalty level is then addressed.

40|$|The <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> until {{fixation}} of an overdominant allele {{were investigated}} {{based on the}} diffusion equation. Furthermore, the rate of accumulation of mutations, or the substitution rate, was predicted from the mean extinction time of a common overdominant allele. The substitution rate calculated theoretically agreed well with that determined by computer simulation. Overdominant selection enhances the polymorphism at linked loci, while {{its effect on the}} <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> and the substitution rate at linked loci has not been studied yet. To solve these problems, a model that assumed two linked loci, each with infinite alleles, was examined by computer simulation. A decrease in the recombination rate between two loci markedly changed the distribution of <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> of a neutral allele. Although overdominant selection obviously increased the <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> and the polymorphism at a linked locus, the rate of nucleotide substitution at the neutral locus was not influenced significantly even if complete linkage was assumed. These results suggest that, in regions containing overdominant genes, linked neutral loci will exhibit elevated levels of polymorphism, but their rate of molecular evolution remains that predicted by neutral theory...|$|R

A general theory about one-dimensional unimodal maps is constructed. A quantity called “sojourning time,” which is the duration of staying in an interval by iteration of a map, is considered. Predictability is formulated as the size of error by fluctuation from the deterministic system. Topological entropy is used as the degree of chaos and a relation between topological entropy and <b>sojourning</b> <b>time</b> is obtained. Also, some conditions for the coexistence of chaotic behavior and predictability of <b>sojourning</b> <b>time</b> are given generally.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{mathematical}} {{questions to}} be discussed in this contribution arose in analyzing and modelling energy systems. For the purposes of picturing the processes involved, we think of a system which moves from one state to another with random <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> in between. Such a process becomes a Markov process if {{the distribution of the}} <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> are all exponentially independent of the next state, it becomes a Markov chain if the <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> are all equal to one, and it becomes a classical renewal process if there is only one state. Many of the processes describing the behaviour of real systems are described by the concept of a Markov renewal process. The process (X; T) = fX n; T n; n 2 Ng {{is said to be a}} Markov renewal process with state space E provided that PfX n+ 1 = j; T n+ 1 <F 38. 9...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} polling {{systems in}} which a single server visits stations in cyclic order and serves customers at each station according to either the gated rule or the exhaustive rule of the station. There are multiple classes of customers at each station, and they are served in either the priority order or the first-come-first-served (FCFS) order. After completing a service at a station, each customer may be routed {{to one of the}} stations or leave the system according to the Markovian feedback mechanism. In this paper, a new approach to mean <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> in multiclass queues, developed in [11, 14, 15], is extended to the feedback polling systems as follows. We define the conditional expected <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> and find their linear functional expressions by solving some equations. The steady state average <b>sojourn</b> <b>times</b> are derived from these expressions by simple limiting procedures, and their values are obtained by solving a set of linear equations. We also consider composite scheduling algorithms and calculate mean path times...|$|R
