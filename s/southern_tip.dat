25|$|Kendall's first design, {{submitted}} to the United States Commission of Fine Arts in May 1923, {{formed the basis for}} planning the Virginia approaches. Preliminary designs for the bridge showed it terminating on Columbia Island. For the center of Columbia Island, Kendall envisioned a gigantic roadway crossarm circumscribed by a grassy ellipse. The roads north and south from this crossarm would terminate in traffic circles at the northern and <b>southern</b> <b>tips</b> of the island. The traffic circles would accommodate connections to Lee Highway and the proposed Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway.|$|R
50|$|The Schaproder Bodden is a bodden on the Baltic Sea coast {{between the}} island of Hiddensee {{in the west and}} the islands of Rügen and Ummanz in the east. To the north the Schaproder Bodden is linked to the Vitter Bodden by the {{so-called}} Trog between the Fährinsel and the Stolper Haken of Rügen island. To the south the bodden transitions into the Kubitzer Bodden. A boundary would be the line between the <b>southern</b> <b>tips</b> of the Hiddensee (Geller Haken) and Ummanz or the link from the Geller Haken - Insel Heuwiese.|$|R
5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} the <b>southern</b> <b>tip</b> of Africa, Arniston {{separated from the}} convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, the {{northern}} polar jet stream {{is the most}} important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the <b>southern</b> <b>tip</b> of South America. The term jet stream in these contexts thus usually implies {{the northern}} polar jet stream.|$|E

Only about twenty individuals, {{collected}} around 1900, are known, and subsequent destruction of its riverine habitat may have driven the species to extinction.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance persisted 520miles (835km) south of Acapulco on July 3. It moved steadily westward and organized over warm water temperatures of 81°F (27°C).

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on August13. With a large swirl of low clouds and little convection, the system tracked westward for two weeks across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, before crossing Central America on August22. On August29, the system became better organized, consisting of a broad low pressure area and thunderstorm activity. The convection persisted and organized further, and at 0000UTC on August30 it developed into Tropical Depression Twelve-E about 600mi (970km) southwest of the <b>southern</b> <b>tip</b> of the Baja California peninsula.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its intensity for 24 hours, Rachel made landfall at peak intensity near the <b>southern</b> <b>tip</b> of Baja California Sur. Strong wind shear prevented additional intensification, despite {{moving into the}} warm waters of the Gulf of California. After weakening slightly, Rachel made a second landfall midway between Las Mochis and Culiacán. Upon moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as the forward speed increased. Rachel dissipated several hours later on October3. By that time, the winds had decreased to 30mph (45km/h). The remnants of Rachel entered the United States, and were last noted over Texas.|$|E
