40|$|AbstractMachine {{tools are}} {{responsible}} for a relevant share of environmental impact related to production processes. This is due to their widespread use, the huge energy requirements during operations and the disposable materials {{involved in the process}} like <b>scraps,</b> <b>cutting</b> inserts and exhausted oil. This study presents a holistic analysis of the main contributions that {{are responsible for}} the environmental impact of the process {{and the use of the}} analysis's results to optimize the process setup for a specific case. The factors included in the analysis are: cutting parameters, lubrication strategy and cutting inserts substitution. Regarding the cutting parameters choice, the analysis of the tests carried out highlighted that the best solution is to use the most demanding process parameters in terms of material removal rate, using the tool strength as a constraint. The comparison of alternative lubrication strategies shows the advantage of using dry machining, to be replaced with MQL only when hard-to-cut materials must be machined. Finally, the approach developed to assess the environmental footprint associated to the cutting inserts allowed to define a new substitution rule. The obtained solution is consistent with the usual industrial practice to change the tool when the geometrical tolerances could not be meet anymore, this result is due mainly to the high environmental impact of the production phase of the insert...|$|R

5000|$|Although dome homes {{enjoyed a}} wave of {{popularity}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as a housing system the dome has many disadvantages and problems. A former proponent of dome homes, Lloyd Kahn, who wrote two books about them (Domebook 1 and Domebook 2) and founded Shelter Publications, became disillusioned with them, calling them [...] "smart but not wise".He noted the following disadvantages, which he has listed on his company's website:Off-the-shelf building materials (e.g., plywood, strand board) normally come in rectangular shapes, therefore some material {{may have to be}} <b>scrapped</b> after <b>cutting</b> rectangles down to triangles, increasing the cost of construction. Fire escapes are problematic; codes require them for larger structures, and they are expensive. Windows conforming to code can cost anywhere from 5 to 15 times as much as windows in conventional houses. Professional electrical wiring costs more because of increased labor time. Even owner-wired situations are costly, because more of certain materials are required for dome construction. Expansion and partitioning is also difficult.Kahn notes that domes are difficult if not impossible to build with natural materials, generally requiring plastics etc. which are polluting and deteriorate in sunlight.|$|R

50|$|After charging, {{the roof}} is swung back over the furnace and {{meltdown}} commences. The electrodes are lowered onto the scrap, an arc is struck and the electrodes are then set to bore into the layer of shred {{at the top of}} the furnace. Lower voltages are selected for this first part of the operation to protect the roof and walls from excessive heat and damage from the arcs. Once the electrodes have reached the heavy melt at the base of the furnace and the arcs are shielded by the scrap, the voltage can be increased and the electrodes raised slightly, lengthening the arcs and increasing power to the melt. This enables a molten pool to form more rapidly, reducing tap-to-tap times. Oxygen is blown into the <b>scrap,</b> combusting or <b>cutting</b> the steel, and extra chemical heat is provided by wall-mounted oxygen-fuel burners. Both processes accelerate scrap meltdown. Supersonic nozzles enable oxygen jets to penetrate foaming slag and reach the liquid bath.|$|R

40|$|When a soft {{polishing}} tool is compressed on a stiff workpiece of curved surface, {{the contact}} {{area is a}} piece of the curved surface. In the process of aspheric surface polishing, the machining speed is always provided by the rotational speed of the spindle of a computer numerical control lathe. Yet, the polishing tool is usually made rotating to remove <b>cutting</b> <b>scraps</b> and broken abrasives from the contact area. The rotational speed of the polishing tool would change the distribution state of the relative speed in the whole contact area, and it would definitely change the volume of material removal in the surface of the workpiece. This article studies how the rotational speed of the polishing tool changes the distribution state of the relative speed in the whole contact area and material removal in the volume of the surface of the workpiece. The computing results show that the volume of material removal increases with the increase in both the rotational speed of polishing disk and the rotational speed of lathe spindle, but the polishing quality is totally not in this case...|$|R
5000|$|Cookie cutting sheet: Used {{for larger}} volumes, a {{production}} cookie cutting sheet {{is a piece}} of study plastic the size of a full sheet pan that essentially has dozens of cutout cookie cutters mounted on to it. [...] Rather than rolling out the dough and pressing the cutter into the top of the dough, the cutting sheet is placed of the baking sheet, cutting side up. A sheet of cookie dough, already rolled to the correct thickness, is laid on top of the cutting sheet, and a rolling pin is used to press the dough down on to the sharp edges of the cutting sheet. The cut cookies fall through the holes into the sheet, into their properly spaced positions on the baking sheet. The <b>scrap</b> dough and <b>cutting</b> sheet are removed, and the pan is ready for baking. Cookie cutter sheets allow high volume production without the time or risk of moving cut cookies to baking sheets, resulting in rapid production of a more uniformly shaped and spaced product.|$|R
2500|$|An ambitious project {{involving}} preserved Class 50s was [...] "Operation Collingwood", {{an engineering}} charity {{established in the}} early 1990s. [...] The aim had been to train young engineering apprentices by getting them to rebuild railway locomotives and Class 50s were chosen both {{for the fact that}} they were a British design throughout and that all were named (so the apprentices would derive some pride from rededication ceremonies at the completion of their work). To this end, Operation Collingwood purchased and stored 50001, 50023, 50029, 50030, 50040 and 50045. All except 50029 and 50030 were heavily stripped examples sold to scrapyards for final cutting up. The intention was to restore them by using industrial sponsorship money to build an engineering centre and overhaul the components, making brand new ones where necessary to overcome lack of availability of some parts unique to the original design. These ambitions failed when sponsorship did not reach the required level and the project lost various key people. The charity was wound up in 2002; 50001/023/040 and 045 were sold back to scrapyards and their state as little more than bodyshells deterred most further preservation attempts. 50045 was scrapped to provide spares for preserved 50026, and 50001 met a similar fate. A private individual made an attempt to restore 50023 using some parts from 50001 but this was abandoned and the shell was cut up a few years after the initial purchase. [...] 50040 could have been suitable for cosmetic restoration, but after many years untouched and in a derelict state at the Coventry Railway Centre, it finally had all remaining parts stripped for spares and was transported to Sims Metals of Halesowen and <b>scrapping.</b> The <b>cutting</b> of the derelict hulk was completed by Wednesday 2 July 2008.

40|$|Estimation of the {{allowances}} for shrinkage, <b>scrap</b> in <b>cutting,</b> and defects in the materials pose challenges in planning quantity of fabric for production control and management. In addition, the garment business {{in general is}} a low margin competitive business, the fashion business tend to be high variety, change dynamically – and with relatively long lead time for fabric production, estimating the amount of fabric required often becomes an important factor deciding the business profitability. Therefore, most companies have implemented a series of existing ordinary processes for achieving accurate fabric estimation. However, a flood of obsolete and overrun fabric is commonly found in the warehouse and storages in most companies. Against this background of overrun, {{a high percentage of}} orders have found actual shortages of fabric to fulfill a customer’s requirement. This thesis attempts to develop a new methodology to design a fabric planning process to ensure sufficient quantity of garments can be produced on time with low cost and minimum fabric wastage. Though most of the data required to solve the above problems often can be found within the companies, the communication among different functional departments {{have not been able to}} take advantage of the wealth of these information and thus, the problems persist. To ensure timely flow of key information between technicians representing the production side and the merchandizing department representing the customer side, business process design is applied to solve the root problem. A step-wise structured business process methodology consisting of five design stages with Axiomatic design concept is developed. Lean process principles and lean process principles and lean information flow ideas are also introduced to the methodology. Finally, using a real case study, an evaluation of a process design is demonstrated. The approach is further validates with a simulation model. The result shows that the proposed design provides an improved performance of performance of quotation time and accuracy of fabric consumption estimation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Laboratorial {{studies were}} carried out to characterise the {{influence}} of different cutting systems (grab shredder and cutting mill) on the physical processing efficiency of spent Zn-MnO 2 batteries. The grab shredder operate based on an indented cutting rotor which applies shear and abrasion stresses with a moderate rotation speed, while the cutting mill operation is based on shear and impact stresses at higher rotation speed. After shredding with the grab shredder, two fractions of material were obtained (above and below the 6 mm discharge grid), which allows a previous separation of the <b>scrap.</b> With the <b>cutting</b> mill, all the grinded material passed the bottom grid (with the same 6 mm opening). Results obtained showed that alkaline batteries were more efficiently shredded than saline batteries, mainly with the grab shredder. Average diameters (d 50) for saline and alkaline batteries fragmented with the grab shredder were 2. 29 and 1. 47 mm respectively, while with the cutting mill were 3. 09 and 1. 54 mm respectively. Chemical analyses {{were carried out}} for different size fractions allowing identifying metals distribution through size categories. In general chemical composition was not substantially different using both shredding systems.

It is made based on the manufacturers desire to improve and make the clamp easier to manufacture and to reduce its price to their customers. This should be done either by manufacturing the clamp in one piece without an expensive and work intensive welding process, or by generating ideas of how to develop a brand new type of clamp. Investigating the market for similar products was done to eliminate intrusion of other manufacturers’ patents but also to generate ideas. Making drawings of the many ideas gave a concept of three concepts called existing clamp in one piece, existing clamp by several pieces and innovation solutions. Some of these ideas were investigated further and were 3 D modelled in pro-engineer and necessary drawing files were made {{to be used in}} the manufacturing of several prototypes. One of the solutions resulted in a prototype that was manufactured by handmade tools and the results of the tests was very positive. The clamp was strong enough to join the pipes together very well without breaking. It was manufactured in one piece and formed in five steps without any welding operations instead of the seven steps, including welding, that is used on the clamp today.

40|$|Construction wastes {{have become}} {{the major source of}} solid wastes in Hong Kong. Thousands of tonnes of solid wastes are {{produced}} every year from construction and demolition activities. Increasing generation of these wastes has caused significant impacts on the environment and aroused growing public concerns. Therefore, the minimization of construction wastes has become a pressing issue. This paper aims to: i) revealing the status of construction wastes; ii) investigating the effectiveness of prefabrication in terms of waste reduction in replacing traditional wet-trade practices; iii) examining the factors that help minimize construction wastes by the adoption of prefabrication; and iv) exploring the current waste reduction situations after adoption of prefabrication by comparing with in-situ construction. It investigates wastes generated from various wet-trade construction activities such as in-situ concreting, timber formwork, bricklaying, plastering, screeding, tiling, rebar fixing and bamboo scaffolding. Six major reasons for the excessive construction wastage are known to be: i) cutting; ii) over ordering; iii) damaging during transportation; iv) losing during installation; v) poor workmanship; and vi) change of design. From the findings of a structured interview survey of thirty-one construction practitioners, "timber formwork" is found to be having the greatest potential for <b>cutting</b> <b>scrap,</b> and wastes from "poor workmanship" can be greatly reduced by adopting prefabrication in construction. Furthermore, after the adoption of prefabrication, wastage generation can be greatly reduced in various wet-trade activities including concreting, rebar fixing, bricklaying, drywall, plastering, screeding and tiling. Especially in plastering, the waste reduction can be reduced by 100 %. It is concluded that prefabrication of building components is one of the effective technologies of waste minimization.

Two systems; (1) the system based on the multiple regression, (2) the system based on artificial neural networks with back-propagation learning algorithms were developed;The raw signals obtained from two sensors (tri-axial accelerometer and AE sensor) with different machining parameters and tool conditions were examined and decomposed into six components by utilizing a wavelet transformation. The most significant components of each signal were found by statistical method and implemented to develop two in-process tool monitoring systems;Before the multiple regression system was developed, a statistical process was performed to eliminate the effects of machining parameters from the signals of the accelerometer and AE sensor. The prediction performance improved 12. 6 % from the process;In order to maximize the benefit of artificial neural networks system in tool monitoring systems, a novel approach was performed in this study. A great number of networks structures were tested systemically to find an optimized structure for the artificial networks tool condition monitoring system. The technique provided benefits of not only saving time but also testing all possible structures more accurately compared with the traditional manual trial-and-error methodology;The developed statistical multiple regression tool condition monitoring system showed 90 % accuracy, and the developed artificial neural networks tool condition monitoring system showed 97 % accuracy from 151 tests with the reject flank wear size of 0. 00787 inch (0. 2 mm) or larger;The successful development of the tool condition monitoring systems can provide a practical tool to reduce downtime related with tool changes and minimize the amount of <b>scrap</b> in metal <b>cutting</b> industry.

The project was carried out on site at the ArcelorMittal’s millin Esch-Belval, Luxembourg which comprises an integrated melt shop, continuous casting plant and the rolling mill with the objectives of proposing optimization rules for the cold sector of the rolling mill and to analyze {{the impact of the}} future truckbay shipment area. The course of action followed was to draw a Value Stream Map (VSM) {{in order to understand the}} plants’ current status and serve as a roadmap to build a discrete event simulation model that after its validation, served as a support tool to analyze what-if scenarios. Similarly, a current status analysis of the  shipment/stock area was conducted collecting statistics about potential truckshipments and finally proposing a series of recommendations for its operation. The main proposed solutions to optimize the rolling mill’s cold sector were:(a) Integer programming model to globally optimize the <b>scrap</b> level when <b>cutting</b> the mother beams to customer size beams. (b) Updating pacemaker parameters and (c) Local process time improvements. Concerning the future truck loading, the simulation model was used as a support tool to dimension the transition area between the cranes’ and forklift operations resulting in a 6 - 9 bundles buffer capacity. Additionally, the current length-based storage policy was found to have competitive objectives so a turnover class-based storage policy is proposed with A, B, C classes which should provide an improved organization of the stock and travel distance of the cranes. The evaluation of the cranes’ performance remains an issue since there are currently no objective measures like, for instance, travelled distance.
