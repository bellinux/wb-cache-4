The study focused on critical literacy to understand how the girls used multiliteracies to understand the social practices and socially ascribed identities, which construct them as lesbian, bisexual or transgender and to critique this social construction thereby contributing to their ability to reconstruct identities and beliefs that have the potential to lead to human agency. The girls engaged with a variety of literacy activities during the weekly sessions such as reading, discussion, writing, drawing, and visual artifacts. Through a mulititeracies pedagogy, the girls developed the critical engagement with literacy required for them to be (come) agents in their own lives. The things learned because of this study are identifying the features that contribute to the effectiveness of out-of-school literacies for African American LBT adolescents while assisting educators and stakeholders in creating strategies and literacy space to support the identity development and growth of African American LBT adolescents in secondary school settings.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} importance of the human face in modern literature, philosophy, and all. “Meaning is a physiognomy,” wrote Wittgenstein—quite literally, if somewhat cryptically—in the Philosophical Investigations. My project takes this remark seriously and begins, in chapters one and two, by reading Wittgenstein 2 ̆ 7 s discussion of aspect-seeing alongside recent work in cognitive science and the philosophy of mind in order to explain how we perceive mentality in the appearance of a human face. I then trace the surprising ways in which our ability to understand facial expressions informs not only the way we understand language, but also other minds and the concept of personhood itself. Chapters three and four extend these findings into an analysis of visual portraiture, focusing on the paintings of Francis Bacon. Regarding the sense of injury often associated with Bacon 2 ̆ 7 s violently distorted likenesses, I ask why such “magical” feelings arise at all with respect to images of human faces. Reading Wittgenstein along with Gombrich and Wollheim, I find that the mind naturally responds to images of faces as expressive of mentality: we not only see faces in images but also to an extent see the images as persons. My final chapter looks into the ethics of physiognomy, asking what difference it makes whether we see the mind as a private substance or, as John Ashbery has suggested, a “visible core. ” This chapter reads two narratives about faces that dramatize the solipsistic consequences of a Cartesian commitment to mental privacy: that of the faceless woman in Rilke 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Notebooks</b> of Malte Laurids Brigge and the Magistrate 2 ̆ 7 s dreams about the tortured woman in Coetzee 2 ̆ 7 s Waiting for the Barbarians. I next consider Levinas 2 ̆ 7 ethics of the face, an ambivalent critique of Husserlian phenomenology that tries, but ultimately fails, to escape this Cartesian predicament. In the end, the convergence of ethics and physiognomy may explain the face 2 ̆ 7 s importance to the modern imagination: perhaps, as Wittgenstein 2 ̆ 7 s writings suggest, faces grip us so because they call upon the same powers of pattern recognition that enable us to grasp the reality of other minds and moral values as well. ...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, {{little was}} known of H. L. A. Hart 2 ̆ 7 s private life. That has now {{changed with the}} {{publication}} of Nicola Lacey 2 ̆ 7 s A Life of H. L. A. Hart: The Nightmare and the Noble Dream. Drawing on Hart 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>notebooks</b> and correspondence, Lacey paints an illuminating portrait of Hart, which reveals that despite his public success he struggled with internal perplexities, including his sexual orientation, Jewish identity, intellectual insecurity, and unconventional marriage. Yet, as critics have noted, the connection between these revelations and the development of Hart 2 ̆ 7 s ideas is unclear. Moreover, one cannot help but wonder whether by focusing on these aspects of Hart 2 ̆ 7 s personal life, Lacey has missed an opportunity to explore certain basic questions about his jurisprudence and its link to wider intellectual currents. For example, linguistics, psychology, and the philosophy of language and mind are much different today {{than they were in the}} 1940 s and 1950 s, yet Lacey does not discuss how such familiar events as the overthrow of logical positivism, the demise of behaviorism, the rise of generative linguistics, or the broader cognitive revolution of which they were a part actually impacted Hart or should influence our understanding of his legacy. Surprisingly, none of these developments are taken up in this book, leading one to ponder the significance of their absence. Likewise, one of the mysteries surrounding Hart is his attitude toward human rights. It is difficult to imagine a more direct repudiation of legal positivism than the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the broader human rights revolution it helped to promote. Yet Hart never seemed to notice or care. None of his rights-related essays of the 1940 s and 1950 s gives the Universal Declaration so much as a passing reference. Meanwhile, the topic of human rights is completely absent from 2 ̆ 2 The Concept of Law. 2 ̆ 2 We are therefore left with the following paradox: human rights is 2 ̆ 2 the idea of our time 2 ̆ 2 (Louis Henkin), yet the twentieth century 2 ̆ 7 s leading legal philosopher had virtually nothing to say about them. Disappointingly, Lacey does not shed much light on these issues. Even after the publication of her biography of Hart, therefore, we lack a proper overall assessment of Hart 2 ̆ 7 s place in the recent history of ideas. This Essay attempts to take an initial step in that direction, by examining a few select themes of Hart 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence and Lacey 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of them in light of recent developments in philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science, and law. The central argument I make is that a genuinely puzzling aspect of Hart 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence is how detached it now seems from many of the most important intellectual events of the past fifty years, including the modern revival of Universal Grammar, the cognitive revolution in the study of language and mind, and the human rights revolution in constitutional and international law, all of which would appear to have significant implications for the traditions of legal positivism, analytic jurisprudence, and epistemological empiricism with which Hart was associated...|$|R
40|$|In {{focusing}} {{on the story of}} Darwin 2 ̆ 7 s religious doubts, scholars too often overlook Darwin 2 ̆ 7 s positive contribution to the study of religion. J. David Pleins traces Darwin 2 ̆ 7 s journey in five steps. He begins with Darwin 2 ̆ 7 s global voyage, where his encounter with religious and cultural diversity transformed his understanding of religion. Surprisingly, Darwin wrestles with serious theological questions even as he uncovers the evolutionary layers of religion from savage roots. Next, we follow Darwin as his doubts about traditional biblical religion take root, affecting his career choice and marriage to Emma Wedgwood. Pleins then examines Darwin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> secret <b>notebooks</b> as he searches for a materialist theory of religion. Again, other surprises loom as Darwin 2 ̆ 7 s reading of Comte 2 ̆ 7 s three stages of religion 2 ̆ 7 s development actually predate his reading of Malthus. Pleins explores how Darwin applied his discovery to the realm of ethics by formulating an evolutionary view of the 2 ̆ 2 Golden Rule 2 ̆ 2 in his Descent of Man. Finally, he considers Darwin 2 ̆ 7 s later reflections on the religion question, as he wrestled with whether his views led to atheism, agnosticism, or a new kind of theism. The Evolving God concludes by looking at some of the current religious debates surrounding Darwin and suggests the need for a deeper appreciation for Darwin as a religious thinker. Though he grew skeptical of traditional Christian dogma, Darwin made key discoveries concerning the role and function of religion as a natural evolutionary phenomenon. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the {{various kinds of}} material (including diary-style writing, impressions of people and places, and notes on work in progress) collected in Carmen Martìn Gaite's Cuadernos de todo and subsequently considers the significance of diaries, letters, and life-writing in her novels of the 1990 s. After observations {{on the importance of}} diaries and letters in women‟s literature, there is an assessment of such narrative material in the contemporary novel and references to how Foucault's essay on 'self-writing' serves to channel the ideas of the self-reflective capacities of letters and diaries. There follows an examination of Cuadernos de todo, with particular reference to the use of diaries and letters in Martín Gaite's work, their relationship to the 'writing-cure'. The section dedicated to Cuadernos de todo opens with an analysis of the first cuadernos (which were written in the 1960 <b>s)</b> as <b>notebooks</b> used by the author as a site for her reflections on society and other matters, themes which are developed in her later novels. Next, there is a discussion of how Martín Gaite used these cuadernos as a writer‟s notebooks, for developing ideas on her novels and essays, showing the close link between the authors 'diaries' and her work, between life and literature. The cuadernos americanos constitute {{the last part of the}} assessment of Cuadernos de todo. Written during different periods the author spent on lecture-tours and as a university teacher in the United States, these cuadernos americanos are particularly significant for her development as a novelist. They reveal a new approach to diary-writing as, free from the family and the social commitments she had in Spain, the author found more time for reflection. The last of the cuadernos americanos is also a clear example of the use of diary writing as therapy, of the 'writing-cure'. The final part of the thesis focuses on Martìn Gaite's four novels of the 1990 s – in which the use of diaries, letters, and life-writing is especially significant. Here the theories of Donald Winnicott and Nancy Chodorow on child development and motherhood, themes which run troughout Martín Gaite's writing, are discussed to shed additional light on the author's approach to life-writing and fiction...|$|R
40|$|Nesta dissertação buscamos entender como a Psicologia Educacional e Escolar, juntamente com a Arte, pode contribuir para a formação continuada de educadores. Sabemos que o trabalho em Educação requer a todo o momento partilhar e pensar conjuntamente práticas abrangendo todos os profissionais destes contextos. Além da atuação no cotidiano da escola, é preciso pensar-se também nos referenciais teóricos que sustentam estas ações de modo que possam integrar-se efetivamente às atividades educacionais. Considerando esta articulação entre teoria e prática e oferecendo espaços para que educadores possam compartilhar e estudar sobre aspectos que envolvem seus fazeres, oferecemos uma proposta de formação continuada, em grupo, buscando contribuir com o desenvolvimento do educador nos aspectos cognitivos, afetivos, sociais e estéticos. Escolhemos a Arte para ser nosso mote por considerarmos que ela, em suas diferentes linguagens, instiga de forma diferenciada o desenvolvimento das funções psíquicas superiores e também amplia o repertório {{cultural}} dos sujeitos, além de trabalhar a expressividade, criatividade e outros aspectos imprescindíveis para a função docente. Além disto, para que o profissional consiga propor atividades diferenciadas em sala de aula, que provoquem processos de aprendizagem no estudante e que considerem as particularidades dos sujeitos é preciso que ele também vivencie, se aproprie e, assim, possa compartilhar essas vivências com outrem. Assim, propusemos dez encontros, com quatro horas de duração cada, em um centro de formação da Prefeitura Municipal da cidade de Uberlândia MG, que teve participação voluntária de educadores da rede municipal. Reunimo-nos durante um semestre e cada encontro foi pensado em uma estrutura que abrangeu primeiramente uma parte teórica e posteriormente uma parte prática e partilha de experiências. Os encontros tiveram temáticas que envolveram artes visuais, literatura, música, teatro, cinema, e também versaram sobre aspectos de formação teórico-conceitual dos participantes, especialmente o enfoque histórico-cultural e a formação continuada de educadores. Durante todos os encontros foram propostas atividades que buscassem contribuir para o desenvolvimento profissional e pessoal do educador e oferecer ferramentas para pensar e repensar sua atividade em contextos educacionais. Analisamos a proposta realizada por meio de registros dos participantes efetuados em seus diários de bordo, no Caderno do Grupo e pela observação e participação da pesquisadora durante o curso. Por meio da leitura minuciosa do material elencamos três principais eixos de análise, os quais se agregaram por similaridade no que tange ao conteúdo: a) Educadores no curso de extensão: trajetórias e reflexões, b) A Arte como possibilidade diferenciada de formação e c) Reflexões sobre a atuação do psicólogo educacional e escolar em contextos de formação. Assim, tecemos algumas interlocuções a partir destes registros pensando nos diálogos entre Educação, Arte e Psicologia bem como as contribuições para a formação continuada de educadores. Salientamos a importância do psicólogo educacional e escolar inserido nestes contextos, e principalmente colocamos a Arte como elemento diferenciado de formação, construindo fazeres que visem contribuir tanto com o campo da Psicologia como da Educação. In this dissertation we {{aimed at}} understanding how Educational and School Psychology, together with Art, {{could contribute to}} the continuing formation of educators. We know that working in education demands disposition all the time/at any time to share and think together about practices that can encompass professionals working on those contexts. In addition to performing actions in schools daily routines, {{it is necessary to}} think of theoretical framework that helps to underpin those actions, in order to effectively integrate them into educational activities. Taking into consideration this articulation between theory and practice and offering spaces for educators to share and study about issues involving their jobs, we offer a proposal of continuing education, in groups, wishing to {{contribute to the development of}} the educator in cognitive, affective, social and aesthetic aspects. We chose art as our main object in this work, because we consider it to instigate the development of higher mental functions due to its different languages and also because it broadens the cultural repertoire of subjects, in addition to working expressiveness, creativity and other aspects which are essential to the teaching function. Moreover, in order that the professional can propose different activities within the classroom, which stimulate the student s learning processes and take into consideration the particularities of each person, it is necessary that the teacher experience it too, take ownership of it and thus he will be able to share those experiences with other people. Thus, we proposed ten meetings, with four hours each, at a formation center located in the Municipality of Uberlândia Minas Gerais, with voluntary participation of municipal teachers. We joined together during a semester and each meeting was organized in a format that primarily involved a theoretical part and later a practical part with a moment dedicated to share experiences. The meetings themes involved visual arts, literature, music, theater, movies, and also included theoretical and conceptual formation aspects of the participants, especially the cultural-historical approach and continuing training/formation of teachers/educators. In all meetings we proposed activities that sought to contribute to educators personal and professional development and to provide tools to think and rethink their activity in educational contexts. The proposal was analyzed by means of records made by the participants in their logbooks, in the Group <b>s</b> <b>Notebook</b> and by observation and participation of the researcher during the course. After a close reading of the material, we selected three main guiding points of analysis, which were aggregated by similarity with respect to their content, as follows : a) Educators in extension course: trajectories and reflections, b) Art as a differentiated formation possibility and c) Reflections on the role of educational and school psychologists in formation contexts. So forth, we have established some dialogues based on those records, thinking of dialogues between education, Art and Psychology as well as its contributions to the continuing formation of educators. We would like to highlight the importance of the educational and school psychologist inserted in these contexts, and we especially used Art as a distinguished element of formation, constructing works which aim at helping both Psychology and Educational areas...|$|R

Razmatra se potom značenje terenskog istraživanja Mijata Sabljara, kojemu su sredinom XIX. st. ovi spomenici zaokupili pozornost i u Makarskom primorju. Zabilježeni podaci i crteži u njegovim terenskim bilježnicama, naročito stdka-sljemenjaka na ZakuL 2 ̆ 7 u kod Makarske, ovdje se prvi put uredno objavljuju i revaloriziraju. Vrednuju se zajedno s rezultatima kasnijih obilazaka fra Luje Maruna, oca starohrvatske arheologije, čije terenske bilježnice krajem istog stoljeća također potvrđuju da je evidentirao stećke i nadgrobne ploče u Drašnicama, jugoistočno od Makarske. Medieval grave monuments {{from the}} Makarska coastal area {{have been mentioned}} in literature from the early days, but {{for a long time}} only in the form of unsystematic documentation. The first mention s of grave monuments and stećci from this part of the coast {{can be found in the}} travel book by A. Fortis from 1774. He did not determine them chronologically, nor call them by any special name, just as in the case of other places in Dalmatia where he travelled. Franciscan P Kačić-Peko called them stećci and provides more detail on them in his work from 1863. He emphasized their great numbers at the Baćina site, and gives general data on their decoration. The first detailed description of a stećak, though, was given by F Bulić in 1925. He wrote about the area of Zakuće, west of Makarska, where a decorated gabled stećak was found, which was later, during the 1960 s, moved and placed in front of the Franciscan church in Makarska. This is the most beautiful medieval gravestone on the Makarska coast, which had already by the mid- 191 h century, attracted the attention of Mijat Sabljar. Since Bulić 2 ̆ 7 s work, this stećak has remained, until the present day, inadequately described in the literature. Only Bulić did not miss the fact that the stećak is decorated on aJI sides. Apart from a circle of human figures on the wider side, a crescent and roses on one of the narrower sides, he also noticed a cross on the other narrower side, and most importantly, a depiction of a horse rider and an animal on the other main side. In the field notebooks of M Sabljar, of which we have two that deal with the Makarska coastal area, it is possible to find several topographic notes on stećci and grave monuments. These refer to a tall chest with pedestal, the so-called Kostanića Greb in Drvenik, about 25 km south-east of Makarska, and also to the gravestones with motifs of tools at the graveyard in Igrane, a coastal settlement 12 km south-east of Makarska. The third site which attracted the attention of M Sabljar was Zakuće. The page of his note book dealing with this site, represents the most detailed drawing of one such monument from this part of the coast, and also gives information on the site itself. This page also resolves some doubts, since the site has entered the literature in a confusing way. Namely, M Wenzel, in her book of drawings of gravestones, entered documentation for this stećak from two sources. She uses the drawings of M Sabljar, as well as later documentation. The author did not realize that she was dealing with drawings of the same stećak, and placed them in two different locations, believing that she was deal ing with two separate monuments. This was a consequence of her skimmed reading of Sabljar 2 ̆ 7 s manuscript. The contribution of M Sabljar to the documentation of medieval monuments in the Makarska coastal area, to the analysis of stećci and grave monuments is modest in its extent. However, Sabljar 2 ̆ 7 s field work should be evaluated in the light of his extremely important data on the graveyard in Zakuće. This refers to a number of decorated stećci, destroyed during the building of the road in 1818, and the preserved stećak that we are analysing here, which was saved by the Franciscans in 1965 when another road was built. Sabljar claimed that a number of stećci were also destroyed during the building of St Nicholas 2 ̆ 7 s chapel, which is easily proved by a decorated chest built into its facade. One other thing adds to the importance of Sabljar 2 ̆ 7 s drawing of the stećak from Zakuće, and this is the sketch of the depiction of a horseman and animal from one of its sides. Sabljar claimed that he was not able to see the other side, that is the depiction of the circle of human figures, photographed a century later. F Bulić, in the meantime, viewed and described aJI sides of the gabled tombstone. If we compare the contribution of M Sabljar to the published data of P Kačić-Peka, we can see that the latter are more general. On the other hand, the result of Sabljar 2 ̆ 7 s visit to Zakuće is substantial drawings and data on destruction of the stećci. This is also the case in the documentation of the grave slabs in Igrane. There is one more significant contributor to the documentation of monuments from the Makarska area. This is the Fra Lujo Marun, the father of Old Croatian archaeology, who in 1897, half a century after Sabljar, registered the gravestones in Drašnice, a coastal settlement about 10 km south-east of Makarska. The importance of Marun 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> field <b>notebooks</b> is almost identical to Sabljar 2 ̆ 7 s, identical in their scientific usefulness today. However, one of the preserved stećci could not be connected to Marun 2 ̆ 7 s notes, although this is a case of specific low-gabled tombstone. Obviously, Marun 2 ̆ 7 s field work in the Makarska coastal area, no matter how modest it was compared to other parts of Dalmatia, did not stop at the already known episode of registering the remains of the medieval church on Sutvid, between Tučepi and Podgora, or the interest in religious matters on those peaks. Marun 2 ̆ 7 s interest in these areas coincides chronologicaJly with the arrival of the Drešnik inscription, with a cross and the year 1466 carved on it, at the Museum of Knin, which proves Marun 2 ̆ 7 s concern for the Makarska area, and his care for one of its movable monuments.
