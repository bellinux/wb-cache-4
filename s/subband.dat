Stronger forms of magnetism usually require localized rather than itinerant electrons. However, in some cases a band structure can result {{in which there are}} two delocalized sub-bands with states of opposite spins that have different energies.

This protein possesses two ATP-hydrolyzing domains, which allows the protein to use energy in the form of ATP. It also contains two domains comprising six alpha helices apiece, which allow the protein to cross the cell membrane. A regulatory binding site on the protein allows activation by phosphorylation, mainly by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The carboxyl terminal of the protein is anchored to the cytoskeleton by a PDZ domain interaction.|$|E
