5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} Definitions and Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature. This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition {{with those of}} others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only belles-lettres (accepted literary canon). They define literary scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal") and contrasted with the literary arts by its more scientific approach. Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective approach {{would be able to}} properly describe literature. They note that literary scholarship <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> examine what makes a work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that allow it to be compared to other works.|$|E

25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing to say no to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|When {{we hear a}} car honk, {{we would}} {{determine}} which car triggers the honk by which car we see is the spatially closest to the honk. It's a spatial congruent example by combining visual and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, {{the sound and the}} pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound and the pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.|$|E

25|$|Early {{on during}} the reign of Queen Christina (1644–1654) De la Gardie became the queen's favourite. Being, reportedly, both well-mannered and good looking might have helped De la Gardie to gain the queen's favour. His {{knowledge}} concerning culture, politics and representation might also have impressed the queen just as his talent for organizing festivities and surrounding himself with extravagance and magnificence. His skill and interest in the mentioned areas was in demand during a time when the power <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> be well-learned, resolute and rooted in history, but have a sense of details and possess splendour as well.|$|E
25|$|McQueen's next change {{occurred}} {{in that same}} year, when Lindley Evans was appointed as music teacher.

McQueen saw this in Evans and felt that he could lift the standard of music at the school. This did indeed happen. For many years, P.L.C won the coveted 'Dempster Shield' for choral singing. The school won it so many times in fact, that the shield became the permanent property of the school.|$|E
25|$|Singer's {{ideas have}} contributed to the rise of {{effective}} altruism. He argues that people <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> try to reduce suffering, but reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, he writes about how the effective altruism movement is doing these things more effectively in his 2015 book, The Most Good You Can Do. He is a board member of Animal Charity Evaluators, a charity evaluator used by many members of the effective altruism community which recommends the most cost-effective animal advocacy charities and interventions.|$|E

25|$|Wherever Priestley went, he also {{instructed}} {{people in}} natural philosophy. In Nantwich, he bought scientific instruments, {{such as a}} microscope, for the school, and encouraged his students to give public presentations of their experiments. In Calne, {{where he was a}} tutor to the son of Lord Shelburne, Priestley convinced his patron to buy expensive equipment with which to teach his son the fundamentals of natural philosophy. He wrote in his Miscellaneous Observations relating to Education (1778), published during these years, that children <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> be educated in the ancient subjects of rhetoric and grammar but should also become acquainted with science early in their lives since scientific understanding underpins the progress of the human race.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the First World War, the British (as well as {{continental}} European) {{tradition was}} to bury officers {{who died on}} the battlefield in individual graves and common soldiers in mass graves. The Great War changed this sentiment, {{as it was a}} total war, one in which nations engaged in the complete mobilization of all available resources, modes of production, and population in order to fight. Subsequently, as the war continued, there was a growing expectation among the people of the United Kingdom that foot soldiers as well as officers <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> be buried singly but commemorated. Many British families had already tried to visit the graves of loved ones, and could not locate them. Numerous letters appeared in newspapers decrying the problem, and Ware realized the British war effort was heading toward a public relations disaster. Ware, too, felt that the experience of war in the trenches was reducing socio-economic and class barriers. He firmly believed that British policy should be to treat all war dead alike, regardless of class or ability to pay. Wealthy families should not be able to repatriate their dead, inter remains privately in France, nor erect ornate memorials over their loved ones.|$|E
25|$|Though these {{contributions}} to Dutch literature were a happy {{byproduct of the}} controversy, more important {{from the standpoint of}} enduring political science were the key publications by the democratic republican theorists around Baruch Spinoza that were published {{at the end of the}} 1660s. Franciscus van den Enden, Spinoza's mentor, went beyond the De la Court brothers in his espousal of political democracy in his Free Political Propositions, published in 1665, which is one of the first systematic statements of democratic republicanism in the western world. Van den Enden argued that government <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> be in the interest of the citizens (as De la Court had proposed), but should create equality of opportunity and be controlled by the people, not the regent oligarchy. Van den Ende acknowledged only two writers that had preceded him with such ideas to his knowledge: Johan de la Court (Pieter's brother with his Consideratiën van Staat of 1660), and Pieter Corneliszoon Plockhoy, whose English-language pamphlet A way propounded to make the poor in these and other nations happy (published in London in 1659) also took aristocrats and priests to task. Plockhoy and Van den Ende first tried to implement their ideas in New Netherland in the early 1660s.|$|E

500|$|While Republican {{in general}} politics, he was [...] "an earnest {{worker in the}} cause of temperance".

He was interested in the progress of prohibition, and served as head of the city's nonpartisan anti-saloon league.|$|E
500|$|Another of Uzanne's {{interests}} was female fashion, {{about which}} he wrote {{a number of books}} and articles that were later translated into English. Specifically, he was focused on the image of the Parisienne, the women of Paris. Uzanne is perceived by some to have had a desire to revive French national pride; he shared the nationalistic feelings of other members of the generation who had experienced the defeat by Prussia in 1870. This was reflected in their efforts to promote a renewal of the decorative arts. Silverman mentions that Uzanne believed that married bourgeois women <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> decorate the walls of their homes, but also [...] "cultivate luxury and art in an ornament ignored by their aristocratic predecessors: their undergarments". Uzanne felt that the eroticism of the theatrical atmosphere was no longer what it had been and had become [...] "more moral, more bourgeois". His first and perhaps most famous book on fashion was L'Éventail (1882, translated as The Fan in 1884), a [...] "delightful" [...] illustrated story about the hand fans. He admitted that his book [...] "in no way a work of powerful wisdom and erudition", but simply the first in a projected series of [...] "little books for the boudoir".|$|E
