5000|$|The word {{is derived}} from the Arabic for [...] "to pound" [...] since the mixture of spices and nuts are pounded {{together}} after being dry roasted to a texture that is neither powdered nor paste-like.

A report from 1978 indicates that even further ingredients can be used, such as nigella, millet flour and dried cheese. Some modern variants include pine nuts, pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds.|$|R
5000|$|Sausage gravy is a {{traditional}} Southern breakfast dish in the United States. [...] After loose pork sausage is cooked in a pan and removed, a roux is formed by browning flour in the residual fat. Milk and seasonings, such as <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper,</b> are added <b>to</b> create a moderately thick gravy, to which the cooked sausage is added.

50|$|Although {{the time}} and place of the dish's {{invention}} is unclear, American canned pork and beans was well established in the American diet by the mid-19th century.

50|$|The key to {{the main}} dish is the butter sauce. The Paris {{newspaper}} Le Monde reports that it is made from chicken livers, fresh thyme and thyme flowers, full cream, white Dijon mustard, butter, <b>and</b> water, plus <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper.</b> According <b>to</b> Le Monde, the chicken livers are blanched in one pan with the thyme until they start to turn colour. In a second pan, the cream is reduced on low heat with the mustard and infused with the flavour of the thyme flowers. The chicken livers are then finely minced and pressed through a strainer into the reduced cream. As the sauce thickens, the butter is incorporated into {{it with a little}} water, it is beaten smooth, <b>and</b> fresh-ground <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> are added. The London newspaper The Independent, however, reports that Hélène Godillot has dismissed the Le Monde report as inaccurate.|$|R
5000|$|Foods to be pan-fried are {{sometimes}} {{covered with a}} batter or breading. Batters consist of dried ingredients such as flour or cornstarch in conjunction with liquids such as milk, water or other beverages. Breading {{can be as simple}} as dusting the food in flour or more commonly what is called the [...] "standard breading procedure." [...] The standard breading procedure involves first dusting the food in flour, (taking care to shake off the excess), then dipping it in beaten eggs, and finally into bread crumbs or some other form of outer coating. Season the food with <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> prior <b>to</b> coating. Allowing the food to rest for 15-30 minutes before frying enables the breading to stick to the food with greater tenacity.|$|R
