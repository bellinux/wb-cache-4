At least two <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> thought to be locum physicians reportedly working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital and at a Staffordshire hospital. These hospitals were the subject of police searches.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 2010, it was {{reported}} that a fourth suspect, an as-yet unidentified Pakistani citizen, was arrested in Pakistan. It is anticipated that he will be extradited to the U.S., and tried in Brooklyn Federal Court with Medunjanin and Ahmedzay on charges that he helped orchestrate the planned attack. One or two more <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> being sought outside the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The film {{features}} the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney), who {{is asked to}} investigate the murder of an American business tycoon aboard the Orient Express train. The <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> portrayed by an all-star cast, including Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Vanessa Redgrave, Michael York, Jacqueline Bisset, Anthony Perkins and Wendy Hiller. The screenplay is by Paul Dehn {{as well as an}} uncredited Anthony Shaffer.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 some 300 of the 365 <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> {{sentenced to}} prison terms, while 34 <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> acquitted. The case was to be appealed.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, Adler and his {{administrative}} assistant were kidnapped. The {{two men were}} held for eight hours and released after $25,000 in ransom money <b>was</b> paid. Three <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> arrested and sheriff's deputies later recovered $14,900 of the ransom money. Two <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> later convicted and one <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> later {{sentenced to life in}} prison.|$|R
50|$|In Antalya, two <b>suspects</b> {{thought to}} <b>be</b> {{members of the}} PKK were arrested. Since one of the <b>suspects</b> <b>was</b> {{under the age of}} 18, the <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> {{required}} to give their witness statement to the Children's Department of the Directorate of Security.|$|R
25|$|On 23 August, {{two more}} {{suspects}} were detained {{on suspicion of}} preparing to commit crimes with terrorist intent. The nationalities of the suspects were unclear as they had claimed being Algerian to Finnish authorities and Moroccan to Swedish authorities. The two were subsequently interviewed; {{and one of them}} released and cleared of charges later on. As of 24 August, four <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> in pre-trial detention, one arrested, one under an international arrest warrant and two cleared.|$|E
25|$|Torture: Torture is an {{established}} {{feature of the}} interrogation process by State agencies, including the State Security Department (SSD), and the Ministry of People's Security (MPS). <b>Suspects</b> <b>are</b> systematically degraded, intimidated and tortured. The treatment of suspects is particularly brutal and inhumane in the interrogation detention centers of the SSD, the primary agency tasked with suppressing “anti-state and anti-people crimes”. Many suspects die at interrogation detention centres {{as a result of}} torture, deliberate starvation or illnesses developed or aggravated by the terrible living conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} of the defense team received some support from the victims' families, who were reportedly dissatisfied with the slow-moving legal process and an alleged cover-up by the investigators. Some victims' relatives told the media they planned to begin an independent organization to monitor the court proceedings. The authorities in Ukraine strongly denied that a fourth person {{was involved in the}} killings who could still be at large, and said that rumors of similar crimes taking place since the arrest of the three <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> unfounded.|$|E
50|$|Birgenair Flight 301 had a fatal {{pitot tube}} failure which {{investigators}} <b>suspected</b> <b>was</b> due to insects creating a nest inside the pitot tube; the prime <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> the Black and yellow mud dauber wasp.|$|R
40|$|Most of time, the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed {{innocent}} in {{the beginning}} of the penal proceeding. But this presumption of innocence is created for saving individual freedoms and reputation. The truth <b>is</b> that the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed guilty after his arrest. And the judicial authorities will check if the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> innocent or confirmed guilty. This situation can threaten individual freedoms and reputation. That is why we want to size the meaning of presumption of innocence in other to protect it, at first. Secondly, we are going to study the presumption of culpability. What is more, the fact that the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed guilty justifies the office of a barrister at any stage of the penal proceeding. In fact, before the arrest of the <b>suspect,</b> he <b>is</b> presumed innocent. After his arrest he is presumed guilty...|$|R
50|$|The six <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> {{charged with}} {{conspiracy}} to commit fraud, {{conspiracy to commit}} forgery, forgery, fraud and money laundering. The crimes for which the <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> charged were allegedly committed between September 20, 2002, and August 25, 2005. A total of 922 counts of indictment were laid {{as a result of}} this IMET criminal investigation.|$|R
25|$|Because the {{documentation}} and <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> in the UK, the Sub-Committee said {{there should be}} a Public Tribunal of Inquiry in Northern Ireland and/or Britain. It recommended the Irish Government bring a case before the European Court of Human Rights to force the British Government to hold such an inquiry into the bombings. In 2005, the Irish Government threatened to bring the British government to the European Court of Justice, to force it to release its files on the bombings. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said there was not enough evidence to justify a public inquiry.|$|E
25|$|Sue {{is shown}} to be a woman who does not shy away from {{speaking}} her mind. She has various altercations, particularly with dowager Lou Beale (Anna Wing), who accuses Sue of having no community spirit. Sue's suspicious, insecure nature also provokes arguments between her and Ali, whom she often accuses of cheating. She has rows with other female residents, including Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton), Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), whom she <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> trying to seduce her husband, although in truth, all that ever occurs is flirtation.|$|E
25|$|An early {{application}} of a DNA database was the compilation of a Mitochondrial DNA Concordance, prepared by Kevin W. P. Miller and John L. Dawson at the University of Cambridge from 1996 to 1998 from data collected as part of Miller's PhD thesis. There are now several DNA databases in existence around the world. Some are private, {{but most of the}} largest databases are government-controlled. The United States maintains the largest DNA database, with the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) holding over 9 million records as of 2011. The United Kingdom maintains the National DNA Database (NDNAD), which is of similar size, despite the UK's smaller population. The size of this database, and its rate of growth, are giving concern to civil liberties groups in the UK, where police have wide-ranging powers to take samples and retain them even in the event of acquittal. The Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition partially addressed these concerns with part 1 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, under which DNA samples must be deleted if <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> acquitted or not charged, except in relation to certain (mostly serious and/or sexual) offences.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{interpretation}} of the title is that it refers to Rawls's demand that Santangelo close at least one case; for a homicide case to be considered [...] "closed" [...] only requires that a <b>suspect</b> <b>be</b> arrested and charged. After the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> charged, the murder is considered closed/solved even if the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> not convicted; this is why, earlier in the season, Rawls pushes for arrests on murders {{in order to help}} the statistics, even though the cases are weak.|$|R
50|$|On Tuesday, 6 May 2014, {{at least}} six people were injured in a knife attack in Guangzhou, China. At least one <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> shot and {{detained}} by authorities. It was believed by some witnesses that about four <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> involved, and were carrying large knives.|$|R
5000|$|Chinese police {{stated that}} it was an {{intentional}} act, and that a <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> detained at the scene after incurring injuries himself. The four detained <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> part of a [...] "violent gang of six people" [...] according to Xinjiang government spokesperson Hou Hanmin.|$|R
25|$|Snatch {{operations}} with IB: In late 2009, investigative journal The Week ran {{a cover story}} on one of India's major clandestine operations that the R ran with Intelligence Bureau to nab terrorists infiltrating India, via Nepal and other neighbouring countries. To bypass the lengthy extradition process, R conducts snatch operations to nab suspects from various foreign countries. The suspect is brought to India, interrogated in black sites, later shown as arrested at an airport or border post and is usually produced before a court. With emergence of Nepal as a terror transit point R and the IB started closely monitoring the movement of suspected terrorists in Nepal. According to The Week, in last decade there has been close to 400 successful snatch operations conducted by R and/or IB in Nepal, Bangladesh and other countries. Some famous snatches netted Bhupinder Singh Bhuda of the Khalistan Commando Force, Lashkar militant Tariq Mehmood and Abdul Karim Tunda, Sheikh Abdul Khwaja, one of the handlers of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Yasin Bhatkal founder leader of the proscribed terrorist organisation Indian Mujahideen etc. most of the <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> kept at Tihar Jail.|$|E
500|$|Andha Naal (...) is a 1954 Indian Tamil-language mystery-thriller film, {{produced}} by A. V. Meiyappan {{and directed by}} Sundaram Balachander. It is the first film noir in Tamil cinema, and the first Tamil film to be made without songs, dance, or stunt sequences. Set in the milieu of World War II, the story is about {{the killing of a}} radio engineer Rajan (Sivaji Ganesan). The <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> Rajan's wife Usha (Pandari Bai), the neighbour Chinnaiah (P. D. Sambandam), Rajan's brother Pattabi (T. K. Balachandran), Rajan's sister-in-law Hema (Menaka), and Rajan's mistress Ambujam (Suryakala). Each one's account of the incident points to a new suspect.|$|E
500|$|Peter {{begins to}} doubt the shapeshifters' motives after another body is found, but {{eventually}} comes {{up with an idea}} to read and track the victims' adrenaline spikes, which allows him to find where the murders took place: a dairy farm. They find the owner, who confesses to killing the women because they rejected him, and kidnapped and tortured Mathis's partner when he discovered the culprit. Repeatedly at the hotel, Peter receives calls with static, strange noises, and clicks, which he <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> coming from Newton. In the end, Peter decides and prepares to head back to Boston, but is approached by Newton, who has brought [...] "Mr. Secretary", the man from the Other Side, to see Peter. The man is revealed to be his actual father from the parallel universe, [...] "Walternate".|$|E
50|$|The 2007 {{international}} {{child pornography}} investigation was an international criminal investigation into a criminal organization dealing in child pornography. Austrian authorities initiated the investigation in July {{and were the}} ones to uncover the criminal organization. More than 2360 suspects residing in 77 countries were investigated. Approximately 600 of the <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> in the United States. The European country with the most <b>suspects</b> <b>was</b> Germany. 130 of the <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> in Australia. The two suspects in the Republic of Ireland were not investigated by Garda Síochána until six months after Austrian authorities notified them of the crime. At least 23 <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> Austrians. The pornography depicted the sexual abuse of {{children under the age}} of 14. A Russian website hosted the pornography on an Austrian server.|$|R

500|$|Barlow {{played the}} part of the detectives during filming, asking scripted {{questions}} to Seifert's character, but is never featured in Her Story. When watching police interviews for research, Barlow found himself empathising with the interviewee, which inspired him to exclude the detective from the game. He stated that the interviews typically feature [...] "double betrayal", in which the detectives are [...] "pretending to be the best friend". Barlow felt that removing the detective from the game empowers Seifert's character, allowing players to empathise. When conducting research for Her Story, Barlow looked at the case regarding the murder of Travis Alexander, which made him consider the manner that female murder <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> treated in interrogations, stating that they [...] "tend to be fetishised, more readily turned into archetypes". This was further proved to Barlow when studying the interviews of Casey Anthony and Amanda Knox; he found that media commentary often ignored the evidence of the investigation, instead focusing on the expressions of the suspects during the interviews. Barlow conducted further research by studying texts about psychology, and the use of language.|$|E
500|$|This {{incident}} {{confirms the}} Centre's suspicions that the paratroopers were agents {{of a foreign}} power, but Tintin fears that efforts to trace any leaked information would be futile. The rocket is successfully launched and orbits the moon as planned, but on its return it is then intercepted by the aforementioned foreign power, who have used the leaked information concerning the rocket's radio control. However, Tintin had anticipated this and asked Calculus to rig a self-destruct mechanism for the rocket, and the Centre destroys the rocket {{to prevent it from}} falling into enemy hands. Tintin reasons that there must have been an inside spy who leaked information to the paratroopers, but no <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> found. Preparations are made for the manned expedition to the moon, but after an argument with Haddock, in which Haddock accuses Calculus of [...] "acting the goat", Calculus becomes irate. Usually misunderstanding everything Haddock says, due to being hard of hearing, Calculus was wearing a hearing aid this time, and understood Haddock all too well. Implacable, Calculus angrily gives Haddock a forced tour of the moon rocket. However, in doing so, Calculus forgets to look where he is going, falls down a ladder and suffers amnesia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{subject of}} [...] "guilt," [...] {{explains}} Desser, dominates many of Lumet's films. From his first feature film, 12 Angry Men (1957), {{in which a}} jury must decide the guilt or innocence of a young man, to Q & A (1990), in which a lawyer must determine the question of guilt and responsibility {{on the part of}} a maverick policeman, guilt is a common thread which runs through many of his films. In a film like Murder on the Orient Express (1974), all of the <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> guilty.|$|E

He stated that the arrests were in response to the assassination attempt on Saddam Hussein, which was carried out by the Shiite Dawa Party. [...] "If the head of state comes under attack, the state is required by law to take action.

2500|$|On October 29, 2009, Richard Fadden {{the head}} of CSIS stated that civil-rights advocates and media present a {{distorted}} picture of, [...] "terror <b>suspects</b> <b>are</b> too often portrayed as romantic revolutionaries". He was referring to Abdelrazik {{and a few other}} accused suspects. He went on to state,"So why then, I ask, are those accused of terrorist offences often portrayed in media as quasi-folk heroes despite the harsh statements of numerous judges. Why are they always photographed with their children, giving tender-hearted profiles and more or less taken at their word when they accuse CSIS or other government agencies of abusing them?...A more balanced presentation is what I'm hoping for." ...|$|E
