25|$|Berkeley was {{supported}} by the Duke of York, who appointed him vice-admiral of the white, and William succeeded his dead brother as lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth later in 1665. Public scepticism over his actions persisted however, with Samuel Pepys commenting that 'it is strange to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> do already slight Sir Wm. Berkeley … who three months since was the delight of the Court'. Berkeley's reputation was further tarnished when he was implicated in the irregular plundering of prize goods from captured Dutch merchantmen, and accused of having abandoned an action with the Dutch ship Luipaard in discreditable circumstances on 21 August 1665.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January 1936, Orwell set out {{by public}} {{transport}} and on foot, reaching Manchester via Coventry, Stafford, the Potteries and Macclesfield. Arriving in Manchester after the banks had closed, {{he had to}} stay in a common lodging-house. The next day he picked up a list of contacts sent by Richard Rees. One of these, the trade union official Frank Meade, suggested Wigan, where Orwell spent February staying in dirty lodgings over a tripe shop. At Wigan, he visited many homes to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> lived, took detailed notes of housing conditions and wages earned, went down Bryn Hall coal mine, and used the local public library to consult public health records and reports on working conditions in mines.|$|E

500|$|Bass's {{announcement}} {{received a}} large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving [...] "overwhelming support" [...] from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as [...] "straight-acting" [...] in his People interview, stating, [...] "I call them the SAGs— the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer." [...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> would get pissed." ...|$|E
500|$|Spacey {{loosely based}} Lester's early [...] "schlubby" [...] deportment on Walter Matthau. During the film, Lester's {{physique}} improves from flabby to toned; Spacey worked out during filming {{to improve his}} body, but because Mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order, Spacey varied postures to portray the stages. Before filming, Mendes and Spacey analyzed Jack Lemmon's performance in The Apartment(1960), because Mendes wanted Spacey to emulate [...] "the way [...] moved, the way he looked, {{the way he was}} in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man". Spacey's voiceover is a throwback to Sunset Boulevard(1950), which is also narrated in retrospect by a dead character. Mendes felt it evoked Lester's—and the film's—loneliness. Bening recalled women from her youth to inform her performance: [...] "I used to babysit constantly. You'd go to church and <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> present themselves on the outside, and then be inside their house and see the difference." [...] Bening and a hair stylist collaborated to create a [...] "PTA president coif" [...] hairstyle, and Mendes and production designer Naomi Shohan researched mail-order catalogs to better establish Carolyn's environment of a [...] "spotless suburban manor". To help Bening get into Carolyn's mindset, Mendes gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like. He lent Bening the Bobby Darin version of the song [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade", which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car.|$|E

I rarely buy from galleries." [...] Massow has had his portrait painted nearly 30 times, including a double nude diptych by Jonathan Yeo, son of Conservative MP Tim Yeo, and a portrait by Darren Coffield of Massow in full foxhunting attire, which was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery. Massow has personally provided regular financial support for some artists, {{to assist them in}} their lives and work.|$|E

Shchedrin, describing {{the current state of}} Russian literature as a [...] "kingdom of scoundrels", in a letter to Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov wrote: [...] "Add to all this the fun-and-games-seeking 'free artists' like Count A.

The study focuses on the practical communicative problems of microphone operations in a media setting where the parties have alternating turns, and addresses the question of who of the participants speaks next and for how long. It is particularly concerned with investigating what the participating parties can do with the microphone, what it accomplishes, and how it is used as a tool for interaction with an audience. We particularly focus on how microphone moves can make use <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>how</b> <b>people</b> orient to emergent content structures in talk, and how microphone performs as a device for confirmation of verbal turns...|$|R
