40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{discusses}} the damage stability of generic <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> following a collision. The damage stability is calculated and average survivability is estimated {{for the world}} fleet of <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> {{using data from the}} HARDER project. Generic results have been compared to specific results using the HARDER approach. The average survivability given collision with water ingress of <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> is also estimated based on records of recent <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> accidents and it is demonstrated that the HARDER results are in general agreement with historic data. A simplified approach to estimate the conditional survivability using simple event trees is also presented. Furthermore, it is estimated that the introduction of double side skin on <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> will enhance the survivability of <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> with approximately 5 – 7. 5 %. Finally, the longitudinal strength on <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> is considered in relation to collisions, and it is concluded that the longitudinal strength is dimensioned by other flooding conditions already included in the rules...|$|R

(Photograph courtesy Program in Maritime Studies, East Carolina University) This study explains the marine transition from Great Lakes steambarge, to wooden <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier,</b> and to {{iron and steel}} <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> designs. It also defines the morphological characteristics of wooden <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers.</b> First, a historical narrative explores influential shipbuilders, technological innovations, and economic factors {{that contributed to the}} development of wooden <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers.</b> Next, Monohansett’s working career explores dangers in operating wooden <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> on the lakes. Then, the archaeological investigations of Monohansett are presented, allowing an internal view of its design. Last, Monohansett’s construction techniques, as seen in the archaeological record, are compared to other archaeologically studied wooden <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers,</b> allowing this study to set a definition for their internal design char-acteristics. In this way, this approach demonstrates how these ships transfer bot...|$|R

50|$|A <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> is an {{ocean-going vessel}} used to {{transport}} bulk cargo {{items such as}} iron ore, bauxite, coal, cement, grain and similar cargo. <b>Bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> can be recognized by large box-like hatches on deck, designed to slide outboard or fold fore-and-aft to enable access for loading or discharging cargo. The dimensions of <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers</b> are often determined by the ports and sea routes {{that they need to}} serve, and by the maximum width of the Panama Canal. Most lakes are too small to accommodate <b>bulk</b> <b>carriers,</b> but a large fleet of lake freighters has been plying the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway of North America for over a century.|$|R
