5|$|Initially {{there were}} few visible changes within the church. Tkach {{continued}} Armstrong's tradition of traveling abroad, although his emphasis was more on visiting church members and operations than on Armstrong's agenda of visiting world leaders to attempt to witness to them. The church entered a period of rapid growth {{during the early years}} of Tkach's administration. In fact, the membership peaked during his tenure at 126,800 members in 1988. The finances were stable, largely due to the church's teaching that members should tithe, giving a tenth of their gross income to the church. The church magazine, The Plain Truth, continued to <b>serialize</b> the final and most controversial book by Armstrong, Mystery of the Ages. Tkach also continued, at least in public, to promote the church's unique doctrines.|$|E
25|$|XML {{has been}} used to {{describe}} structured data and to <b>serialize</b> objects. Various XML-based protocols exist to represent the same kind of data structures as JSON for the same kind of data interchange purposes. Data can be encoded in XML several ways. The most expansive form using tag pairs results in a much larger representation than JSON, but if data is stored in attributes and 'short tag' form where the closing tag is replaced with '/>', the representation is often about the same size as JSON or just a little larger. If the data is compressed using an algorithm like gzip, there is little difference because compression is good at saving space when a pattern is repeated.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of Canaan was first {{announced in the}} November issue of Newtype magazine that 428: Shibuya Scramble would have an anime adaptation. The show's title was later officially announced on 428: Shibuya Scrambles official website with P.A.Works doing the animation. A 17-second commercial was later aired on the show's official website. Comp Ace magazine had announced on a flyer that its July issue will <b>serialize</b> Canaans manga adaptation. Canaan is also scheduled to have a movie adaptation in October, in where all of its 13 episodes are compiled into one show. Canaan was released on Region 2 DVDs and in Blu-Rays on October 21, 2009, with the DVD being sold for ¥6,090 and the Blu-Ray for ¥7,140. As of 2012, there is no word about the Canaan OVAs.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 2000s, {{publishers}} {{finally found}} it feasible to start commercially supporting manga production: Kaza and Lazhari Labter, both publishers of youth literature, began publishing manga in 2011, and Z-Link, the first publisher dedicated entirely to manga was founded in 2007. Among these, the most notable is Z-Link: with a specific focus on developing new artists and bringing them to the market, it predominantly publishes small-format, softcover, black and white manga books with a small DZ-manga icon in the bottom left corner of their jackets. These run either as independent volumes or, on rare occasions, as installments in a small series (like Victory Road). They are printed on low-quality paper, allowing locally published volumes to remain affordable. This combination of publication strategies has enabled Algerian manga to circumvent the financial barrier to access that young Algerian consumers face with imported manga and even local BD albums. Easy to <b>serialize,</b> Z-Link's low-cost medium has also helped artists to compete – at least on a local level – with foreign manga that admittedly are more intricate and include higher quality graphics.|$|E

[...] The serialization sold poorly, but the book version was a surprise bestseller.

500|$|Hernandez found {{serialization}} {{an impediment}} {{to the type of}} storytelling he was attempting with Poison River. [...] Since its completion, he has chosen to <b>serialize</b> certain works, such as Julio's Day (2012) and Me for the Unknown in the second volume of Love and Rockets; and to publish others as stand-alone graphic novels, such as Sloth (2006) and Chance in Hell (2007).

500|$|Tremaine's {{policy of}} {{printing}} material {{that he liked}} without staying too strictly {{within the bounds of}} the genre led him to <b>serialize</b> H.P. Lovecraft's novel At the Mountains of Madness in early 1936. [...] He followed this with Lovecraft's [...] "The Shadow Out of Time" [...] in June 1936, though protests from science-fiction [...] purists occurred. [...] Generally, however, Tremaine was unable to maintain the high standard he had set in the first few years, perhaps because his workload was high. [...] Tremaine's slow responses to submissions discouraged new authors, although he could rely on regular contributors such as Jack Williamson, Murray Leinster, Raymond Gallun, Nat Schachner, and Frank Belknap Long. [...] New writers who did appear during the latter half of Tremaine's tenure included Ross Rocklynne, Nelson S. Bond, and L. Sprague de Camp, whose first appearance was in September 1937 with [...] "The Isolinguals". [...] Tremaine printed some nonfiction articles during his tenure, with Campbell providing an 18-part series on the solar system between June 1936 and December 1937.|$|E
500|$|South Park {{generally}} ends on {{a positive}} note and [...] "resets" [...] upon the next episode, in which way it is connected to traditional television sitcoms, as it does not <b>serialize</b> or employ story arcs with frequency. An example of this format is best characteristic of the show's early years, in which the character of Kenny was killed in each episode. In contrast, the stark, abrupt ending of [...] "You're Getting Old" [...] was inspired by modern television dramas, in which events can go poorly, and the episode ends regardless. The character of Sharon references this in one of the episode's final moments, criticizing, on a meta level, the show's form and reliance on [...] "happy endings." [...] Stone likened this structure to an [...] "immature view of the world": he remarks in the episode's DVD commentary that things do not often end on a [...] "happy" [...] note in real-life. Likewise, the dialogue between Sharon and Randy {{near the end of the}} episode functions as a meta-comment on the show's general form, which is consequently broken.|$|E

Wenner offered Wolfe around $200,000 to <b>serialize</b> his work. The frequent deadline pressure gave him the motivation he had hoped for, and from July 1984 to August 1985, he published a new installment in each biweekly issue of Rolling Stone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{collaboration}} {{between the two is}} believed by literary historians to have benefited Lane's career as much as her mother's. [...] Lane's most popular short stories and her two most commercially successful novels were written at this time and were fueled by material which was taken directly from Wilder's recollections of Ingalls-Wilder family folklore. [...] Let the Hurricane Roar (later titled Young Pioneers) and Free Land, both addressed the difficulties of homesteading in the Dakotas in the late 19th century, and how the [...] "free land" [...] in fact cost homesteaders their life savings. The Saturday Evening Post paid Lane top fees to <b>serialize</b> both novels, which were later adapted for popular radio performances. Both books represented Lane's creative and literary peak. [...] The Saturday Evening Post paid her $30,000 in 1938 to <b>serialize</b> her best-selling novel Free Land, ($ by today's standards). [...] Let the Hurricane Roar saw an increasing and steady sale, augmented by its adaptation into popular radio dramatization that starred Helen Hayes.|$|E
