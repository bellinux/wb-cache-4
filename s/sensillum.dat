50|$|Action {{potential}} recordings {{are conducted}} {{in three different}} ways electroantenograms, electropalpograms, and single <b>sensillum</b> recordings (SSR). In electroantenograms (EAG) and electropalpograms (EPG) the action potentials from the entire antenna or maxillary palp, respectively, is recorded. EAGs and EPGs provide an overall view of olfaction in the respective organ. During a SSR an electrode is inserted into just one <b>sensillum</b> and the recording is made from only the ORNs which are contained within that <b>sensillum,</b> providing more detailed information.|$|E
50|$|Campaniform sensilla are a {{class of}} mechanoreceptors found in insects, which respond to stress and strain within the animal's cuticle. Each campaniform <b>sensillum</b> {{consists}} of a flexible dome, which {{is surrounded by a}} socket within the cuticle. The dendrites of a single sensory neuron innervate each <b>sensillum.</b> Deformation of the dome opens mechanotransduction channels in the sensory neuron, which leads to the firing of action potentials that are transmitted to the central nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>sensillum</b> (pl.= sensilla) is an {{arthropod}} sensory organ {{protruding from}} the cuticle, or sometimes lying within or beneath it. Sensilla are divided into chemical, mechanical (e.g.: campaniform sensilla) , thermal, and humidity [...]|$|E
50|$|Insects {{evolved from}} prehistoric crustaceans, {{and they have}} {{secondary}} antennae like crustaceans, but not primary antennae. Antennae are the primary olfactory sensors of insects and are accordingly well-equipped {{with a wide variety}} of sensilla (singular: <b>sensillum).</b> Paired, mobile, and segmented, they are located between the eyes on the forehead. Embryologically, they represent the appendages of the second head segment.|$|E
5000|$|A {{diagnostic}} {{feature of}} species is the <b>sensillum</b> placodeum on the antennae. With {{respect to the}} <b>sensillum,</b> {{if there is a}} different morphology, then it is likely that these two or more species are different from one another based on phylogenetic speciation. Another problem is discerning a difference between species. “Cryptic species are those that satisfy an accepted concept of species, but which are closely similar or identical in morphology.” Many times, a specimen will be classified a member of a species based on its similarities to another member of that species. In the case of B. magnus, several taxonomists have argued that {{it is part of a}} long-ignored species, or really part of another species and was misidentified. Several species in the subgenus Bombus may actually be species complexes. B. magnus, B. lucorum, and B. cryptarum are referred to as the [...] "white-tailed bumblebee complex".|$|E
50|$|Prakash {{and colleagues}} {{explain that the}} brown-banded {{cockroach}} has five segmented maxillary palps and the most distal fifth segment has the largest segment with the most variety of sensilla. With the variety of shapes and sizes of the maxillary {{it is expected that}} they would have a variety of functions. In Prakash and colleagues experiment they observed that the curved edge of fifth segment that remained most ventral and probes the substratum with it during foraging. On the fifth segment parallel to the curved ventral edge on the medial surface is a longitudinal furrow that's densely lined with papillaform sensilla. The shaft of the papilla has a longitudinal slit near the distal tip, allowing dendrites of the <b>sensillum</b> to sense the external environment. These dendrites proceed in a wavy form through the shaft of the <b>sensillum.</b> The <b>sensillum</b> contains antennal glomeruli, suggesting that it has an olfactory role. Prakash and colleagues suggest that since the location of this sensilla is in the maxillary palp that this is a short-range olfactory detector for the micro-environment. The olfactory sensilla on the antenna and the double-walled sensilla on both palps probably serve as long-range odour sensors. The maxillary and labial palps show sexual dimorphism which suggests involvement in courtship. Females have more sensilla chaetica on both appendages than males whereas, males have more chemosensilla on the maxillary palps and taste sensilla on the labial palps.|$|E
50|$|In {{cockroaches}} Blaberus discoidalis and Blattella germanica, {{the organ}} has {{the shape of}} a fan that is placed across the limb. Much of its volume is filled with discoidal cells that serve accessory purposes; they are placed between an epidermal cell layer attached to the cuticle and connective tissue. Sensory structures called chordotonal sensilla are involved in the perception of movement proper and contain a neuron per <b>sensillum,</b> about 40-50 in total. This neuron has a single dendrite and several cilia extend from it.|$|E
50|$|Specifically {{the process}} is as follows: first the odorant wafts towards an insects antenna or maxillary palp which is covered with hair like {{projections}} called sensilla. The odorant then enters through tiny pours in the exoskeleton (or cuticle) of that <b>sensillum</b> and diffuses into the fluid between the cells called extracellular fluids. There the odorant molecule binds to an odorant binding protein which transports it to a receptor and co-receptor (Orco) team {{on the surface of}} the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN). This leads to the neuron firing an action potential down the axon. This signal is sent to the antennal lobe of the insects brain where it can then integrate the information with other signals from other sensilla.|$|E
50|$|Drone {{detection}} of 9ODA {{begins in the}} antennae, triggering a pathway that leads to behavioral responses. This begins with diffusion of 9ODA through the antennae's pores, into the lymph of the olfactory <b>sensillum.</b> The hydrophilic domain of carrier protein ASP1 binds to an apolar region of 9ODA, forming a complex that is transported to olfactory receptors located in the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Olfactory receptor AmOR11 specifically is involved {{in responding to the}} pheromone/carrier complex. Although expressed in all castes, expression of AmOR11 is significantly higher in drones, further suggesting its role in 9ODA detection. The binding of the pheromone/carrier to AmOR11 sends a signal to the brain's primary olfactory centres. The specific neural pathway by which 9ODA causes behavioral changes is not yet developed in bees, however research shows olfactory signals from floral odors are integrated to the level of mushroom bodies. Research has not been conducted for the 9ODA pathway.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The present {{investigation}} of the fine structure of antennal sensilla of fourth instar Toxorhynchites brevipalpis was undertaken to aid {{in our understanding of}} the sen-sory basis of behavior of predacious mosquito larvae and make contributions to the limited knowledge of the sensilla of immature, aquatic insects. Each antenna has 26 neurons which innervate 5 types of sensilla. At the antennal tip are a cone <b>sensillum</b> with a protuberance, a peg <b>sensillum,</b> and an unbranched hair <b>sensillum.</b> Two other unbranched hair sensilla, a branched hair <b>sensillum,</b> and a cam-paniform <b>sensillum</b> occur in the midregion. Another campaniform <b>sensillum</b> is at the base. Each cone <b>sensillum</b> is innervated by 11 neurons which occur in 6 distinct groups called neuronal units, each consisting of 1 - 3 neurons with inner and outer sheath cells. Medially on the cone is a small protuberance with a neuronal unit containing 2 neurons.

40|$|The flagellar sensory {{structures}} of Quadraspidiotus perniciosus Comstock (Rhynchota: Diaspididae) male have been investigated, using scanning and transmission electron microscopy.

40|$|Sex {{pheromone}} specific antennal sensilla of {{the male}} corn stemborer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe), were studied by electrophysiological and electronmicroscopical techniques. Electroantennographic measurements showed that the two pheromone components, (Z) - 11 -hexadecenal and (Z) - 11 -hexadecenol, elicited the highest responses together with a third potential pheromone component, (Z) - 10 -pentadecenal. Two physiological types of pheromone detecting sensilla trichodea were identified in the single <b>sensillum</b> measurements, In one <b>sensillum</b> type (type I), a receptor neuron characterized by a large action potential amplitude responded to (Z) - 11 -hexadecenal, and a neuron with a small spike amplitude responded to (Z) - 11 -hexadecenol, The receptor neurons present in this <b>sensillum</b> type also responded to other pheromone-like compounds produced in the female C, partellus pheromone gland. In a second <b>sensillum</b> type (type II), a single receptor neuron responded exclusively to (Z) - 9 -tetradecenal, a fourth potential pheromone component. The morphological investigation confirmed the presence {{of different types of}} sensilla trichodea. Sensilla trichodea containing one-to-three receptor neurons were observed. These sensillar types could however not be distinguished based on external morphology.

40|$|Within insect species, {{olfactory}} signals play a {{vital role}} in communication, particularly in the context of mating. During courtship, males of many moth species release pheromones that function as aphrodisiacs for conspecific females, or repellants to competing conspecific males. The physiology and antennal lobe projections are described of olfactory receptor neurons within an antennal <b>sensillum</b> present on male Heliothis virescens F. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) moths sensitive to conspecific male H. virescens-produced pheromone components. Olfactory receptor neurons responded to hexadecanyl acetate and octadecanyl acetate hairpencil components, and Z 11 -hexadecenyl acetate, an odorant used by closely related heliothine species in their female produced pheromone, which is antagonistic to male H. virescens responses. This acetate-sensitive <b>sensillum</b> appears homologous to a <b>sensillum</b> type previously described in females of this species, sharing similar physiology and glomerular projection targets within the antennal lobe. Wind tunnel observations indicate that H. virescens hairpencil odors (hexadecanyl acetate, octadecanyl acetate) function to antagonize responses of conspecific males following a female sex pheromone plume. Thus, male-male flight antagonism in H. virescens appears to be mediated by this particular <b>sensillum</b> type...|$|E
40|$|The {{sense of}} smell is {{essential}} for insects to find foods, mates, predators, and oviposition sites 3. Insect olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are enclosed in sensory hairs called sensilla, which cover the surface of olfactory organs. The surface of each <b>sensillum</b> is covered with tiny pores, through which odorants pass and dissolve in a fluid called <b>sensillum</b> lymph, which bathes the sensory dendrites of the OSNs housed in a given <b>sensillum.</b> The OSN dendrites express odorant receptor (OR) proteins, which in insects function as odor-gated ion channels 4, 5. The interaction of odorants with ORs either increases or decreases the basal firing rate of the OSN. This neuronal activity {{in the form of}} action potentials embodies the first representation of the quality, intensity, and temporal characteristics of the odorant 6, 7. Given the easy access to these sensory hairs, it is possible to perform extracellular recordings from single OSNs by introducing a recording electrode into the <b>sensillum</b> lymph, while the reference electrode is placed in the lymph of the eye or body of the insect. In Drosophila, sensilla house between one and four OSNs, but each OSN typically displays a characteristic spike amplitude. Spike sorting techniques make it possible to assign spiking responses to individual OSNs. This single <b>sensillum</b> recording (SSR) technique monitors the difference in potential between the <b>sensillum</b> lymph and the reference electrode as electrical spikes that are generated by the receptor activity on OSNs 1, 2, 8.

40|$|The solitary {{parasitoid}} Leptopilina heterotoma {{is one of}} {{the best}} studied organisms concerning the ecology, behaviour and physiology of host discrimination. Behavioural evidence shows that L. heterotoma uses its ovipositor to discriminate not only between parasitized and unparasitized Drosophila melanogaster larvae, but also to discriminate between hosts with different numbers of parasitoid eggs. The existing knowledge about how and when the parasitoid marks the host motivated us to unravel the chemosensory basis of host discrimination by L. heterotoma that allows it to choose the "best" host available.
