5|$|A {{more mundane}} {{example is the}} {{presence}} of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the writing}} of unit names is language-specific, {{the writing of}} unit <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> the values of {{quantities}} is consistent across all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them.

5|$|An {{important}} symbol {{among the}} Nri religion was the omu, a tender palm frond, used to sacralize and restrain. It {{was used as}} protection for traveling delegations or safeguarding certain objects; a person or object carrying an omu twig was considered protected. The influence of these <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> institutions extended well beyond Nri, and this unique Igbo socio-political system proved capable of controlling areas wider than villages or towns.|$|E

It derives from the full dress uniform of a consul of the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the history}} of Canada, {{heraldry}} in the country has incorporated aboriginal and First Nations <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> elements. The Coat of Arms of Nunavut, for example, includes elements such as an inukshuk, a qulliq, and an igloo, all of which are references to the Inuit peoples who live in the area, while the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority include ravens, a First Nations symbol of creation and transformation. In addition, some Canadians choose to bear their arms on a roundel rather than a shield, a reference to a drumhead; an example is the coat of arms of Nunavut.|$|E
5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} the real world {{represent}} character actions in an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical <b>symbols</b> <b>and</b> theatrical improvisation are used to bridge differences between the real world and the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Epic narratives, poems, sagas and allegories {{from all}} {{cultures}} tell such gripping tales {{that they have}} inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu Ramayana and Mahabharata; Homer's Odyssey and Iliad; the first Arabic novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan; the Persian epic Shahnameh; the Sagas of Icelanders and the celebrated Tale of the Genji. Collections of stories, such as Grimms' Fairy Tales or those by Hans Christian Andersen, have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, <b>symbols,</b> <b>and</b> structural elements to create new entertainment forms.|$|E
