40|$|Transmissible ileal {{hyperplasia}} (TIH) was experimentally induced in weanling hamsters, and {{the development}} of lesions was characterized. Ileal lesions developed in two phases: a hyperplastic phase which was detected by Day 10 and an inflammatory phase which began by Day 20. Hyperplasia began as focal lengthening of villi with expansion of crypt-type epithelium onto villus walls. Diffuse hyperplasia of distal ileum developed; dilated, tortuous crypts penetrated <b>subjacent</b> <b>supporting</b> tissues; but metastases were not seen. Inflammation began in association with focal or segmental necrosis of crypt epithelium, and crypt abscesses developed. Severe pyogranulomatous inflammation of the ileal wall, focal peritonitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, and portal hepatitis were common in advanced lesions. Development of ileal lesions was closely correlated with accumulation of particulate antigen, detectable by immunofluorescence, in the cytoplasm of mucosal epithelial cells. Antigen was also detected in ileal granulomas, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver. There was simultaneous development of serum antibody specific for intracytoplasmic antigen. These studies comfirm that mucosal hyperplasia is the primary lesion in TIH...|$|R
50|$|Lateral and <b>subjacent</b> <b>support,</b> {{in the law}} of property, {{describes}} the right a landowner has to have that land physically supported in its natural state by both adjoining land and underground structures. If a neighbor's excavation or excessive extraction of underground liquid deposits (i.e. crude oil or aquifers) causes subsidence (e.g. causing the landowner's land to cave in), the neighbor {{will be subject to}} strict liability in a tort action. The neighbor will also be strictly liable for damage to buildings on the landowner's property if the landowner can show that the weight of the buildings did not contribute to the collapse of the land. If the landowner is unable to make such a showing, the neighbor must be shown to have been negligent in order for the landowner to recover damages.|$|E
