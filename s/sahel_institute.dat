40|$|The <b>Sahel</b> <b>Institute</b> {{has just}} {{launched}} {{the publication of}} a biannual bibliographic series called RESINDEX. Developed as part of the Sahel Network on Information and Scientific and Technical Documentation, this bibliography is the result of cooperation among several national and regional centres involved in the RESADOC data base. RESINDEX consists of two parts: a bibliographic list where the references are classified according to RESADOC's categories (crop production, crop protection and harvest, livestock, fishing, environment, ecology, energy, hydrology, transportation, infrastructure, commercialization, demography, health/nutrition, human resources, rural economics and sociology, economic development planning, information/documentation), and an index by subject, geographic location, institute and author By thus creating its own 'memory bank', the <b>Sahel</b> <b>Institute</b> will no doubt make more efficient use of studies in its possession and increase its programming capacity, with a view to launching more widespread development activities in the Sahel Finally, by publishing RESINDEX, the <b>Sahel</b> <b>Institute</b> opens the way to a more effective use of existing documentation on the Sahel.

40|$|The annual chore of {{producing}} the annual all-important {{report of a}} national agricultural organisation often suffers {{from a lack of}} resources, including publishing and writing skills. In April 1999, CTA and the Agricultural Research Institute of Guinea organized a workshop near Conakry for 19 publications staff from government bodies and NGOs from Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, Madagascar, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, and Togo. Opened and closed by the Minister for Agriculture, the workshop covered the steps of planning, commissioning, writing, and producing an annual report. Participants not only exchanged their own experiences but also learned about those of other organisations from resource people from CTA, CIRAD, and the <b>Sahel</b> <b>Institute.</b> In April 1999, CTA and the Agricultural Research Institute of Guinea organized a workshop near Conakr...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{department of the}} <b>Sahel</b> <b>Institute</b> in Bamako, Mali has just released the results of trials conducted between 1981 - 1984 to compare different varieties of millet, sorghum, cowpeas and maize. They are {{the outcome of a}} regional crop improvement project involving eight CILSS countries (Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel) and financed by the EEC through the European Development Fund (EDF). As a result, a small number of varieties were identified as being capable of adapting to difficult climatic conditions. The project also {{led to the development of}} a facility to produce seeds for both breeding and production purposes. It was established to select an array of seeds to test for stability and production characteristics in several ecological zones. This project is an important element in the effort to reduce the food deficit but it must be part of an overall policy. Apart from the problems of price, credit and commercialization, the policy should embrace the distribution of seeds to peasants, improvement of other production factors such as the use of fertilizers and appropriate cultivation techniques, and the maintenance of soil fertility. Such measures are the responsibility of each of the countries concerned. The authors of the report, G. Loynet, A. Kere and O. Sidibe, rightly emphasize that the selection of new varieties and their distribution must be considered an important but not decisive link in making agriculture more intensive. A significant and lasting increase in agricultural production cannot be envisaged simply by exchanging local varieties for improved ones with peasants who are not able to take advantage of this change. Seed selection inevitably involves a trade-off between loss of hardiness and increased productivity. If the other conditions for more-intensive agriculture are not met, there is every possibility that the peasants will reject the new varieties For further information. contact: CILSS Institut du Sahel B P. 1530 Bamako MaliThe {{research department}} of the <b>Sahel</b> <b>Institute</b> in Bamako, Mali has just released the results of trials conducted between 1981 - 1984 to compare different varieties of millet, sorghum, cowpeas and maize.
