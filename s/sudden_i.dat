25|$|I guess {{though you}} could {{honestly}} say {{the relationship between}} Greg (Chappell) and myself, {{when he came back}} from World Series Cricket, and all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>I</b> was playing in Queensland with him, was difficult for a little while.|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} from Matthew West's new album, [...] "My Own Little World" [...] was {{released}} on August 23, 2010. The album, The Story of Your Life, was released October 5, 2010, and according to West, {{is a response to}} thousands of life stories his fans shared with him. [...] "The first day, I got 1,000 stories. All of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>I</b> was like, 'holy cow, something special is about to take place'. I rented a cabin in Tennessee, about 25 minutes from my house that felt like it was {{out in the middle of}} nowhere. And I spent two months in that cabin reading 10,000 stories," [...] the singer/songwriter reported in an interview with CBN.com. Matthew is also starring in The Heart of Christmas.|$|E

500|$|Kinsler was {{promoted}} two levels on June 12 to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. [...] "When I first got called up, {{there were a}} million things running through my head", he said. [...] "I was nervous, my hands were sweating. It was really exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. I was a little nervous that ... all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't be able to hit." [...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E
500|$|Wayne Pommen, the first-choice Cambridge bow, {{was injured}} {{two days before}} the race, {{fracturing}} his wrist following a full-speed collision with the harbourmaster's launch during a practice start. [...] Matthias Kleinz was hit on the head but did not require medical attention. Cambridge number seven James Livingston said: [...] "For a couple of seconds I thought I was going to die. [...] We were going flat out and all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>I</b> heard Jim's voice. [...] I've never heard so much fear in anybody's voice before." [...] Pommen was circumspect: [...] "A few of us were feeling quite lucky last night... at the same time, it was very frustrating and disappointing... but there was no point sulking in the corner." [...] Three oars were destroyed and two riggers bent; the boat was sent to Weybridge to be repaired. [...] Pommen was replaced by Ben Smith, brother of the Oxford stroke Matthew. [...] Not since the 1979 race had such a late change in the line-up of a crew been made. Along with James and David Livingston, {{this was the first time}} in the history of the Boat Race that two pairs of brothers would be racing against one another.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>I</b> thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I really think I owe it to myself and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E

500|$|Ashmore {{indicates}} that his casting {{was both a}} surprise and what he wanted. The actor states, [...] "I auditioned for [...] and I put myself on tape. I hadn't heard anything, {{and a couple of}} weeks later, all of the <b>sudden,</b> <b>I</b> got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really." [...] Aaron Ashmore's twin, Shawn, who is better known as Bobby [...] "Iceman" [...] Drake in the X-Men film series, appeared in two episodes of Smallville as the power leeching Eric Summers. After three seasons with the show, two as a series regular, Ashmore was written out of the series. According to Ashmore, when the producers were first trying to get permission to use the character on Smallville, DC Comics had qualms over how close Jimmy was in age to Clark and Lois, as the character was supposed to be at least ten years younger. The producers guaranteed the department they would eventually reveal the Jimmy Olsen who appeared on the show was not the Jimmy Olsen who would one day work alongside Clark and Lois. At the character's funeral, his full name is shown to be [...] "Henry James Olsen", and it is alluded that Jimmy's younger brother, who is given a brief appearance at the funeral, is the DC Comics version of Jimmy Olsen who will one day work at the Daily Planet with Clark and Lois. Although Ashmore was sad to leave the show, he feels that the redemptive story that was given to Jimmy in the finale, through the self-sacrifice he makes for Chloe, makes a good send off for his character.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>I</b> was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E

2500|$|I {{am getting}} more into performing. [...] It's incredible. [...] When I played Carnegie Hall {{in the fall}} {{something}} just happened.

[...] But now the combination seems to be right and it's been clicking a lot.|$|E
2500|$|Aderca was {{similarly}} troubled by philosemitism. He believed that positive discrimination was counterproductive, and favored race blindness: [...] "When [...] secretly confesses philosemitism, {{all of a}} <b>sudden</b> <b>I</b> have a hunch. I would prefer to know he is indifferent." [...] Looking back on Romanian antisemitism, Aderca sided with other Jewish thinkers who looked favorably on ethno-nationalists such as Mihai Eminescu. He argued that Eminescu's work was not particularly antisemitic, and evidenced those traits which gave it universal appeal.|$|E

2500|$|In 1931, Gimbutas {{settled with}} her parents in Kaunas, the {{temporary}} capital of Lithuania, where she continued her studies. After her parents separated that year, she lived {{with her mother and}} brother, Vytautas, in Kaunas. Five years later, her father died suddenly. At her father's deathbed, Gimbutas pledged that she would study to become a scholar: [...] "All of a <b>sudden</b> <b>I</b> had to think what I shall be, what I shall do with my life. I had been so reckless in sports—swimming for miles, skating, bicycle riding. I changed completely and began to read." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 3 July 2012, Jágr {{signed a}} one-year deal, {{reportedly}} worth $4.5 million, with the Dallas Stars. The signing marked Jágr's first time {{playing for a}} club in the Western Conference. Jágr said during a conference call two days later that the Montreal Canadiens had been his first choice as a free agent. [...] "I always wanted to play in Canada and I {{wanted to go to}} Montreal if I had a chance, but Montreal wasn't interested," [...] Jágr said. [...] "All of a <b>sudden</b> <b>I</b> {{got a phone call from}} Stars' general manager Joe Nieuwendyk that Dallas was interested." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, 27 October 1912, the 18-year-old Kiyoaki and Honda {{are talking}} {{on an island}} in the {{ornamental}} lake on the estate when they see Kiyoaki's mother, her maids, and two guests: Satoko Ayakura, the 20-year-old daughter of a count, and her great-aunt, the Abbess of Gesshu. The Ayakura family is one of twenty-eight of the rank of Urin, and they live in Azabu. Kiyoaki is aware that Satoko has a crush on him, and pretends indifference to her. Shortly after they all meet, there is a bad omen: they see a dead black dog {{at the top of a}} high waterfall. The Abbess offers to pray for it. Satoko insists on picking flowers for the dog with Kiyoaki. While Satoko is alone with Kiyoaki, she blurts out: [...] "Kiyo, what would you do if all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>I</b> weren't here any more?" [...] He is discomfited by the inexplicable question, and resents the fact that she has startled him with it.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his search}} for radio work {{following}} his graduation, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. He stopped and was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing [...] "I freaked out. I got real nervous that I wasn't good enough". Stern accepted a marketing role at Benton & Bowles, a New York advertising agency, which he soon [...] "quit without giving notice" [...] {{in favor of a}} position in the creative department. He lasted three hours before he was fired [...] "because their personnel department realized that I was the guy who just quit." [...] Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, [...] "All of a <b>sudden</b> ... <b>I</b> realized I had turned down a job in radio". With encouragement from his mother and girlfriend, Stern contacted WRNW for work and agreed to take cover shifts surrounding the Christmas holidays in 1976. Impressed with his reliability and professional approach, the station's director hired Stern full-time for a four-hour midday shift for six days a week, for $96 a week. After several months, Stern became the station's production director which lasted until November 1977 when he became its program director for an increased salary of $250 a week. To save money, Stern rented a room in a monastery in Armonk, New York.|$|E
2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>I</b> felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E
