500|$|Sons of Soul {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. Billboard {{praised the}} record's traditional influences and contemporary sensibilities, calling it [...] "a prismatic record from a maturing group", and The New Yorker <b>said</b> <b>Tony!</b> Toni! Toné! easily transitioned from [...] "irresistible dance tracks... to lovely, sensuous ballads" [...] on the album. In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot hailed Sons of Soul as [...] "the most accomplished merger of hip-hop attitude with a '70s R aesthetic", deeming the group's funk and soul music savvy, particularly {{because of their}} incorporation of Memphis soul guitars and fashionable rhythms and turntable scratches. Kot compared Raphael Wiggins to Stevie Wonder as a singer, while USA Todays James T. Jones believed the record's groovy, catchy songs were comparable to Sly Stone. Reviewing the album in Time, Christopher John Farley found the music elegant and more innovative than the band's previous records. Michael Saunders from The Boston Globe believed even without a song as great as their 1990 hit [...] "Feels Good", the record was [...] "unquestionably better than {{nearly all of the}} formulaic soul/pop albums littering the charts", featuring ballads that sounded intimate without being overly sentimental. Robert Christgau was somewhat less enthusiastic in The Village Voice, citing [...] "If I Had No Loot" [...] and [...] "Anniversary" [...] as highlights while jokingly calling the group [...] "sexy liars of the year". In a more critical review, Spins Jonathan Bernstein was not impressed by songs such as [...] "If I Had No Loot" [...] and [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around", accusing Tony! Toni! Toné! of competing with contemporary R acts such as Silk, H-Town, and Intro.|$|E
2500|$|Pickard {{explained}} Tony's {{reason for}} marrying Cindy saying: [...] "he’s {{looking forward to}} someone {{not so much to}} fall in love with, but for more practical reasons – so he lets himself be swept off his feet by Cindy". Shortly before the wedding Tony becomes intoxicated and has sex with a woman who Darren has paid. Tony admits this to Cindy who in turn admits she and Darren had been planning to scam Tony. Waring <b>said</b> <b>Tony</b> has [...] "been a good man telling the truth and Cindy takes that as her opportunity to tell him the truth. All the cards are on the table". Pickard said he was [...] "surprised that Tony would go through with it because of their volatile relationship and the fact that Tony knows Cindy's into Darren. I think he wanted to just go for it with her, and hopefully it'll work out for him". Pickard later stated that he didn't think Cindy was right for Tony stating: [...] "I don't think she's the one for him, to be honest". Tony meets Gabby Sharpe (Phina Oruche) which allows him to realise [...] "his marriage is over and he intends to tell Cindy that as soon as he gets home".|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Soap Stars, Debbie Foy refers to Tony as having lived through several {{dramatic}} episodes. Foy {{went on to}} describe Tony as being famous for his [...] "many on-screen relationships, affairs and engagements" [...] but always has plenty of heartache. The Daily Star described Tony as going [...] "through more women than he’s served hot meals in his restaurant Gnosh" [...] before adding {{that he is a}} [...] "loser-in-love". They commented that after dumping Cindy [...] "this time he’s only got himself to blame". On the character Sky said: [...] "Tony Hutchinson is our fave character on the show. Probably because he's been on it the whole time since it started in 1995". An Inside Soap critic responded negatively to a plot centring on Tony catering for the college ball saying [...] "Just who do the Hollyoaks writers think they are catering for with a plot like this? Do us a favour and serve up something decent!" [...] The Liverpool Echos Caroline Corcoran reviewed Hollyoaks: Movin' On saying the spinoff provided [...] "an insight in to Tony's character that we don't get in Hollyoaks, and I actually found myself feeling for a character that is normally written to be deliberately irritating". Another critic for Inside Soap felt Hollyoaks was back to a high standard before adding that [...] "Tony Hutchinson has been on fine comedy form following the disastrous transformation of his garden by 'Charlie Dimmock'". Inside Soaps Lucy said that [...] "You've got to feel sorry for Hollyoaks's Tony Hutchinson ... Give the man a break!" [...] Following Tony's relationship with Mandy becoming troubled. Lucy's colleague Sam also reviewed the storyline saying: [...] "Feel sorry for Tony? Oh get over it! He deserves everything he's got coming to him. What is Mandy doing with him anyway? He's far too old, a total fuddy duddy, and has had the same naff hairstyle for seven years!" [...] While reflecting on [...] "some of soap's more memorable business ideas", an Inside Soap writer, on Tony's business ideas, said: [...] "Tony Hutchinson, {{is not so much the}} king of money-making schemes - more of an old skin-flint ... he came up with the idea of recycling all his guest's used water ... When his recycling racket was discovered, his claims that it was just an innovative method of being environmentally friendly wouldn't wash - we all knew it was just his cheap-skate way of reducing his water bill! However, to this day his roses continue to bloom strangely well". Inside Soap critic Sam expressed disinterest in a storyline in which Tony and Ruth kiss, questioning if they have [...] "gone back in time or something?" [...] Merle Brown of the Daily Record bemoaned the lack of realism in Tony's storylines saying: [...] "why on earth would Izzy go out with Tony? Yes, she's slightly irritating, but in the real world would a man like Tony honestly have a constant stream of girlfriends?" [...] Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail felt that [...] "Asking Tony for guidance is the equivalent of asking the obese for dieting tips, such a fat lot of good he is". Stephens later <b>said</b> <b>Tony</b> has [...] "enjoyed the company of as many women as Hugh Hefner". During the Enjoy The Ride storyline, Inside Soaps Sarah said [...] "there are standout performances from some of my all-time favourite Hollyoaks stars" [...] which she said included Pickard.|$|E
