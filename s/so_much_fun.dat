I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "There was a stunt which {{she did not want to}} do herself, but I told her 'You want to be authentic so I want you to pull me,' so she obliged.

500|$|Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks and Nickelodeon Movies {{hoped the}} film {{would become a}} {{franchise}} like the Harry Potter film series.

5000|$|Many grown-up {{children}} of the '80s have {{a special place in}} their hearts for ladies such as the Go-Go's, Bananarama, and Kim [...] "Kids in America" [...] Wilde.

Their songs made pining and heartache sound like <b>so</b> <b>much</b> friggin' <b>fun.</b> Finally, the valley girl woes have a new poster girl: Manda Marble. Manda and the Marbles are a Columbus, Ohio trio whose songs mirror those of sassy female-fronted pop bands - sunny surf rhythms and rather forlorn subject matter.|$|R

Guggenheim said: I've never had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> writing a script before ... It was such a blast to work on... I keep telling everyone that we should try for Avengers. It's these two heroes together with a big production value. ... There's the opportunity for inside jokes, and seeing all of the characters together. What happens when Cisco gets his eyes on Thea? There are moments like that, that you just can’t do in a normal episode....It's just <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> In October 2014, the title of The Flash episode was announced as [...] "Flash vs. Arrow".

5000|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} by Variety, and described as [...] "a silly farce with few amusing moments {{and many more}} boring ones". The San Francisco Chronicle noted that [...] "the film goes {{as far as a}} non-pornographic film can go in depicting sexuality" [...] but [...] "Eventually you catch on that the film isn't really making <b>fun</b> of itself <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as making <b>fun</b> of the audience for watching." [...] However, Rotten Tomatoes gives Paris, France a %73 rating, meaning good reviews.|$|R
5000|$|Loewenthal later recalled, [...] "we {{just started}} making music in our bedroom, which {{was like a}} big granny flat sort of thing.

So we made that track then stewed on it, then made heaps of tracks - then after a while we just decided to put them up and see what people thought. We got a much better reaction than we'd ever had for Alice Blu - so we were a bit excited about that." [...] According to Byron Bay Festival's correspondent, they played a [...] "blend of ambient harmonies, layered rhythms and pulsing soundscapes."

500|$|Julianne Moore as Julian Taylor. For Julian, Cuarón {{wanted an}} actor who had the [...] "credibility of leadership, intelligence, [...] independence".

However, I {{think that in}} another week I shall be over that, and shall then begin to learn my work as an officer. They are a jolly set of fellows here, always up to some fun or other. I always thought when fellows got to be men they were rather serious, {{but it seems to}} me that there is ever <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more <b>fun</b> here among them than there was at school. Of course {{newcomers}} get worried a little just as they do at school. I got off very well; because, you see, what with school and the privateer I have learned to take things good temperedly, and when fellows see that you are as ready for fun as they are they soon give up bothering you.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{had laughed}} some more, {{all of which}} goes to show {{how easy it is}} to be mistaken, and how foolish it is to laugh at things you really don't know about. Buster Bear had come to live in the Green Forest, and Farmer Brown's boy had seen his footprint. But Farmer Brown laughed <b>so</b> <b>much</b> and made <b>fun</b> of him <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> that at last his boy began to think that he must have been mistaken after all. So when he heard Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay making a great fuss near the edge of the Green Forest, he never once thought of Buster Bear, as he started over to see what was going on.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot {{awarding}} it 7.6/10, saying [...] "Ridge Racer V is a fun, great-looking {{game that}} will please older Ridge Racer fans. Players that {{picked up the}} series around {{the third or fourth}} game may be a little disappointed with the way the cars handle, but not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that their <b>fun</b> will be ruined. Overall, the game feels a little rushed with its easy-way-out track design, and it's really a shame that Ridge Racer V wasn't given the same treatment that Tekken Tag Tournament received when it was translated for the domestic market".|$|R
500|$|For {{his eighth}} birthday, Stevens {{received}} a new basketball hoop. [...] "It’s <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to dream in your driveway," [...] he later remarked.

[...] He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for grilled cheese sandwiches over to Monk's house, so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook.|$|E
500|$|I {{love this}} song for many reasons. It had a {{different}} sound {{than a lot of}} my songs. I related to it personally more than other songs, and I have <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> with it. I thought if it could be a single that it would be incredible to perform it all the time ... What stands out about the song [...] I can dance to it and rock out to it, which is ultimately my goal. I was just so excited when I heard this one, 'cause it's the epitome of where I want to go with the future.|$|E
500|$|I think I should {{rephrase}} {{myself from}} my previous letters when I {{was talking about}} taking a 'break'. What I meant was I am {{taking a break from}} being told what to do. ... It's cool when you look at someone and don't know whether they are at work or play since it's all the same to them. The things I've been doing for work lately have been <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun,</b> because it's not like work to me anymore. I've been even more 'hands on' in my management and the business side of things, and I feel more in control than ever.|$|E

John Simpson, who joined the unit as a pilot officer two months after Hull, recalled finding [...] "a confidence when flying with Caesar that was wholly lacking otherwise." [...] "I have never seen anyone who could throw a fighter about with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> confidence as old Caesar," [...] said another pilot, quoted by Beedle. [...] "Nobody gave me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> confidence to have a lead from, nobody gave me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> exhilaration and <b>fun.</b> Following Caesar you found yourself getting more out of your machine than you had ever imagined was possible, doing things that done by yourself would have made your hair stand on end." ...|$|R
500|$|Up to {{the point}} the episode aired, Anna Torv {{considered}} it her favorite episode, explaining, [...] "In ‘Bound,’ when Olivia gets kidnapped, they’re giving her a spinal tap and she wakes up and breaks out – it was just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. I found it really easy to follow and kind of energetic, and I really loved filming that."

500|$|The torture {{scene at}} the end of the film did not {{initially}} contain Asami's lines [...] "Kiri-kiri-kiri". Shiina was initially whispering her lines while filming this scene, but after discussion with Miike, the two decided that having her say these lines would make the scene scarier. Ishibashi found that Miike was [...] "having <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> with that scene", and that Miike was especially excited when Ishibashi's character's feet are cut off. For the special effects where Shiina's character places acupuncture needles into Ishibashi, special effects make-up was used to create a mask layer which was laid upon Ishibashi's eyes, which is then pierced by the needles.|$|E
500|$|In her weekly {{blog post}} for TV Guide, actress Kate Flannery {{wrote of the}} producer's cut, [...] "Isn't that cool? I think the Office fans are going to really dig it.

5000|$|In many ways, I'll {{agree with}} it. That's {{another way of}} saying, [...] "Crawford's games aren't that much fun." [...] And there is some merit in that.

None of my games are great, none of my games have touched people deeply, but that is what I am {{learning}} how to do ... none of my games can hold a candle to any of Charlie Chaplin's works.

500|$|In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown {{described}} Gilmour's guitar {{style as}} [...] "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures." [...] According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on [...] "Money", [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "Comfortably Numb" [...] "cut through the mix like {{a laser beam}} through fog." [...] Brown described the [...] "Time" [...] solo as [...] "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato." [...] Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: [...] "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting... singing sustain... you need to play loud — {{at or near the}} feedback threshold. It's just <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more <b>fun</b> to play... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade." ...|$|R
