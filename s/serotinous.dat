5|$|Banksia ilicifolia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic shoots {{under its}} bark. Follicles open and release seeds after several years. It is weakly <b>serotinous,</b> like eight other Banksia species, {{all of which}} tend to occur in Western Australia's southwestern corner. The other two species of the {{subgenus}} Isostylis are killed by fire and regenerate by seed.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{response}} {{may also}} furnish {{an explanation for}} the evolution of this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales would have created different evolutionary pressures, with plants on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly <b>serotinous,</b> and plants in swales adapting to patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and swale plants, although evidence suggests that there was some introgression at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly <b>serotinous</b> plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two populations to drift independently of each other.|$|E
5|$|Banksia menziesii regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, or from epicormic buds on the trunk. It is {{generally}} only weakly <b>serotinous</b> {{in the southern}} part of its range, that is, it lacks a canopy seed bank as follicles on old flower spikes in the canopy release their seed after two years, but populations retain more seed as populations move north. Lower canopies and drier climates predispose to hotter fires that are more likely to kill plants and effect seed release, and thus facilitate seedling recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, {{but is also}} <b>serotinous</b> in {{that it has a}} seed bank held in its canopy to be {{released}} after fire. The number of flowers produced by plants growing back from fire peaks two or three years afterwards. A field study in Brisbane Water National Park north of Sydney found that plants that had experienced two short (less than seven-year) intervals between bushfires had reduced reproductive output as measured by lower numbers of follicles, compared with plants in areas which had had no or one short inter-fire interval. Plants can live for over 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oblongifolia {{plants can}} live {{for more than}} 60 years. They respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the {{greatest}} number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat, although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are <b>serotinous,</b> that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} tree in Yellowstone, the lodgepole pine, fared poorly from the fires, except {{in areas where}} the heat and flames were very mild. The lodgepole pine is <b>serotinous</b> and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire. Research of test plots established after the fires indicated that the best seed dispersal occurred in areas which had experienced severe ground fires, and that seed dispersal was lowest in areas which had only minor surface burns. Regions with crown fires sometimes had the highest rates of regeneration of lodgepole pine after 5years. However, the rate of lodgepole regeneration was not uniform, with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less. Stands of dead lodgepole killed by the fires may persist for decades, rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many Banksia species, B.telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B.telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency {{may be one reason}} why B.telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia. Unlike most <b>serotinous</b> Banksia species, the seeds of B.telmatiaea are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator. If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is <b>serotinous,</b> that is, it has {{an aerial}} seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened by fire and release seed in large numbers, which {{germinate}} and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed. Flower spikes appear to have similar numbers of follicles regardless of the age of the parent plant. Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and store progressively larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence seed) in the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 viable seeds per plant. Plants appear to have a life span of at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known. An experimental burn and monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed B.speciosa seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two years than co-occurring Banksia species. Though this suggested B.speciosa might outcompete its conspecifics, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment.|$|E
25|$|Another species well {{adapted to}} a {{particular}} disturbance is the Jack Pine in boreal forests exposed to crown fires. They, {{as well as some}} other pine species, have specialized <b>serotinous</b> cones that only open and disperse seeds with sufficient heat generated by fire. As a result, this species often dominates in areas where competition has been reduced by fire.|$|E
25|$|Forest fires play an {{important}} role in regulating the growth of plants in the Pine Barrens. Frequent light fires tend to reduce the amount of undergrowth and promote the growth of mature trees. Forest fires have contributed to the dominance of pitch pine in the Pine Barrens. They can resist and recover quickly from fire by resprouting directly through their bark (something very unusual for pines). Their <b>serotinous</b> pine cones open only after having been heated by a fire. The prevalence of forest fire allows the pitch pines to dominate over oaks, which by comparison are usually killed outright by a moderate or intense fire. High air temperatures and dry plant undergrowth contribute to the intensity of the fire. While severe fires are uncommon, severe fires at fairly frequent intervals can eliminate species that do not bear seed at an early age. Frequent killing fires keep an area covered with small sprouts.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} other {{characteristics}} of B.prionotes {{can be understood as}} secondary responses to weak serotiny. For example, winter flowering ensures that seed is ripe {{by the beginning of the}} bushfire season; this is very important for weakly <b>serotinous</b> species, which rely heavily upon the current year's seed crop. Another example is the deciduous florets of B.prionotes. In strongly <b>serotinous</b> species, the old florets are retained on the cones, where they function as fire fuel, helping to ensure that follicles reach temperatures sufficient to trigger seed release. In B.prionotes, however, seed release is triggered at relatively low temperatures: in one study, 50% of follicles opened at , and 90% opened at in contrast, the closely related but strongly <b>serotinous</b> B. hookeriana required [...] respectively. Floret retention would therefore be to no advantage, and might even prevent seed from escaping spontaneously opened follicles.|$|E
500|$|The {{response}} of Banksia marginata to fire is variable. In the Gibraltar Range and Sydney regions, plants {{are killed by}} fire and regenerate from seed. They are <b>serotinous,</b> storing their seed in old cones, forming a seedbank in their canopy which is released after bushfire. A field study found that seeds were dispersed short distances (generally [...] or less), with those closest to the parent plant faring the best. In Little Desert National Park in northwestern Victoria and also eastern south Australia, it grows as a low shrub which suckers (shoots growing from lateral roots) after fire. Plants {{do not appear to}} live longer than 25 years; after this time the ageing plants begin to die and are succeeded by younger plants arising from suckers around the parent. A field study in Gippsland found counting the nodes of Banksia marginata plants to be accurate in indicating age within a year up to 21 years since the last fire. There is anecodotal evidence of plants reaching 150 years old in this region. Plant species from communities dependent on fire are thought to self-select to be more flammable; Banksia marginata tested from a dry sclerophyll community in southeastern Tasmania was shown to burn readily, and fire would spread easily through it.|$|E
500|$|It is {{moderately}} <b>serotinous,</b> storing {{only one}} tenth {{the number of}} seeds in its seed bank as the reseeding B.hookeriana with which it coexists on sand dunes in scrub at Eneabba north of Perth. Even then, many of its follicles do not release seed after a fire, but instead after successive autumn rains. An experiment simulating wet weather following a fire saw a series of Banksia attenuata cones with follicles subjected to twice weekly immersions in water after being heated in a ring Bunsen flame to around [...] for two minutes. Cones that {{had been exposed to}} water for more weeks had more seed released from follicles over time; around 40% released at threeweeks, increasing steadily to almost 90% at tenweeks, compared with a series of controls (which were kept dry) of which fewer than 10% of seed released. Thus, the seed remains in the follicles until successive rains result in seed dispersal in the wetter winter (instead of dryer summer), increasing the chance of survival. After the follicle is split, the seed and separator are exposed to the elements. The wings of the woody separator are hygroscopic, and move together when wet, and spread and curl apart when dry. The seed is gradually drawn out by the movement with each wetting.|$|E
2500|$|Plants {{have evolved}} many adaptations {{to cope with}} fire. [...] Of these adaptations, {{one of the best-known}} is likely pyriscence, where {{maturation}} and release of seeds is triggered, in whole or in part, by fire or smoke; this behaviour is often erroneously called serotiny, although this term truly denotes the much broader category of seed release activated by any stimulus. [...] All pyriscent plants are <b>serotinous,</b> but not all <b>serotinous</b> plants are pyriscent (some are necriscent, hygriscent, xeriscent, soliscent, or some combination thereof). [...] On the other hand, germination of seed activated by trigger is {{not to be confused with}} pyriscence; it is known as physiological dormancy.|$|E
2500|$|Eucalyptus oil {{is highly}} {{flammable}} (ignited trees {{have been known}} to explode); bushfires can travel easily through the oil-rich air of the tree crowns. [...] Eucalypts obtain long-term fire survivability from their ability to regenerate from epicormic buds [...] situated deep within their thick bark, or from lignotubers, or by producing <b>serotinous</b> fruits.|$|E
50|$|Serotiny {{can occur}} in various degrees. Plants that retain all of their seed indefinitely {{in the absence of}} a trigger event are {{strongly}} <b>serotinous.</b> Plants that eventually release some of their seed spontaneously {{in the absence of a}} trigger are weakly <b>serotinous.</b> Finally, some plants release all of their seed spontaneously after a period of seed storage, but the occurrence of a trigger event curtails the seed storage period, causing all seed to be released immediately; such plants are essentially non-serotinous, or facultatively <b>serotinous.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Serotinous</b> adaptations have {{occurred}} in at least 530 species in 40 genera, which together constitute a paraphyletic group. Serotiny likely evolved separately in these species, but may in some cases have been lost by the related non-serotinous species.|$|E
50|$|Fire {{occurs at}} low-moderate {{frequency}} with high severity. Many plants {{have adapted to}} this by having <b>serotinous</b> seeds that open to germinate only under high heat. Because of this, they are often the first to colonize a new area.|$|E
50|$|Pinus virginiana is in {{the family}} Pinaceae and the order Pinales. A {{molecular}} phylogeny indicates that the sister taxa to Pinus virginiana are Pinus clausa, Pinus contorta, and Pinus banksiana. Pinus banksiana has shorter needles than P. viginiana at 2-3.5 centimeters in length, whereas P. virginiana is 2-8 centimeters in length. P. banksiana needles are not twisted, but curved, and has cones that are <b>serotinous</b> and unarmed. The leaf sheaths in P. banksiana are less than 2.5 millimeters long. In P. virginiana the needles are twisted and straight. The cones open at maturity, are not <b>serotinous</b> and the scales on the cones have prominent prickles. The sheaths of the P. virginiana are greater than 2.5 millimeters long. Pinus clausa has larger needles than the P. virginiana. The Pinus clausa has needles that are between 5 and 13 centimeters long, P. virginiana has needles that range between 2 and 8 centimeters long. Pinus clausa is also <b>serotinous.</b> Lastly, Pinus virginiana and Pinus contorta are distributed differently: Pinus virginiana are found {{on the eastern side}} of the United States, whereas Pinus contorta are found on the western side. A similarity between Pinus virginiana and Pinus contorta is that the needles of both species are twisted.|$|E

50|$|The {{relative}} importance of serotiny can vary among populations of the same plant species. For example, North American populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) can vary from being highly <b>serotinous</b> to having no serotiny at all, opening annually to release seed. Different levels of cone serotiny {{have been linked to}} variations in the local fire regime: areas that experience more frequent crown-fire tend to have high rates of serotiny, while areas with infrequent crown-fire have low levels of serotiny. Additionally, herbivory of lodgepole pines can make fire-mediated serotiny less advantageous in a population. Red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) and red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) will eat seeds, and so <b>serotinous</b> cones, which last in the canopy longer, {{are more likely to be}} chosen. Serotiny occurs less frequently in areas where this seed predation is common.|$|E
50|$|Monterey pine is {{a species}} adapted {{to cope with}} stand-killing fire disturbance. Its cones are <b>serotinous,</b> i.e. they remain closed until opened by {{the heat of a}} forest fire; the {{abundant}} seeds are then discharged to regenerate on the burned forest floor. The cones may also burst open in hot weather.|$|E
5000|$|Eucalyptus oil {{is highly}} {{flammable}} (ignited trees {{have been known}} to explode); bushfires can travel easily through the oil-rich air of the tree crowns. [...] Eucalypts obtain long-term fire survivability from their ability to regenerate from epicormic buds situated deep within their thick bark, or from lignotubers, or by producing <b>serotinous</b> fruits.|$|E
50|$|The needles are {{in bundles}} {{of three or}} four, and 15 - 20 cm long. The almost round cones are 5 - 8 cm long with small prickles on the scales. Its cones are usually <b>serotinous,</b> {{requiring}} fire to open. The pond pine is found in wet habitats near ponds, bays, swamps, and pocosins.|$|E
50|$|Banksia ilicifolia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic shoots {{under its}} bark. Follicles open and release seeds after several years. It is weakly <b>serotinous,</b> like eight other Banksia species, {{all of which}} tend to occur in Western Australia's southwestern corner. The other two species of the {{subgenus}} Isostylis are killed by fire and regenerate by seed.|$|E
50|$|Fire is {{the most}} common and best studied case. Some plants may respond to more than one of these triggers. For example Pinus halepensis {{exhibits}} primarily fire-mediated serotiny, but responds weakly to drying atmospheric conditions. Similarly, some Banksia species are strongly <b>serotinous</b> with respect to fire, but also release some seed in response to plant or branch death.|$|E
50|$|Another species well {{adapted to}} a {{particular}} disturbance is the Jack Pine in boreal forests exposed to crown fires. They, {{as well as some}} other pine species, have specialized <b>serotinous</b> cones that only open and disperse seeds with sufficient heat generated by fire. As a result, this species often dominates in areas where competition has been reduced by fire.|$|E
50|$|Most beaufortias are <b>serotinous,</b> only {{reproducing}} from seed, {{released from}} the fruit after fire. Several species which occur in areas where fire is frequent, have a lignotuber which resprouts after fire. Honeyeaters (Family Meliphagidae) and the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) {{are thought to be}} the main pollinators but many kinds of insect have also been recorded on beaufortia flowers.|$|E
50|$|The {{conifers}} are <b>serotinous,</b> {{meaning they}} release seeds {{in response to}} an environmental trigger. Seed release in the forest relies on fire and shoot death. Shoot death is when death of a stem signals cones to release seeds. One example of serotiny due to shoot death is cupressaceae. Although shoot death can be cause by fire, there are other sources of stem death. Closed-cone forests rely on predictable, infrequent fires. The fires are stand-replacing crown fires. One example of serotiny due to fire is Pinacae releasing seed after the cone has undergone 200°C for five minutes. Sargent cypress, Gowan cypress, McNabb cypress, Monterrey Pine, and Torrey Pine are all California endemic <b>serotinous</b> conifer species. Serotiny offers benefits to plant species because after a fire, there is less competition for the seeds on the ground. Thus, the fire signals an advantageous time for trees to drop their seeds.|$|E
50|$|Surviving pockets {{exist in}} several small nature {{reserves}} within the city, such as Rondevlei, Kenilworth Racecourse, Rondebosch Common and Tokai Park. These {{are identified as}} “Core Conservation Sites”. However, these sites alone {{are too small to}} preserve this vegetation type, and they themselves are threatened by invasive alien plants and the destructive practise of mowing (which eliminates all the tall and <b>serotinous</b> species).|$|E
50|$|Banksia baxteri is <b>serotinous,</b> that is, it has {{an aerial}} seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened with fire and release seed in large numbers, which {{germinate}} and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 9 to 12 years old have been found to have seed that remains 100% viable.|$|E
50|$|In the Pinus genus, serotiny likely evolved {{because of}} the {{atmospheric}} conditions during the Cretaceous period. The atmosphere during the Cretaceous had higher oxygen and carbon dioxide levels than our atmosphere. Fire occurred more frequently than it does currently, and plant growth was high enough to create an abundance of flammable material. Many Pinus species adapted to this fire-prone environment with <b>serotinous</b> pine cones.|$|E
50|$|The seed cones are oblong-ovoid to cuboid, 15-25 mm {{long and}} 13-20 mm broad, with six (rarely four or eight) scales, each scale bearing a {{prominent}} umbo; they are strongly <b>serotinous,</b> not opening {{to release the}} seeds until the parent tree is killed by wildfire. This enables heavy seed release to colonize the bare, fire-cleared ground. The pollen cones are 3-4 mm long, and release their pollen in the fall.|$|E
