40|$|Graduation date: 2014 This {{study focused}} on the {{potential}} water and energy savings from implementing a revised schedule of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> connected to a condensing gas tankless water heater located in a study home in Portland, Oregon. The existing <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> activation schedule was studied for {{its impact on the}} overall water use and energy efficiency of the water heater. Utilizing the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> for water events was found to reduce overall water consumption by 14. 84 times the consumption when not using the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump.</b> The use of the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> was also found to reduce the energy efficiency of the water heater by 7. 82 %. Based on these findings, a revised schedule was developed for homeowner adoption. Regional expansion of this technology was examined through the development of a suitability index that highlighted building and homeowner characteristics likely to lead to technological adoption. This suitability index was applied to a map of the Portland metro area to identify suitability hotspots for energy policy applications on a larger scale. Results of the expanded analysis indicated that there are significant impacts to water consumption and energy efficiency with the adoption of this technology.

50|$|The RPV and Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) have {{significant}} improvements, {{such as the}} substitution of RIPs, eliminating conventional external recirculation piping loops and pumps in the containment that in turn drive jet pumps producing forced flow in the RPV. RIPs provide significant improvements related to reliability, performance and maintenance, including a reduction in occupational radiation exposure related to containment activities during maintenance outages. These pumps are powered by wet-rotor motors with the housings connected {{to the bottom of}} the RPV and eliminating large diameter external recirculation pipes that are possible leakage paths. The 10 internal <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> are located at the bottom of the annulus downcomer region (i.e., between the core shroud and the inside surface of the RPV). Consequently, internal <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> eliminate all of the jet pumps in the RPV, all of the large external <b>recirculation</b> loop <b>pumps</b> and piping, the isolation valves and the large diameter nozzles that penetrated the RPV and needed to suction water from and return it to the RPV. This design therefore reduces the worst leak below the core region to effectively equivalent to a 2 in leak. The conventional BWR3-BWR6 product line has an analogous potential leak of 24 or more inches in diameter. A major benefit of this design is that it greatly reduces the flow capacity required of the ECCS.|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} to vent in zero gravity without resettling is a technology need that involves practically all uses of sub-critical cryogenics in space, and would extend cryogenic orbital transfer vehicle capabilities. However, {{the lack of}} definition regarding liquid/ullage orientation coupled with the somewhat random nature of the thermal stratification and resulting pressure rise rates, lead to significant technical challenges. Typically a zero gravity vent concept, termed a thermodynamic vent system (TVS), consists of a tank mixer to destratify the propellant, combined with a Joule-Thomson (J-T) valve to extract thermal energy from the propellant. Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC's) Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) {{was used to test}} both spray-bar and axial jet TVS concepts. The axial jet system consists of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> heat exchanger unit. The spray-bar system consists of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump,</b> a parallel flow concentric tube heat exchanger, and a spray-bar positioned close to the longitudinal axis of the tank. The operation of both concepts is similar. In the mixing mode, the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> withdraws liquid from the tank and sprays it into the tank liquid, ullage, and exposed tank surfaces. When energy extraction is required, {{a small portion of the}} recirculated liquid is passed sequentially through the J-T expansion valve, the heat exchanger, and is vented overboard. The vented vapor cools the circulated bulk fluid, thereby removing thermal energy and reducing tank pressure. The pump operates alone, cycling on and off, to destratify the tank liquid and ullage until the liquid vapor pressure reaches the lower set point. At that point, the J-T valve begins to cycle on and off with the pump. Thus, for short duration missions, only the mixer may operate, thus minimizing or even eliminating boil-off losses...|$|R

50|$|The {{two-phase}} fluid (water and steam) above the core enters the riser area, {{which is the}} upper region contained inside of the shroud. The height of this region may be increased to increase the thermal natural <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumping</b> head. At {{the top of the}} riser area is the moisture separator. By swirling the two-phase flow in cyclone separators, the steam is separated and rises upwards towards the steam dryer while the water remains behind and flows horizontally out into the downcomer or annulus region.

50|$|Usually {{there are}} also other means of {{controlling}} reactivity.

Operators of the BWR design use the coolant flow through the core to control reactivity by varying the speed of the reactor <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps.</b> An increase in the coolant flow through the core improves the removal of steam bubbles, thus increasing the density of the coolant/moderator with the result of increasing power.|$|R

50|$|For example, if {{the reactor}} got too hot, it would trigger {{a system that}} would release soluble neutron {{absorbers}} (generally a solution of borated materials, or a solution of borax), or materials that greatly hamper a chain reaction by absorbing neutrons, into the reactor core. The tank containing the soluble neutron absorbers would be located above the reactor, and the absorption solution, once the system was triggered, would flow into the core through force of gravity, and bring the reaction to a near-complete stop. Another example was the Isolation Condenser system, which relied {{on the principle of}} hot water/steam rising to bring hot coolant into large heat exchangers located above the reactor in very deep tanks of water, thus accomplishing residual heat removal. Yet another example was the omission of <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> within the core; these pumps were used in other BWR designs to keep cooling water moving; they were expensive, hard to reach to repair, and could occasionally fail; so as to improve reliability, the ABWR incorporated no less than 10 of these <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps,</b> so that even if several failed, a sufficient number would remain serviceable so that an unscheduled shutdown would not be necessary, and the pumps could be repaired during the next refueling outage. Instead, the designers of the simplified boiling water reactor used thermal analysis to design the reactor core such that natural circulation (cold water falls, hot water rises) would bring water {{to the center of the}} core to be boiled.|$|R
40|$|In {{designing}} {{systems for}} the long-term storage of cryogens in low gravity space environments, one must consider the effects of thermal stratification on excessive tank pressure that will occur due to environmental heat leakage. During low gravity operations, a Thermodynamic Venting System (TVS) concept is expected to maintain tank pressure without propellant resettling. The TVS consists of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump,</b> Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion valve, and a parallel flow concentric tube heat exchanger combined with a longitudinal spray bar. Using {{a small amount of}} liquid extracted by the pump and passing it though the J-T valve, then through the heat exchanger, the bulk liquid and ullage are cooled, resulting in lower tank pressure. A series of TVS tests were conducted at the Marshall Space Flight Center using liquid nitrogen as a liquid oxygen simulant. The tests were performed at fill levels of 90 %, 50 %, and 25 % with gaseous nitrogen and helium pressurants, and with a tank pressure control band of 7 kPa.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on the {{assumption}} that the costly human albumin is not completely used during Single Pass Albumin Dialysis (SPAD) and is largely rejected. In order to verify this hypothesis, an additional pump was connected to the filtration line and the dialysate line to partially recirculate the dialysis solution that had already passed through the filter. In contrast to the commercially obtainable MARS® system, the dialysate solution containing the albumin is not cleaned after passing through the filter; part of it is rejected immediately afterwards and part of it after renewed circulation. Four series of experiments with the additional pump operating at three different speeds (180 ml/min, 270 ml/min, 90 ml/min) were carried out. 2000 ml of plasma, which was full of toxins, were detoxified for 6 hours using the various setup modes in the OLAD (Open Loop Albumin Dialysis) system for each experiment (number of experiments = 4 per setup mode) during this in vitro study. All the experiments were performed using the CVVHDF configuration. The concentrations of ammonia, creatinine, urea, uric acid, albumin, protein and bilirubin were set in order to assess the detoxification capacity. The samples were obtained before the start of the experiment and at particular time intervals. Bilirubin was selected as the marker for albumin-bonded substances and it was reduced from 16. 5 ± 0. 9 mg/dl to 8. 0 ± 1. 3 mg/dl through the OLAD mode when the speed of the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> was set at 90 ml/min. It was possible to reduce the concentration of bilirubin from 17. 2 ± 0. 4 mg/dl to 9. 5 ± 0. 8 mg/dl by setting the speed of the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> to 180 ml/min. By increasing the recirculation speed to 270 ml/min, it was possible to reduce the bilirubin level from 17. 5 ± 1. 8 mg/dl to 7. 5 ± 1. 5 mg/dl. A reduction in the concentration of bilirubin from 17. 4 ± 0. 4 to 8. 8 ± 0. 6 mg/dl was observed within the standard SPAD procedure (i. e. without any additional <b>pump</b> for <b>recirculation</b> purposes or with the recirculation speed set at 0 ml/min). Ammonia was selected as the marker for the water-soluble toxins that are clinically significant during liver failure. The concentration of ammonia was reduced from 244. 8 ± 67. 6 mg/dl to 19. 6 ± 12. 9 mg/dl using SPAD (the speed of the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> was 0 ml/min). Using the OLAD option and the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pump</b> speed set at 90 ml/min, the ammonia level fell from 214. 7 ± 34. 3 mg/dl to 24. 2 ± 8. 7 mg/dl. If the speed was doubled to 180 ml/min, it was possible to reduce the concentration of ammonia from 245. 7 ± 36. 5 mg/dl to 36. 3 ± 13. 7 mg/dl and, if the speed was increased to 270 ml/min, from 237. 2 ± 38. 5 mg/dl to 22. 4 ± 8. 4 mg/dl. An analysis of variance was used to analyse the results of the experiments. The partial recirculation of the dialysate solution containing albumin did not offer any statistically significant effect for the detoxification potential of SPAD when eliminating albumin-bonded and water-soluble toxins...|$|R

40|$|The dry out {{criterion}} (MCPR) {{has been}} {{calculated for the}} most limiting H 2 -events for Forsmarks unit 2 and 3, at operating points that are normally not analyzed before each cycle. The operating points that normally are regarded as {{the ones with the}} lowest margin to dry out are the ones where the thermal power is the highest at agiven recirculation flow. This report shows {{that this is not the}} case for Forsmark 3. MCPR-values at partial power operating points are higher for the limiting case inside rather than on the boundary of the region of operation. It is therefore recommended that the method for determining the dry out criterion for Forsmark 3 is revised to account for this effect. It is recommended that the number of operating points studied is increased or that a conservative value is established of how large the effect of operating point can have on MCPR.

The effect on MCPR of changing the A/B- and scram-runback ramps of the <b>recirculation</b> <b>pumps</b> for Forsmark 3 has also been calculated. The alternative rampused was found to give a decrease in the MCPR value between about 20 - 30 units, depending on fuel type, at partial power operation.
