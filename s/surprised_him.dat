5|$|With his sprinting prosthesis, McFall began {{training}} with an ex-Paralympian. In early 2005 former Welsh international athlete Darrell Maynard {{took over as}} his coach and he began {{training with}} an able-bodied squad. He was selected to represent Great Britain at the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) European Championships {{which took place in}} August 2005 in Espoo, Finland, a decision that greatly <b>surprised</b> <b>him</b> as he had not achieved the qualifying standard in races that summer. In the Championships, his first international competition, he took the bronze medal in the 200metres and came fourth in the 100-metre race, having competed in sport class T42 (single amputation above the knee). McFall was subsequently placed on a funding programme, enabling him to become a full-time athlete.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, Spee led his squadron across the Pacific to the coast of South America. Here on 1 November, he defeated the British 4th Cruiser Squadron under Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock in the Battle of Coronel, sinking two of Cradock's cruisers and forcing his other two ships to retreat. A month later, Spee decided to attack the British naval base in the Falkland Islands, though a superior British force <b>surprised</b> <b>him.</b> In the ensuing Battle of the Falkland Islands, Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee's squadron, which included two powerful battlecruisers, destroyed the East Asia Squadron. Spee and his two sons, {{who happened to be}} serving on two of his ships, were all killed, along with about 2,200 other men. Spee was hailed as a hero in Germany, and several ships were named in his honor, including the heavy cruiser , which was built in the 1930s and was defeated in the Battle of the River Plate during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The carnival's backstory {{begins at}} the end of the nineteenth century when Lucius Belyakov, a Russian aristocrat from Minsk and officer in the Tsar's army, became aware of his Avataric powers. The birth of his son Alexei evoked dark visions in him. After Belyakov's attempt to kill two-year-old Alexei, his wife fled with their two {{children}} to America, but news spread they perished in a train accident soon thereafter. Resuming his duties in Lemberg in 1914, Belyakov was again afflicted by dark visions. Henry Scudder, an American who had escaped prosecution for criminal activities in his home country by joining foreign armies, had had psychokinetic powers since childhood. At the time of Belyakov's visions, Scudder was stationed in Lemberg as an observer for the Austro-Hungarian Army. Belyakov became obsessed with killing his spiritual enemy (Scudder) and deserted his post, but an escaped circus bear feeding on the dead nearby <b>surprised</b> <b>him</b> in an attack. Belyakov was so gravely injured he would lose an arm and both legs.|$|E

The group began to reform and reconcile their differences, planning to start recording a comeback album at the beginning of the following year.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} force now {{proceeded to}} Buhahayen, principal town {{of the island}} and {{the capital of the}} most important chief. Buhahayen was well fortified. Shortly after their arrival the Spanish were involved in a skirmish with the natives. Rodríguez was still aboard his flagship, but seeing that the Spanish were faring badly, he left the ship with a few men to take command. In order to travel more quickly, he was not wearing his helmet. Before he reached the scene of the skirmish, a single native <b>surprised</b> <b>him,</b> giving him a blow on the head with a sword.|$|E
25|$|In October 1960, Gaggi {{committed}} {{his first}} murder for the Gambino family. He {{served on a}} hit squad that murdered mobster Vincent Squillante, who is suspected of killing Scalise. According to Montiglio, Gaggi described the murder: “We <b>surprised</b> <b>him</b> (Squillante) in the Bronx. We {{shot him in the}} head, stuffed him in the trunk, then dumped him for good.” In this case, “dumped him for good” meant that they hauled the body to the basement of a building, loaded it into a trash incinerator, and cremated it. After the Squillante murder, Gaggi was inducted into the Gambino family.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force; Hotze was killed during this maneuver when Soult's men <b>surprised</b> <b>him</b> on an early morning reconnaissance. By the time Alexander Suvorov arrived from northern Italy into St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E
25|$|Gregory VII {{replied with}} a rough letter, dated 8 December 1075, in which, among other charges, he accused the German king of {{breaching}} his word and with his continued support of excommunicated councilors. At the same time, he sent a verbal message suggesting that the enormous crimes which would be laid to his account rendered him liable, {{not only to the}} ban of the Church, but to the deprivation of his crown. Gregory did this {{at a time when he}} himself was confronted by a reckless opponent in the person of Cencio I Frangipane, who on Christmas night <b>surprised</b> <b>him</b> in church and carried him off as a prisoner, though on the following day Gregory was released.|$|E
25|$|Holyfield {{made his}} next defense in Atlanta against Bert Cooper, who <b>surprised</b> <b>him</b> {{with a very}} good effort. Holyfield scored the first {{knockdown}} of the fight against Cooper with a powerful shot to the body, but Cooper returned the favor with a good right hand that sent Holyfield against the ropes; while not an actual knockdown, referee Mills Lane gave Holyfield a standing 8-count. Having suffered the first technical knockdown of his professional career, Holyfield regained his composure quickly and administered a beating that left Cooper still on his feet, but unable to defend himself. Holyfield landed brutal power shots, culminated by repeated vicious uppercuts that snapped Cooper's head back. Referee Mills Lane stopped the bout in the seventh.|$|E

25|$|New manager Frank O'Farrell led United to an eighth-place {{finish in}} 1971–72. Highlights for Best {{included}} hat-tricks against West Ham United and Southampton, {{as well as}} a goal against Sheffield United that came after he beat four defenders in a mazy run. However, he was also sent off against Chelsea, was the subject of death threats, and failed to turn up for training for a whole week in January as he instead spent his time with Miss Great Britain 1971, Carolyn Moore. On 17 November, he was the subject of Eamonn Andrews's This Is Your Life when he was surprised at a central London restaurant. He would be the subject for a second time in 2003 when Michael Aspel <b>surprised</b> <b>him</b> at Teddington Studios. With 27 goals in 54 appearances, Best finished as the club's top-scorer for the sixth – and final – consecutive season. Best then announced his retirement from football, but nevertheless turned up for pre-season training, and continued to play.|$|E
25|$|According to Polybius (bold {{emphasis}} added) Just at this time, Gaius Atilius, {{the other}} Consul, had reached Pisa from Sardinia with his legions {{and was on}} his way to Rome, marching in the opposite direction to the enemy. When the Celts were near Telamon in Etruria, their advanced foragers encountered the advance guard of Gaius and were made prisoners. On being examined by the Consul they narrated all that had recently occurred and told him of the presence of the two armies, stating that the Gauls were quite near and Lucius behind them. The news <b>surprised</b> <b>him</b> but at the same time made him very hopeful, as he thought he had caught the Gauls on the march between the two armies. He ordered his Tribunes to put the legions in fighting order and to advance thus at marching pace in so far as the nature of the ground allowed the attack in line. He himself had happily noticed a hill situated above the road by which the Celts must pass, and taking his cavalry with him, advanced at full speed, being anxious to occupy the crest of the hill before their arrival and be the first to begin the battle, feeling certain that thus he would get the largest share of credit for the result.|$|E
25|$|Nomura's father {{influenced}} {{his interest}} in art and games early on, creating little drawings and unique Sugoroku board games for him. Nomura started drawing {{at the age of}} three years and developed his own Sugoroku games during his elementary school years. As a child, he spent much of his free time playing baseball, swimming, fishing and building fortresses. When he was in middle school, his father told him that an era of computers would come and bought him his own computer. Nomura played Legends of Star Arthur: Planet Mephius on it and started creating his own video games by learning programming. He first tried a Nintendo product with the tennis and ping-pong variant of the Color TV Game console and later borrowed a Family Computer in high school. Around that time, Dragon Warrior became Nomura's favorite because it <b>surprised</b> <b>him</b> and introduced him to video games with story elements. His art teacher in high school pointed him towards the works of Final Fantasy illustrator Yoshitaka Amano. Nomura also created his own manga during class and intended to do this as a profession although he ultimately abandoned the idea. Nomura went to vocational school to learn magazine and advertising artwork. Nomura then looked for an advertising job at a publishing company. However, he eventually applied at the video game company Square after he had seen a job advertisement with a drawing by Yoshitaka Amano.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "Scouting" [...] {{seems to}} have been {{inspired}} by the important and romantic role played by military scouts performing reconnaissance in the wars of the time. In fact, Baden-Powell wrote his original military training book, Aids To Scouting, because he saw the need for the improved training of British military-enlisted scouts, particularly in initiative, self-reliance, and observational skills. The book's popularity with young boys <b>surprised</b> <b>him.</b> As he adapted the book as Scouting for Boys, it seems natural that the movement adopted the names Scouting and Boy Scouts.|$|E
