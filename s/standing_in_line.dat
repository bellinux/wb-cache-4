5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were hung over while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last shot of the film where the killer is seen <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> at the movie theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who {{had been}} fired in the {{previous}} episode, auditions for The Next Great A Cappella Sensation. However, before {{he is able to}} try out, the judges close the auditions, sending home the remaining applicants, who have been <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for hours. Refusing to accept this, he bolts past security and argues with the judges to let him audition. When they refuse, he throws a crying tantrum. Later, he journeys to Poor Richard's Pub, where he meets his former office workers. All together, the office watches the official airing of the documentary on PBS's Scranton affiliate station, WVIA-TV.|$|E
5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car {{that matches the}} one from the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him to run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|When rehearsals {{began in}} October 1874, the {{orchestra}} had difficulties with the score, finding some parts unplayable. The chorus likewise declared {{some of their}} music impossible to sing and were dismayed {{that they had to}} act as individuals, smoking and fighting onstage rather than merely <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line.</b> Bizet also had to counter further attempts at the Opéra-Comique to modify parts of the action which they deemed improper. Only when the leading singers threatened to withdraw from the production did the management give way. Resolving these issues delayed the first night until 3 March 1875 on which morning, by chance, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was announced.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Ethel & Millie then {{abandoned}} their battered boat and were hauled aboard the German submarine, where the Nelson survivors last saw them <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> being addressed by a German officer. The seven British sailors of the Ethel & Millie were never seen again, and much controversy exists surrounding their disappearance. Prevailing opinion {{at the time was}} that they were murdered and dumped overboard by the German crew or abandoned at sea without supplies, but these scenarios cannot be substantiated. Another theory is that they were taken prisoner aboard the boat and killed when the submarine was itself sunk. The son of Arthur Soanes, a sailor who disappeared in this incident, later claimed to have contacted his father through his powers as a spiritual medium, reporting that he had died on board the German vessel. UC 63 has been named as the submarine that sank both vessels.|$|E
5|$|Brett's replacement, Major General George Kenney, {{arrived in}} the theater in August, and Walker was {{appointed}} Commanding General, V Bomber Command, Fifth Air Force on 3 September, with his headquarters in Townsville. At this time, Port Moresby was subject to frequent Japanese air raids, so the bombers were generally based in the Townsville area and staged through Port Moresby to minimize their chance of loss or damage on the ground. In mid-September 1942, {{at the height of}} the Kokoda Track campaign, Kenney sent Walker to Port Moresby for a few weeks to direct the advanced echelon, to give Whitehead a rest and Walker more experience. Walker attempted to lift morale by improving the men's living conditions. He made a point of small gestures of fellowship, such as <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the men at meal times. But what endeared him most to his men was his willingness to share the dangers as well as their hardships, by flying a mission a week on average. In October, General Douglas MacArthur gave Kenney a dressing down for flying over the Owen Stanley Range. In turn, Kenney ordered Walker, Wilson and Whitehead not to fly any more missions. For a variety of reasons, all four of them eventually disobeyed their orders.|$|E

He was given a lavish pension as an older-generation party member and continued to reside in a luxurious Dorobanți villa. In the 1980s, he was sometimes seen <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> to buy groceries, a rigid expression on his face, his eyes averted. Late in that decade, he was reportedly pleased by the increasing isolation and seeming self-destruction of Ceaușescu's regime.|$|E
25|$|Raymond J.

Place also agreed to let the officers search the luggage he had checked, but they declined to do so in light of the flight's imminent departure. Discrepancies between the two luggage tags on Place's two suitcases further aroused the officers' suspicions, and they confirmed that the addresses were false. The Miami officers alerted DEA agents at LaGuardia to their suspicions about Place.|$|E

25|$|Matt Ouimet, {{the former}} {{president}} of the Disney Cruise Line, was promoted to assume leadership of the Disneyland Resort in late 2003. Shortly afterward, he selected Greg Emmer as Senior Vice President of Operations. Emmer was a long-time Disney cast member who had worked at Disneyland in his youth prior to moving to Florida and held multiple executive leadership positions at the Walt Disney World Resort. Ouimet quickly set about reversing certain trends, especially concerning cosmetic maintenance and a return to the original infrastructure maintenance schedule, in hopes of restoring Disneyland's former safety record. Similarly to Disney himself, Ouimet and Emmer could often be seen walking the park during business hours with members of their respective staff, wearing cast member name badges, <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for attractions, and welcoming guests' comments. In July 2006, Matt Ouimet left The Walt Disney Company to become president of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. Soon after, Ed Grier, executive managing director of Walt Disney Attractions Japan, was named president of the resort, though he retired from his job on February 8, 2008. In October 2009, Grier announced his retirement, and was replaced by George Kalogridis.|$|E
500|$|The first table read of {{the episode}} was held on January 9, 1991. The episode was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on January 15, 1991. Filming {{of the episode}} took place at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where, starting with the season premiere [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", filming of all the show's episodes took place. A few scenes were changed prior to the filming of the episode. The scene in which Jerry informs George he told Elaine about the apartment initially showed them <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for the movies, talking about sitting {{in the front of the}} theatre. George would tell Jerry that he once pretended to have a grotesque physical impairment while he was <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> to get a ticket for The Exorcist (1973), and people would let him go in front of them without saying anything. The location of this scene, however, was changed to Monk's Cafe, a regular hangout for the show's main characters, and George and Jerry's dialogue was shortened. In the original script, Jerry, instead of George, proclaimed himself [...] "lord of the idiots", but this was changed during rehearsals.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for Top Hat {{were mainly}} positive. The Los Angeles Evening Herald Express praised the film, exclaiming [...] "Top Hat is the tops!

[...] The New York Times praised the film's musical numbers, but criticized the story line, {{describing}} it as [...] "a little on the thin side," [...] but also stating that [...] "it is sprightly enough to plug those inevitable gaps between the shimmeringly gay dances."Top Hat" [...] is worth <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for.

500|$|Officials set up {{emergency}} {{water purification}} plants in Acapulco, though water remained largely unavailable. Water trucks {{were sent to}} the city, with thousands <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for fresh water. Tourists in luxury hotels of Acapulco, for the most part generally unaffected by the hurricane, and rapidly recovered while other parts of the city remained devastated. Hotels were forced to use bottled water and ration their available water to as little as possible to provide water {{for the rest of the}} city. Extreme price gouging occurred in the city following the hurricane, with one consumer protection official reporting shopkeepers charging 200percent more for milk, 500percent more for tortillas, and 1000percent more than usual for water. Even though the government was blamed for lack of warnings and water shortages, Ernesto Zedillo, the president of Mexico at that time, cut his vacation in Europe short to respond to the catastrophe. [...] Government officials set up 39aid centers for Acapulco citizens, though some residents were unable to get food and water. Some residents suspected than the President and his Institutional Revolutionary Party of taking aid supplies for their own purposes. The president promised to seek charges and decided to close aid centers in favor of opening soup kitchens. Despite having the food, the Mexican army did not set up the kitchens, nor was aid distributed at the aid centers.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Rob Walker of Yahoo! called PewDiePie's {{popularity}} [...] "insane", writing, that it [...] "strikes me as {{considerably more}} curious — I mean, {{you know who}} Rihanna is, but would you recognise this kid if he were <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> behind you at the bank?" [...] Walker, among other reporters and some casual gamers, have questioned the reasons for his popularity, while other reporters have criticised his rise in notability. Walker commented on PewDiePie's interaction with his audience, writing, [...] "While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly {{more than willing to}} make fun of himself in the process." [...] In 2015, The Verge wrote, [...] "Love it or hate it, his success — like so many other YouTube personalities — isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record." [...] He refers to his fan base as the [...] "Bro Army" [...] and addresses his audience as [...] "bros". On this, Walker wrote, [...] "Profanity aside, it's a bummer that his persona includes constant references to his viewers as [...] "bros," [...] and that he's loose with words like [...] "bitch" [...] when his gaming adventures lead him into contact with female villain characters. Given how smart this guy clearly is when he speaks directly, I suspect he could modify his demeanor in a way that remained engaging to a young fan base but somehow contributed to improving gamer-land’s sometimes disturbingly bro-centric attitude." [...] However, both Walker and Reed have commented on PewDiePie's intelligence, with Reed opining, [...] "He's much more thoughtful and self-aware than he seems in many of his videos." ...|$|E
