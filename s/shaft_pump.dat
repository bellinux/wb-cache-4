40|$|Abstract. Thermal sprayed WC-based {{coatings}} {{are widely}} used in modern industry, especially in excellent wear-resistant-demanding fields, due to their high hardness and superior mechanical properties. WC-Co is a typical representative of the coatings, usually used as the protective layers of <b>shaft,</b> <b>pump</b> sleeve intine, etc. WC-Co coatings were prepared on low carbon steel substrate using {{high velocity oxygen fuel}} (HVOF) technology, under different distance ranging from 160 to 240 mm. The influence of the spraying distance on coating hardness was investigated and discussed. The results reveal that, the cross-sectional hardness of the HVOF WC-Co coatings depend not only on the spraying distance, but also on the indentation position. The average microhardness for all the coatings was obviously enhanced. The highest one (1793. 6 Hv) was produced with a distance of 240 mm. Due to the heat effect of the flame, the hardness for all coatings varies with the distance from indentation to coating/substrate interface...|$|E
40|$|In {{vertical}} <b>shaft</b> <b>pump</b> turbines {{operating in}} pumped storage power plants {{an important role}} is played by a thrust bearing. Due to the bidirectional character of operation, thrust bearing tilting pads have to be supported symmetrically, which {{is known to be}} unfavourable {{from the point of view}} of their performance. Large thrust bearings have to be carefully designed so as to minimise excessive thermo-elastic pad deformations. The research into fluid film thrust bearings has been quite extensive over the years, comprising theoretical studies of bearing properties with the use of more and more sophisticated calculation codes. On the other hand, the availability of experimental field data on bearing operation is limited, for obvious reasons. In this paper the authors present part of the results of extensive field tests of a large bearing of a pump-turbine they have conducted in a pumped storage power plant. Hopefully this data will be of interest to other researchers to compare theoretical predictions to measurement data...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{research}} program {{based on a}} scientific and technical monitoring of the EGS Soultz power plant has been achieved during geothermal exploitation between 2010 and 2012. Several hydraulic circulation tests have been performed that involve one production well, GPK- 2 and two reinjection wells, GPK- 1 and GPK- 3 : a long term circulation for about 11 months in 2010, and two short term circulation tests in 2011. In 2012, a short term circulation test sharply stopped due to a serious down-hole pump failure. During the 2010 exploitation, geothermal fluid discharge from GPK- 2 reached a volume of about 500 000 m 3 by producing at 18 L/s for a temperature of 164 Â°C. Tracer test was conducted and showed the good connection between GPK- 3 and GPK- 2. In 2010, more than 400 induced micro-seismic events of low magnitude occurred. In 2011, geothermal fluid discharge from GPK- 2 reached a volume of about 300 000 m 3 by producing at 24 L/s for a temperature of 159 Â°C. The strategy was to increase the reinjection flow rate in the shallow well GPK- 1 (3. 6 km) and simultaneously minimize it in GPK- 3 in order to decrease reinjection pressure. Induced seismic activity was seriously decreased with less than 10 microearthquakes in 2011. In 2012, GPK- 4 well, a former production well was converted into an injection well but for a rather short period, due {{to the failure of}} the down-hole production pump. New improvements about Line <b>Shaft</b> <b>Pump</b> (LSP) technology were done and another pump was designed and tested before its setting in GPK- 2. In parallel, many research works have been carried out for characterizing scaling and the natural radioactivity derived from natural brines circulating within a deep fractured granite reservoir. Down-hole pump technology was also tested in various geothermal conditions during exploitation. In 2010, the LSP worked for more than 300 days without any trouble. In 2011, occurrences of cuttings at higher flow rate, generated abrasion of the pump reinforcing its damaging. In 2012, serious damages occurred on its hydraulic part in terms of abrasion and corrosion. Environmental nuisances were also investigated in order to evaluate their impact on the local population and then on public acceptance.

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{pressing}} problems constraining the development of geothermal energy {{is the lack of}} satisfactory component and system reliability. This is due to the unavailability, on a commercial scale, of cost-effective materials that can function {{in a wide range of}} geothermal environments and to the unavailability of a comprehensive body of directly related test data or materials selection experience. In 1976, the GHTD started the Geothermal Materials Program to address materials-related problems, and since 1978 Brookhaven National Laboratory has provided technical and managerial assistance in the implementation of the effort. Major successes have been attained in the development of elastomers for high-temperature applications and in the use of polymer concrete liners for corrosion protection. Both technologies have been successfully transferred to industry. Current efforts in metallic and nonmetallic materials development and corrosion protection will be summarized. In the metals area, testing of a series of experimental stainless steels has led to compositions which show a very remarkable resistance to pitting corrosion in hot chloride electrolytes. Combinations of molybdenum and nitrogen are very beneficial. Alternate materials for line <b>shaft</b> <b>pump</b> bearings have been identified through tests in simulated hot brine. Cermets and carbides show promise of extending pump life. A series of drill bit steels has been examined for fatigue and hot fracture toughness. The work has indicated alloys with properties that exceed those of materials now in use. A major finding in the nonmetallic materials area has been the development of fluorinated elastomers for use in statis seals at temperatures greater than 300 C. Field testing has just commenced, but based upon laboratory results, the work is very promising. Commercialization of this material is underway. Technology transfer of a 240 C EPDM was completed earlier. Field testing of polymer concrete-lined pipe has been successful, and at least one commercial source of the material now exists. Programs started in FY 1983 include the development of high-thermal-conductivity composites for heat exchanger tubes and elastomers for dynamic seal applications. Cathodic protection measurements of carbon steel have been made, both in the laboratory and in the field, which showed the feasibility of such protection of some carbon steel components, e. g., the outer surface of well casing. More work is suggested to include heat exchanges. Studies of corrosion in binary systems is also reviewed...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 107 The use of long <b>shaft</b> {{vertical}} <b>pumps</b> {{is common}} practice in the nuclear waste processing industry. Unfortunately, when such pumps employ plain cylindrical journal bearings, they tend to suffer from rotordynamic instability problems due to the inherent lightly-loaded condition that the vertical orientation places on the bearings. This paper describes {{a case study in}} which the authors utilized rotordynamic analysis and experimental vibration analysis to diagnose such a problem and designed replacement tilting-pad bearings to solve the problem. The subject pumps are 45 foot long vertical pumps used for mixing nuclear waste in one million gallon tanks. Each pumping system consists of an induction motor driven by a variable frequency drive, a segmented <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> with a centrifugal impeller at the bottom, and a pipe column that surrounds the <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> and is suspended into the tank. The column is filled with water that serves as the lubricant for the eight plain cylindrical journal bearings that support the <b>pump</b> <b>shaft.</b> Unfortunately, these <b>pumps</b> have been plagued with vibration related problems, such as bearing and seal failures, ever since they were commissioned. In order to evaluate the problem, the <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> and column were instrumented with vibration transducers, and vibration testing was performed. This testing revealed that subsynchronous whirling, at approximately one-half the running speed, was the primary culprit responsible for the failures. In an effort to understand the cause of the observed vibrations, a two-level rotordynamic model of the <b>pump</b> <b>shafting</b> and column was constructed. This rotordynamic model, like those for many vertical pumps, was far from routine. The rotordynamic analysis, which is described in detail, then successfully confirmed that the problem was subsynchronous whirling due to rotordynamic instability. This analysis was then used to guide the design of tilting-pad bearings employing offset pivots and geometric preload to replace the original plain cylindrical bearings and, thereby, resolve the instability problem. The plain cylindrical bearings were removed from a pump, tilting-pad bearings were installed, and subsequent testing verified the predicted vibration reduction. Accordingly, the application of tilting-pad bearings, whose design is described in detail, was conclusively shown to be an effective solution for this specific problem...|$|R
