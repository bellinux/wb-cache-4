Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a <b>standard</b> <b>fixture</b> in the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Kantakouzenos {{responded by}} having himself {{declared}} emperor at Didymoteicho in October 1341, while his opponents followed with the coronation of John V in November. The two coronations finalized the split, and {{ushered in a}} civil war that would embroil the Byzantine Empire and all of its neighbours until 1347 with Kantakouzenos's victory. In its course, it would devastate the remaining imperial possessions, and create a deep rift in Byzantine society: the aristocracy and the propertied classes generally supported Kantakouzenos, while the lower and middle classes, primarily urban, as well as the merchants and sailors, supported Apokaukos and the regency. This gave the dynastic dispute and civil war strong social overtones: during the war, the excessive wealth and perceived indifference of Kantakouzenos and the aristocracy towards the common people became a <b>standard</b> <b>fixture</b> of Apokaukos's propaganda. In addition, the conflict acquired religious significance as well: the Hesychast controversy divided the pious Byzantines, and, despite some important exceptions, the supporters of Hesychasm also supported Kantakouzenos.|$|E

30|$|For the 3 D model, the {{boundaries}} {{were defined as}} 60 m in width from {{each side of the}} centerline of the structure and 60 m in depth from the underneath of foundation (see Figure  3). As in the 2 D idealization, <b>standard</b> <b>fixtures</b> were applied as boundaries to the outer surfaces of the continuum media, and {{the boundaries}} were specified after several analyses to minimize the effects of the boundaries on the results and geostatic pressures.|$|R
25|$|The {{single side}} door, {{which had been}} {{introduced}} to around 6½ per cent of Mark B production vehicles after November 1951, became a <b>standard</b> <b>fixture</b> on the Mark C. Because the car's monocoque construction depended principally upon its skin for rigidity, the size of door was severely limited and to overcome the resulting decrease in structural rigidity, vertical steel strengthening brackets were fitted either side and along the bottom edge of the door aperture.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{found only}} in large {{industrial}} applications, microwave ovens increasingly became a <b>standard</b> <b>fixture</b> of residential kitchens in developed countries. By 1986, roughly 25% of households in the U.S. owned a microwave oven, up from only about 1% in 1971; the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that over 90% of American households owned a microwave oven in 1997. In Australia, a 2008 market research study found that 95% of kitchens contained a microwave oven and that 83% of them were used daily. In Canada, fewer than 5% of households had a microwave oven in 1979, but more than 88% of households owned one by 1998. In France, 40% of households owned a microwave oven in 1994, but that number had increased to 65% by 2004.|$|E
25|$|Through {{most of the}} 20th century, the Melbourne Cricket Ground {{was one of the}} {{two major}} Test venues in Australia (along with the Sydney Cricket Ground), and it would host one or two Tests in each summer in which Tests were played; since 1982, the Melbourne Cricket Ground has hosted one Test match each summer. Until 1979, the ground almost always hosted its match or one of its matches over the New Year, with the first day's play falling somewhere between 29 December and 1 January; in most years since 1980 and every year since 1995, its test has begun on Boxing Day, and it is now a <b>standard</b> <b>fixture</b> in the Australian cricket {{calendar}} and is known as the Boxing Day Test. The venue also hosts one-day international matches each year, and Twenty20 international matches most years. No other venue in Melbourne has hosted a Test, and Docklands Stadium is the only other venue to have hosted a limited-overs international.|$|E

500|$|The {{format of}} the {{competition}} has been modified {{many times over the}} years. The game was initially contested between the champions of the Football League and the Southern Football League from its inception until 1912, after which both professional and amateurs players participated. Following a six-year suspension {{as a result of the}} First World War, the competition resumed in 1920 with a game between the champions of the Football League First and Second Divisions. The following year saw the match arrangement changed again to become a match between the Football League champion and the winner of the FA Cup, switching several more times between the amateur/professional and league champion/FA Cup winner matches during the 1920s. From 1930 onwards it settled to a <b>standard</b> <b>fixture</b> between the FA Cup winner and the Football League champion, except on three occasions. In 1950, the England World Cup squad played the England team who toured Canada that summer, while double-winning Tottenham Hotspur played an [...] "F.A. Selected XI" [...] in 1961 that was described by The Times as being an [...] "England team masquerading". A decade later in 1971, Arsenal won the double and opted against contesting the Shield in favour of playing in more profitable friendlies in Europe; Leicester City – the champions of the Second Division – took their place.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{documented}} that the long-term clinical outcome of the Brånemark system is very favourable. However, failures do occur before and after loading. This study examined the differences in marginal bone loss between <b>standard</b> and self-tapping <b>fixtures</b> and attempted to explain excessive marginal bone loss or loss of osseointegration during the first 3 years of loading. Marginal bone loss (scored on long cone radiographs) and fixture failure rate were compared for different <b>fixture</b> designs. For <b>standard</b> <b>fixtures,</b> in comparison with self-tapping fixtures, the failure rate was clearly higher before as well as after loading. However, for successful fixtures no difference in marginal bone loss was observed. For the conical fixtures an increased marginal bone loss around the smooth part was observed. The effect of fixture overload, marginal bone height and loss of osseointegration was examined in 69 patients with 1 and 15 patients with 2 fixed full prostheses, and in 9 patients with an overdenture in the upper jaw. Excessive marginal bone loss (more than 1 mm) {{after the first year}} of loading and/or fixture loss correlated well with the presence of overload {{due to a lack of}} anterior contact, the presence of parafunctional activity and osseointegrated full fixed prostheses in both jaws. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The man and {{his hotel}} became synonymous: {{the use of the}} Corones name as the hotel name {{represented}} a significant break in the English tradition of the naming of hotels within an accepted nomenclature, a marketing strategy which was to see both the {{man and his}} hotel achieve (a joint and severable) iconic status in the west. That this icon was also of Greek origin was even more singular: Greek migration to Queensland in this century was most visible in the small business sector; the Greek cafe and green grocer became <b>standard</b> <b>fixtures</b> in the state's cities and throughout rural Queensland. Harry Corones' move into the hotel industry and the scale in which it was undertaken (uncompromisingly proclaimed by his ambitious plans for the Hotel Corones) represented a significant leap. Moreover, in the (predominantly British) mythology of the (Queensland) west, the Greek hero was (and is) a rarity.|$|R

2500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Simon Reynolds, <b>standard</b> musical <b>fixtures</b> of gothic rock include [...] "scything guitar patterns, high-pitched basslines that often usurped the melodic role [...] beats that were either hypnotically [...] or [...] "tribal" [...] African polyrhythmic". Reynolds described the vocal style as consisting of [...] "deep, droning alloys of Jim Morrison and Leonard Cohen". Siouxsie and the Banshees tended to use flanging guitar effects, producing a brittle, cold and harsh sound that contrasted with their psychedelic rock predecessors. Several acts used drum machines downplaying the rhythm's backbeat.|$|R
