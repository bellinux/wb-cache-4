40|$|Although the {{knowledge}} of the manuscript tradition of the Medea by Euripides has been undeniably improved and there are new editions of this play, those of Diggle and van Looy, the text is still being corrected too much with unnecessary conjectures and <b>seclusions</b> which must be rejected. In some occasions Murray’s text (1902) is preferable. In this paper the author justifies the maintenance of the text of the manuscripts of Medea in several passages and he argues that the acceptance of some conjectures and some <b>seclusions</b> of verses are due to an inadequate knowledge of the poet’s intention or of the Greek syntax. Some neutral and rare uses as well as the lexical, syntactic and metrical hapax, which appear in the manuscripts, can be often defended...|$|R

In some of these cases, this type of abuse resulted in death. Given these reports, the Committee asked GAO to (1) provide an overview of <b>seclusions</b> and restraint laws applicable to children in public and private schools, (2) verify whether allegations of student death and abuse from the use of these methods are widespread, and (3) examine the facts and circumstances surrounding cases where a student died or suffered abuse as a result of being secluded or restrained. GAO reviewed federal and state laws and abuse allegations from advocacy groups, parents, and the media from the past two decades. GAO did not evaluate whether using restraints and <b>seclusions</b> can be beneficial. GAO examined documents related to closed cases, including police and autopsy reports and school policies. GAO also interviewed parents, attorneys, and school officials and conducted searches to determine the current employment status of staff involved in the cases. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} psychiatric inpatient bed closures, accompanied by a training program aimed at enhancing team effectiveness and incorporating datadriven practices, in a mental health service. Design and setting: Retrospective comparison {{of the changes in}} services within three consecutive financial years: baseline period — before bed reduction (2006 – 07); observation period — after bed reduction (2007 – 08); and intervention period — second year after bed reduction (2008 – 09). The study was conducted at Cramond Clinic, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide. Main outcome measures: Length of stay, 28 -day readmission rates, discharges, bed occupancy rates, emergency department (ED) presentations, ED waiting time, <b>seclusions,</b> locality of treatment, and follow-up in the community within 7 days. Results: Reduced bed numbers were associated with reduced length of stay, fewer referrals from the community and subsequently shorter waiting times in the ED, without significant change in readmission rates. A higher proportion of patients was treated in the local catchment area, with improved community follow-up and a significant reduction in inpatient <b>seclusions.</b> Conclusion: Our findings should reassure clinicians concerned about psychiatric bed numbers that service redesign with planned bed reductions will not necessarily affect clinical care, provided data literacy and team training programs are in place to ensure smooth transition of patients across ED, inpatient and community services.

40|$|Objective. The Early Recognition Method aims at {{improving}} collaboration between nurses and patients to prevent aggression in forensic psychiatric care. To achieve this goal, Early Recognition Method strongly focuses on {{early signs of}} aggression. In the current study, we investigated whether application of Early Recognition Method led to {{a significant decrease in}} inpatient incidents. Background. Nurses in forensic settings are often confronted with patients' aggression. Better collaboration between nursing staff and patients may improve patients' ability to self manage aggression and contribute to a decrease in inpatient aggression. Design. Naturalistic one-way case-crossover design. Methods. The Early Recognition Method was introduced on 16 wards of a maximum security forensic hospital. Using a one-way case-crossover design, where cases were their own controls, the effects of Early Recognition Method were assessed by comparing the number of incidents of 189 patients during 'Treatment As Usual' with the period after Early Recognition Method was implemented. The Early Recognition Method intervention involved weekly evaluations of signs of aggression between staff and patients. The outcome measures were the number of <b>seclusions</b> and the severity of inpatient incidents. Results. A significant {{decline in the number of}} <b>seclusions</b> was observed after Early Recognition Method was introduced. Apart from this decrease, the mean severity of inpatient incidents was also found to be lower during the post intervention period. The effect size was most pronounced for patients with substance abuse and personality disorders. Patients with schizophrenia, however, showed modest, yet significant, effect sizes. Conclusions. The results suggest that Early Recognition Method may be an innovative and effective risk management method for forensic psychiatric patients, in particular for patients with personality disorders. Relevance to clinical practice. This article aims to contribute to evidence-based risk management for nurses in collaboration with their patients, resulting in a decrease in inpatient aggression...|$|R

To ensure they do not awaken too soon or in a fetid atmosphere among ugly surroundings is not enough. They cannot awaken in a void.

As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E
40|$|Individuals with {{borderline}} {{personality disorder}} (BPD) fre-quently present to hospital emergency services with sui-cidal ideation or behaviour (1). Although threats of suicide outnumber actual suicide attempts, these patients are prob-lematic {{for mental health}} professionals because the risk of sui-cide is high, with rates approaching those found in other major psychiatric disorders. Davis and colleagues estimated that pa-tients with BPD have about a 10 % lifetime risk of suicide (2). Clinicians are often troubled when hospitalizing patients with BPD, not knowing whether this course of action will benefit or worsen the patient’s crisis. Clinical lore has long suggested that patients with BPD regress during hospitalization, and an inpatient stay {{may be associated with}} disruptive behaviour, including self-harm behaviours, aggression, and noncompli-ance with ward routine (3). Little empirical evidence is avail-able to guide the clinician in assessing whether hospitalization will improve or worsen these behaviours. Two recent studies provide some empirical evidence on this issue. Faulkner and colleagues compared hospitalized adoles-cents with and without BPD regarding the occurrence of restraints, <b>seclusions,</b> incidents of self-abuse and aggression...|$|R

40|$|An objectively defined {{three-dimensional}} cyclone phase {{space is}} proposed and explored. Cyclone phase is described using {{the parameters of}} storm-motion-relative thickness asymmetry (symmetric/nonfrontal versus asymmetric/frontal) and vertical derivative of horizontal height gradient (cold- versus warm-core structure via the thermal wind relationship). A cyclone’s life cycle can be analyzed within this phase space, providing substantial insight into the cyclone structural evolution. An objective classification of cyclone phase is possible, unifying the basic structural description of tropical, extratropical, and hybrid cyclones into a continuum. Stereotypical symmetric warm-core (tropical cyclone) and asymmetric cold-core (extratropical cyclone) life cycles are illustrated using 18 Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) operational analyses and 2. 58 NCEP–NCAR reanalyses. The transitions between cyclone phases are clearly illustrated within the phase space, including extratropical transition, subtropical and tropical transition, {{and the development of}} warm <b>seclusions</b> within extratropical cyclones. The planet’s northwestern hemisphere inhabitance of the proposed phase space between 1980 and 1999 is examined using NCEP–NCAR 2. 58 reanalyses.
