5|$|Pelicans {{give their}} {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies and frigatebirds, all {{traditional}} members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the <b>shoebill</b> have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes. Molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} <b>shoebill</b> and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans, though there is some doubt as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{consistently}} shown that pelicans, the namesake {{family of the}} Pelecaniformes, are actually {{more closely related to}} herons, ibises and spoonbills, the hamerkop and the <b>shoebill</b> than to the remaining species. In recognition of this, the order comprising the frigatebirds and Suloidea was renamed Suliformes in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Long {{thought to}} be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, gannets and boobies, {{pelicans}} instead are now known to be most closely related to the <b>shoebill</b> and hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes. Ibises, spoonbills, herons and the desolate bitterns have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back to at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages.|$|E

25|$|Many {{familiar}} {{animals are}} quadrupedal, walking or running on four legs. A few birds use quadrupedal movement in some circumstances. For example, the <b>shoebill</b> sometimes uses its wings to right itself after lunging at prey. The newly hatched hoatzin bird has claws on its thumb and first finger enabling it to dexterously climb tree branches until its wings {{are strong enough}} for sustained flight. These claws are {{gone by the time}} the bird reaches adulthood.|$|E
25|$|The park's Nairobi Village houses {{numerous}} exhibits {{for smaller}} animals. Among these are meerkats, an African aviary, lemurs, flamingos, red river hogs, and bee eaters. A large lagoon {{is home to}} numerous species of waterfowl such as <b>shoebill</b> storks. Lorikeet Landing and Hidden Jungle display feedable Lories and lorikeets, and African birds, respectively. There is a nursery where visitors can watch baby animals being hand-reared {{as well as a}} nearby petting corral. Finally, a gorilla habitat houses a troop of western lowland gorillas. A flying fox bat exhibit also located there.|$|E
25|$|A boat-trip {{along the}} Luwomwba River, {{or any other}} major river in the park may reveal Pel’s fishing owl, African finfoot, half-collared kingfisher, Ross’ turaco and Böhm’s bee-eater. The vast {{wetlands}} of Kasanka support some species not easily seen elsewhere such as rufous-bellied heron, lesser jacana and African pygmy goose. The <b>shoebill</b> was confirmed {{for the first time}} in 20 years at the end of 2010 and a breeding pair of wattled cranes and their offspring are often encountered. Marsh tchagra, coppery-tailed coucal, Fulleborn's longclaw, locustfinch, pale-crowned, croaking and short-winged cisticola, chestnut-headed and streaky-breasted flufftail, harlequin and blue quail, black-rumped buttonquail and fawn-breasted waxbill are amongst the other specials on the wetland fringes and in the large dambo’s.|$|E
50|$|Wilhelma's {{collection}} of cranes {{began with a}} bird exhibition in 1950: Redcrowned, Blue, and White-naped cranes and also a Hawaiian goose joined Wilhelma. Birds that {{used to have a}} presence at the zoo include other types of cranes, <b>shoebills,</b> geese, and curiously a Brush kangaroo.|$|R
50|$|The solitary {{nature of}} <b>shoebills</b> extends to their {{breeding}} habits. Nests typically occur {{at less than}} three nests per square kilometre, unlike herons, cormorants, pelicans and storks which predominantly nest in colonies. The breeding pair of <b>shoebills</b> vigorously defends a territory of 2 to 4 km2 from conspecifics. In the extreme {{north and south of}} the species' range, nesting starts right after the rains end. In more central regions of the range, it may nest near end of wet season in order to hatch around the beginning of the following wet season. Both parents engage in building the nest on floating platform, after clearing out an area of approximately 3 m across. The large, flattish nesting platform is often partially submerged in water and can be as much as 3 m deep. The nest itself is about 1 to 1.7 m wide. Both the nest and platform are made of aquatic vegetation. In Sudan, the nests apparently were able to support the weight of an adult man, although {{this was not the case}} in Zambia. From one to three white eggs are laid. These eggs measure 80 to 90 mm high by 56 to 61 mm and weigh around 164 g. Incubation lasts for approximately 30 days. Both parents actively brood, shade, guard and feed the nestling, though the females are perhaps slightly more attentive. Food items are regurgitated whole from the gullet straight into the bill of the young. <b>Shoebills</b> rarely raise more than one chick, but will hatch more. The younger chicks are intended as back-ups in case the eldest dies or is weak. Fledging is reached at around 105 days and the young birds can fly well by 112 days. However, they are still fed for possibly a month or more after this. It will take the young <b>shoebills</b> three years before they become fully sexually mature.|$|R
50|$|The plumage {{of adult}} birds is blue-grey with darker slaty-grey flight feathers. The breast {{presents}} some elongated feathers, which have dark shafts. The juvenile {{has a similar}} plumage colour, but is a darker grey with a brown tinge. When they are first born, <b>shoebills</b> have a more modestly-sized bill, which is initially silvery-grey. The bill becomes more noticeably large when the chicks are 23 days old and becomes well developed by 43 days.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} fossil of ostrich-like {{birds are}} Paleocene taxa from Europe. Palaeotis and Remiornis are birds from the Middle Eocene also cited as potential early ostriches. However, their exact status as such is controversial, {{and they have}} alternatively been considered more basal (or more derived) ratites. Other unspecified ratite remains are known from the Eocene and Oligocene of Europe and Africa; their status as early ostriches too is questionable, and may in fact represent multiple lineages of flightless paleognaths. The African Eremopezus, when not considered a basal secretarybird or <b>shoebill,</b> is sometimes considered an ostrich relative or an [...] "aepyornithid-like" [...] taxon.|$|E
2500|$|While giant Galloanserae {{were common}} and diverse in the Paleogene in particular, these (diatrymas and mihirungs) were flightless {{terrestrial}} birds; {{it is perhaps}} significant though that the only other [...] "bone-toothed" [...] birds known so far are the two species of the moa-nalo genus Thambetochen, extinct giant flightless dabbling ducks from the Hawaiian Islands. In any case, the 2005 cladistic analysis uses {{a representative sample of}} Procellariiformes and recovers them as strongly supported clade in agreement with the current consensus. The presumed close relationship between bony-toothed birds and tubenoses can thus be disregarded after all. As regards [...] "Pelecaniformes", the analysis does not recover the correct phylogeny and does not include the <b>shoebill</b> (Balaeniceps rex, a [...] "missing link" [...] between pelicans and storks) either; clearly, the adaptive radiation of the pelican-stork lineage is misleading the analysis here. In addition, the Galloanserae are not recovered as monophyletic. In 2007, a far more comprehensive cladistic analysis of bird anatomy including some fossil forms (though not the crucial Late Cretaceous taxa, which are usually known only from fragmentary remains) resolved the [...] "higher waterbird" [...] radiation somewhat better; still, the problem of leg and foot traits confounding the analysis was noticeable.|$|E
50|$|Morphological {{study has}} {{suggested}} pelicans are sister to a gannet-cormorant clade, yet genetic analysis groups {{them with the}} hamerkop and <b>shoebill,</b> though the exact relationship between the three is unclear. Mounting evidence pointed to the <b>shoebill</b> as a close relative of pelicans. This also included microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995, who found that the shells of pelecaniform eggs (including those of the <b>shoebill</b> but not the tropicbirds) were covered in a thick microglobular material. Reviewing genetic evidence to date, Cracraft and colleagues surmised that pelicans were sister to the <b>shoebill</b> with the hamerkop as the next earlier offshoot. Ericson and colleagues sampled five nuclear genes in a 2006 study spanning the breadth of bird lineages, {{and came up with}} pelicans, <b>shoebill</b> and hamerkop in a clade. Hackett and colleagues sampled 32 kilobases of nuclear DNA and recovered <b>shoebill</b> and hamerkop as sister taxa, pelicans sister to them, and herons and ibises as sister groups to each other with this heron and ibis group a sister to the pelican/shoebill/hamerkop clade.|$|E
50|$|At close range, it can {{be easily}} {{identified}} by its unique features. In flight, if its unique bill cannot be seen, the <b>shoebill's</b> silhouette resembles that of a stork or condor, but its feathers are a distinctive medium blue-grey. Also unusual, its tail is the same colour as its wings. Under poor viewing conditions, its size and wingspan can distinguish it from other birds in its habitat. Its legs, roughly the length of storks', extend straight back far past its tail when in flight. The wing to tail size cannot be used for identification; it is {{similar to those of}} several other birds.|$|R
50|$|The plant {{complex for}} African {{ungulates}} {{which includes the}} giraffe house, was opened 1980th Today there live zebras, giraffes, kudus, okapi, Dorcas gazelle, Marabou stork and Somali wild ass. Wilhelma has been very successful in the breeding of giraffes, Somali wild asses, bongos, okapi, bontebok and zebras. Since 1989, a total of 12 okapi have arrived at Wilhelma. In the giraffe house there are not only the indoor enclosure of giraffe and okapi, but also the home of Congo peacocks, Fennec foxes, short-eared elephant shrews and weaver birds. Former residents include Grant's zebras, <b>shoebills,</b> porcupines, klipspringers, waterbucks, warthogs and numerous antelopes.|$|R

50|$|The Sudd {{provides}} {{food and}} water to large populations of migrating birds; over 400 species of bird are found here, including <b>shoebills,</b> great white pelicans, and black crowned cranes. As the surrounding landscape is a large swath of dry Sahel across Africa, the swamp is also a haven for migrating animals, especially antelopes, such as the endangered Nile lechwe, tiang, reedbuck, and the world's largest population of white-eared kob, estimated at around 1.2 million—an animal population comparable to Tanzania's better-known Serengeti National Park. The shallow water is frequented by crocodiles and hippopotamuses. In more upland areas the Sudd was known as an historic habitat for the endangered painted hunting dog, Lycaon pictus, which however may have been exterminated in the region.|$|R
50|$|The final {{programme}} looks at how water influences {{life on the}} continent. Rain falling on the mountains of equatorial Africa eventually flows into Nile, Congo, Niger and other great rivers. The Luangwa, {{a tributary of the}} Zambezi, draws animals from the surrounding arid lands. Predators and prey drink alongside one another in an uneasy truce. The waters hold dangers too; a Nile crocodile attacks a buffalo. When river levels fall, hippos are forced together and sometime fatal territorial fights ensue. Crocodiles are filmed tearing flesh from a hippo carcass. Carmine bee-eaters excavate nest chambers in exposed river banks, but African fish eagles and monitor lizards prey on the birds and their eggs. The lakes of East Africa hold most of the continent’s fresh water. Over 600 species of cichlid have evolved in Lake Malawi, each occupying their own niche. The fish and migrating birds feast on a seasonal bonanza provided by clouds of black flies hatching on the water’s surface. Africa has great wetlands too. Zambia’s Banguela Swamp is a rich fishing ground for <b>shoebills,</b> spoonbills and egrets. The Okavango River flows towards the Kalahari Desert, creating the greatest inland delta in the world. It is paradise for hippos, but savannah animals have had to adapt. Lions have learned to swim across the water channels to keep up with their prey. The final scenes show the vast flocks of flamingos at the soda lakes of East Africa. Every few years, they engage in synchronised courtship dances.|$|R
5000|$|Predators of Nile {{crocodiles}} eggs {{have ranged}} from insects such as {{the red flour beetle}} (Tribolium castaneum) to predators as large and formidable as spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Unsurprisingly, once exposed to the elements as hatchlings, the young, small Nile crocodiles are even more vulnerable. Most of the predators of eggs also opportunistically eat young crocodiles, including monitors and marabous, plus almost all co-existing raptorial birds, including vultures, eagles, and large owls and buzzards. Many [...] "large waders" [...] are virulent predators of crocodile hatchlings, from dainty little egrets (Egretta garzetta) and compact hamerkops (Scopus umbretta) to towering saddle-billed storks (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), goliath herons and <b>shoebills</b> (Balaeniceps rex). Larger corvids and some non-wading water birds (i.e. pelicans) can also take some young Nile crocodiles. Mammalian carnivores take many hatchlings as well as large turtles and snakes, large predatory freshwater fish, such as the African tigerfish, the introduced largemouth bass, and possibly bull sharks, when they enter river systems. When crocodile nests are dug out and the young placed in water by the mother, in areas such as Royal Natal National Park predators can essentially enter a feeding frenzy. It may take a few years before predation is no longer a major cause of mortality for young crocodiles. African fish eagles can take crocodile hatchlings up to a few months of age and honey badgers can prey on yearlings. Once they reach their juvenile stage, very large African rock pythons and big cats remain as the only predatory threat to young crocodiles. Perhaps no predator is more deadly to young Nile crocodiles than larger crocodiles of their own species, as, like most crocodilians, they are cannibalistic. This species may be particularly dangerous to their own kind considering the aggressive disposition they tend to bear. While the mother crocodile will react aggressively towards potential predators and has been recorded chasing and occasionally catching and killing such interlopers into her range, due to the sheer number of animals who feed on baby crocodiles and the large number of hatchlings, she is more often than not unsuccessful at deflecting such predators.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>shoebill</b> {{is noted}} for its slow {{movements}} and tendency to remain still for long periods, resulting in repeated descriptions of the species as [...] "statue-like". They are quite sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon their nests if flushed by humans. However, while foraging, if dense vegetation stands between it and humans, this wader can be fairly tame. The <b>shoebill</b> is attracted to poorly oxygenated waters where fish frequently surface to breathe. Exceptionally for a bird this large, the <b>shoebill</b> often stands and perches on floating vegetation, making them appear somewhat like a giant jacana, although the similarly-sized and occasionally sympatric Goliath heron (Ardea goliath) is also known to stand on aquatic vegetation. Shoebills typically feed in muddy waters and, being solitary birds, forage at a minimum distance of 20 m from one another even where relatively densely populated. This species stalks its prey patiently, in a slow and lurking fashion. While hunting, the <b>shoebill</b> strides very slowly and is frequently motionless. Unlike some other large waders, this species hunts entirely using vision and is not known to engage in tactile hunting. When prey is spotted, it launches a quick, violent strike. However, {{depending on the size}} of the prey, handling time after the strike can exceed 10 minutes. Around 60% of strikes are successful in yielding prey. Frequently water and vegetation is snatched up during the strike and is spilled out from the edges of the mandibles. The activity of hippopotamus may inadvertently benefit the <b>shoebill,</b> as the hippos occasionally force fish to the surface of the water while they are submerged.|$|E
