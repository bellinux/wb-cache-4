5000|$|However, {{in various}} jurisdictions and circumstances, {{nominally}} [...] "senior" [...] debt may not {{rank pari passu}} with all other senior obligations. For example, in the 2008 Washington Mutual Bank seizure, all assets and most (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank's liabilities were assumed by JPMorgan Chase. However other <b>debt</b> claims, <b>including</b> unsecured <b>senior</b> <b>debt,</b> were not. By doing this, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) effectively subordinated the unsecured <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> to depositors, thereby fully protecting depositors while also eliminating any potential deposit insurance liability to the FDIC itself. In this and similar cases, specific regulatory and oversight powers can lead to senior lenders being subordinated in potentially unexpected ways.|$|R
5000|$|In finance, <b>senior</b> <b>debt,</b> {{frequently}} {{issued in}} the form of senior notes or referred to as <b>senior</b> loans, is <b>debt</b> that takes priority over other unsecured or otherwise more [...] "junior" [...] debt owed by the issuer. <b>Senior</b> <b>debt</b> has greater seniority in the issuer's capital structure than subordinated debt. In the event the issuer goes bankrupt, <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> theoretically must be repaid before other creditors receive any payment.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{financial}} crisis of 2007-2010, large PFI projects were funded through the sale of bonds and/or <b>senior</b> <b>debt.</b> Since the crisis, funding by <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> has become more common. Smaller PFI projects — the majority by number — have typically always been funded directly by banks {{in the form of}} <b>senior</b> <b>debt.</b> <b>Senior</b> <b>debt</b> is generally slightly more expensive than bonds, which the banks would argue is due to their more accurate understanding of the credit-worthiness of PFI deals — they may consider that monoline providers underestimate the risk, especially during the construction stage, and hence can offer a better price than the banks are willing to.|$|R

5000|$|In {{relation}} to credit standing, the ranking {{of a security}} refers to where that particular security would stand in a wind up of the issuing company, i.e., its seniority in the company's capital structure. For instance, capital notes are subordinated securities; they would rank behind <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> in a wind up. In other words, the holders of <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> would be paid out before subordinated debt holders received any funds.|$|R
40|$|A liquidity-constrained {{entrepreneur}} {{needs to}} raise capital {{to finance a}} business activity that may cause injuries to third parties - the tort victims. Taking the level of borrowing as fixed, the entrepreneur finances the activity with <b>senior</b> (secured) <b>debt</b> in order to shield assets from the tort victims in bankruptcy. Interestingly, <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> serves the interests of society more broadly: it creates better incentives for the entrepreneur to take precautions than either junior debt or outside equity. Unfortunately, the entrepreneur will raise a socially excessive amount of <b>senior</b> <b>debt,</b> reducing his incentives for care and generating wasteful spending. Giving tort victims priority over senior debtholders in bankruptcy prevents over-leveraging but leads to suboptimal incentives. Lender liability exacerbates the incentive problem even further. A Limited Seniority Rule, where the firm may issue <b>senior</b> <b>debt</b> up to an exogenous limit after which any further borrowing is treated as junior to the tort claim, dominates these alternatives. Shareholder liability, mandatory liability insurance and punitive damages are also discussed...|$|R
