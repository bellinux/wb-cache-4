5000|$|The {{brown marmorated stink bug}} is an {{agricultural}} pest {{that can cause}} widespread damage to fruit and vegetable crops. In Japan it is a pest to soybean and fruit crops. In the U.S., the brown marmorated stink bug feeds, beginning in late May or early June, {{on a wide range of}} fruits, vegetables, and other host plants including peaches, apples, green beans, soybeans, cherries, raspberries, and pears. It is a <b>sucking</b> <b>insect,</b> a [...] "true bug", that uses its proboscis to pierce the host plant in order to feed. This feeding results, in part, in the formation of dimpled or necrotic areas on the outer surface of fruits, leaf stippling, seed loss, and possible transmission of plant pathogens.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} ants on the insect {{community}} on inflorescences of Byrsonima crassifolia (Malpighiaceae) {{were tested in}} an ant exclusion experiment in a cerrado vegetation in southeastern Brazil. Forty-four species of insects (23 families) and nine species of ants (6 genera and 3 subfamilies) {{were found on the}} inflorescences of B. crassifolia. The exclusion of ants, primarily Camponotus sericeiventris and Camponotus spp., reduced the treehopper population to 20 % of the original abundance. Ant exclusion and time influenced the abundance of chewing (Exclusion, P< 0. 001; Time, P< 0. 002), and <b>sucking</b> <b>insects</b> (Exclusion, P< 0. 02; Time, P< 0. 01). Twice as many chewing and <b>sucking</b> <b>insects</b> were found on ant-excluded inflorescences as compared to control inflorescences (P< 0. 001). One and half more <b>sucking</b> <b>insects</b> were found on ant-excluded than on control inflorescences. Only time significantly influenced the richness of chewing and <b>sucking</b> <b>insects</b> associated with B. crassifolia inflorescences. Inflorescences on control branches were significantly less attacked by herbivores than inflorescences on ant-excluded branches (P< 0. 001). Therefore, these results suggest that the presence of ants alters the structure of insect herbivore community associated with B. crassifolia...|$|R

40|$|Being {{members of}} complex communities, plants often emit {{a wide range}} of {{volatile}} organic compounds to defend themselves against insect invasions. Although many studies exist on insect-induced plant volatile emission, most of them either compare the influences of various herbivore species on one plant species or the impact of a given herbivore on several host plant species. Moreover, informations related to the influence of insect density as well as the infestation duration are still needed. Here, we showed that a <b>sucking</b> <b>insect</b> – Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) induced the volatile emission from Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia wild-type (A. thaliana Col- 0) under laboratory conditions based on results obtained by solid-phase micro-extraction coupled with gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS). The released volatile blend was discussed in relation to related biosynthesis pathways and functions. These included terpenoids, green leaf volatiles, alcohols and isothiocyanate. The qualitative and overall proportion of volatile components differed depended on the number and residence duration of aphids on leaves. By studying the effects of <b>sucking</b> <b>insect</b> stresses to plant, we not only aim to contribute to the fundamental understanding of the emission of volatile components in the interaction between plants and pests, but also to provide standardised and easy to use assays to assess A. thaliana volatile changes according to cross stresses, including both biotic and abiotic ones in ongoing experiments...|$|E

40|$|The sap <b>sucking</b> <b>insects</b> (Hemiptera), {{which include}} aphids, whiteflies, plant bugs and stink bugs, {{have emerged as}} major {{agricultural}} pests. The Hemiptera cause direct damage by feeding on crops, {{and in some cases}} indirect damage by transmission of plant viruses. Current management relies almost exclusively on application of classical chemical insecticides. While the development of transgenic crops expressing toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has provided effective plant protection against some insect pests, Bt toxins exhibit little toxicity against sap <b>sucking</b> <b>insects.</b> Indeed, the pest status of some Hemiptera on Bt-transgenic plants has increased in the absence of pesticide application. The increased pest status of numerous hemipteran species, combined with increased prevalence of resistance to chemical insecticides, provides impetus for the development of biologically based, alternative management strategies. Here, we provide an overview of approaches toward transgenic resistance to hemipteran pests...|$|R

This study aims to evaluate the effects of cyantraniliprole on the probing behavior of B. tabaci on tomato. Electrical penetration graph data indicated that on plants treated with cyantraniliprole (foliar application), adult whiteflies of the genetic variant Q 2 were not able to reach the phloem and consequently did not perform the activities represented by E 1 and E 2 waveforms, i. e., phloem salivation (during which inoculation of geminiviruses occurs) and phloem sap ingestion (during which geminiviruses are acquired by the whiteflies), respectively. The complete failure of B. tabaci biotype Q adults to feed from the phloem of tomato plants treated with cyantraniliprole could be explained by rapid cessation of ingestion because of the mode of action of this insecticide. Overall, these findings indicated that cyantraniliprole might represent a useful new tool for producers to protect tomato plants from damage by B. tabaci...|$|E
40|$|The {{vasculature}} {{of plants}} {{act as a}} channel for transport of signal(s) that facilitate long-distance intraplant communication. In maize, Maize insect resistance 1 -Cysteine Protease (Mir 1 -CP), which has homology to papain-like proteases, provides defense to different feeding guilds of insect pests. Furthermore, accumulation of Mir 1 -CP in the vasculature suggests that Mir 1 -CP can potentially function as a phloemmobile protein. In a recent study, we provided evidence that Mir 1 -CP can curtail the growth of phloemsap <b>sucking</b> <b>insect,</b> corn leaf aphid (CLA; Rhopalosiphum maidis). Our current study further examined whether aboveground feeding by CLA can induce resistance to subsequent herbivory by belowground feeding western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). Aboveground feeding by CLA systemically induced the accumulation of Mir 1 -CP in the roots. Furthermore, foliage feeding by CLA provided enhanced resistance to subsequent herbivory by below ground feeding of WCR.
