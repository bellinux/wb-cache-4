40|$|The larvae of the Japanese horned beetle, Trypoxylus dichotomus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae), are {{an example}} of a <b>saprophage</b> insect. Generally, Scarabaeid larvae, such as T. dichotomus, eat dead plant matter that has been broken down by fungi, such as Basidiomycota. It is thought that β- 1, 3 -glucan, a {{constituent}} polysaccharide in microbes, is abundant in decayed plant matter. Studies of the degradation mechanism of β- 1, 3 -glucan under these circumstances are lacking. In the current study, we sought to clarify the relationship between the capacity to degrade polysaccharides and the food habits of the larvae. The total activities and optimum pH levels of several polysaccharide-degrading enzymes from the larvae were investigated. The foregut, midgut and hindgut of final instar larvae were used. Enzymatic activities were detected against five polysaccharides (soluble starch, β- 1, 4 -xylan, β- 1, 3 -glucan, pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose) and four glycosides (p-nitrophenyl (PNP) -β-N-acetylglucosaminide, PNP-β-mannoside, PNP-β-glucoside and PNP-β-xyloside). Our results indicate that the digestive tract of the larvae is equipped with a full enzymatic system for degrading β- 1, 3 -glucan and β- 1, 4 -xylan to monomers. This finding elucidates the role of the polysaccharide-digesting enzymes in the larvae, and it is suggested that the larvae use these enzymes to enact their decomposition ability in the forest environment...|$|E

40|$|Fertilization {{and/or the}} {{accumulation}} of organic matter from plant residues can influence the composition of soil and litter community. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of P and K fertilization on total faunal and nematode faunal composition and richness in plant litter and soil for 360 days in an area reforested with Acacia auriculiformis (A. Cunn), located in the municipality of Conceição de Macabu in the State of Rio de Janeiro. For each treatment (fertilized and unfertilized plots), samples of litter and soil (to a depth of 5 cm) were collected and transferred into a Berlese-Tüllgren funnels for the extraction of fauna. Mesofauna and macrofauna were quantified, and the major taxa identified. Nematodes were extracted by centrifugal flotation in sucrose solution and identified according to feeding habits. Density (number of individuals m- 2) of total fauna, microphages, social insects and saprophages varied significantly per treatment and sampling time in both litter and soil. The total number of individuals collected was 5, 127, and the total number of nematodes 894. Phosphorus and potassium fertilization resulted in an increase in total fauna density and richness in the litter due to an increased abundance of social insects, saprophages and herbivores. In the soil, fertilization increased the <b>saprophage</b> and predator densities. Saprophages were the predominant taxa in the litter, while social insects (Formicidae) prevailed in the soil. Litter nematode populations were favored by mineral fertilization. Bacteriophages were the predominant nematode group in both litter and soil...|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} robin, Erithacus rubecula Linnaeus, 1758 as a consort of {{autotrophic}} consortia is considered. It {{has been}} found that representatives of 9 higher taxa of animals (Mammalia, Aves, Gastropoda, Insecta, Arachnida, Acarina, Malacostraca, Diplopoda, Clitellata) have trophic and topical links with the robin. At the same time, the robin is a consort of determinants of autotrophic consortia, which core is represented mostly by dominating species of deciduous trees (Quercus robur Linnaeus, 1753 (24. 6 %), Tilia cordata Miller, 1768 (17. 5 %), Acer platanoides Linnaeus, 1753 (22. 8 %), Acer campestre Linnaeus, 1753), and also by sedges (Carex sp.) and grasses (Poaceae). The robin also belongs to the concentre of the second and higher orders as a component of forest biogeocenoses and forms a complex trophic system. In the diet of its nestlings, there have been found 717 objects from 32 invertebrate taxa, belonging to the phylums Arthropoda (99. 2 %, 31 species) and Annelida (0. 8 %, 1 species). The phylum Arthropoda was represented by the most numerous class Insecta (76. 9 %), in which 10 orders (Lepidoptera (46. 8 %) dominates) and 20 families were recorded, and also by the classes Arachnida (15. 0 %), Malacostraca (5. 3 %) and Diplopoda (1. 9 %). The invertebrate species composition was dominated by representatives of a trophic group of zoophages (14 species; 43. 8 %); the portion of phytophages (7 species; 21. 9 %), saprophages (18. 7 %), and necrophages (15. 6 %) was the less. The highest number of food items was represented by phytophages (N = 717; 51 %), followed by zoophages (34 %), saprophages (12 %), and necrophages (3 %). The difference among study areas according to the number of food items and the number of species in the robin nestling diet is shown. In NNP “HF”, the highest number of food items was represented by phytophages - 47 % (N = 443), whereas zoophages were the most species-rich group (43. 3 %, 13 species). In NNP “H”, phytophages also prevailed in food items - 62. 3 % (N = 164), but the number of phyto-, zoo- and <b>saprophage</b> species was equal (30. 8 %, 13 species).

40|$|The {{count of}} litter {{macrofauna}} {{was carried out}} in 339 natural deciduous forest sites in Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya, Nikolaev andDonetskregions ofUkrainein 2001 – 2014. It was shown that tree crown density did not significantly influence the abundance of litter macrofauna and the abundance of litter invertebrates. The Shannon and Pielou diversity indexes have a tendency to raise the gradient of tree crown density (from 50 % to 90 – 100 %). The relative abundance of saprophages and zoophages reached its minimum (median was 18 % and 3 %, respectively) in forest sites with sparse crown cover, and, at the level of tendency, was higher in dense forests with a closed crown (median was 40 % and 18 %, respectively). The relative abundance of polyphages, on the contrary, was lower in these conditions (82 % in sparse and 27 % in closed crown cover). The number of species in each trophic group did not significantly change in relation to tree crown density. At sites with 70 – 79 % tree crown density the size structure of the litter macrofauna was close to its optimal condition. The relative abundance of ants reached its maximum (median 73 %) in sparsely timbered sites (up to 50 % tree crown density), the relative share of Isopoda reached its maximum (median 40 %) at sites with average crown density (50 – 59 %). At densely wooded sites the taxonomic structure at the level of order and family was more or less level, without clearly dominant groups, each order and family occupying about 15 % {{of the total number of}} macrofauna. The relative abundance of the majority of orders and families did not significantly vary in response to different levels of tree crown density. The influence of herbaceous layer cover on macrofauna was in general less than that of tree crown density. The abundance of litter macrofauna in deciduous forests reached its maximum at sites with the two extreme variants of herbaceous layer cover: sparse herbaceous cover (up to 15 %) and dense herbaceous cover (over 90 %). The minimal abundance of litter macrofauna was observed at sites with average herbaceous layer density (45 – 59 %). The number of species and the Shannon and Pielou diversity indexes did not vary significantly in relation to changes in herbaceous layer density in deciduous forests of the steppe zone of Ukraine. The number of phtyophage species was higher at sites with average values for herbaceous layer density, while the number of <b>saprophage,</b> zoophage and polyphage species did not significantly change. The dominance structure of litter macrofauna was maximally transformed at sites with the extreme variants of herbaceous layer cover: sparse herbaceous cover (up to 15 %) and dense herbaceous cover (over 90 %). The median number of ground beetle species reached its maximum at sites with 15 – 29 % herbaceous layer cover. The median of the relative abundance of ground beetles did not significantly change relative to the extent of herbaceous layer cover. The median of the relative abundance of Formicidae reached its maximum at sites with 60 – 74 % herbaceous layer cover and for Isopoda this maximum was reached at sites with 15 – 59 % herbaceous layer cover...|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{highlights}} some knowledge on {{the diversity and}} structure of insect communities and trophic groups living in Sabkha Djendli (semi-arid area of Northeastern Algeria). The entomofauna was monthly sampled from March to November 2006 using pitfall traps at eight sites located at {{the vicinity of the}} Sabkha. Structural and diversity parameters (species richness, Shannon index, evenness) were measured for both insect orders and trophic guilds. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was applied to determine how vegetation parameters (species richness and cover) influence spatial and seasonal fluctuations of insect assemblages. The catches totalled 434 insect individuals classified into 75 species, 62 genera, 31 families and 7 orders, of which Coleoptera and Hymenoptera were the most abundant and constant over seasons and study stations. Spring and autumn presented the highest values of diversity parameters. Individual-based Chao- 1 species richness estimator indicated 126 species for the total individuals captured in the Sabkha. Based on catch abundances, the structure of functional trophic groups was predators (37. 3 %), <b>saprophages</b> (26. 7 %), phytophages (20. 5 %), polyphages (10. 8 %), coprophages (4. 6 %); whereas in terms of numbers of species, they can be classified as phytophages (40 %), predators (25. 3 %), polyphages (13. 3 %), <b>saprophages</b> (12 %), coprophages (9. 3 %). The CCA demonstrated that phytophages and <b>saprophages</b> as well as Coleoptera and Orthoptera were positively correlated with the two parameters of vegetation, especially in spring and summer. While the abundance of coprophages was positively correlated with species richness of plants, polyphage density was positively associated with vegetation cover.

40|$|The {{role of the}} robin as a {{determinant}} of heterotrophic consortia is considered. The robin is a consort of determinants of autotrophic consortia, which core is represented mostly by dominating species of deciduous trees (Quercus robur Linnaeus, 1753, Tilia cordata Miller, 1768, Acer platanoides Linnaeus, 1753, Acer campestre Linnaeus, 1753), and also by sedges (Carex sp.) and grasses (Poaceae), connected with the determinants by fabric links. The robin also belongs to the concentr of the second and higher orders {{as a component of}} forest biogeocenoses and it is also the main determinant in species composition of the insects inhabiting bird nests. As a result of the taxonomic analysis of invertebrates in the robin nests, it has been found out that the most numerous class was Insecta (9 orders and 27 families), with the dominance of Coleoptera (30. 7 %). The nidicolous fauna of the robin (38 species) was dominated by zoophages along with parasites and hematophages such as Hippoboscidae (46. 4 %). The percentage of phytophages and <b>saprophages</b> among the invertebrate nest inhabitants was somewhat less (21 % each), then followed necrophages (12 %). Zoophages and parasites also dominated according to the number of objects in the nests (42 %; n = 150), the less was the portion of phytophages (34 %), <b>saprophages</b> (18 %), and necrophages (6 %).

40|$|Abstract Tropical {{rainforest}} canopies are {{renowned for}} their high invertebrate diversity and abundance. The canopy comprises {{a range of}} microhabitats representing very different food resources (including photosynthetic, reproductive, and structural tissues). As these resources vary considerably in temporal and spatial availability, nutritional quality, chemical protection and other attributes, we hypothesized that microhabitats support structurally different invertebrate communities. To test this we used the Australian Canopy Crane to sample invertebrates from mature leaves, flush leaves, flowers, fruit and suspended dead wood from 23 plant species. Invertebrate faunas on different microhabitats varied in taxonomic composition and feeding guild structure {{in support of the}} microhabitat differentiation hypothesis. Herbivores were found predominantly on new leaves (Hemiptera, Lepidoptera) and especially flowers (Coleoptera,Thysanoptera), but were relatively uncommon on mature leaves. Instead, the mature foliage community was dominated by predators, especially spiders and ants, and supported high abundances of <b>saprophages.</b> Ripe fruit and dead wood were scarce canopy resources that were utilized by {{a relatively small number of}} invertebrates, mostly <b>saprophages</b> and fungivores. Flowers supported a more heterogeneous fauna than the leaves in terms of proportional abundances of taxonomic groups and feeding guilds, both within tree species (evenness) and between tree species (non-uniformity). These results demonstrate microhabitat ifferentiation in a rainforest canopy and are the first to quantify differences in taxonomic composition, guild structure and abundance patterns between such diverse invertebrate assemblages within host trees. We conclude that studies based only on sampling one microhabitat, and leaves in particular, may provide a distorted picture of invertebrate community structure. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the structure of}} the litter invertebrate community in 141 pine (Pinus sylvestris Linnaeus, 1753) forest sites with five variants of canopy density (30 - 44, 45 - 59, 60 - 74, 75 - 89 and 90 - 100 %) in the steppe zone of Ukraine. The total number of litter macrofauna specimens collected at each site decreased from an average of 84 / 100 trap-days in the sparsest stands (30 - 40 % density) to 4 - 39 specimens/ 100 trap-days in the forests with a denser canopy. The number of macrofauna species caught in the pitfall traps does not vary significantly with different degrees of canopy density. The Shannon-Weaver and Pielou diversity indexes show increases corresponding to increasing stages of canopy density. The average share of phytophages in the trophic structure of the litter macrofauna does not vary with canopy density. The relative number of <b>saprophages</b> decreases from 54 % in the forests with the sparsest canopy to 11 - 13 % in the forests with denser canopies. The relative number of <b>saprophages</b> in pine forests (22 %) is lower than that in deciduous forests (40 %). The share of zoophages in the trophic structure of the litter macrofauna increases significantly with the increase in the pine forest canopy density (from 21 % in the sparsest plots to 59 % in the densest). The relative number of polyphages is highest (47 - 65 %) when the canopy density is 45 - 89 %. At canopy densities below or above this range, the share of polyphages in the community decreases to 20 and 24 %, respectively. Regardless of canopy density, Formicidae and Lycosidae invariably rank amongst the first three dominant families. Nine families of invertebrates dominate in the pine forest stands with the highest density (90 - 100 %), and 5 - 7 families dominate in the stands with lower density.

The relative number of <b>saprophages</b> reaches maximum values in hygro-mesophilic, meso-hygrophilic and hygrophilic conditions, and minimum values – in mesophilic conditions of moistening. The share of rare species is maximum in hygro-mesophilic conditions of moistening. The minimum quantity of mass species is also observed in conditions of hygro-mesophilic and meso-hygrophilic deciduous forests. With the growth of moistening of the soil, quantity of species of Carabidae, Formicidae and other dominant families remains without significant changes. The relative number of Formicidae is maximum in xeromesophilic and mesophilic conditions of soil moistening. In these hygrotopes, as well as in hygro-mesophilic conditions of moistening the Julidae numbers are maximum. The Isopoda percent in mesofauna significantly grows in meso-hygrophilic and hygrophilic conditions of moistening.

30|$|There are {{additionally}} also morphological, {{physiological and}} behavioural factors which strongly influence {{the exposure of}} soil organisms towards GMO [21]. Based on their biology, two groups of soil organisms can be identified which differ strongly in their way to take up chemicals: soft-bodied organisms, i.e. nematodes, enchytraeids, earthworms and hard-bodied organisms, i.e. mainly arthropods such as spiders, mites, collembolans, diplopods, isopods, or chilopods. Arthropods have special organs for water and oxygen uptake, while soft-bodied organisms use the body surface for these purposes. In addition, both groups can take up harmful substances by food. Different feeding types can be differentiated in soil organisms [26 – 28]: <b>saprophages</b> (feeding on dead organic material), microphages (feeding on bacteria), fungiphages (feeding on fungi), phytophages (feeding on living plants) and zoophages (predators) are the most common. However, evidence increases that many soil organisms are able to use different food resources [29 – 31]. Based on their mobility or preferences for different soil layers, most soil organism species can be classified into {{a limited number of}} ecological (trait) groups, e.g. epigeic, endogeic and anecic groups of earthworms [32].|$|R
50|$|Chloropidae {{are not of}} {{importance}} in human medicine {{in the same way}} as blood sucking parasites such as mosquitoes or Simuliidae. Also, in contrast to specialist pathogens such as Plasmodium or Trypanosoma, the pathogens that Chloropidae transmit are not adapted to particular vectors. However, some Chloropidae are troublesome in that they act as purely mechanical agents of disease transmission. Species that occur in large numbers and are attracted to animal secretions such as tears and dung, sometimes cause serious irritation and infection. Prominent examples include the eye gnat genera: Liohippelates in the Americas and Siphunculina in parts of Asia. Their larvae are soil <b>saprophages</b> that have several generations per year and accordingly can multiply rapidly. In warm seasons they may emerge in huge numbers and swarm about the eyes, up the nostrils and in the mouths of mammals, including livestock and humans. The irritation can be so great as to compel the use of gauze face masks for humans and even for animals. Furthermore, the flies are so small that the gauze must be very fine to offer effective protection.|$|R
50|$|In Getz's scheme, {{words for}} miners are of Greek {{etymology}} and words for gatherers are of Latin etymology. Thus a bestivore, {{such as a}} cat, preys on live animals (Latin: bestia=animal) while a sarcophage, such as a botfly larva mines live flesh and a zontanophage (Greek: zontanos=alive), such as a leaf miner, mines live plant material. A carcasivore (Latin: carcasium=carcass), such as white-backed vulture, scavenge animal carcasses while a necrophage (Greek: nekros=dead body), such as a blowfly, mines dead flesh. Victivores (Latin: victus=living) gather live plant material and thus include frugivores, nectivores, graminivores, granivores and folivores as subcategories. Lectivores, such as many termites, gather dead plant material (Latin: lectus=bed which {{is the root of}} the word litter, as in leaf-litter) and thanatophages (Greek: thanatos=death), such as pillbugs mine piles of dead plant material. Carnivore and herbivore are generic multigroup categories for gathers respectively of animal and plant material, irrespective of whether live or dead. Croppers, scavengers, and detritivores are gatherers respectively of live, dead, and particulate material. Parasites, <b>saprophages,</b> and decomposers are miners respectively of live, dead, and particulate material.|$|R
40|$|In {{work the}} results of {{studying}} of the spatial organization of soil mesofauna of the artificial forest planting have been processed by OMI- and RLQ-analysis methods. Our research were conducted in June, 6 st, 2011 in Oles Gonchar University botanic garden (earlier territory of park of J. Gagarin, Dnepropetrovsk). The studied plot is situated {{at a distance of}} 220 m from the Building 1 of DNU and at a distance of 95 m from Y. Gagarin Avenue (the So a perpendicular manner in relation to the Avenue. Each transect is made of seven sample points. The distance between points is 2 m. The coordinates of the lower left point have been taken as (0; 0). The plot represents artificial forest-park planting. The vegetation has typically wood, mesotrophic and mesophilic character (93. 55 % silvants, 70. 97 % mesotrophic, 57. 84 % mesophiles). At each point the soil mesofauna was studied; temperature, electrical conductivity and soil penetration resistance, dead leaf layer and herbage height were measured. Soil-In ecological structure of the soil animal community have been found such groups dominant as <b>saprophages,</b> pratants and stepants, hygrophilous, mesotrophocoenomorphes...|$|R
