2500|$|OHSAS 18000 is an {{international}} {{occupational health and safety}} management <b>system</b> <b>specification</b> developed by the London-based BSI Group, a multinational business chiefly concerned with the production and distribution of standards related services. OHSAS 18000 comprises two parts, OHSAS 18001 and 18002 and embraces a number of other publications. [...] OHSAS 18000 is the internationally recognized assessment specification for occupational health and safety management systems. It was developed by a selection of leading trade bodies, international standards and certification bodies to address a gap where no third-party certifiable international standard exists. This internationally recognized specification for occupational health and safety management system operates on the basis of policy, planning, implementation and operation, checking and corrective action, management review, and continual improvement.|$|E

Because this document determines all future development, the stage cannot be completed until a {{conceptual design}} review has determined that the <b>system</b> <b>specification</b> properly addresses the motivating need.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{adaptation}} of model-based verification, via model checking pushdown systems, to semantics-based verification. First we introduce the algebraic notion of pushdown <b>system</b> <b>specifications</b> (PSS) and adapt a model checking algorithm for this new notion. We instantiate pushdown <b>system</b> <b>specifications</b> in the K framework by means of Shylock, a relevant PSS example. We show why K is a suitable environment for the pushdown <b>system</b> <b>specifications</b> and we give a methodology for defining the PSS in K. Finally, we give a parametric K specification for model checking pushdown <b>system</b> <b>specifications</b> based on the adapted model checking algorithm for PSS...|$|R

50|$|The Blu-ray Disc {{application}} for recording of digital broadcasting {{has been developed}} as System Description Blu-ray Rewritable Disc Format part 3 Audio Visual Basic Specifications (BDAV). The requirements related with computer file system have been specified in System Description Blu-ray Rewritable Disc Format part 2 File <b>System</b> <b>Specifications</b> version 1.0 (BDFS). Initially, the BD-RE version 1.0 (BDFS) was specifically developed for recording of digital broadcasts using the Blu-ray Disc application (BDAV application). But these requirements are superseded by the Blu-ray Rewritable Disc File <b>System</b> <b>Specifications</b> version 2.0 (UDF) (a.k.a. RE 2.0) and Blu-ray Recordable Disc File <b>System</b> <b>Specifications</b> version 1.0 (UDF) (a.k.a. R 1.0). Additionally, a new {{application for}}mat, BDMV (System Description Blu-ray Disc Prerecorded Format part 3 Audio Visual Basic Specifications) for High Definition Content Distribution was developed for BD-ROM. The only file system developed for BDMV is the System Description Blu-ray Read-Only Disc Format part 2 File <b>System</b> <b>Specifications</b> version 1.0 (UDF) which defines the requirements for UDF 2.50.|$|R
