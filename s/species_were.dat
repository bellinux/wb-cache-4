5|$|Myrmecologist William Brown, Jr., {{was perhaps}} {{the first person to}} {{question}} the monophyly of the genus, mentioning that the Argentine ant, a former member of Iridomyrmex, differed {{from the rest of the}} genus. The first proper revisions of the genus began in the 1990s, and 91 <b>species</b> <b>were</b> transferred to six genera; only 62 species remained after these revisions. These <b>species</b> <b>were</b> placed into the genera Anonychomyrma, Doleromyrma, Linepithema, Ochetellus, Papyrius and Philidris. In 2011, the genus was revised again, and 79 species and five extinct <b>species</b> <b>were</b> now present, 31 of which were newly described. Four <b>species</b> <b>were</b> placed in different genera while 25 species and subspecies were classified as synonyms. According to one source, 350 Australian Iridomyrmex species may be present.|$|E
5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus, this species was {{originally}} classified as Hippopotamus along with H. lemerlei, {{and indeed the}} two <b>species</b> <b>were</b> roughly the same size. A review of their morphology and habitat, however, suggested a closer relationship to the modern pygmy hippopotamus.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} lemur <b>species</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} threatened; two <b>species</b> <b>are</b> critically endangered, one <b>species</b> <b>is</b> endangered, and five <b>species</b> <b>are</b> rated as vulnerable.|$|R

5|$|Aside from carp, {{several species}} of fish and {{amphibians}} still inhabited the creek up to the 1980s, when floods destroyed much of the remaining riparian habitat. These included the mosquito fish, bluegill, bass, and channel catfish, as well as {{several species of}} native frogs. After the floods, most of these <b>species</b> <b>were</b> reported to have disappeared completely.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers, {{scavenged}} for dead animals and hunted living ones for food. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing {{is thought to be}} the first example of agriculture; useful plant <b>species</b> <b>were</b> identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable <b>species</b> <b>were</b> removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed. While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{heritage}} plants monitoring, {{an additional}} inventory of Orthoptera is being undertaken; three new <b>species</b> <b>were</b> identified in 2013: common pheasant, Eurasian siskin and common wall lizard. Fourteen new plants were also identified. Inventories of bats and mushrooms are {{being carried out}} by partners.|$|E
50|$|Thirteen <b>species</b> <b>are</b> {{globally}} {{threatened and}} on <b>species</b> <b>is</b> locally threatened and highly endangered (gray wolf, Canis lupus), one <b>species</b> <b>is</b> endemic to Horsh Ehden (lesser white-toothed shrew, Crocidura suaveolens), and four <b>species</b> <b>are</b> considered threatened at global level.|$|R
50|$|Penion <b>species</b> <b>are</b> {{restricted}} to the Southern Hemisphere. Two extant <b>species</b> <b>are</b> currently classified in Australia and six extant <b>species</b> <b>are</b> documented in New Zealand.|$|R
25|$|Currently, around 1700 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> described, but an {{estimated}} 20,000 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> {{estimated to be}} awaiting discovery, mainly in the tropics. More than 600 <b>species</b> <b>are</b> known from Europe.|$|R
5|$|Caron and Jackson {{found that}} about 25% of the 172 known <b>species</b> <b>were</b> {{abundant}} and widespread throughout the time {{range of the}} GPB, {{while the majority of}} <b>species</b> <b>were</b> rare, and occurred in a small area {{for a short period of}} time. In most layers the five most abundant species accounted for 50% to 75% of individual animals. The species that had wide ranges in time and space may have been generalists, while the rest were specialists in particular types of environment. Alternatively some wide-ranging species may have been opportunists that were quick to recolonize the area after each burial event. The 6 species that appeared in all layers were very probably generalists.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, adult males of the <b>species</b> <b>were</b> characterized by greatly enlarged upper arms (humerus) with a bony ridge covered by skin and black keratinized spines. Spines were also {{present on the}} upper surface of the area just before the thumbs. These spines were likely used during amplexus.|$|E
5|$|Four Albatrellus <b>species</b> <b>were</b> {{included}} in a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of the order Russulales published in 2003. Based on their ribosomal DNA sequences, the four form a clade, or monophyletic group (that is, they derived from a single ancestor). Of the four tested species, A.ovinus was most closely related to A.subrubescens. The polypore Wrightoporia lenta (type species of the genus Wrightoporia) occurred on a single branch basal to the albatrellus clade, implying that it shared with the Albatrellus species a common ancestor from which both were descended. In a more recent (2010) molecular analysis by Canadian mycologist Serge Audet aimed at clarifying relationships among species formerly placed in Scutiger, A.subrubescens grouped in a clade with A.ovinus and A.citrinus. According to Audet, these species, in addition to A.avellaneus and A.piceiphilus, are the constituents of an Albatrellus with limits defined by molecular genetics. Other Albatrellus <b>species</b> <b>were</b> transferred to segregate genera: A.fletti and A.confluens to Albatrellopsis; A.caeruleoporus and A.yasudae to Neoalbatrellus; A.pes-caprae and A.ellisii to an amended Scutiger.|$|E

5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of <b>species</b> <b>were</b> {{associated with the}} radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that <b>species</b> <b>were</b> immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for {{one part of the}} anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Reid Venable Moran placed both Schlumbergera russelliana and Zygocactus truncatus in {{the genus}} Schlumbergera. Other <b>species</b> <b>were</b> added later by David Hunt, {{including}} those formerly placed in Epiphyllanthus, {{to form the}} modern total of six full species {{and a number of}} hybrids.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, it was {{estimated}} that 159 resident and 23 migratory <b>species</b> <b>were</b> endangered or vulnerable due to forest clearance, illegal logging, hunting and habitat degradation, especially in the lowlands. The species most affected are large water birds whose wetland habitat has been largely lost to agriculture, and forest species, as deforestation for agriculture and logging have removed and degraded portions of the woodlands.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} grass {{selectivity}} among the wildebeest, zebra, and the Coke's hartebeest, the hartebeest showed the highest selectivity.

5|$|In the Antarctic, <b>species</b> <b>were</b> {{found in}} the South Shetland Islands, South Orkney Islands, South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula.

According to two studies of the myxomycete flora of these regions, more <b>species</b> <b>were</b> discovered in the subantarctic forests, for example 67 species in Argentinian Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, and 22 on high ground on Macquarie Island.|$|E
