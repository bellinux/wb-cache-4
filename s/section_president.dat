Pogor in Iași, and Carp in Bucharest, {{helped organize the}} February 1866 putsch against the authoritarian Cuza, and supported the interim government presided upon by both liberal [...] "Reds" [...] and conservative [...] "Whites". On February 15, the Romanian Regency appointed Pogor Prefect of Iași County, {{and he was also}} a regional representative in the Assembly of Deputies (quickly elected for the drafting of a new constitution). On April 28, he was elected as one of its secretaries. For most of the year, he had a noted role in persuading his colleagues to accept bicameralism, and thus contributed to the establishment of the Senate of Romania. In March, he was also sent back to the appellate court, as <b>section</b> <b>president,</b> serving until January 1868. According to scholar George Călinescu, he also began supplementing his revenue with [...] "multiple and ephemeral" [...] special commissions, including that of teacher certification examiner (October 1866).|$|E
