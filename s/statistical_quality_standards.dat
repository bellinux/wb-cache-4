In this paper we examine the <b>statistical</b> <b>quality</b> of some air <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> by taking both measurement error and variability of the ambient field away from the monitoring sites into account. In particular we study the distribution of the maximum of the ambient field conditional on a measured monitoring value at the value prescribed by the standard.

The theoretical part of the piece of work deals with defining the terms pertaining to the <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> of social services in care homes for the elderly. These are the terms ?old age?, ?need?, ?care home for the elderly?, ?social services?, ?<b>quality</b> <b>standards?,</b> and ?client?. The aim of the dissertation was to map the fulfilment and realisation of selected <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> in care homes for the elderly. Partial aims were {{to determine the extent of}} fulfilment of <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> from the point of view of the client and to compare the individual levels of application of the <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> for social services. Two care homes were chosen for the study, the Care Home for the Elderly Tep in Veselí nad Lužnicí and the Care Home for the Elderly in Horní Stropnice. Two hypotheses were established. Quantitative research was chosen to facilitate reaching the aims and verifying the hypotheses, utilising questioning methods, interviewing techniques and questionnaire enquiry. Furthermore, analysing the data was accomplished using secondary document analysis. The research file contained the clients and staff of both selected care homes for the elderly. Following the evaluation of the results I believe that the aims of the dissertation were fulfilled. Selected <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> are realised well in both care homes for the elderly and the essential criteria of individual <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> are fulfilled as well. In addition, the research study proved both hypotheses to be correct.
