500|$|From 2006 until 2010, Twitter's {{developer}} platform experienced {{strong growth}} {{and a highly}} favorable reputation. Developers built upon the public API to create the first Twitter mobile phone clients {{as well as the}} first URL <b>shortener.</b> Between 2010 and 2012, however, Twitter made a number of decisions that were received unfavorably by the developer community. In 2010, Twitter mandated that all developers adopt OAuth authentication with just 9 weeks of notice. Later that year, Twitter launched its own URL <b>shortener,</b> in direct competition with some of its most well-known 3rd-party developers. And in 2012, Twitter introduced strict usage limits for its API, [...] "completely crippling" [...] some developers. While these moves successfully increased the stability and security of the service, they were broadly perceived as hostile to developers, causing them to lose trust in the platform.|$|E

40|$|Social Media (OSM) {{has become}} a massive e-crime. To counter the {{dissemination}} of long complex URLs in emails and character limit imposed on various OSM (like Twitter), the concept of URL shortening has gained a lot of traction. URL <b>shorteners</b> take as input a long URL and output a short URL with the same landing page (as in the long URL) in return. With their immense popularity over time, URL <b>shorteners</b> have become a prime target for the attackers giving them an advantage to conceal malicious content. Bitly, a leading service among all shortening services is being exploited heavily to carry out phishing attacks, work-from-home scams, pornographic content propagation, etc. This imposes additional performance pressure on Bitly and other URL <b>shorteners</b> {{to be able to}} detect and take a timely action against the illegitimate content. In this study, we analyzed a dataset of 763, 160 short URLs marked suspicious by Bitly in the month of October 2013. Our results reveal that Bitly is not using its claimed spam detection services very effectively. We also show how a suspicious Bitly account goes unnoticed despite of a prolonged recurrent illegitimate activity. Bitly displays a warning page on identification of suspicious links, but we observed this approach to be weak in controlling the overall propagation of spam. We also identified some short URL based features and coupled them with two domain specific features to classify a Bitly URL as malicious or benign and achieved an accuracy of 86. 41 %. The feature set identified can be generalized to other URL shortening services as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study to highlight the issues with the implementation of Bitly’s spam detection policies and proposing suitable countermeasures. 1 I...|$|R

30|$|Under their direct {{transversal}} shape, all of {{the proposed}} adaptive channel <b>shorteners</b> are designed for both FIR and/or IIR channel shortening.

In order to ensure the best algorithm convergence to TEQ zeros, canceling poles and causing the tail, we suggest working with the lattice structure for the adaptive TEQ implementation. We admit the adaptive blind MERRY and SAM algorithms.|$|R
50|$|In April 2009, TinyURL was {{reported}} to be blocked in Saudi Arabia. Yahoo! Answers blocks postings that contain TinyURLs, and Wikipedia does not accept links by any URL shortening services in its articles.

500|$|The tweets {{were set}} to a largely constrictive 140-character limit for {{compatibility}} with SMS messaging, introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages. The 140-character limit also increased the usage of URL shortening services such as bit.ly, goo.gl, and tr.im, and content-hosting services, such as Twitpic, memozu.com and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters. Since June 2011, Twitter has used its own t.co domain for automatic shortening of all URLs posted on its website, making other link <b>shorteners</b> superfluous for staying within the 140 character limit.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With {{an average}} of 80 % length reduction, the URL <b>shorteners</b> have become the norm for sharing URLs on Twitter, mainly due to the 140 -character limit per message. Unfortunately, spammers have also adopted the URL <b>shorteners</b> to {{camouflage}} and improve the user click-through of their spam URLs. In this paper, we measure the misuse of the short URLs and analyze {{the characteristics of the}} spam and non-spam short URLs. We utilize these measurements to enable the detection of spam short URLs. To achieve this, we collected short URLs from Twitter and retrieved their click traffic data from Bitly, a popular URL shortening system. We first investigate the creators of over 600, 000 Bitly short URLs to characterize short URL spammers. We then analyze the click traffic generated from various countries and referrers, and determine the top click sources for spam and non-spam short URLs. Our results show {{that the majority of the}} clicks are from direct sources and that the spammers utilize popular websites to attract more attention by cross-posting the links. We then use the click traffic data to classify the short URLs into spam vs. non-spam and compare the performance of the selected classifiers on the dataset. We determine that the Random Tree algorithm achieves the best performance with an accuracy of 90. 81 % and an F-measure value of 0. 913. Keywords—traffic analysis, short URL spam, Twitter I...|$|R
30|$|Political {{astroturfing}} in {{the form}} of propagation of memes in Twitter was studied by the Truthy team [7],[8]. Investigating political election campaigns in US in the year 2010, the research group uncovered a number of accounts sending out duplicate messages and also retweeting messages from the same few accounts in a closely connected network. In another case, 10 different accounts were used to send out thousands of posts, many of them duplicates slightly altered to avoid detection as spam. With URL <b>shorteners</b> available, messages containing links could be altered to give different shortened links to the same source and hence escaping the spam filters.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the abuse of online social {{networks}} {{at the hands of}} spammers through the lens of the tools, techniques, and support infrastructure they rely upon. To perform our analysis, we identify over 1. 1 million accounts suspended by Twitter for disruptive activities over the course of seven months. In the process, we collect a dataset of 1. 8 billion tweets, 80 million of which belong to spam accounts. We use our dataset to characterize the behavior and lifetime of spam accounts, the campaigns they execute, and the wide-spread abuse of legitimate web services such as URL <b>shorteners</b> and free web hosting. We also identify an emerging marketplace of illegitimate programs operated by spammers that include Twitter account sellers, ad-based URL <b>shorteners,</b> and spam affiliate programs that help enable underground market diversification. Our results show that 77 % of spam accounts identified by Twitter are suspended within on day of their first tweet. Because of these pressures, less than 9 % of accounts form social relationships with regular Twitter users. Instead, 17 % of accounts rely on hijacking trends, while 52 % of accounts use unsolicited mentions to reach an audience. In spite of daily account attrition, we show how five spam campaigns controlling 145 thousand accounts combined are able to persist for months at a time, with each campaign enacting a unique spamming strategy. Surprisingly, three of these campaigns send spam directing visitors to reputable store fronts, blurring the line regarding what constitutes spam on social networks...|$|R
