60|$|None of 'em {{seemed to}} be in a hurry. Bill Jones took it up and bit it, and rang it on the table and <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> it, and then he bit it agin, and turned round and asked Joe Barlcomb wot was wrong with it.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Bowater almost <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> my {{two small}} {{envelopes}} when she licked the stamps for me. [...] "We can only hope," [...] was her one remark, [...] "that when {{the secrets of}} all hearts are opened, they'll excuse some of the letters we reach ourselves to write." [...] But I did not ask her to explain.|$|E
5000|$|NPR's Ann Powers called Kristofferson's {{cover of}} [...] "Turpentine" [...] "A full-daylight <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> heartbreak".|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{almost without}} warnin'; but not {{altogether}} without it. You heer'd the captain say he'd go an' take a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> the glass?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "First-rate," [...] replied Tim, [...] "an' {{much the}} same as your own. I had a good <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> you before you awoke. Isn't the place splendacious?" ...|$|R
60|$|Janet {{looked a}} little {{surprised}} to see me lying stiffly on the sofa (I was afraid to move lest it should be displeasing to my aunt), but went on her errand. My aunt, with her hands behind her, {{walked up and down}} the room, until the gentleman who had <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> me from the upper window came in laughing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Four-thousand-dollar {{stock of}} goods!" [...] gasped Keogh, in ecstasy. [...] "Talk about coals to Newcastle! Why didn't he take a ship-load of palm-leaf fans to Spitzbergen {{while he was}} about it? Saw the old codger on the beach. You {{ought to have been}} there when he put on his specs and <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> the five hundred or so barefooted {{citizens}} standing around." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he glared defiantly at the older officer, who calmly {{proceeded}} {{to translate the}} speech to the colonel. Carg reported that it was translated verbatim. Then the general sat back and <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> his companion, who seemed fairly bewildered by the threat. Patsy caught the young officer smothering a smile, but neither of them interrupted the silence that followed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} they was all thumbs," [...] he grimaced, {{holding up his}} hand and <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> it with the {{fraction}} of sight remaining to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you take}} a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> it every now and then," [...] I said. [...] "Just as soon as Emmeline leaves Prissy alone I'll hoist the signal." ...|$|R

60|$|It was not {{surprising}} that young Tom Gaylord, {{when he came back}} from New York and heard of Austen's victory, should have rushed to his office and congratulated him in a rough but hearty fashion. Even though Austen had won a suit against the Gaylord Lumber Company, young Tom would have congratulated him. Old Tom was a different matter. Old Tom, hobbling along under the maples, <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> Austen and held up his stick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, they're drowned," [...] {{continued}} Wicks; [...] "drowned alongside {{trying to}} lower a boat. We {{had a bit}} of a squall last night; that's how we got ashore." [...] He ran and <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> the compass. [...] "Squall out of nor'-nor'west-half-west; blew hard; every one in a mess, falls jammed, and Holdorsen and Wallen spilt overboard. See? Clear your blooming heads!" [...] He was in his jacket now, and spoke with a feverish impatience and contention that rang like anger.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> me in unfeigned alarm at this; {{the lump}} {{in his throat}} went up and down; and though {{possibly}} I had painted the picture in rather sombre colours, this settled the matter. I hope it taught Adam to fight shy ever afterwards of adventuresses. It certainly taught this adventuress that the mind may be [...] "subdued to what it works in, like the dyer's hand." [...] I cast a look of hatred after the weak, silly man as he disappeared between the trees.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{pretty sure}} I haven't lost my bearings," [...] {{answered}} the old lumberman. [...] "However, to make sure, maybe I had {{better have a}} <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> my compass." ...|$|R

6000|$|Poll Sweedlepipe obeyed, {{and scraped}} the lather off again with {{particular}} care. Mr Bailey <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> every successive dab, {{as it was}} deposited on a cloth on his left shoulder, and seemed, with a microscopic eye, to detect some bristles in it; for he murmured more than once 'Reether redder than I could wish, Poll.' The operation being concluded, Poll fell back {{and stared at him}} again, while Mr Bailey, wiping his face on the jack-towel, remarked, 'that arter late hours nothing freshened up a man so much as a easy shave.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ginger {{sat up in}} bed {{and stared}} at ’im; then ’e bent ’is ’ead down and <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> ’is chest, and next moment ’e was out of bed and all three of ’em was holding ’im down on the floor to prevent ’im {{breaking}} the tattooer’s neck which ’e’d set ’is ’eart upon doing, and explaining to ’im that the tattooer {{was at the top of}} ’is profession, and that it was only by a stroke of luck ’e had got ’im. And Sam reminded ’im of wot ’e ’ad said the night before, and said he’d live to thank ’im for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} don't neglect your school work, though, Carl." [...] Mrs. Cowles held the scarf nearer the lamp and <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> it, {{deliberately}} and solemnly, through the eye-glasses that lorded it atop her severe nose. A headachy scent of moth-balls {{was in the}} dull air. She forbiddingly moved {{the shade of the}} lamp about a tenth of an inch. She removed some non-existent dust from the wrought-iron standard. Her gestures said that the lamp was decidedly more chic than the pink-shaded hanging lamps, raised and lowered on squeaking chains, which characterized most Joralemon living-rooms. She glanced at the red lambrequin over the nearest window. The moth-ball smell grew more stupifying.|$|E
60|$|Hardly had he spoken, when Silas Foster {{thrust his}} head, {{done up in}} a cotton handkerchief, out of another window, and took what he called as it {{literally}} was--a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jest take a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> these hoss tracks," [...] said Nels, and he drew Stillwell a {{few paces}} aside and pointed to large hoofprints in the dust. [...] "I reckon you know the hoss thet made them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Twelve {{hours had}} intervened since Bradley's lying down, {{when he got}} up. 'Not that I swaller it,' said Riderhood, <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> his Lock, when he saw Bradley {{coming out of the}} house, 'as you've been a {{sleeping}} all the time, old boy!' ...|$|R
60|$|At last {{he found}} inside {{a book on}} motor fuels the wad of copy-paper on which he had scrawled notes with a broad, soft pencil, {{and he began to}} dictate a short article on air-cooling. Una was terrified lest she be unable to keep up, but she had read recent numbers of the Gazette thoroughly, she had practised the symbols for motor technologies, and she was not troubled by being watched. Indeed, Babson seemed to have enough to do in keeping his restless spirit from {{performing}} the dismaying feat of leaping straight out of his body. He leaned back in his revolving desk-chair with a complaining squawk from the spring, he closed his eyes, put his fingers together piously, then seized the chair-arms and held them, while he cocked one eye open and <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> a large alarm-clock on the desk. He sighed profoundly, bent forward, gazed at his ankle, and reached forward to scratch it. All this time he was dictating, now rapidly, now gurgling and grunting while he paused to find a word.|$|E
60|$|Only Marcus O’Brien knew, and {{he never}} came back to tell. He awoke next morning in torment. His stomach had been {{calcined}} by the inordinate quantity of whisky he had drunk, and was a dry and raging furnace. His head ached all over, inside and out; and, worse than that, was {{the pain in his}} face. For six hours countless thousands of mosquitoes had fed upon him, and their ungrateful poison had swollen his face tremendously. It was only by a severe exertion of will {{that he was able to}} open narrow slits in his face through which he could peer. He happened to move his hands, and they hurt. He <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> them, but failed to recognize them, so puffed were they by the mosquito virus. He was lost, or rather, his identity was lost to him. There was nothing familiar about him, which, by association of ideas, would cause to rise in his consciousness the continuity of his existence. He was divorced utterly from his past, for there was nothing about him to resurrect in his consciousness a memory of that past. Besides, he was so sick and miserable that he lacked energy and inclination to seek after who and what he was.|$|E
60|$|She congratulated herself {{still more}} on observing {{in the course}} of days that Mr Verloc seemed to be taking kindly to Stevie’s companionship. Now, when ready to go out for his walk, Mr Verloc called aloud to the boy, in the spirit, no doubt, in which a man invites the {{attendance}} of the household dog, though, of course, in a different manner. In the house Mr Verloc could be detected staring curiously at Stevie a good deal. His own demeanour had changed. Taciturn still, he was not so listless. Mrs Verloc thought that he was rather jumpy at times. It might have been regarded as an improvement. As to Stevie, he moped no longer {{at the foot of the}} clock, but muttered to himself in corners instead in a threatening tone. When asked “What is it you’re saying, Stevie?” he merely opened his mouth, and <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> his sister. At odd times he clenched his fists without apparent cause, and when discovered in solitude would be scowling at the wall, with the sheet of paper and the pencil given him for drawing circles lying blank and idle on the kitchen table. This was a change, but it was no improvement. Mrs Verloc including all these vagaries under the general definition of excitement, began to fear that Stevie was hearing more than was good for him of her husband’s conversations with his friends. During his “walks” Mr Verloc, of course, met and conversed with various persons. It could hardly be otherwise. His walks were an integral part of his outdoor activities, which his wife had never looked deeply into. Mrs Verloc felt that the position was delicate, but she faced it with the same impenetrable calmness which impressed and even astonished the customers of the shop and made the other visitors keep their distance a little wonderingly. No! She feared that there were things not good for Stevie to hear of, she told her husband. It only excited the poor boy, because he could not help them being so. Nobody could.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{glad you}}'re wet,' said Quilp, {{snatching}} it, and <b>squinting</b> <b>at</b> her. 'I'm glad you're cold. I'm glad {{you lost your}} way. I'm glad your eyes are red with crying. It does my heart good to see your little nose so pinched and frosty.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} taking a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> the prison where I'm told your comrade is held, and am {{come to believe that}} unless these 'ere Britishers are much like weasels, it won't be such a hard thing {{to get him out of}} that scrape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I {{might get}} a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> my patient," [...] laughed the doctor, [...] "for he prefers to lie on an ottoman {{right at the end}} of the {{conservatory}} amid all those blood-red poinsettias; it would give me the creeps. But what are you doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Which {{detail of}} reminiscence has again stayed my course to the Witley Villa, when {{even on the}} way I quaked a little with my sense of what {{generally}} most awaited or overtook my companion's prime proposals. What had come most to characterise the Leweses to my apprehension was that there couldn't be a {{thing in the world}} about which they weren't, and on the most conceded and assured grounds, almost scientifically particular; which presumption, however, only added to the relevance of one's learning how such a matter as their relation with Mrs. Greville could in accordance with noble consistencies be carried on. I could trust her for it perfectly, as she knew no law but that of innocent and exquisite aberration, never wanting and never less than consecrating, and I fear I but took refuge for the rest in declining all responsibility. I remember trying to say to myself that, even such as we were, our visit couldn't but scatter a little the weight of cloud on the Olympus we scaled--given the dreadful drenching afternoon we were after all an imaginable short solace there; and this indeed would have borne me through to the end save for an incident which, with a quite ideal logic, left our adventure an approved ruin. I see again our bland, benign, commiserating hostess beside the fire in a chill desert of a room where the master of the house guarded the opposite hearthstone, and I catch once more the impression of no occurrence of anything at all appreciable but their liking us to have come, with our terribly trivial contribution, mainly from a prevision of how they should more devoutly like it when we departed. It is remarkable, but the occasion yields me no single echo of a remark on the part of any of us--nothing more than the sense that our great author herself peculiarly suffered from the fury of the elements, and that they had about them rather the minimum of the paraphernalia of reading and writing, not to speak of that of tea, a conceivable feature of the hour, but which was not provided for. Again I felt touched with privilege, but not, as in '69, with a form of it redeemed from barrenness by a motion of my own, and the taste of barrenness was in fact in my mouth under the effect of our taking leave. We did so with considerable flourish till we had passed out to the hall again, indeed {{to the door of the}} waiting carriage, toward which G. H. Lewes himself all sociably, then above all conversingly, wafted us--yet staying me by a sudden remembrance before I had entered the brougham and signing me to wait while he repaired his omission. I returned to the doorstep, whence I still see him reissue from the room we had just left and hurry toward me across the hall shaking high the pair of blue-bound volumes his allusion to the uninvited, the verily importunate loan of which by Mrs. Greville had lingered on the air after his dash in quest of them; [...] "Ah those books--take them away, please, away, away!" [...] I hear him unreservedly plead while he thrusts them again at me, and I scurry back into our conveyance, where, and where only, settled afresh with my companion, I venture to assure myself of the horrid truth that had <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> me as I relieved our good friend of his superfluity. What indeed was this superfluity but the two volumes of my own precious [...] "last"--we were still in the blest age of volumes--presented by its author to the lady of Milford Cottage, and by her, misguided votary, dropped with the best conscience in the world into the Witley abyss, out of which it had jumped with violence, under the touch of accident, straight up again into my own exposed face? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The earth seemed unearthly. We are {{accustomed}} to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there--there {{you could look at}} a thing monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men were--No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it--this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity--like yours--the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you--you so remote from the night of first ages--could comprehend. And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything--because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there after all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage--who can tell?--but truth--truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and shudder--the man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet that truth with his own true stuff--with his own inborn strength. Principles won't do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags--rags that would fly off at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in this fiendish row--is there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice, too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments, is always safe. Who's that grunting? You wonder I didn't go ashore for a howl and a dance? Well, no--I didn't. Fine sentiments, you say? Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes--I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook. There was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man. And between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical boiler. He was there below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs. A few months of training had done for that really fine chap. He <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident effort of intrepidity--and he had filed teeth, too, the poor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful because he had been instructed; and what he knew was this--that should the water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance. So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully (with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways through his lower lip), while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left behind, the interminable miles of silence--and we crept on, towards Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither that fireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.|$|E
5000|$|... “Qi {{has a very}} {{particular}} way of selecting the places their envoys are sent: those that are bright and competent are sent to dignified and respectable places; those that are incompetent are designated to failed states. I am the most incompetent one which is why I have been sent here to Chu.” A long silence ensued while the subjects of the King <b>squinted</b> <b>at</b> Yan Ying.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a pretty}} group in a pretty setting, and I thrilled with {{professional}} pride as I stepped back for a final, knowing <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> it all. Then I went to my camera, slipped in the plate, gave them due warning and took off the cap.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do belave I'm all right," [...] he said {{at length}} {{with a sigh of}} relief; [...] "have a care, Bunco, kape yer paws off, but take a <b>squint</b> <b>at</b> the nape o' me neck an' see if me {{back-bone}} is stickin' up through me shirt-collar." ...|$|R
