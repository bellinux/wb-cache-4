5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} in rural environments {{made use of}} local materials and styles. As in England, cruck construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof; however they were usually hidden from view. In rural areas there was extensive use of turf {{to fill in the}} walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt frequently, perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. With a lack of long span <b>structural</b> <b>timber,</b> the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing.|$|E
5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local materials and methods. The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups of family and friends. Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span <b>structural</b> <b>timber,</b> the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E

25|$|In grading {{lumber and}} <b>structural</b> <b>timber,</b> knots are {{classified}} {{according to their}} form, size, soundness, and the firmness {{with which they are}} held in place. This firmness is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.|$|E
25|$|Knots do not {{necessarily}} influence the stiffness of <b>structural</b> <b>timber,</b> this {{will depend on the}} size and location. Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects. Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.|$|E
25|$|Mousa's {{walls are}} the best {{preserved}} and are still 13m tall; {{it is not clear}} how many brochs originally stood this high. A frequent characteristic is that the walls are galleried: with an open space between, the outer and inner wall skins are separate but tied together with linking stone slabs; these linking slabs may in some cases have served as steps to higher floors. It is normal for there to be a cell breaking off from the passage beside the door; this is known as the guard cell. It has been found in some Shetland brochs that guard cells in entrance passageways are close to large door-check stones. Though there was much argument in the past, it is now generally accepted among archaeologists that brochs were roofed, perhaps with a conical timber framed roof covered with a locally sourced thatch. The evidence for this assertion is still fairly scanty, although excavations at Dun Bharabhat, Lewis, may support it. The main difficulty with this interpretation continues to be the potential source of <b>structural</b> <b>timber,</b> though bog and driftwood may have been plentiful sources.|$|E
50|$|Structural beams: Use {{of large}} <b>structural</b> <b>timbers</b> for primary {{support of the}} roof of a building. Wooden timber, usually large trimmed logs, are used as {{load-bearing}} columns and lateral beams for framing buildings and supporting the roofs. These beams are connected to each other directly or, in larger and higher class structures, tied indirectly together through the use of brackets. These <b>structural</b> <b>timbers</b> are prominently displayed in finished structures. It is not definitively known how the ancient builders raised the huge wooden load bearing columns into position.|$|R

The gun platforms were unable to bear the weight of cannons, and the defences needed additional artillery and gunpowder; the permanent garrison by now only comprised five gunners.

500|$|Very few rural {{houses have}} survived from the Medieval era in Scotland. As in England, cruck {{construction}} was used, employing pairs of curved timbers {{to support the}} roof, however, unlike in England, they were usually hidden from view. The major timbers often belonged to the local laird and were known as [...] "master's wood" [...] or [...] "master's timbers" [...] and were often reused. The responsibility for infilling the walls usually belonged to the tenants. There was extensive use of turf {{to fill in the}} walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and stray, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. With a lack of long span <b>structural</b> <b>timber,</b> the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing. Central to most houses was the hearth. The simplest were in the centre of the floor, with smoke exiting {{through a hole in the}} roof and this form tended to be used longer in the Highlands. More developed forms had a backstone of a single flagstone or walling. There is evidence of Lowland houses with canopies for smoke extraction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hotel was}} {{constructed}} from 5,000 tons (4,535t) of rough-cut granite, 1,000 tons (907t) of steel, and 30,000 feet (9,140m) of timber. The apparent wood siding and <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> on the hotel's exterior are actually formed of stained concrete poured into molds to simulate a wood pattern. The steel {{came from the}} Union Iron Works in San Francisco, and the timber from land owned by the Curry family. Concrete {{was chosen as the}} material for the outside [...] "wood" [...] elements to add fire resistance to the hotel. The construction lasted eleven months and cost US$1,225,000 upon completion in July 1927. After construction was complete the company began an advertising campaign to showcase the new amenities.|$|E
