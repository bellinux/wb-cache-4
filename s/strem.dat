The aim of the project is to deliver video to {{heterogeneous}} clients using only one video stream.

A multicast method of delivery {{would mean that the}} client can control the amount of stream it receives and hence the video quality without the server having to transcode or modify the <b>strems</b> it sends out. However, because there are devices that cannot receive multicast data, e. g., handheld devices or PDAs, a proxy gateway was developed to receive the multicast stream and retransmit them in a unicast manner. The proxy gateway, because it is developed primarily to support the low-powered handheld devices, also performs buffering and other actions that may require amounts of memory which handheld devices do not have.

A escolha do tema deveu-se ao recente reconhecimento, pela comunidade científica, da eficácia do medicamento conhecido como "óleo de Lorenzo", desenvolvido a partir de pesquisas feitas por Augusto e Michaela Odone, pais de Lorenzo e protagonistas da história. Aqui, foi realizado um estudo observacional, tipo de observação de "segunda mão", indireta e não participante. Na revisão bibliográfica tentou-se contextualizar, de maneira sucinta, o método científico e a origem das abordagens quantitativa e qualitativa, identificando, com base no filme, as relações de poder que permeiam o campo científico.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Cowpeas are {{produced}} under low and irregular rainfall {{in most of}} arid and semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Growth and yield are therefore reduced due to the occurrence of water stress during the growing season. Knowledge of the responses and adaptive mechanisms of cowpeas to water stress may help to improve the management practices for these areas. Therefore, three glasshouse experiments were conducted at Welgevallen Experimental Farm of the University of Stellenbosch to test the responses of two cowpea cultivars to water stress. In the first experiment, physiological responses were used to identify those physiological parameters, {{which can be used}} to distinguish between drought tolerant and susceptible cowpea cultivars. In the second experiment, some of the identified physiological parameters together with some morphological growth responses, yield and grain protein content of the same two cowpea cultivars were used to identify which is the more tolerant cultivar. Tn the third experiment, the hypothesis that increased phosphorus supply may improve the tolerance of cowpea plants to water stress and their ability of recover from the stress was tested. The results showed that water stress affected water relations, morphological growth parameters, yield and grain protein content, but increasing P supply reduced the effect of water stress and promoted more rapid recovery after re-watering. Water relations were affected by water stress because it reduced relative water content, which resulted in reduced water potential and increased leaf diffusive resistance and proline accumulation. Morphological growth responses and yields were affected because water stress reduced the leaf area, which resulted in reduced biomass production and seed yield. Lower leaf area under water stress {{was the result of the}} reduced number of leaves and leaf expansion rate, but the number of leaves was the most important parameter. Reduced seed yield was due to reduced number of pods. The responses of the two cultivars tested were different. AB Wit, which performed better under well-watered conditions was more affected by water stress due to its larger leaf area that resulted in excessive water loss by transpiration. ACH 14 was more drought tolerant than AB Wit due to a combination of a more rapid stomatal closure and proline accumulation, which induced osmotic adjustment, and which in tum helped to maintain higher water potentials. The increased P supply reduced the effect of the water stress. High-P level plants showed higher root growth, which resulted in more water uptake and larger leaf area during the water stress period, and after re-watering these plants recovered more rapidly. The more rapid recovery from stress was the result of enhanced root growth and leaf expansion rate and most probably due to increased water uptake. High-P level plants also showed more rapid leaf appearance and plant growth at earlier stages compared to the low-P level plants. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Akkerbone word onder toestande van lae en wisselvallige reenval in baie ariede en semi-ariede gebiede van Afrika verbou. In hierdie gebiede word groei en produksie dikwels beperk deur water tekorte gedurende die groei seisoen. Kennis van reaksies en aanpassingsmeganismes van akkerbone teenoor water tekorte mag dus help om produksietegnieke in bogenoemde gebiede te verbeter. Om hierdie rede is drie glashuiseksperimente onder gekontroleerde toestande op die Welgevallen Proefplaas van die Universiteit van Stellenbosch uitgevoer. In die eerste eksperiment is fisiologiese reaksies van twee cultivars gebruik om eienskappe te identifiseer wat gebruik kan word om tussen droogteweerstandbiedende en droogte gevoelige cultivars te onderskei. In die tweede eksperiment is sommige van die geidentifiseerde eienskappe asook morfologiese groei, opbrengs en kwaliteitsreaksies van dieselfde twee cultivars gebruik om die meer droogte weerstandbiedende cultivar te identifiseer. In die derde eksperiment is die hipotese dat P-bemesting die droogteweerstandbiedendheid teen en herstelvermoe na droogte kan verbeter, getoets. Die resultate toon dat water tekorte beide plantwaterverhoudings, morfologiese eienskappe asook opbrengs en proteieninhoud beinvloed, maar dat hoe P-peile die invloed van water tekorte verminder en herstelverrnoe na die droogte verbeter. Plant-waterverhoudings is bemvloed omdat water tekorte relatiewe waterinhoud van plante verlaag wat aanleiding gee tot verlaagde plantwaterpotensiale, verhoogde huidmondjie weerstand en 'n toename in prolien inhoud. Morfologiese eienskappe en opbrengs is benadeel weens 'n veri aging in blaaroppervlakte wat fotosintetiese vermoe en gevolglik ook biomassaproduksie en saad opbrengs benadeel. Verlaagde blaaroppervlakte tydens water tekorte was hoofsaaklik die gevolg van 'n vermindering in aantal blare, terwyl verlaagde saadopbrengs grootliks die resultaat van 'n vermindering in aantal peule was. Die cultivar AB Wit wat die hoogste opbrengs onder gunstige groeitoestande gelewer het, is die meeste bemvloed deur water tekorte omdat die welige blaargroei van hierdie cultivar, luukse waterverbruik en groter transpirasie verliese veroorsaak het. Die cultivar ACH 14 daarteenoor het waterverliese beperk deurdat die huidmondjies vinniger gesluit het en verhoogde prolien-inhoude, osmotiese aanpassings veroorsaak het. Dit het gehelp om waterpotensiale instand te hou. Hierdie cultivar was gevolglik meer droogte weerstandbiedend as AB Wit. Hoe vlakke van P-bemesting het die effek van water tekorte verminder weens verbeterde wortelgroei. Dit het wateropname gedurende en na die peri ode van water <b>stremming</b> verbeter sodat plante vinniger herstel het na die droe periode.

We found significantly higher <b>sTREM</b> 2 concentration in AD compared to control CSF. There were significant correlations between CSF <b>sTREM</b> 2 and T-tau as well as P-tau 181. CSF <b>sTREM</b> 2 increase in AD was replicated in a second, independent cohort consisting of 24 AD patients and 16 healthy volunteers. Conclusion: CSF concentrations of <b>sTREM</b> 2 are higher in AD than in controls, and correlate with markers of neurodegeneration. CSF <b>sTREM</b> 2 may be used to quantify glial activation in AD...|$|E

Toluene and THF were purified by passage through a neutral alumina column, and t-amyl alcohol was purified by distillation from CaH 2. All other solvents were used as received: hexane (Aldrich; Sure/Seal); NMP (Aldrich; Sure/Seal); DMF (Aldrich; Sure/Seal). All alkyl halides were purified by either distillation or vacuum transfer: n-nonyl iodide (Aldrich); n-nonyl bromide (Aldrich); n-nonyl chloride (Aldrich); n-nonyl fluoride (Aldrich); 1 -bromo- 3 -methylbutane (Aldrich); isobutylbromide (Aldrich); isopropylbromide (Aldrich). n-Nonyl tosylate was prepared by tosylation of n-nonyl alcohol. P(t-Bu) 2 Me (<b>Strem)</b> and Pd(P(t-Bu) 3) 2 (<b>Strem)</b> were used without further purification. Pd(PCy 3) 2 (<b>Strem)</b> was purified by recrystallization from toluene/methanol.

40|$|Super-resolution {{microscopy}} typically {{achieves high}} 2 D spatial resolution but {{the detection of}} depth is always difficult. At {{the same time the}} temporal resolution remains low and obstructs most biological and chemical researches. In this thesis, I firstly introduced the depth detection method via phase modulation with a 4 f system. In the Fourier domain, a phase mask encodes the depth information with a specific phase pattern, double helix phase mask. The final point spread functions deviates from the standard Gaussian point spread functions and the depth information can be measured with high precision by fitting the corresponding double helix point spread functions. Based on the 4 f system, I modified the instrument and propose a novel technique Super Temporal-Resolved Microscopy (<b>STReM)</b> to improve the temporal resolution of 2 D super-resolution microscopy. The fundamental basis for <b>STReM</b> is the utilization of a double helix phase mask which is rotated at fast speeds to encode temporal information in Fourier domain. The signal can be analyzed either by single emitter fitting or a l_ 1 norm constrained optimization process, which is based on dynamic properties of emitter movement. <b>STReM</b> has been verified using both simulated and experimental 2 D data for adsorption/desorption and 2 D transport. The temporal resolution has been improved roughly 20 times when comparing traditional methods to that of the novel method of <b>STReM</b> presented in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of plasma membrane (PM) microdomains plays {{a crucial role}} in the regulation of membrane signaling and trafficking. Remorins are a plant-specific family of proteins organized in six phylogenetic groups, and Remorins of group 1 are among the few plant proteins known to specifically associate with membrane rafts. As such, they are valuable to understand the molecular bases for PM lateral organization in plants. However, little is known about the structural determinants underlying the specific association of group 1 Remorins with membrane rafts. We used a structure-function approach to identify a short C-terminal anchor (RemCA) indispensable and sufficient for tight direct binding of potato (Solanum tuberosum) REMORIN 1. 3 (<b>StREM</b> 1. 3) to the PM. RemCA switches from unordered to alpha-helical structure in a nonpolar environment. Protein structure modeling indicates that RemCA folds into a tight hairpin of amphipathic helices. Consistently, mutations reducing RemCA amphipathy abolished <b>StREM</b> 1. 3 PM localization. Furthermore, RemCA directly binds to biological membranes in vitro, shows higher affinity for Detergent-Insoluble Membranes lipids, and targets yellow fluorescent protein to Detergent-Insoluble Membranes in vivo. Mutations in RemCA resulting in cytoplasmic <b>StREM</b> 1. 3 localization abolish <b>StREM</b> 1. 3 function in restricting potato virus X movement. The mechanisms described here provide new insights on the control and function of lateral segregation of plant PM...|$|E
40|$|<b>StREM</b> 1. 3 Remorin is a {{well-established}} plant raftophilic protein, predominantly associated with sterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane rafts. We recently identified a C-terminal domain (RemCA) required and sufficient for <b>StREM</b> 1. 3 anchoring to the plasma membrane. Here, we report {{a search for}} homologs and analogs of RemCA domain in publicly available protein sequence and structure databases. We could not identify RemCA homologous domains outside the Remorin family but we identified domains sharing bias in amino-acid composition and predicted structural fold with RemCA in bacterial, viral and animal proteins. These results suggest that RemCA emerged by convergent evolution among unrelated membrane binding domain...|$|E
