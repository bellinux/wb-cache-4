5|$|In a video {{posted on}} July 21, 2009, YouTube {{software}} engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos. The videos {{can be viewed}} in several different ways, including the common anaglyph (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect. The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a checkerboard pattern, <b>side-by-side</b> or anaglyph using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting <b>side-by-side</b> 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision.|$|E
5|$|The {{broadcast}} of the Olympic closing ceremony featured 1080p and <b>side-by-side</b> 1080i 3D on various TV channels and online.|$|E
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the standard MP 40 (sometimes erroneously called MP 40/II) with a dual <b>side-by-side</b> magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations troops on the Eastern Front to compensate for the enemies' PPSh-41 larger magazine capacity. However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut Wing was {{featured}} in the March 2007 edition of Civil Air Patrol Volunteer magazine for an event held at Hartford-Brainard Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, {{in conjunction with the}} Connecticut State Police, which provided volunteers <b>side-by-side</b> training with search-and-rescue dogs.|$|E
5|$|During the 7th week in Trinity Term, {{the boat}} club hosts the annual Oriel Regatta; events in this {{competition}} include <b>side-by-side</b> racing for eights, coxed fours, pairs and single sculls. The course runs upstream from the Longbridges Boathouse to past {{the end of}} boathouses on Christ Church Island and races are conducted in knock-out format.|$|E
5|$|Galactica {{features}} a dual-platform loading station, permitting three trains to operate simultaneously. Each train has seven cars, with each car carrying four riders <b>side-by-side</b> {{in a single}} row. This configuration allows for up to 1500 riders per hour.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} live {{sedentary}} {{people such as}} the Sara, the nation's main ethnic group, whose essential social unit is the lineage. In the Sahel sedentary peoples live <b>side-by-side</b> with nomadic ones, such as the Arabs, the country's second major ethnic group. The north is inhabited by nomads, mostly Toubous.|$|E
5|$|The 23rd Boat Race {{took place}} on the River Thames on 24 March 1866. The Boat Race is a <b>side-by-side</b> rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Oxford won by three lengths in a time of 25 minutes and 35 seconds, one of the slowest times {{in the history of the}} event.|$|E
5|$|The Linda Hall Library has {{digitized}} , one {{of which}} was , who marked salient passages by dog-earing the pages so that the corners acted as arrows. The books can be compared <b>side-by-side</b> to show what interested Newton.|$|E
5|$|The {{technical}} theater program offers college-level {{training in}} stage management, lighting, sound, and set and costume design. Each specialty has a lab {{for students to}} develop concepts and practice technique, and students work <b>side-by-side</b> with professional trades people in their chosen field.|$|E
5|$|After the film's release, several {{blogs and}} users of social media {{websites}} Twitter, Facebook and YouTube accused {{the director of}} plagiarism. Media further alleged that Basu had not tried to credit the original sources. Several videos were uploaded to YouTube showing <b>side-by-side</b> comparisons with Hollywood films like Cops, The Adventurer, City Lights, Singin' in the Rain, Project A, The Notebook and Benny & Joon. They also accused Barfi!s music director Pritam of copying the background music from the French film Amélie.|$|E
5|$|At the Pierre Levasseur Company in Paris, Nungesser and Coli, {{working closely}} with Chief Engineer Émile Farret and {{production}} manager Albert Longelot, assisted {{in the design of}} the new Levasseur PL.8 biplane. Based on the Levasseur PL.4 developed for the Aéronavale to operate from the French aircraft carrier Béarn, the PL.8 was a conventional, single-bay, wood and fabric-covered biplane that carried a crew of two in a <b>side-by-side,</b> open cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis is {{all that}} remains of a Devonian volcano that met a cataclysmic end in the Carboniferous period around 350 million years ago. Evidence near the summit shows light-coloured granite (which had cooled in {{subterranean}} chambers several kilometres beneath the surface) lies among dark basaltic lavas (that only form on the surface). The two lying <b>side-by-side</b> is evidence the huge volcano collapsed in on itself creating an explosion comparable to Thera (2nd millennium BC) or Krakatoa (1883).|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{coincides with}} the {{availability}} of water. In South America and South Africa, the main nesting period is December–February, in Nigeria it is July–December, and in North America mid-May–August. In India, the breeding season is from June to October but peaking in July and August. Fulvous whistling ducks show lifelong monogamy, although the courtship display is limited to some mutual head-dipping before mating and a short dance after copulation in which the birds raise their bodies <b>side-by-side</b> while treading water.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.4 was {{released}} on May 28, 2009, and the first HDMI 1.4 products were available {{in the second half}} of 2009. HDMI 1.4 added support for 4K×2K, i.e. 4096×2160 at 24Hz (which is a resolution used with digital theaters), 3840×2160 (Ultra HD) at 24Hz/25Hz/30Hz, and support for 1080p at 120Hz. It also added an HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC) which allows for a 100Mbit/s Ethernet connection between the two HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection, introduced an audio return channel (ARC), 3D Over HDMI, a new Micro HDMI Connector, an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC601, Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC601, and an Automotive Connection System. HDMI 1.4 defined several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative (interlaced), frame packing (a full resolution top-bottom format), line alternative full, <b>side-by-side</b> half, <b>side-by-side</b> full, 2D + depth, and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth (WOWvx). HDMI 1.4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24. High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI 1.3 work with all HDMI 1.4 features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel, which requires the new High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet defined in HDMI 1.4.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.4a was {{released}} on March 4, 2010, and adds two additional mandatory 3D formats for broadcast content, which was deferred with HDMI 1.4 {{in order to see}} the direction of the 3D broadcast market. HDMI 1.4a has defined mandatory 3D formats for broadcast, game, and movie content. HDMI 1.4a requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24, <b>side-by-side</b> horizontal at either 1080i50 or 1080i60, and top-and-bottom at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24.|$|E
5|$|In most cultures, {{persons with}} {{epilepsy}} have been stigmatized, shunned, or even imprisoned; in the Salpêtrière, {{the birthplace of}} modern neurology, Jean-Martin Charcot found people with epilepsy <b>side-by-side</b> with the mentally ill, those with chronic syphilis, and the criminally insane. In ancient Rome, epilepsy {{was known as the}} morbus comitialis ('disease of the assembly hall') and was seen as a curse from the gods. In northern Italy, epilepsy was once traditionally known as Saint Valentine's malady.|$|E
5|$|The 107th Boat Race {{took place}} on 1 April 1961. Held annually, the Boat Race is a <b>side-by-side</b> rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. The race which was delayed, the lead changed hands several times and an Oxford rower slumped and nearly {{fell out of the}} boat. It was won by Cambridge by four-and-a-quarter lengths in a time of 19 minutes 22 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The 37th Boat Race, {{an annual}} <b>side-by-side</b> rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames, {{took place on}} 22 March 1880 {{following}} a postponement two days earlier {{as a result of}} thick fog. It is the only {{time in the history of}} the event that the race has been rescheduled. Oxford won by a margin of three-and-three-quarter lengths in a time of 21 minutes 23 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The 38th Boat Race, {{an annual}} <b>side-by-side</b> rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames, {{took place on}} 8 April 1881. In a race umpired by Robert Lewis-Lloyd, Oxford won {{by a margin of}} three lengths in a time of 21 minutes 51 seconds taking the overall record to 2017 in their favour.|$|E
5|$|The USAF F-111A and Navy F-111B {{variants}} {{used the}} same airframe structural components and TF30-P-1 turbofan engines. They featured <b>side-by-side</b> crew seating in an escape capsule, {{as required by the}} Navy. Because of conflict between the Air Force and Navy over whose requirements had precedence, McNamara intervened in 1961, declaring that the Air Force desires would override suggestions by the Navy. The F-111A variant first flew on 21 December 1964 from Carswell AFB, Texas. It was followed by the F-111B, which first flew on 18 May 1965.|$|E
5|$|The {{landline}} telephones in most residential {{homes are}} analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage. Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel <b>side-by-side</b> with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} version at Six Flags Over Georgia features a dual-platform loading station, permitting three trains to operate simultaneously. Each train has seven cars, with each car carrying four riders <b>side-by-side</b> {{in a single}} row. The other two versions use a more standard single-platform loading station. While this allows a maximum of only two trains to operate at a time, each train compensates by having one additional row {{for a total of}} eight rows per train.|$|E
5|$|The superb fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, with pairs {{or groups of}} 3–5 birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. The group consists of a social pair {{with one or more}} male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, though they may not necessarily be the offspring of the main pair. These birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost <b>side-by-side</b> in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.|$|E
5|$|There {{are still}} intense areas of shadow which throw the Cumaean Sibyl into relief. But {{it is more}} than relief; it is the three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect to see {{in the work of the}} man who sculpted Moses. Critics of the {{restoration}} claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid <b>side-by-side</b> that were then worked over a secco to achieve this effect and that this is what has been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.|$|E
5|$|Andover Football Club {{was formed}} in 1883 and played their first game on 27October at Stride's Field, Weyhill Road, a {{friendly}} match against Basingstoke Mechanical Engineers. Three years later they moved to the Walled Meadow, where they played their home matches for the next 96years. For most of the next thirty years, the club competed in three separate small leagues which were run <b>side-by-side</b> during the space of each season; the Hampshire League, the Salisbury and District League, and the North Hants May League. During this time, Andover won the Salisbury League eight times, the North Hants May League five times and reached the Hampshire Junior Cup final twice.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Famicom's {{restricted}} hardware capabilities, the remake {{is entirely}} two-dimensional. Special compensation {{was made for}} some of the in-battle sprites such as Cloud Strife's, combining two 16x24 pixel sprites <b>side-by-side</b> instead of the usual single sprite to account for weapons such as Cloud's sword or Barret's gun. While most Japanese games use only 8x8-pixel hiragana or katakana fonts, and most Chinese games use 4-color 16x16-pixel tiles stored in dedicated CHR ROM pages, this game uses its own several-hundred 16x16-pixel monochrome font instead. The script itself is strewn in chunks across the code; {{at the beginning of each}} piece of text for dialog boxes is a three digit number preceded by an @-symbol, signifying which character portrait to display.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows <b>side-by-side,</b> and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Dugan {{produced}} the Model E, the E standing for economy. This half-rack-sized automixer was much smaller {{and less expensive}} than previous ones. It could be linked with another Model E to control up to 16 channels; two units could be mounted <b>side-by-side</b> in only 1U of rack space. The Model E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 the Model E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement to replace the Model E. It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT inputs and outputs. Its user interface was a simple web browser page, accessible by computer connected with Category 5 cable.|$|E
5|$|Pricing {{was central}} to the {{marketing}} strategy, {{as it had been}} through Sinclair's career. The ZX81 had been designed to meet a £70 price point and was launched at a price of £69.95 (built) or £49.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a <b>side-by-side</b> comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from £630 {{in the case of the}} Apple II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine.|$|E
5|$|The Canopus-class {{ships were}} {{powered by a}} pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam {{provided}} by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the <b>side-by-side</b> funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the Majestics.|$|E
5|$|The Ekaterina II {{class were}} {{a class of}} four battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. They were the first battleships built for the Black Sea Fleet. Their design was highly unusual in having the main guns on three barbettes grouped in a {{triangle}} around a central armored redoubt, two <b>side-by-side</b> forward {{and one on the}} centerline aft. This was intended to maximize their firepower forward, both when operating in the narrow waters of the Bosphorus and when ramming. Construction was slow because they were the largest warships built until then in the Black Sea and the shipyards had to be upgraded to handle them.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} such motif is the double {{crossover}} (DX) complex, which contains two Holliday junctions {{in close proximity}} to each other, resulting in a rigid structure that can self-assemble into larger arrays. The structure of the DX molecule forces the Holliday junctions to adopt a conformation with the double-helical domains directly <b>side-by-side,</b> in contrast to their preferred angle of about 60°. The complex can be designed to force the junctions into either a parallel or antiparallel orientation, but in practice the antiparallel variety are more well-behaved, and the parallel version is rarely used.|$|E
5|$|The {{variegated}} fairywren is {{a cooperative}} breeding species, with pairs or {{small groups of}} birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Though less studied than the superb- and splendid fairywrens, it is presumably socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, with each partner mating with other individuals. Females and males feed young equally, while helper birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost <b>side-by-side</b> in dense cover as well as engage in mutual preening. Occasionally larger groups of around 10 birds have been recorded, though {{it is unclear whether}} this was incidental or a defined flock.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main {{handwritten}} {{forms of the}} Deseret alphabet: a cursive version and a printed version. Over the lifetime of the alphabet, the cursive form fell out of favor among most users of the alphabet and by 1856 no more cursive documents exist. Its impact on the glyphs can however still be plainly seen in the loops of certain characters such as 𐑅, 𐑀 and 𐐼. The earliest surviving versions of the Deseret alphabet, from 1853 (one year before its January 1854 approval), have printed and cursive forms <b>side-by-side,</b> suggesting that a cursive form {{was part of the}} plan from the very beginning.|$|E
5|$|Though both of New York City's {{football}} teams play today across the Hudson River in MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, both teams started out {{playing in the}} Polo Grounds. The New York Giants played <b>side-by-side</b> with their baseball namesakes {{from the time they}} entered the National Football League in 1925, until crossing over to Yankee Stadium in 1956. The New York Jets, originally known as the Titans, started out in 1960 at the Polo Grounds, staying there for four seasons before joining the Mets in Queens in 1964.|$|E
