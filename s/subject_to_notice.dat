50|$|In {{neuroscience}} and psychophysics, {{an absolute}} threshold was originally {{defined as the}} lowest level of a stimulus - light, sound, touch, etc. - that an organism could detect. Under the influence of signal detection theory, absolute threshold has been redefined as the level at which a stimulus will be detected a specified percentage (often 50%) of the time. The absolute threshold can be influenced by several different factors, such as the subject's motivations and expectations, cognitive processes, and whether the subject is adapted to the stimulus.The absolute threshold can be compared to the difference threshold, which is the measure of how different two stimuli must be for the <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> that they are not the same.|$|E
5000|$|David Chalmers {{tries to}} show that even though mental content cannot be fully {{accounted}} for in functional terms, there is nevertheless a nomological correlation between mental states and functional states in this world. A silicon-based robot, for example, whose functional profile matched our own, {{would have to be}} fully conscious. His argument for this claim {{takes the form of a}} reductio ad absurdum. The general idea is that since it would be very unlikely for a conscious human being to experience a change in its qualia which it utterly fails to notice, mental content and functional profile appear to be inextricably bound together, at least in the human case. If the subject's qualia were to change, we would expect the <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice,</b> and therefore his functional profile to follow suit. A similar argument is applied to the notion of absent qualia. In this case, Chalmers argues that it would be very unlikely for a subject to experience a fading of his qualia which he fails to notice and respond to. This, coupled with the independent assertion that a conscious being's functional profile just could be maintained, irrespective of its experiential state, leads to the conclusion that the subject of these experiments would remain fully conscious. The problem with this argument, however, as Brian G. Crabb (2005) has observed, is that it begs the central question: How could Chalmers know that functional profile can be preserved, for example while the conscious subject's brain is being supplanted with a silicon substitute, unless he already assumes that the subject's possibly changing qualia would not be a determining factor? And while changing or fading qualia in a conscious subject might force changes in its functional profile, this tells us nothing about the case of a permanently inverted or unconscious robot. A subject with inverted qualia from birth would have nothing to notice or adjust to. Similarly, an unconscious functional simulacrum of ourselves (a zombie) would have no experiential changes to notice or adjust to. Consequently, Crabb argues, Chalmers' [...] "fading qualia" [...] and [...] "dancing qualia" [...] arguments fail to establish that cases of permanently inverted or absent qualia are nomologically impossible.|$|E

The Act requires insurers authorized to issue certain individual or group accident and sickness benefit plans, contracts, or policies, and nondental contracts with managed care plans to include, as part of any such plan renewed or entered into on or after July 1, 1998, coverage for one annual chlamydia screening test for covered females twenty-nine {{years of age or}} younger.

40|$|Bipartisan {{politics}} has prevented meaningful reform {{to a system}} {{in dire need of}} solutions: Immigration. Meanwhile there are eleven million noncitizens with no valid immigration status who currently reside in the United States and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not have the necessary resources to effect their removal. DHS does have the authority through prosecutorial discretion to prioritize these cases and provide relief to individuals with compelling circumstances that warrant humanitarian consideration; nonetheless, DHS’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion is underutilized, inconsistently applied and lacks transparency. This Article suggests a remedy – that the immigration prosecutor’s role should redefined to be one more akin to criminal prosecutors with a concomitant obligation to seek justice. Others have argued that DHS prosecutorial discretion should be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> and comment rulemaking and a presumption of judicial review. However, if prosecutorial discretion is to remain a solidly executive branch prerogative to counter legislation painted with too broad a brush (a defect of almost all legislation) and a mechanism to prioritize individuals for deportation, such as violent repeat criminal offenders, it should be shielded from rulemaking and a presumption of judicial review...|$|E
