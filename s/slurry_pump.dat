Four sequential steps are performed: data collection, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The main idea is to combine the predictions of multiple unsupervised classifiers fed with different inputs taken from different signals, based on fuzzy C-means clustering, to reduce the variance of the results so that they are less dependent on the specifics of a single classifier. This will also reduce the variance of the bias, because a combination of multiple classifiers may learn a more expressive concept class than a single classifier...|$|R

The shape resulted in a decrease in power consumption by the feed <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> by up to 10% and resulted in better jet formation that improved air entrainment. For coal applications, the wash water addition system was changed from a tray to stainless-steel circular rings attached to a manual lifting system. This allowed the flexibility of an easy transition from above-froth wash water addition to the in-froth addition that might be necessary for high concentrate-grade operations. For metals applications, new design wash water trays consisting of removable rubber mats for easy maintenance were used. [...] The AISE valves were developed to prevent solids being sucked back into the air lines when individual downcomers become blocked.

Oilsand froth is difficult to pump at very low speeds and at low temperatures. However above a certain speed in a steel pipe, water may separate and form a lubrication layer.

40|$|Slurry pumps, such as {{oil sand}} pumps, are widely used in {{industry}} to convert electrical energy to slurry potential and kinetic energy. Because of adverse working conditions, <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> impellers are prone to suffer wear, which may result in <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> breakdowns.

An approach to derive the performance behaviour of a vertical centrifugal pump used for transporting dredged slurry based on detail hydraulic loss analysis has been presented in this paper. The derived analytical data has been compared with experimental results. Performance analysis of a vertical submersible centrifugal <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> has been accomplished in two stages.

40|$|This report {{marks the}} fourth quarter of the third phase of the {{centrifugal}} <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> improvement program. The program was begun in 1982 to improve the operating life of centrifugal slurry pumps for coal liquefaction service. The first phase reviewed pilot plant experience with centrifugal slurry pumps and identified, {{with the help of a}} literature search, the critical design parameters and materials required for such improvement. The second phase encompassed extensive small-scale testing of several hydraulic design concepts and materials testing and selection - the results being incorporated in a prototype <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> design. This third phase of the work has included i) prototype <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> testing against a state-of-the-art coal liquefaction <b>slurry</b> <b>pump,</b> wherein substantial reduction of wear was obtained at 60 % higher speed at the same head and flow rate therefore at 60 % higher specific speed - and ii) an investigation as to whether still higher specific speed is possible. The prototype pump tested in (i) had a specific speed of 600. Another pump of this same design was re-fitted for investigation (ii) with a smaller impeller and associated liners so as to operate at a specific speed of 1000. Both the 600 and the 1000 impellers for this latter investigation (ii) were made of mild carbon steel to accelerate the testing time. The two pumps were run in series in the slurry test loop using AS {number_sign} 110 sand ({approximately} 110 mesh) at a concentration of 30 % by weight in water at 80 {degrees}F. As previously reported, 24 hours of test time revealed a slightly lower overall wear rate for the 1000 -specific-speed pump; however, excessive local wear occurred in the impeller eye area of that pump. This was attributed to too large a clearance between the pump-out vanes and the suction side of the volute liner. Wear elsewhere in the pump was uniform and comparable to that of the 600 -specific-speed prototype pump. 3 figs., 2 tabs...|$|E
