Pulse shape analysis is of paramount importance in neutron detectors, such as NEDA, based on scintillators that are sensitive to γ-rays as well. High resolution and high speed are often two parameters which conform a trade-off and it is hard to achieve both simultaneously. The aforementioned constraints and the urge of building new sampling electronics to improve the signal analysis in nuclear physics experiments, led to the development of this FADC mezzanine This involves sampling rates up to 250 Msps preserving a high resolution of 11. 3 effective bits in order to satisfy the experiment demands. In this work is described the design and the test bench proposed for a proper high speed ADC characterization system and the results obtained up to now...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} application of a Plasma Impedance Monitor (PIM) as a plasma diagnostic for use with RF plasmas, focusing on its potential use in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The plasma impedance monitor system was designed to measure the amplitude and phase of the first five Fourier components (harmonics) of the plasma voltage and current of RF plasma process reactors. The first two chapters of this thesis discuss Plasma and Plasma Process Reactors as commonly used {{in the manufacture of}} semiconductors. The most important parameters of a plasma in terms of materials processing are introduced as are the most common types of plasma process reactors and their characteristics. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the PIM hardware and its method of calibration In chapter 3, the RF sensor and waveform <b>sampling</b> <b>card,</b> known as the IV Sensor and RF Vector Integrator respectively, are discussed in detail. The technique of measuring the RF voltage and current using the IV Sensor and the unique waveform sampling technique used by the <b>sampling</b> <b>card</b> are explained. In chapter 4, the method of calibration for the IV Sensor and RF Vector Integrator are explained. Finally, the use of a Dynamic Dummy Load (DDL) to test the performance of the system is shown. Chapter 5 demonstrates the measurement repeatability and resolution of the PIM as used with a commercial plasma process reactor. In chapter 6 some applications of the PIM for use in the semiconductor manufacturing industry are explained and demonstrated. As the manufacture of integrated circuits becomes more complex due to the reduction in component size, improved control of the manufacturing processes becomes essential. Present day plasma processing tools provide real-time information such as RF power, chamber pressure, temperature, gas flow rate and gas composition that are used to control the process. However, the reduction in device geometry, the need for higher yield, and the high cost of equipment ownership means that engineers require tighter control of the process and must be able to diagnose process and machine faults quickly and efficiently. Plasma-based processing systems can be characterised by their RF electrical parameters and {{it has been shown that}} changes in process conditions such as RF power or matching efficiency can be correlated to variability in process results and wafer quality. The use of a plasma impedance monitor to measure and control the electrical properties of the RF discharge, and ultimately detect or predict process faults, can therefore become a most valuable process diagnostic...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of blood}} spot {{collection}} cards was investigated {{as a means}} of obtaining small volume samples for the analysis of therapeutic drugs for the purpose of neonatal pharmacokinetic studies. We describe the development of two micro-analytical methods for the determination of captopril extracted from dried blood spots (DBS). Firstly a liquid chromatography ion-trap mass spectrometry method with selected ion monitoring (LC-MS(SIM)) of target ion at m/z 218. 0 was developed to determine captopril levels in 8 mm discs punched from each DBS. This was compared in terms of specificity and sensitivity to a simple accurate mass liquid chromatography high resolution TOF mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method in which MS detection was carried out in electrospray positive ion mode for target ions at m/z 218. 0845 for captopril and 377. 2084 for the IS. Dithiothreitol was used both to pre-treat the sampling cards and as part of the extraction medium in order to stabilise the DBS extracted captopril. Drug extraction efficiency from spiked blood spots was demonstrated to be 90 ± 10 % and the drug was stable in DBS for at least 12 weeks. Validation of both micro-analytical methods showed good precision and accuracy and the LC-HRMS method was linear within the tested calibration range 10 - 400 ng/ml for captopril and had improved sensitivity and specificity compared to the LC-MS(SIM) method. This method was applied to blood spots on <b>sampling</b> <b>card</b> from a neonate patient previously administered 1 mg/kg captopril orally. The amount of captopril in the DBS was 88 ng/ml. Requiring only a micro volume (30 µl) blood sample for analysis, the developed DBS based micro-analytical method has the potential to facilitate pharmacokinetic studies of captopril in children...|$|E

40|$|Shipping {{influenza}} virus specimens, isolates or purified RNA is normally conducted at ultra-low temperatures using dry ice to ensure minimal {{degradation of the}} samples but this is expensive and requires special packaging and shipping conditions. Therefore, alternative methods for shipping {{influenza virus}}es or RNA at ambient temperatures would be desirable. The RNASound RNA <b>Sampling</b> <b>Card</b> (FortiusBio LLC, CA, USA) is a device that enables specimens or isolates {{to be applied to}} a card, whereby viruses are inactivated, while RNA is preserved and purified RNA can also easily be eluted. To evaluate this card, we applied influenza virus cell culture isolate supernatants to either the RNASound card or Whatman Grade No. 1 filter paper (GE Healthcare, NSW, Australia) and compared the preservation to that of material stored in liquid form. Preservation was tested using influenza A and B viruses at two different storage temperatures (cool 2 - 8 oC or room temperature 18 - 22 oC) and these were compared with control material stored at - 80 °C, for 7, 14 or 28 days. The quality of the RNA recovered was assessed using real time RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The RNASound card was effective in preserving influenza RNA at room temperature for up to 28 days, with only a minor change in real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold values for selected gene targets when comparing between viruses applied to the card or stored at - 80 °C. Similar results were obtained with filter paper, whilst virus in liquid form performed the worst. Nevertheless, as the RNASound card also has the capability to inactivate viruses in addition to preserving RNA at room temperature for many weeks, this makes it feasible to send samples to laboratories using regular mail, and thus avoid the need for expensive shipping conditions requiring biohazard containers and dry ice. Moreover, the quick and simple RNA recovery from the RNASound card allows recipient labs to obtain RNA without the need for special reagents or equipment...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of blood}} spot {{collection}} cards was investigated {{as a means}} of obtaining small volume samples for the quantification of therapeutic drugs for assessing medication adherence. A liquid chromatography-high resolution TOF mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method, based on the measurement at the accurate mass to charge ratio of the target analyte, was used to ensure specificity for atenolol in the dried blood spot (DBS) samples. A working method was developed and validated. For the preparation of DBS samples whole blood spiked with analyte was used to produce 30 µl blood spots on specimen collection cards. A 5 mm disc was cut from the dried blood spot and extracted using methanol: water (60 : 40, v/v) containing the internal standard, atenolol-d 7. Extracts were vortexed, sonicated and then centrifuged. Gradient chromatographic elution was achieved using an Ascentis Express C 18 100 x 2. 1 mm column and a mobile phase flow rate of 0. 2 ml/min and the column oven temperature at 30 °C. MS detection was carried out in electrospray positive ion mode for target ions at accurate mass m/z 267. 1703 for atenolol and 274. 2143 for the IS. Drug extraction efficiency from spiked blood spots was demonstrated to be 96 ± 5 % and the drug was stable in DBS for at least 10 weeks. The developed LC-HRMS method was linear within the tested calibration range of 25 - 1500 ng/ml and validation showed the accuracy (relative error) and precision (coefficient of variation) values were within the pre-defined limits of ≤ 15 % at all concentrations with a limit of quantification of 25 ng/ml. Factors with potential to affect drug quantification measurements such as the matrix effects, volume of blood applied onto the collection card and effect of different sampling cards were investigated. The developed LC-HRMS method was applied to blood spots on <b>sampling</b> <b>card</b> taken from adult healthy volunteers previously administered a 50 mg atenolol tablet and a DBS concentration-time profile was obtained for atenolol. Requiring only a micro volume (30 µl) blood sample for analysis, the developed DBS based assay has the potential to assess patient adherence to atenolol...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The Dried Blood Spot {{sampling}} (DBS) method gives {{patients and}} health care workers the opportunity for remote sampling using {{a drop of blood}} from a fingerprick on a <b>sampling</b> <b>card</b> which can be send to the laboratory by mail. Laboratory analysts frequently reject DBS samples because of poor sampling performance, which delays adequate monitoring of a patients‘ blood drug concentration. We developed a web-based application (Web-app) measuring the quality of DBS at the moment of sampling using a smartphone or computer. The patient takes a picture of the blood spot using a smartphone, uploads it into the Web-app and the Web-app determines the spot quality (sufficient or insufficient). When an insufficient spot is produced the Web-app asks the patient or health care worker to resample until a sufficient spot is produced. We hypothesize that the use of this app will reduce rejection rates of DBS samples in clinical practice. We aim to measure the performance of this Web-app before implementation of this app in clinical practice. Materials & Methods: The Dried Blood Spot App is a responsive web-based App accessible in the browser on smartphone, tablet or desktop pc. The app uses HTML 5, Javascript and CSS technology. The results of the app was compared to a golden standard consisting of the combined judgment of two analysts with extensive experience in DBS analysis. Based on rejection rates observed in clinical practice performance qualification was set at 95 % accurate evaluation. A samples size of at least 186 spots was required for qualification of the app. Samples were collected by a trained phlebotomist using the same sampling method the patients use at home. These samples were photographed and analyzed using the Web-app. Results: 221 samples were collected on 204 different cards from 181 different patients. The app showed a performance of 90. 0 % with 4. 1 % false positives and 5. 9 % false negatives. False negative results will lead to (unnecessary) patients resampling until a sufficient spot is created and therefore will not lead to delayed monitoring. False positives will lead to sending in insufficient quality spots by the patient leading to delayed monitoring. Conclusion: Although performance of 95 % was not met, the current version of the Web-app will lead to a rejection rate of 4. 1 % DBS samples and is feasible for clinical application. The app will be implemented in clinical practice in the near future...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Up to 30 % of {{international}} travelers {{are affected by}} travelers’ diarrhea (TD). Reliable data on the etiology of TD is lacking. Sufficient laboratory capacity at travel destinations is often unavailable and transporting conventional stool samples to the home country is inconvenient. We evaluated the use of Hemoccult <b>cards</b> for stool <b>sampling</b> combined with a multiplex PCR {{for the detection of}} model viral, bacterial, and protozoal TD pathogens. Methods. Following the creation of serial dilutions for each model pathogen, last positive dilution steps (LPDs) and thereof calculated last positive sample concentrations (LPCs) were compared between conventional stool <b>samples</b> and <b>card</b> <b>samples.</b> Furthermore, <b>card</b> <b>samples</b> were tested after a prolonged time interval simulating storage during a travel duration of up to 6 weeks. Results. The LPDs/LPCs were comparable to testing of conventional stool samples. After storage on Hemoccult cards, the recovery rate was 97. 6 % for C. jejuni, 100 % for E. histolytica, 97. 6 % for norovirus GI, and 100 % for GII. Detection of expected pathogens was possible at weekly intervals up to 42 days. Conclusion. Stool <b>samples</b> on Hemoccult <b>cards</b> stored at room temperature can be used in combination with a multiplex PCR as a reliable tool for testing of TD pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Smart cards play an {{important}} role in a digital society. A smart card contains memory or an embedded microprocessor with the capability of enabling a wide variety of services, such as electronic cash in the case of memory cards and digital signature computation in the case of processor cards. A processor card can require a cardholder to authenticate herself in order to prevent others from using the card's services, from forging the cardholder's signature, for example. Authentication can be done by storing a personal identification number (PIN) or digitized fingerprint of the cardholder on the card itself. The PIN or fingerprint must always remain confidential no matter how the card is (ab) used. This thesis addresses the problem of preserving the privacy of information stored on smart cards. Volpano and Smith have developed a static analysis for analyzing source code for information flow violations. This technique is developed further here for a language called Java Card, in which smart card applications are written. A prototype analyzer is presented for a subset of Java Card and applied to a <b>sample</b> <b>card</b> application to demonstrate its utility in protecting private information stored on smart cards.
