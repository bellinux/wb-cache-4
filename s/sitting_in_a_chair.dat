When Sam tells Norman they've come to question his mother, he knocks Sam out and rushes to the house. Lila sees Norman approaching and hides by going down steps {{that lead to the}} fruit cellar. There she finds Mrs. Bates <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair.</b> Lila turns her around and discovers that she is in fact a mummified corpse.

5|$|Two statues {{erected in}} the 19th century {{have since been}} removed. One of Edward Jenner, pioneer of the {{smallpox}} vaccine, {{was set up in}} the south-west corner of the square in 1858, next to that of Napier. Sculpted by William Calder Marshall, it showed Jenner <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> in a relaxed pose, and was inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by Prince Albert. It was moved to Kensington Gardens in 1862. The other, of General Charles George Gordon by Hamo Thornycroft, was erected on an 18-foot high pedestal between the fountains in 1888. It was removed in 1943 and re-sited on the Victoria Embankment ten years later.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts off}} with a cable car looking over a large city (Barcelona, from the West looking East) while a German {{newscast}} featuring Alexander von Roon plays on TV and switches to a luxurious-looking hotel in Plaça de Catalunya with Elena Anaya taking off her sweater. It then cuts to Timberlake in a different room; then to a club scene and Timberlake {{in front of a}} white background. The video alternates between those four viewpoints, with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club. At a certain point, Timberlake goes over to Anaya's room by jumping over to her balcony. Then when Anaya goes to check it out, Timberlake traps and passionately has sex with her. In the club, it ends with Timberlake kissing Anaya in a bathroom stall. In the hotel room scene, Timberlake leaves by the same way he entered and moments later jumps to the next balcony before an explosion ensues. It ends with the figure of Anaya <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> beside a small television in which a kiss is frozen on the screen.|$|E
5|$|Upon his return, Edge {{began to}} show some villainous {{characteristics}} centering on his obsession for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge, Chris Benoit, and Shawn Michaels received a title shot for Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday in October 2004. Michaels won the audience vote to receive the title shot, giving Edge and Benoit a tag team title shot. During the match, an angry Edge abandoned his partner (although Benoit managed to win the title on his own) and instead interfered in the main event, costing Michaels the championship. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Edge and Benoit lost the World Tag Team Championship with Edge abandoning Benoit again and <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> and watching the match. After {{the conclusion of the}} match, Edge attacked Benoit, officially turning heel {{for the first time since}} 2001. Edge then adopted a drastically different gimmick, becoming a crazed and brash villain in the process. At Survivor Series, Edge was part of Team Triple H along with Triple H, Batista and Snitsky. They were defeated by Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven). During the match, Edge eliminated both Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho before getting eliminated by Randy Orton.|$|E

25|$|The single's {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Herb Ritts. The music video features two parts which frequently interchange back and forth throughout the song. The {{first part of the}} video shows Lopez having a small party in her home with guests including Ja Rule and Ashanti. This part of the video is {{from the point of view}} of the guy who is being mentioned in the song. His face is not seen, and Lopez addresses the camera throughout this section of the video. This section begins with the guy knocking on the door, Lopez inviting him in, and then eventually showing him the door when she sees him attempting to look/flirt with other women at the party. As he leaves, she goes on entertaining the other guests. The second part of the video involves scenes with Lopez, Ja Rule and Cadillac tah in a white room, Ja Rule in a recording studio in Lopez's home, Lopez <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> singing bits of the song, and Lopez and Ja Rule singing the parts of the final verse against a gold backdrop.|$|E

25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E
500|$|In {{the video}} Usher {{and his love}} {{interest}} simulate sexual intercourse, with the woman maintaining dominance, echoing the song's theme. Interspersed are scenes of him playing the song on a transparent piano, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> singing and dancing against a brick backdrop. In some of the sex scenes the camera is rotated 180 degrees, so that an illusion is given from Usher being [...] "on the top" [...] to being [...] "on the bottom".|$|E
500|$|Many of {{his works}} are {{dedicated}} to famous events in Polish history. Matejko was focusing on major themes in Polish history and using historical sources to paint events in minute historical detail. [...] His earliest paintings are simple historical paintings with no hidden messages. The later ones, starting with the painting Stańczyk (1862), are intended to inspire the viewers with a patriotic message. Stańczyk focuses on the court jester, portrayed {{as a symbol of}} country's conscience, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> in the background of a party - a sole figure reflecting on the war, ignored by the joyful crowd.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Suga Mama" [...] was released to British music channels in April 2007. It {{was shot in}} black-and-white and was co-directed by Melina Matsoukas alongside Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month; [...] "Suga Mama" [...] was one of eight videos shot in two weeks for the video album. It begins with Knowles <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> wearing men's clothing and smoking a cigar. She gets up and begins to pole dance. The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing {{on top of a}} sugar cube, dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed, lying in a circle of light, and riding a mechanical bull. Knowles said she is meant to [...] "slowly become a woman" [...] during the video, adding [...] "Well, a sexier woman – I'm always a woman." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} premiered on May 19, 1995, through MTV. It {{features}} Madonna, her dancers, and her chihuahua Chiquita in black leather and latex outfits. The S inspired outfits were {{to symbolize the}} [...] "breaking out of the restraints" [...] as the lyrics described. Her hair, which appears brown in the video was actually blonde at the time. She had leather strips painstakingly braided into her hair to blend with her dark roots. The frizzy afro she sports halfway through the video was actually a hairpiece. During {{the middle of the}} video, Madonna and her dancers appear in a series of boxes, trying to break free. Another sequence shows the singer being thrown around within a series of ropes managed by her dancers. As the video concludes there is a shot of Madonna <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> looking straight into the camera as she says the line [...] "Absolutely no regrets!". Then there is a brief shot of her standing next to the chair as she boxes into the air.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Hilson {{lounging}} in her bed. Upset by her partner, she {{walks over to}} the closet and rips down all of his clothes. The video then cuts to Hilson <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> at a beauty salon, where she gets a new haircut and dyes her hair from black to blonde. She later begins a choreographed routine with her girlfriends, who appear to also have been mistreated by their men. The women then march down Auburn Avenue before they head home to throw their men's clothes off the balcony. The video received mixed to positive reviews. Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy was positive and called it a [...] "beautifully shot portrait of a woman {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown", and The Fader writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd regarded it as an accurate representation of how women act when they are [...] "wronged by dudes". On the other hand, Robbie Daw of Idolator deemed it tiresome, calling it a [...] "visual snoozefest". He wrote, [...] " [...] goes to a salon, orders up Rihanna's Rated R haircut and sasses men who are wrongin' the ladies. Hey, girls—her love has a limit! But so does our patience for this [...]" ...|$|E
