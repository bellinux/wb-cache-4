5|$|In week 6, {{head coach}} <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> benched Munnerlyn {{for the first}} series of the game against Ole Miss due to Munnerlyn missing class and team weightlifting sessions. Against Kentucky, Munnerlyn {{returned}} a kickoff 84yards before being tackled on the 16yard line. On the next play quarterback Stephen Garcia completed a touchdown pass to Kenny McKinley.

5|$|A {{four-year}} {{starting quarterback}} at Mississippi Valley State University, Dickinson {{was drafted by}} the Buccaneers in the seventh round of the 1976 NFL Draft. He served as the backup quarterback behind <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> his rookie season, and saw playing time in eight games, including one start against the Miami Dolphins. His season ended after suffering an injury {{in a game against}} the Cleveland Browns. He recovered from the injury and tried to make the team in 1977, but was cut, ending his career. After retiring, he became a high school offensive coordinator in Tampa.|$|E
50|$|Myles {{accepted}} an athletic scholarship {{to attend the}} University of Florida, where he played for coach Galen Hall and coach <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> Florida Gators football teams from 1987 to 1990.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the growing}} trouble, the Buccaneers managed to beat <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> {{slumping}} Redskins. Brad Johnson threw four touchdown passes, and Derrick Brooks iced {{the game with}} a 44-yard interception return touchdown.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{other college}} and {{professional}} sports teams, the Gators do not currently have any retired jersey numbers. Although <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> (11) and Scot Brantley's (55) numbers were once retired, Spurrier reissued them as head coach.|$|R
5|$|Nevada coach Chris Ault was one {{of three}} members of the College Football Hall of Fame to lead a team into a bowl game, along with Barry Alvarez (Wisconsin interim coach) and <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> (South Carolina). Nevada's senior {{receiver}} Brandon Wimberly had caught a pass in all 39 games of his college career. This was the Wolf Pack's second New Mexico Bowl; they had previously played in the 2007 edition (then {{as a member of the}} Western Athletic Conference), losing to the hometown New Mexico Lobos by a score of 23-0.|$|E
5|$|The Oakland Raiders, with an NFL-best 11–1 record, {{scored three}} {{touchdown}}s before the Buccaneers got their third first down. Mark van Eeghen scored on two 1-yard runs. A 2-yard Ed Williams touchdown run tied the score at 7–7 after the Buccaneers recovered a fumble at the Oakland 14-yard {{line in the}} first quarter. A Dave Green field goal made the score 21–10 at halftime, but Ken Stabler threw for two third-quarter touchdowns for the Raiders. <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> finished the Buccaneers’ scoring with a fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Morris Owens. Dewey Selmon suffered a serious knee injury, the Buccaneers’ 14th of the season, on the first play of the game.|$|E
5|$|Two fumbles deep in New England Patriots {{territory}} overcame {{a stubborn}} Buccaneer effort. The Patriots’ 260 rushing yards stood {{for years as}} the most allowed in a game by the Buccaneers, while their total of four pass completions remains the least by a Tampa Bay opponent. New England came from behind twice on Andy Johnson touchdown runs, and took the lead for good on Sam Hunt’s 58-yard return of a <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> interception. Johnson’s first touchdown run was a 69-yarder that set a club record. Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan set an NFL record with four seconds left, rushing for his 12th touchdown of the year. The Buccaneers also set an NFL record, by becoming the only team to go winless in a 14-game season.|$|E
5000|$|Mills {{accepted}} an athletic scholarship in 1986 {{to attend the}} University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, {{where he was a}} four-year letterman for coach Galen Hall and coach <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> Florida Gators football teams from 1987 to 1990.|$|R
50|$|Lattimore {{enrolled}} in the University of South Carolina, where he played for coach <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> South Carolina Gamecocks football team from 2010 to 2012. A highly sought-after college recruit, he made an immediate impact for the Gamecocks as a freshman.|$|R
50|$|Jackson {{accepted}} a football scholarship {{to attend the}} University of Florida in Gainesville, where he played for coach <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> Florida Gators football team from 1990 to 1993.

5|$|Youngblood, who is {{regarded}} {{by some as}} the best defensive end in Gators history, {{was named to the}} All-time Florida Gators team in 1983, and in 1999 he was voted to the Florida Gator All-Century Team. In 2006, he was named to the 100-year Anniversary Gator Team. In 1975, Youngblood was voted to the Florida Sports Hall of Fame which features great athletes who played college or professional athletics and have a Florida connection. In 2001, {{he was elected to the}} University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame. Five years later, in 2006, Youngblood was among the first four Gator legends to be inducted into the Florida Football Ring of Honor, alongside <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier,</b> Danny Wuerffel, and Emmitt Smith.|$|E
5|$|A blocked {{field goal}} and extra-point attempt {{provided}} {{the margin of}} victory for the Miami Dolphins. Ex-Dolphin receiver Morris Owens came back to haunt his old team with three touchdown catches. Starting quarterback Parnell Dickinson threw the first, then was replaced by recently acquired quarterback Terry Hanratty after injuring his ankle. When Hanratty proved ineffective, <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier,</b> who had not practiced during the week due to a swollen knee, came off the bench to throw the final two touchdowns. It took a final-minute, 55-yard Garo Yepremian field goal to clinch the game for the Dolphins, whose pass defense had been decimated by injuries. 192 of the Buccaneers’ 334 total yards came through the air. John McKay would later point to this game as {{the high point of}} the Buccaneers’ season. Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti saw it differently, calling the narrow victory “a disgrace” and “the low point in Miami Dolphins’ history”.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} college, Dickinson was {{selected}} by the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 183rd overall pick in the seventh round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Buccaneers' head coach John McKay said that Dickinson was considered the second best prospect on his draft board behind Richard Todd. <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> had the starting job wrapped up when he was signed to the team, {{and as a result}} Dickinson spent the offseason competing for a backup quarterback spot alongside Bill Cappleman and James Foote. Dickinson started off training camp by throwing the hardest passes of the four quarterbacks, and had a few accuracy issues in the process. Dickinson served as the second-string quarterback throughout the preseason. In a game against the Green Bay Packers, he led the Buccaneers to their first touchdown as a team. By the end of preseason, his place was on the roster was solidified behind Spurrier, as Cappleman and Foote were cut and replaced by Gary Valbuena and Larry Lawrence.|$|E
5000|$|George {{accepted}} an athletic scholarship {{to attend the}} University of Florida, where he played for coach <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> Florida Gators football team from 1995 to 1998.

50|$|Carolina {{had their}} first spring {{practice}} on March 21, 2008. It {{was the first of}} 15 spring practice sessions for the Gamecocks, who return 54 lettermen in <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> fourth season. The annual Garnet & Black Spring Game is scheduled for 1:00 p.m., Saturday, April 19.|$|R
50|$|Ingram {{attended}} the University of South Carolina, {{where he played}} for coach <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> South Carolina Gamecocks football team from 2008 to 2011. He played linebacker for the Gamecocks before switching to defensive end. As a junior in 2010, he led the team with nine sacks.|$|R
5|$|Strong first-half play {{left the}} Buccaneers tied 7–7 with the Cleveland Browns at halftime, but {{they failed to}} {{maintain}} the intensity {{for the second half}} of the game. A screen pass from <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> to Essex Johnson caught the blitzing Cleveland linebackers out of position for a 13-yard touchdown. The solid blocking of the first half gave way to the Cleveland rush in the second half, and Spurrier was replaced with Parnell Dickinson in the fourth quarter. Dickinson wound up leaving the game with a season-ending knee injury on a play in which he threw an interception to Terry Brown. Two Browns players were ejected for fighting, in a game in which several Buccaneers complained of cheap shots being taken. Dave Pear said, “If I had a gun, I would have shot them both in the head”, of two Cleveland players who tried to take out his knees.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 and 2001 seasons brought South Carolina back to {{national}} prominence with consecutive Outback Bowl wins over Ohio State and season ending rankings in the Top 25. However, after going 5–7 {{the following two}} seasons and suffering a season-ending blowout in 2003 by intrastate rival Clemson, Skip was demoted from the offensive coordinator and assistant head coaching positions to quarterbacks coach. Four assistant coaches—including the team's defensive coordinator—were fired in the same shakeup that saw Skip demoted. On November 22, 2004, one season after Skip's demotion, Lou Holtz announced he was retiring as head coach of South Carolina. The next day, South Carolina announced <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> as the next head football coach. Coach Spurrier {{announced that he was}} keeping only three members of Lou Holtz's staff. Letters were sent to all the other staffers—including Skip Holtz—informing them that they likely would not be retained.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers signed their first-ever {{free agents}} in January: former Birmingham Americans and Nebraska guard Tom Alward, Denver Broncos and Notre Dame {{defensive}} end Pete Duranko, and Chicago Bears wide receiver Wayne Wheeler. Having not selected a {{quarterback in the}} veteran allocation draft, they addressed that need in their first-ever trade, a deal to get local favorite <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> from the San Francisco 49ers. The former Heisman Trophy winner was obtained for a second-round draft choice {{and two of the}} veteran draftees, Bruce Elia and Willie McGee. An earlier attempt to obtain a quarterback failed when the team sent a future draft pick to the Saints for backup quarterback Larry Cipa, only to waive him when he failed his physical. The Buccaneers also used a third-round pick to obtain defensive back Mike Washington from the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5000|$|Florida beat rival Georgia 33 - 26. In {{constant}} rain, {{the usually}} prolific passing game of coach <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> Gators was stymied. [...] Instead, the Gators relied on tailback Errict Rhett to amass 183 {{yards and two}} touchdowns to build a 33 - 26 fourth-quarter lead.|$|R
50|$|As ACC champions, the Terps {{earned a}} {{berth in the}} Orange Bowl to face <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> #5 Florida out of the SEC, in a BCS match-up. The Gators beat the Terrapins with a lop-sided result (56-23). Thus, Maryland ended the post-season with a 10-2 record, ranked #10 in the nation.|$|R
5000|$|Carter {{accepted}} an athletic scholarship {{to attend the}} University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, {{where he was a}} four-year letterman for coach <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> Florida Gators football team from 1991 to 1994. [...] During his four seasons as a Gator, the team won three Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1991, 1993, 1994).|$|R
5|$|The (as McKay {{liked to}} point out, undefeated) team made their game debut against the Los Angeles Rams in an {{exhibition}} at the Los Angeles Coliseum on July 31, losing 26-3. McKay called the players’ performance “unaggressive, uninspiring, lethargic, and unacceptable”, and cut 15 players one day prior to the following Tuesday’s cutdown date. McKay {{was pleased with the}} following week’s improved performance against the Green Bay Packers, a 10–6 loss in which a late interception of a Parnell Dickinson pass prevented a likely Buccaneer victory. After the Packers referred to them as the “Tampa Buccaneers”, the Buccaneers threatened to introduce the “Green Packers” at their next meeting. The Buccaneers’ first victory came in a 17–3 preseason win over the favored Atlanta Falcons, in which they scored on runs by <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> and Essex Johnson, and a Mirro Roder field goal. Although the win had no official significance, it raised optimism among fans, particularly due to the team’s defensive performance. McKay himself was puzzled, unsure whether the win was due to a superior performance by Tampa Bay, or a lack of effort by the Falcons. Their home debut came in a 28–21 loss to the Miami Dolphins, in front of a crowd of 71,718, a crowd which Dolphins owner Joe Robbie said proved his longtime prediction that a Bay Area team would be a success.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I thought you said you were going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas City Chiefs {{credited}} {{their defense}} with the win after holding the Buccaneers to 14 yards rushing. The Buccaneers managed only 2 first downs and 34 yards of total offense before exploding for three {{touchdowns in the}} final ten minutes. The Buccaneers were mistake-prone and ineffective throughout the first three quarters. Ken Stone was penalized for roughing on a missed field goal in the first quarter, {{with the result that}} the Chiefs got a second chance to kick it. The special teams allowed Henry Marshall to return a punt 59 yards, setting up the Chiefs’ second touchdown. They got 14 first downs and 162 yards in the final 15 minutes, scoring on an Essex Johnson run and passes from <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier</b> to Johnny McKay and Jack Novak. Coach McKay felt that the difference was that the team did not begin giving effort until the fourth quarter. McKay also felt that the Chiefs left themselves vulnerable by trying to run up the score. Bert Cooper, filling in at linebacker for an injured Steve Reese, was consistently exploited in the passing game. McKay later threatened to fire players who he felt were giving a slack effort, specifically referring to a Chiefs kickoff that rolled {{all the way to the}} 4-yard line, with no Buccaneers trying to recover it. Spectators booed the team, and one threw a dead bird at Spurrier as he returned to the locker room after the game. Buccaneer defenders found some consolation in having held the AFC’s top offensive team to only 13 points. Defensive end Council Rudolph played, despite the death of his father the previous evening.|$|E
5000|$|The 1991 Florida Gators {{football}} team represented the University of Florida during the 1991 NCAA Division I-A football season. The season was <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> second {{as the head}} coach of the Florida Gators {{football team}}. The Gators were led by quarterback Shane Matthews and first-team All-American defensive tackle Brad Culpepper.|$|R
5000|$|McNabb {{accepted}} an athletic scholarship {{to attend the}} University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Galen Hall and coach <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> Florida Gators football teams from 1988 to 1991. [...] During McNabb's senior season in 1991, the Gators won their first official Southeastern Conference (SEC) football championship.|$|R
50|$|He {{then left}} for the University of Florida, and landed a three-year stint as <b>Steve</b> <b>Spurrier's</b> {{defensive}} coordinator. Hired after Florida gave up 62 points to Nebraska in the 1996 Fiesta Bowl, he was given full powers over the Gators defense and {{was part of the}} Gators' national championship win over Florida State in the 1997 Sugar Bowl.|$|R
