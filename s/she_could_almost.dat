2500|$|Independent music magazine, American Songwriter, {{called the}} album [...] "Dark, piano-driven [...] spectacularly unique", {{crediting}} Amos with offering up something [...] "gothic, inspired and winter-y." [...] Billboard noted, [...] "Amos reaches {{deep into the}} world of carols for ancient and less obvious fare that she subsequently recasts on string-laden songs," [...] praising the album, finally, as [...] "a typically provocative-in the best possible way-entry in the yuletide canon." [...] The New York Times noted, [...] "Gorgeously recorded and impeccably produced, [...] dwells in hymn-like serenity and diaphonous wonder." [...] The London Evening Standard also considered the album a success, stating, [...] " [...] fills [...] with harpsichord and subdued strings as well as her crisp, icicle voice. There's an ancient sound to [...] tracks...and again, a deliberate avoidance of anything cheery enough to be played over the Asda tannoy." [...] The Guardian, which gave the album 4/5 stars, noted enthusiastically, [...] "Centre stage is given to her voice and the simple arrangements," [...] adding, [...] "Amos sounds so tranquil <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> be floating, but the stateliness of the orchestral backing keeps the songs grounded. You'd never know this was recorded [...] summer, so vividly does it evoke crunching snow and frosty nights." [...] They summized, [...] "Accordingly, it's her most touching album in years." [...] BBC Music exclaimed, [...] "'Midwinter Graces' has an appealing skip in its step... When it slows, it can do so with an understated elegance that Amos has only sporadically summoned during the 00s." [...] The Digital Fix called it [...] "perhaps the most straightforward album, both musically and lyrically that [...] has ever produced." ...|$|E
60|$|She was trembling, and yet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have {{smiled at}} this well-remembered trick of pertinacity.|$|E
60|$|Marjorie {{felt she}} had to hurry. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> feel the feet of Theodore coming up that tower.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, my dear Harry, Polly would as soon {{think of}} marrying {{the man in}} the moon as Charley Horton. Why, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> marry <b>almost</b> any one she liked, and she does nothing but make fun of him." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{first she}} studied and studied every {{clump of grass}} and every bush behind which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> creep. <b>She</b> saw that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get <b>almost</b> to where Peter Rabbit was sitting and never once show herself to him. Then she looked this way and looked that {{way to make sure}} that no one was {{watching}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{have spoken}} to you {{at least three times}} without getting an answer, Tony,” <b>she</b> said. “One <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> fancy that you had {{something}} on your mind to‐night.” ...|$|R
6000|$|As Louisa read on, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> hear Lord Radclyffe's whispered words, whilst {{she herself}} sang Tosti's melancholy song: [...] "Good-bye!" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{another moment}} he was off his horse, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have adored him when she heard him {{pronounce}} that Frederick lived.|$|E
60|$|Patricia {{thanked her}} aunt with eager words, and said, as indeed she felt, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> love Aunt Jane for her final, if dilatory, act of justice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am so glad!" [...] said <b>she,</b> [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> rejoice {{that his}} uncle cheated {{him out of}} his property. He is to be factor of Gordon's Pride?" ...|$|R
50|$|The Boswell Sisters sang {{together}} until 1936 when Vet and Martha retired {{to begin their}} married lives. In addition to singing, she also played piano accompaniment {{on most of the}} Sisters recordings and was a gifted concert pianist as well. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> play <b>almost</b> anything with keys. Rag and blues entered Martha's musical vocabulary at an early age.|$|R
6000|$|Tony was not {{devoid of}} a certain cunning, and the boldness of the {{question}} had its effect, but the girl’s eyes gleamed as <b>she</b> said, “I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> as soon believe you guilty as Bernard Appleby.” ...|$|R
60|$|Marguerite {{felt as if}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> {{hear them}} talking it over and vowing that she should not escape, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel should soon be captured.|$|E
60|$|Brooke stood still, {{looking at}} her with signs of struggle, and, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> fancy, passion, in his set face; and then made a little gesture, which seemed to imply that he had borne enough.|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} see Chauvelin, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> feel those keen, pale eyes of his fixed maliciously upon her {{helpless}} form, and his hurried, whispered words reached her ear, as the death-knell of her last faint, lingering hope.|$|E
50|$|On December 19, 2010, actress Marilu Henner was {{featured}} on the US television program 60 Minutes for her superior autobiographical memory ability. Henner claimed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> remember <b>almost</b> every day of her life since she was 11 years old. The show was initially pitched as a story featuring hyperthymestic violinist Louise Owen, but the reporter Lesley Stahl volunteered her friend Henner as having a similar ability.|$|R
5000|$|Isaac Anderson in The New York Times Book Review (5 March 1933) wrote: [...] "The {{stories are}} slight in structure, but they present some very pretty {{problems}} and introduce us to some truly interesting people. Miss Marple ... is {{in a class}} by herself. She does not call herself a detective, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> give <b>almost</b> any of the regular sleuths cards and spades and beat him at his own game." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{proved to}} be so indeed, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> still blush, <b>almost,</b> to show it. [...] "I make out now what he must have done at school." [...] And she gave, in her simple sharpness, an almost droll disillusioned nod. [...] "He stole!" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> {{have been}} sorry {{that the various}} arrivals kept the {{domestic}} establishments of both houses so fully occupied! Poor Tom! {{she had been a}} long time without hearing of him! and a hero was turning up on her hands! ...|$|E
60|$|Lucy went {{closer to}} the {{stallion}} so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> touch him. He saw her. He was nearly choked. Foam and blood wheezed out with his heaves. She must do something quickly. And in her haste she pricked her arms and shoulders on the cactus.|$|E
6000|$|O yes! Rosa shyly thought so. O yes, Rosa shyly {{believed}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> {{answer for}} it. But should she ask Mr. Crisparkle? ‘I think your {{authority on the}} point as good as his, my dear,’ said Helena, sedately, ‘and you needn’t disappear again for that.’ Odd of Helena! ...|$|E
60|$|Over these uplands, {{through these}} {{thickets}} of hazel brush, and around these coverts of popple, Burton and I careered, hunting the cows, chasing rabbits, killing rattlesnakes, watching the battles of bulls, racing the half-wild colts and pursuing the prowling wolves. It was an alluring life, and Harriet, who rode with us occasionally, {{seemed to enjoy}} it quite {{as much as any}} boy. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> ride <b>almost</b> as well as Burton, and we were all expert horse-tamers.|$|R
60|$|The class-teaching {{itself at}} last became almost mechanical. It was {{a strain on}} her, an {{exhausting}} wearying strain, always unnatural. But {{there was a certain}} amount of pleasure in the sheer oblivion of teaching, so much work to do, so many children to see after, so much to be done, that one's self was forgotten. When the work had become like habit to her, and her individual soul was left out, had its growth elsewhere, then <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be <b>almost</b> happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you been}} many voyages with Captain Jenness before this?" [...] asked Lydia, as she set open her trunk, {{and began to}} lay her dresses out on the locker. Homesickness, like all grief, attacks in paroxysms. One gust of passionate regret had swept over the girl; before another came, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> occupy herself <b>almost</b> cheerfully with the details of unpacking.|$|R
60|$|Carley sat {{up before}} Glenn and Flo reached her. Manifestly they were {{concerned}} about her, but both were ready to burst with laughter. Carley knew she was not hurt and she was so glad to be off the mustang that, on the moment, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have laughed herself.|$|E
60|$|Violet, therefore, retreated, {{hoping that}} now {{there might be}} an opening for sympathy, some {{depression}} that would allow her to show her fellow-feeling; but no: when they met again Theodora was as cheerful and disengaged as ever, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have persuaded herself that these tears had been a dream.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have smiled; {{he was at}} once so well {{pleased that}} she and his 'goodly heritage' should belong to each other, so {{confident}} in her love and good intentions towards it, and so doubtful of her discretion and management. She promised with all her heart to do her utmost to fulfil his wishes.|$|E
60|$|In another cabin I found {{women and}} {{children}} only, {{and one of the}} children was in the last stage of illness. But nevertheless the woman of the house seemed glad to see me, and talked cheerfully as long as I would remain. She inquired {{what had happened to the}} vessel, but it had never occurred to her to go out and see. Her cabin was neat and well furnished, and there also I saw newspapers and Harper's everlasting magazine. She said it was a coarse, desolate place for living, but that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> raise <b>almost</b> anything in her garden.|$|R
60|$|Louisa {{left alone}} in the sitting room, {{in front of the}} cheery fire, sat down for a moment on the sofa and rested her head against the cushions. There was memory even in that, for when she closed her eyes, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> imagine that Luke was sitting {{at the foot of the}} sofa; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see him <b>almost,</b> with his eyes turned ever toward her, and that quaint gesture of his when he passed his hand over the back of his neatly groomed head.|$|R
60|$|Poor Miss Thorne. She {{heard all}} this and yet did not quite swoon. She made {{her way through the}} crowd as best <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> sick herself <b>almost</b> to death. Oh, his mother--his poor mother! How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> ever forgive herself. The agony of that moment was terrific. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> hardly get to the place where the poor lad was lying, as three or four men in front were about the horse, which had risen with some difficulty, but at last she found herself close to the young farmer.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Thornbury made {{a little}} exclamation, drew her lips together, and the tears rose in her eyes. Through them {{she looked at the}} hall which was now laid with great breadths of sunlight, and at the careless, casual groups of people who were {{standing}} beside the solid arm-chairs and tables. They looked to her unreal, or as people look who remain unconscious that some great explosion is about to take place beside them. But there was no explosion, and they went on standing by the chairs and the tables. Mrs. Thornbury no longer saw them, but, penetrating through them as though they were without substance, she saw the house, the people in the house, the room, the bed in the room, and the figure of the dead lying still in the dark beneath the sheets. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> see the dead. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> hear the voices of the mourners.|$|E
60|$|But if the {{fortnight}} {{was to be}} like this, how was Arthur to bear it? Violet dreaded it for him {{the more}} {{because he was so}} very good and forbearing, not making one remark on what she knew must have struck him. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> have reproached herself with selfishness in never having thought of his want of companionship and amusement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me! I {{should be}} quite {{in the way}}. But, perhaps--I may be equally in the way here. Miss Woodhouse looks {{as if she did}} not want me. My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> say the same. What am I to do?" ...|$|E
60|$|He looked wonderingly at {{the girl}} beside him. He {{had spent most of}} his life among educated and cultured people. He had passed several years in the backwoods. But with all his {{experience}} with people he had to confess that this young woman was as a revelation to him. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> ride like an Indian and shoot like a hunter. He had heard that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> run <b>almost</b> as swiftly as her brothers. Evidently she feared nothing, for he had just seen an example of her courage in a deed that had tried even his own nerve, and, withal, she was a bright, happy girl, earnest and true, possessing all the softer graces of his sisters, and that exquisite touch of feminine delicacy and refinement which appeals more to men than any other virtue.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} excited because these men {{attended}} {{to her when}} she came near. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> make their eyes light up and quiver, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make Anthony, the eldest, twist and twist his moustache. <b>She</b> knew <b>she</b> <b>could</b> move them <b>almost</b> at will with her light laughter and chatter. They loved her ideas, watched her as she talked vehemently about politics or economics. And she, while she talked, saw the golden-brown eyes of Anthony gleam like the eyes of a satyr as they watched her. He did not listen to her words, he listened to her. It excited her.|$|R
6000|$|The child sat by, {{and watched}} its {{progress}} with a troubled mind. Regardless {{of the run}} of luck, and mindful only of the desperate passion which had its hold upon her grandfather, losses and gains were to her alike. Exulting in some brief triumph, or cast down by a defeat, there he sat so wild and restless, so feverishly and intensely anxious, so terribly eager, so ravenous for the paltry stakes, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>almost</b> better borne to see him dead. And yet she was the innocent cause of all this torture, and he, gambling with such a savage thirst for gain as the most insatiable gambler never felt, had not one selfish thought! ...|$|R
