500|$|The {{fourth stage}} {{involved}} remedying {{the problem of}} communicating between the two towers {{during the time of}} Pope Pius X. His plans were to make the Gregorian Tower into a historical tower and to record and carry out observations at the second tower by linking the two towers along the fortified wall with a [...] iron bridge spanning the gap. At the west end of this bridge, a four-inch equatorial was installed on semicircular bastion. The east end of the bridge, above the barracks of the gendarmes, had a heliograph, with a camera attached, used to photograph the Sun (photoheliograph). A new 16-inch visual telescope, called Torre Pio X, was erected in the second tower. As a result of these modifications, the original library was moved to the Pontifical Academy Lincei, and the old meteorological and seismic instruments were shifted to the Valle di Pompei observatory. The new Astronomical Library was housed in two rooms of the building. The two new Repsold machines were used for recording on the astrographic plates. The recorded observations were published along with explanatory notes together with the last two series of the atlas of stars. Charts were printed on <b>silver</b> <b>bromide</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} version of the printing process, carbon tissue (a temporary support sheet coated {{with a layer of}} gelatin mixed with a pigment—originally carbon black, from which the name derives) is bathed in a potassium dichromate sensitizing solution, dried, then exposed to strong ultraviolet light through a photographic negative, hardening the gelatin in proportion to the amount of light reaching it. The tissue is then developed by treatment with warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin. The resulting pigment image is physically transferred to a final support surface, either directly or indirectly. In an important early 20th century variation of the process, known as carbro (carbon-bromide) printing, contact with a conventional <b>silver</b> <b>bromide</b> <b>paper</b> print, rather than exposure to light, was used to selectively harden the gelatin. A wide variety of colored pigments can be used instead of carbon black.|$|E

40|$|Simple, universally {{adaptable}} {{techniques for}} fabricating conductive patterns {{are required to}} translate laboratory-scale innovations into low-cost solutions for the developing world. Silver nanostructures have emerged as attractive candidates for forming such conductive patterns. We report here the in situ formation of conductive silver-nanowire networks on paper, thereby {{eliminating the need for}} either cost-intensive ink formulation or substrate preparation or complex post-deposition sintering steps. Reminiscent of the photographic process of `salt printing', a desktop office printer was used to deposit desired patterns of <b>silver</b> <b>bromide</b> on <b>paper,</b> which were subsequently exposed to light and then immersed in a photographic developer. Percolating silver nanowire networks that conformally coated the paper fibres were formed after 10 min of exposure to light from a commercial halogen lamp. Thus, conductive and patterned films with sheet resistances of the order of 4 Omega/rectangle can be easily formed by combining two widely used processes - inkjet printing and photographic development...|$|R

European fashion in Sarajevo in the period before World War II was rare and worn only by younger, modern women of the upper class.

In the course of the 1930 s, younger men and government officials employed in the administration in Sarajevo started to wear European-style suits. The Bosniaks combined them with the fes. The style was somewhat outdated, reminiscent of the late 1920 s. During the winter, men in Sarajevo dressed in long coats and suits with white shirts and a tie. They preferred narrow lapels, and wore their coats buttoned up to the top. Trousers were straight and rather short, leaving the socks visible. Some men wore Oxford Bags and fitted coats with broad lapels. It was common to fold back the sleeves, like the man in the photograph.
