5|$|Emilio del Guercio {{said that}} the toy arrow {{represents}} absurdity and the teardrop sentimentality and melancholy.

5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to winter {{closures}} due to lake effect caused by snowsquall, which can create sudden whiteout conditions along the Lake Huron shoreline. Several Emergency Detour Routes {{have been established}} further inland to guide drivers around such closures. Care <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> during the winter months, as these storms can progress rapidly and unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 {{census of}} Association of Religion Data Archives has also {{reported}} that 46.5% {{of the total population}} was Christian, slightly larger than the Muslim population of 45.5%, while 7.7% were members of other religions. However, these estimates <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> with caution because sample data is mostly collected from major urban areas in the south, which are predominantly Christian.|$|E

5|$|Despite these setbacks, Simonds {{was adamant}} that Verrières Ridge <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> and {{sent in the}} Black Watch and the Calgary Highlanders to {{stabilise}} the precarious Allied position. Minor counterattacks by both battalions on 21 July managed to contain Dietrich's armoured formations {{and by the time}} the operation was called off, Canadian forces held several footholds on the ridge, including a now secure position on Point67. Four German divisions still held the ridge. In all, the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1,300 Allied casualties.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during his}} college tour, Chapman {{mentioned}} that a television audience member {{had written to}} the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, adding that the Bible said any man who lies with a man <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> out and stoned. With other Pythons already aware of his sexual orientation, Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E
5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness {{takes the form}} of general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E

5|$|Rolling {{a person}} with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the {{recovery}} position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs. Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten. Efforts <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to prevent further self-injury. Spinal precautions are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{satellites}} are {{of similar}} size or {{larger than the}} planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Alan Stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into account {{in the definition of}} a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.|$|E
5|$|The French Resistance in Paris rose {{against the}} Germans on 19 August. Eisenhower {{initially}} wanted {{to bypass the}} city to pursue other targets, but amid reports that the citizens were going hungry and Hitler's stated intention to destroy it, de Gaulle insisted that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> immediately. French forces of the 2nd Armoured Division under General Philippe Leclerc arrived from the west on 24 August, while the U.S. 4th Infantry Division pressed up from the south. Scattered fighting continued throughout the night, and by the morning of 25 August Paris was liberated.|$|E

5|$|The Histoire Naturelle was {{translated}} into languages including English, German, Swedish, Russian and Italian. Many translations, often partial (single volumes, or all volumes to a certain date), abridged, reprinted in the same translation by different printers, or with additional text (for example on insects) and new illustrations, were made {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century and the start of the nineteenth century, presenting a complicated publication history. Early translations were necessarily only of the earlier volumes. Given the complexity, all catalogue dates other than of single volumes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> as approximate.|$|E
5|$|The candlelight vigil {{following}} the bill's defeat in committee {{was attended by}} labor union members and religious groups. Father Richard Shields of the Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii stated religion <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> out of the argument and {{a spokesperson for the}} hotel and restaurant union Local 5 argued the bill provided economic justice. A letter later sent to senators in support of the H.B. 444 by community groups, including the Local 5 union, the Hawaii NAACP, the Hawaii State Democratic Women's Caucus, and the Japanese American Citizens League.|$|E
5|$|When Congress reconvened in December 1931, the Republicans {{nominally}} {{controlled the}} Senate by the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Charles Curtis, but, as Hoover later wrote, {{there was no}} real majority as Borah and other progressives were against the administration. After the Bonus Army marched on Washington, Borah and Hoover agreed that no action <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> on their demands so long as the ex-soldiers remained in the capital. Borah considered their presence intimidating to Congress, but was angered when they were forcibly dispersed.|$|E

5|$|When welding {{dissimilar}} metals, {{the joint}} {{must have an}} accurate fit, with proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to avoid melting excessive base material. Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input. The filler metal should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the base materials.|$|E
5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn off or falling {{to the ground and}} it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E

Particular care <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E
