5|$|Early {{treatment}} {{increases the}} chance of a good outcome. Treatment consists of stabilizing the person, followed by the use of an antidote. The preferred antidote is fomepizole with ethanol used if this is not available. Hemodialysis may also be used in those where there is organ damage or a high degree of acidosis. Other treatments may include <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate,</b> thiamine, and magnesium.|$|E

5|$|Gastric acid acts as {{a barrier}} against {{microorganisms}} to prevent infections and {{is important for the}} digestion of food. Its low pH denatures proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as pepsin. The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin by self-cleavage. After leaving the stomach, the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the duodenum by <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The stomach {{itself is}} {{protected}} from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick mucus layer, and by secretin induced buffering with <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate.</b> Heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail. Drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in the stomach, and antacids are used to neutralize existing acid.|$|E
5000|$|The first hydrographic {{study of}} the thermal springs of Vidago {{occurred}} in 1863, following several years of visits by Portuguese locals and those seeking medical treatments.

Since this period, though, the spas were closed, but at its height (1875 to 1877) was visited by people as important as the King D. Luís I of Portugal. Between 1876 and 1889 it was awarded prices in Madrid, Paris, Vienna and Rio de Janeiro for its curative properties.|$|R

5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens. An injection with <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate.</b> Treatment with <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> solution to rapidly improve the acid {{levels in the}} blood is controversial. There {{is little evidence that}} it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed some evidence that while it may improve the acidity of the blood, it may actually worsen acidity inside the body's cells and increase the risk of certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged, although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH<6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH 6.9–7.0).|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not adsorb glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. <b>Sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of DKA is with intravenous fluids and insulin. Depending on the severity, insulin {{may be given}} intravenously or by injection under the skin. Usually potassium is also needed to prevent the development of low blood potassium. Throughout treatment blood sugar and potassium levels should be regularly checked. Antibiotics may be required in those with an underlying infection. In those with severely low blood pH, <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> may be given; however, its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Though {{metallic}} sodium has some important uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds; millions {{of tons of}} sodium chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually. Sodium chloride is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing and as a preservative; <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight. Sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.|$|E
50|$|Coal-fired boilers / power plants, {{when using}} coal or lignite rich in limestone, produce ash {{containing}} calcium oxide. CaO readily dissolves in water to form slaked lime-Ca(OH)2-and carried by rain water to rivers / irrigation water. Lime softening process precipitates Ca and Mg ions / removes hardness {{in the water}} and also converts <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonates</b> in river water into sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonates (washing soda) further reacts with the remaining Ca and Mg in the water to remove / precipitate the total hardness. Also water-soluble sodium salts present in the ash enhance the sodium content in water. The global coal consumption is 7700 million tons in the year 2011. Thus river water is made devoid of Ca and Mg ions and enhanced Na by coal-fired boilers.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} water {{immersion}} on renal bicarbonate and acid excretion were assessed in 10 normal male subjects. Immersion {{resulted in a}} highly significant progressive increase {{in the rate of}} <b>sodium</b> and <b>bicarbonate</b> excretion, and in urine pH. Immersion was also associated with a significant increase in urine P-CO 2; this increase presupposes a maintained rate of hydrogen secretion in the distal tubular segment. The rapidity of onset of the bicarbonaturia (2 hrs of immersion) and the concomitant increase in urinary P-CO 2 suggest that enhanced bicarbonate excretion of immersion cannot be completely accounted for by immersion-induced suppression of aldosterone, and that the natriuresis and bicarbonaturia of immersion is mediated in part by an increased proximal rejection of <b>sodium</b> and <b>bicarbonate...</b>|$|R

5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate,</b> and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor's fire company {{existed for}} more than a year before Briarcliff Manor's incorporation. Frederick C. Messinger (a fireman in Kingston for ten years) and {{thirteen}} local men founded the private fire company in 1901. Thirty-six men became the company's charter members on March 4, 1902, and dues were set at 25cents per month. On April 15 of that year, the company took the name Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. The company's first equipment was a 1901 hand-drawn chemical apparatus, with a tank containing a mixture of water and <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate.</b> Sulfuric acid would be added to the tank, creating carbon dioxide, which would propel the solution through the hose and help extinguish the fire. That first apparatus was white, which Messinger thought more visible than the conventional red in a village without street lights, and the village's engines remain white.|$|E
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (<b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate),</b> and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E

5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> {{can be used}} to {{extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> releases carbon dioxide.

The alkaline nature of <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E

40|$|The {{carbonation}} {{resistance of}} alkali-activated binders is often tested via accelerated test protocols designed for Portland cements, without questioning whether the tests replicate the mechanisms observed in service. Thus, validation of accelerated methods {{is required to}} enable realistic prediction of material performance. Changes in pore solution equilibria cause the formation of <b>sodium</b> <b>bicarbonates</b> during accelerated carbonation, compared with hydrous sodium carbonates in natural carbonation. This shifts the carbonation mechanism to favour more rapid reaction progress, to give a higher apparent degree of acceleration (compared to natural conditions) than in Portland cements. The pore solution pH under accelerated carbonation is significantly lower than at natural CO 2 concentrations, leading to a falsely short predicted service life (time to expected corrosion of embedded steel), as natural CO 2 concentrations appear not to reduce the pH below 10. Thus, accelerated carbonation testing is unduly aggressive towards alkali-activated binders, and test results must be cautiously interpreted...|$|R
