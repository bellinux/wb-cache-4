40|$|Abstract: For long, {{fine-grained}} {{version control}} for <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> has been neglected severely. Typically, software configuration management systems support {{the management of}} text or binary files. Unfortunately, text-based tools for fine-grained version control are not adequate for <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> produced in earlier phases in the software life cycle. Frequently, these documents have a graphical syntax; therefore we will call them software diagrams. This paper discusses {{the current state of}} the art in fine-grained version control (differencing and merging) for software diagrams with an emphasis on UML diagrams. ...|$|R
40|$|During the {{evolution}} of a large-scale software project, developers produce a large variety of software artifacts such as requirement specifications, design documents, source code, documentation, bug reports, etc. These <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> are not isolated items — they are semantically related to each other. They evolve over time and the set of active semantic relationships among them is also dynamic. Their evolution makes the task of managing them and maintaining their semantic consistency a very challenging task for software developers. At times, {{the evolution}}ary changes may reduce the consistency of the software project and break semantic connections among its documents. We use the term conformance to denote the state where the network formed by <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> and their relationships is in semantic harmony. Conformance analysis is the process of determining whether <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> and their logical relationships are in agreement. In this paper, we present a representation for <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> and their logical relationships based on the hypertext model. We describe how conformance analysis can be supported by this representation and present a method to detect non-conformance using timestamps and versioned hypermedia. Then we describe a formalism, called the conformance model, {{that can be used to}} understand and combine approaches to the conformance analysis problem. ...|$|R
40|$|Merging {{revisions}} of <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> after develop-ment has branched into multiple lines {{is a difficult}} task. Previous approaches to merging are either based on text files or refer to specific languages.

In this paper, we present a structure-oriented merge tool that is applicable to <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> (re-quirements definitions, <b>software</b> architecture descrip-tions, module implementations, etc.) written in arbitrary languages, preserves their context-free correctness, and also takes binding of identifiers to their declarations into account. ...|$|R
40|$|Context <b>Software</b> <b>documents</b> are core {{artifacts}} {{produced and}} consumed in documentation {{activity in the}} software lifecycle. Meanwhile, knowledge-based approaches have been extensively used in software development for decades, however, the software engineering community lacks a comprehensive understanding on how knowledge-based approaches are used in software documentation, especially documentation of software architecture design. Objective The objective of this work is to explore how knowledge-based approaches are employed in software documentation, their influences {{to the quality of}} software documentation, and {{the costs and benefits of}} using these approaches. Method We use a systematic literature review method to identify the primary studies on knowledge-based approaches in software documentation, following a pre-defined review protocol. Results Sixty studies are finally selected, in which twelve quality attributes of <b>software</b> <b>documents,</b> four cost categories, and nine benefit categories of using knowledge-based approaches in software documentation are identified. Architecture understanding is the top benefit of using knowledge-based approaches in software documentation. The cost of retrieving information from documents is the major concern when using knowledge-based approaches in software documentation. Conclusions The findings of this review suggest several future research directions that are critical and promising but underexplored in current research and practice: (1) there is a need to use knowledge-based approaches to improve the quality attributes of <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> that receive less attention, especially credibility, conciseness, and unambiguity; (2) using knowledge-based approaches with the knowledge content in <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> which gets less attention in current applications of knowledge-based approaches in software documentation, to further improve the practice of software documentation activity; (3) putting more focus on the application of <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> using the knowledge-based approaches (knowledge reuse, retrieval, reasoning, and sharing) in order to make the most use of software documents; and (4) evaluating the costs and benefits of using knowledge-based approaches in software documentation qualitatively and quantitatively. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{identify}} and analyze basic principles which necessarily underlie software measures research. In the prevailing paradigm for the validation of software measures {{there is a}} fundamental assumption that the sets of measured documents are ordered, and that measures should report these orders.

Consideration of these orders suggests a hierarchy of <b>software</b> <b>document</b> measures, a methodology for developing new measures, and a general approach to the analytical evaluation of measures. We also point out the importance of units for any type of measurement and stress the perils of equating document structure complexity and psychological complexity.

40|$|Source code {{browsing}} is {{an important}} part of program comprehension. Browsers expose semantic and syntac-tic relationships (such as between object references and definitions) in GUI-accessible forms. These relation-ships are derived using tools which perform static anal-ysis on the original <b>software</b> <b>documents.</b> Implementing such browsers is tricky. Program comprehension strate-gies vary, and it is necessary to provide the right brows-ing support. Analysis tools to derive the relevant cross-reference relationships are often difficult to build. Tools to browse distributed documents require extensive cod-ing for the GUI, as well as for data communications. Therefore, there are powerful motivations for using ez-istang Statzc analysts tools in conjunction with WWW technology to implement browsers for distributed soft-ware projects. The CHIME framework provides a flex-ible, customizable platform for inserting HTML links into <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> using information generated by existing software analysis tools. Using the CHIME spec-ification language, and a simple, retargetable database interface, it is possible to quickly incorporate a range of different link insertion tools for <b>software</b> <b>documents,</b> into an existing, legacy software development environ-ment. This enables tool builders to offer customized browsing support with a well-known GUI.

40|$|Several {{researchers}} have explored {{the use of}} hypermedia technology in software development environments (SDEs). However, existing hypermedia-based SDEs have only limited support for the evolutionary aspects of software projects.

While researchers in the hypermedia community acknowledged the need for strong version control support in their systems, they are still far from achieving this goal.

40|$|Abstract {{visualisation}} of <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> is {{a powerful}} tool for software comprehension.

In this paper we describe how the UQ* software development environment and, in particular, the associated generic language-based editor provides for: the flexible definition of software visualisations; powerful navigation facilities that are common to both the software visualisations and the actual software documents; and the manipulation of appropriate content within such visualisations.

The major issues addressed include definition of <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> containing tool contributions, real-time consistency checking of such documents, communication and synchronisation between the editor and constructive tools.

To cater for the full range of representation and integration requirements of both analytic and constructive tools, we propose to define a generic model of <b>software</b> <b>documents</b> and to develop a corresponding front-end editor for such documents which is capable of real-time interaction with these tools. 1 Introduction Software development tools [...] ...|$|R
