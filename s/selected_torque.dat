40|$|Nowadays, due to {{excellent}} {{advantages of}} permanent magnet brushless (PMBL) motors {{such as high}} efficiency and high torque/power density, they are used in many industrial and variable-speed electrical drives applications. If the fabricated PMBL motor has neither ideal sinusoidal nor ideal trapezoidal back-EMF voltages, it is named nonideal (or nonsinusoidal) PMBL motor. Employing conventional control strategies of PMSMs and BLDCMs lowers the efficiency and leads to unwanted torque ripple, vibration, and acoustic noises. Moreover, in many applications {{to reduce the cost}} and enhance the reliability of drive, sensorless control techniques are used. This paper proposes a novel sensorless control for a nonsinusoidal PMBL motor with minimum torque ripple. To develop smooth torque, the <b>selected</b> <b>torque</b> harmonic elimination strategy is employed. Furthermore, to estimate the rotor position and speed, a novel full-order sliding mode observer is designed. Proposed observer estimates the position and speed of motor from standstill to final speed. The proposed observer is robust to uncertainty of harmonic contents in phase back-EMF voltage and able to run the motor from standstill with closed-loop control scheme. The capabilities of torque ripple minimization and sensorless strategies are demonstrated with some simulations...|$|E

40|$|A spring-mass model {{accurately}} predicts {{centre of}} mass dynamics for hopping and running animals and is pervasive throughout experimental and theoretical studies of legged locomotion. Given the neuromechanical complexity of the leg, it remains unclear how joint dynamics are selected to achieve such simple {{centre of mass}} movements consistently from step to step and across changing conditions. Human hopping is a tractable experimental model to study how net muscle moments, or joint torques, are coordinated for spring-mass dynamics, which include stable, or invariant, vertical ground forces. Subjects were equally able to stabilize vertical forces at all hopping frequencies (2. 2, 2. 8, 3. 2 Hz) by <b>selecting</b> force-equivalent joint <b>torque</b> combinations. Using a hybrid-uncontrolled manifold permutation analysis, however, we discovered that force stabilization relies less on interjoint coordination at greater hopping frequencies and more on selection of appropriate ankle joint torques. We conclude that control strategies for <b>selecting</b> the joint <b>torques</b> that stabilize forces generated on the ground are adjusted to the rate of movement. Moreover, this indicates that legged locomotion may involve the differential regulation of several redundant motor control strategies that are accessed as needed to match changing environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Fracture of nickel-titanium {{rotary files}} is an {{iatrogenic}} error which can seriously jeopardize root canal therapy. If a high-torque motor is used, the instrument-specific limit-torque (fracture limit) is often exceeded, thus increasing {{the risk of}} intracanal failure. A possible {{solution to this problem}} is to use a low-torque endodontic motor which operates below these values. If the torque is set just below the limit of elasticity for each instrument, the risk of fracture is likely to be markedly reduced. The purpose of this paper was to discuss mechanical properties of NiTi rotary instruments, the rationale for <b>selecting</b> low <b>torque</b> values, and to use clinically a new endodontic motor (step-motor) which operates below the limit of elasticity of each rotary file. The step-motor was found to be helpful in reducing the risk of instrument fracture. Irreversible material damage (plastic deformation) and instrument fracture were rarely seen. Low-torque instrumentation also increased tactile sense and, consequently, mental awareness of rotary instrumentation...|$|R

5000|$|To effect gear changes, one of {{two types}} of {{clutches}} or bands are used to hold a particular member of the planetary gearset motionless, while allowing another member to rotate, thereby transmitting torque and producing gear reductions or overdrive ratios. These clutches are actuated by the valve body (see below), their sequence controlled by the transmission's internal programming.

40|$|Tightening {{screws and}} wedge anchors {{to the correct}} torque is {{important}} for various construction tasks. This thesis presents an effort to <b>select</b> the right <b>torque</b> by means of computer vision. The suggested method makes use of a Hough transform for circles to detect such an object. Selection {{of one of the}} circles found by the Hough transform is done with help of a self simi-larity measure based on the object’s invariance to rotation. The result of detection is used to classify wedge anchors of two different groups. These can be distinguished by cross-like markings engraved in the anchors of one class. Classification is based on the Hough transform for lines, which was extended to detect orthogonal, crossing lines. A short evaluation on still im-ages demonstrates that the approach works. The overall rate of classification achieved with this method is 0. 61, which is too low for real-world application. Additional suggestions for improving the concept conclude this thesis...|$|R

40|$|A {{rationale}} {{is presented}} for examining {{the relationship between}} the inertia of a segment and the torque curve for the corresponding joint, during childhood and adolescence. Joint <b>torque</b> impulse was <b>selected</b> as the criterion variable and segment mass, segment moment of in ertia about the transverse joint axis and age selected as predictor variables. The designated segment was the combined head, arms and trunk (HAT) in the reference configuration. Two joints, the hip and the ankle, were <b>selected</b> for <b>torque</b> analysis. The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine through visual inspection, intra-individual curves of the relationships. Data were taken from a mixed longitudinal investigation of twelve boys followed over five years for an age range of five to eighteen years. Segment inertias were estimated using the elliptical zone model and joint torques were calculated from cinematographic records of a standing jump for distance using the inverse dynamics approach. The results show an increasing slope for joint torque impulse with age. This is similar to the reported relationship for strength. The relationships between hip torque impulse and the mass and moment of inertia of HAT are essentially rectilinear. This is in contrast with the reported relationships between strength and weight, height and height squared which show an increasing slope. The relationships for the ankle were similar to those for the hip but the curves were more dispersed, possibly due to the more remote linkage between the ankle and the HAT. It is concluded that the relationship between structure and function, when an impulse/momentum rationale is used to select appropriate variables, approaches collinearity...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} work {{concerns a}} very important part of the planetary gear train, namely, a design of the planet carrier. An application of heavy-duty commercial gearboxes is <b>selected</b> because large <b>torque</b> levels dominate in this application and then the design of the carrier is crucial. One of the most important parameters of the plant carrier is its torsional stiffness, which has a direct influence on stress level gears. The low stiffness leads to uneven contact between the gears during loading which reduces pitting resistance of the gears. The next important parameter is the stress level in the planet carrier, because of varying torque the planet carrier is exposed to fatigue failure. These two parameters are taken in a design process as the main factors. A topology optimization method was used to find a direction to design the torsional stiff carrier also taking into account a size limit of the carrier. The project is done with the purpose of showing that the usage of the optimization tool helps significantly to design a new part, which excels a standard part in terms of structural performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} laminar steady flow in a {{stationary}} cylinder with a rotating top disk was studied numerically. Three governing equations in cylindrical coordinates were solved by the alternating-direction implicit (ADI) method. To characterize the flow, three bulk quantities were <b>selected,</b> namely, the <b>torque</b> coefficient {{and the primary}} and secondary volumetric flow rates. Determination of the torque coefficient presented a difficulty because a singularity exists in the velocity gradient at the corner where the rotating disk and the stationary cylinder meet. This problem was overcome by specifying {{a gap between the}} disk and cylinder and incorporating this into the boundary conditions. The results obtained using these boundary conditions compared favourably with previous experimental, analytical and computational studies. The relevant parameters for the problem were the rotational Reynolds number, the aspect ratio (the ratio of the height of the cylinder to its radius) and the gap. The ranges of parameters investigated were as follows: Reynolds number from 1 to 105; aspect ratio from 0. 02 to 3; and gap size from 0. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to operate at a constant speed, no matter the thrust output—a characteristic permitted by the Astafan's use of precise fuel metering and fan blade pitch adjustment. To control the engine, the pilot first sets the speed lever, which adjusts fuel flow {{in proportion to the}} selected engine speed. Then the pilot moves the thrust lever (analogous to a throttle), actuating the fan pitch piston by way of a mechanical linkage and hydraulic valve, and varying the blade pitch. In response, the speed governor holds engine speed steady by adjusting fuel delivery to the combustor. The control system also monitors turbine temperature and adjusts blade pitch (and therefore engine load) to maintain it within the preferred range of 350 °C to 450 °C. Additionally, the system automatically protects against excessive fuel delivery or unusual changes in blade pitch. Using the thrust lever, pilots can start an Astafan in fine pitch (for minimal resistive <b>torque),</b> <b>select</b> takeoff (coarse) pitch, feather the fan, or even reverse the fan pitch in flight (with the fan providing reverse thrust in lieu of conventional reversers).|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new formulation of priori-tized task-space control for humanoids {{that is used}} to develop a dynamic kick and dynamic jump in a 26 degree of freedom simulated system. The demonstrated motions are controlled through a real-time conic optimization scheme that <b>selects</b> appropriate joint <b>torques</b> and contact forces. More specifically, motions are characterized in appropriate task spaces, and the real-time optimizer solves the task-space control problem while accounting for user-defined priorities between the tasks. In contrast to previous solutions of the Prioritized Task-Space Control (PTSC) problem for humanoids, the solution presented here satisfies the ZMP constraint and ground friction limitations at all levels of priority, and is general to periods of flight as well as support. All generated motions include control of the system’s centroidal angular momentum, which leads to emergent whole-body behaviors, such as arm-swing, that are not specified by the designer. In addition, compared to a previous quadratic programming solution of the PTSC problem, our approach gains a factor of 2 speedup in its required computational time. This speedup allows the control approach to operate at real-time rates of approximately 200 Hz. I...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Compared {{with visual}} torque-onset-detection (TOD), threshold-based TOD {{produces}} onset bias, which increases with lower torques or rates of torque development (RTD). PURPOSE: To compare {{the effects of}} differential TOD-bias on common contractile parameters in two torque-disparate groups. METHODS: Fifteen boys and 12 men performed maximal, explosive, isometric knee-extensions. Torque and EMG were recorded for each contraction. Best contractions were <b>selected</b> by peak <b>torque</b> (MVC) and peak RTD. Visual-TOD-based torque-time traces, electromechanical delays (EMD), and times to peak RTD (tRTD) were compared with corresponding data derived from fixed 4 -Nm- and relative 5 %MVC-thresholds. RESULTS: The 5 %MVC TOD-biases were similar for boys and men, but the corresponding 4 -Nm-based biases were markedly different (40. 3 ± 14. 1 vs. 18. 4 ± 7. 1 ms, respectively; p< 0. 001). Boys-men EMD differences were most affected, increasing from 5. 0 ms (visual) to 26. 9 ms (4 Nm; p< 0. 01). Men's visually-based torque kinetics tended to be faster than the boys' (NS), but the 4 -Nm-based kinetics erroneously depicted the boys as being much faster to any given %MVC (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: When comparing contractile properties of dissimilar groups, e. g., children vs. adults, threshold-based TOD methods can misrepresent reality and lead to erroneous conclusions. Relative-thresholds (e. g., 5 % MVC) still introduce error, but group-comparisons are not confounded...|$|R
30|$|Plantar flexors were {{selected}} as the target muscles in this experiment because previous studies that reported {{an increase in the}} maximal voluntary concentric <b>torque</b> <b>selected</b> plantar flexors as the target muscles (Fukutani et al. 2012); (Miyamoto et al. 2011). Each participant lay on an isokinetic dynamometer (CON-TREX, CMV AG, Switzerland) with the right knee and hip joints fully extended. The right foot was tightly secured to the dynamometer’s footplate, and the right thigh was fixed to the dynamometer’s bench with a non-elastic strap to minimize unwanted movements. The center of rotation of the footplate and center of the ankle joint were aligned visually. During the twitch and conditioning contractions, the ankle joint angle was set at 0 ° (anatomical position). The joint angular velocity of the maximal voluntary concentric contraction was set at 30 °/s and 180 °/s (slow and fast conditions, respectively). The range of motion of the maximal voluntary concentric contraction was set from - 15 ° (dorsiflexion) to 30 ° (plantar flexion) in the fast velocity condition and from - 15 ° to - 5 ° in the slow velocity condition to minimize the difference of the contraction duration between the two velocity conditions. In a preliminary study, we confirmed that peak torque during the maximal voluntary concentric contraction in each velocity condition was recorded within these ranges of motion. Subjects were instructed to perform the fast and slow maximal voluntary concentric contraction as forcibly as possible.|$|R

Recently, high variability has been reported about the accuracy of spring-style mechanical torque devices (S-S MTDs). Joint stability and survival rate of fixed implant supported prosthesis depends on the accuracy of these devices. Currently, there is limited information on the steam sterilization influence on the accuracy of MTDs. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of steam sterilization on the accuracy (&plusmn; 10 % of the target torque) of spring-style mechanical torque devices for dental implants. Materials and methods: Fifteen new S-S MTDs and their appropriate drivers from three different manufacturers (Nobel Biocare, Straumann [ITI], and Biomet 3 i [3 i]) were <b>selected.</b> Peak <b>torque</b> of devices (5 in each subgroup) was measured before and after autoclaving using a Tohnichi torque gauge. Descriptive statistical analysis was used and a repeated-measures ANOVA with type of device as a between-subject comparison was performed to assess the difference in accuracy among the three groups of spring-style mechanical torque devices after sterilization. A Bonferroni post hoc test was used to assess pairwise comparisons. Results: Before steam sterilization, all the tested devices stayed within 10 % of their target values. After 100 sterilization cycles, results didn&# 39;t show any significant difference between raw and absolute error values in the Nobel Biocare and ITI devices; however the results demonstrated an increase of error values in the 3 i group (P &lt; 0. 05). Raw error values increased with a predictable pattern in 3 i devices and showed more than a 10 % difference from target torque values (maximum difference of 14 % from target torque was seen in 17 % of peak torque measurements). Conclusion: Within the limitation of this study, steam sterilization did not affect the accuracy (&plusmn; 10 % of the target torque) of the Nobel Biocare and ITI MTDs. Raw error values increased with a predictable pattern in 3 i devices and showed more than 10 % difference from target torque values.
