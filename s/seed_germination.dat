5|$|Persoonia levis {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, {{mainly because of}} {{difficulties}} in propagation; <b>seed</b> <b>germination</b> is unpredictable, and cuttings have been nearly impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E

5|$|Droseraregia {{is often}} {{described}} as being a difficult species to cultivate, though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions have led to success for some. For optimal growth, D.regia appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool nights and warm days have been reported to induce vigorous growth. Asexual propagation is frequently achieved through small root cuttings instead of leaf cuttings, which tend to rot before roots can form. <b>Seed</b> <b>germination</b> occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster than many other Drosera species. Germination is phanerocotylar (non-glandular cotyledons exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being alternate in arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aemula resprouts from a {{lignotuber}} or shoots from epicormic buds after fire. Fire {{management of}} Banksia aemula heath in Southeast Queensland recommends 7- to 20-year fire intervals. Intervals of 10–15 years are recommended for the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, as longer leads to overgrowth by Leptospermum laevigatum. Experimenting with <b>seed</b> <b>germination</b> and early growth of B.aemula showed that phosphorus was toxic to seedlings, inhibiting growth at double normal soil concentrations and causing seedling death at quadruple normal soil concentrations. The addition of potassium or magnesium ameliorated these effects a little although potassium in high concentrations impacted on growth as well. Overall, seedlings grow slowly {{over the first}} 21 weeks of life compared with other plant species, the reasons for which are unclear, {{although it may be}} that it offers an increased chance of survival in a nutrient- or water-poor environment. Seed was killed by exposure to 150°C, but survived seven-minute exposure to 100°C.|$|E
40|$|Brassica oleracea var italica {{occupies}} {{a special place}} in the internal and external market of vegetables seeds. Vegetables producers demand seeds with high degree of purity, germination and vigor, since seeds' quality is the basis for the success of the production. In this work, broccoli seeds were coated in a spouted bed, by an aqueous suspension of hidroxy-ethyl-cellulose. Effects of the operating variables: spouting air temperature, atomizing air pressure and coating suspension flow rate over the dependent variables: <b>seeds</b> <b>germination,</b> <b>seeds</b> accelerated aging and the speed of <b>seeds</b> <b>germination</b> in soil, were investigated in a factorial scheme trial. The maximum processing time was 120 min. A totally randomized experiment evaluated and compared <b>seeds</b> <b>germination</b> and vigor of the coated and non-coated seeds. There was no identifiable, pronounced difference on germination of coated and non-coated seeds, accelerated aging of seeds, and speed of <b>seeds</b> <b>germination</b> in the soil.

40|$|ALLELOPATHIC POTENTIAL OF YELLOW NUTSEDGE (Cyperus rotundus L.) ON SEEDLING GROWTH OF SEVERAL FOOD AND HORTUCULTURAL CROPS. Yellow nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) occurs {{everywhere}} in plantation, agronomic, hurticulture and nursery field {{and has an}} allopathic potential. The allelochemic efficacy depend on several factors such as source of extract, time of application, and extract concentration. The yellow nutsedge shoot and rhizome extract were evaluated on their phytotoxicity on corn (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max), watermelon (Citrulus lanatus), and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) seedlings. The experiment was conducted in Agronomy Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Bengkulu from March to September 1995. Yellow nutsedge was planted in pots and was harvested at 14 days after planting while yellow nutsedge rhizome was collected from the field. The shoot tissue and rhizome were placed in a drying oven at 4 C, grounded, and extracted using water to get 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 g L- 1 concentrations. The experiment was arranged in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 3 replications and 2 experimental runs. As shoot tissue extract concentration increased, allelopathic potential of tissue also increased. Food crops <b>seeds</b> <b>germination</b> decreased at an extract concentration of 30 g L- 1 while <b>seeds</b> <b>germination</b> and coleoptile length of tomato and waermelon decreased at concentration of 20 and 10 g L- 1, respectively. On the other hand, increasing rhizome extract did not affect food crops <b>seeds</b> <b>germination</b> while horticulture <b>seeds</b> <b>germination</b> decreased at 20 g L- 1 extract concentration. The radicle growth of all crops tested was suppressed at 30 g L- 1 while watermelon shoot dry weight decreased at 10 g L- 1 extract concentration...|$|R

40|$|Osmopriming has a {{positive}} effect on the enhancement of <b>seeds</b> <b>germination</b> and seedlings growth, especially under stress conditions. This study investigated the effects of osmopriming with polyethylene glycol on alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) <b>seeds</b> <b>germination</b> and seedlings antioxidant responses under drought stress. Seeds of five Moroccan alfalfa populations and an American Moapa variety were used to investigate the effect of osmopriming on <b>seeds</b> <b>germination,</b> seedlings growth, activities of antioxidant enzymes and membrane stability under two water deficit levels (- 0. 45 and - 0. 75 MPa). Seeds were primed with polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) (- 0. 6 MPa) for 24 h at 25 °C. The results showed that treated <b>seeds</b> presented higher <b>germination</b> rate and growth of 8 d-old seedlings than untreated ones. Particularly, osmoprimed seeds of ‘Adis-Tata’ (Ad) and ‘Riche’ (Rc) populations presented the highest final germination percentages of 90. 8 % and 64 %, respectively, and seedlings shoot and root lengths under both levels of water deficit. The priming treatment enhanced the activity of peroxidase (PO) and catalase (CAT) and reduced the malonyldialdehyde (MDA) content and the electrolyte leakage under water deficit. Generally, the success of germination was positively correlated to PO and CAT activities and the degree of membrane stability in drought tolerant populations. However, the positive effect of the osmopriming technique on alfalfa drought tolerance remains limited in some tested populations, and severe water stress could inhibit germination and cause damages of alfalfa seedlings...|$|R
