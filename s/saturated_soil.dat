5|$|The storm {{contributed to}} {{numerous}} weather-related traffic accidents, {{at least one}} of them classified as major. Around 20 collisions occurred on the night of August 19 across the San Francisco Peninsula. Two crashes on Interstate 80 forced the closure of four lanes for 30 minutes, while California State Route 9 was blocked in Saratoga by a large tree which fell due to <b>saturated</b> <b>soil.</b> It is unclear how many injuries resulted from the various incidents. Thunderstorms associated with the storm system left about 78,000 electric customers in Sonoma County without power after lightning struck a power substation. The outages lasted up to a few hours. Lightning also knocked three workers unconscious in a vineyard near Lodi; they were in good condition after hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Laura never approached land, and no damages or fatalities occurred. Since the storm remained over open waters {{for most of}} its life, several ships and oil platforms recorded tropical storm-force winds. The highest recorded winds were at an oil platform with the call sign VEP717 at 03:00UTC on October1. Winds were recorded up to 47knots (54mph; 87km/h). Despite the lack of impact, the storm's remnants were caught in an upper-level jet stream, and steered towards Europe. There, they contributed to heavy rainfall across portions of Britain on October5, causing localized accumulation of flood waters. As a result, Glebe Road near Windermere, England was closed in both directions, and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale, previously <b>saturated</b> <b>soil,</b> combined with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding. Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed due to poor driving conditions. One person had to be rescued from her car after driving into a flooded street. The UK Environment Agency issued 76 flood watches and 21 severe flood warnings {{as a result of the}} rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Gert's broad wind {{circulation}} produced {{widespread and}} heavy rainfall across Central America through September15–17. Combined with <b>saturated</b> <b>soil</b> from Tropical Storm Bret's passage a month earlier, the storm triggered widespread floods and mudslides that isolated numerous communities. In Costa Rica, the blustery weather destroyed {{a national park}} and led to significant losses for the agricultural and tourism sectors. Much of the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua and Honduras endured overflowing rivers, with many cities, villages, and crops in those countries left under water. Although Gert's highest winds occurred upon landfall in Mexico, the worst effects in the country were due to an extreme rainfall event in the Huasteca region, where as many as 31.41inches (798mm) of rain fell. As {{an increasing number of}} major rivers burst their banks, catastrophic flooding submerged extensive areas around the Pánuco basin. Tens of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate, and scores of structures were demolished in what was described as the region's worst disaster in 40years.|$|E

40|$|Issue of {{construction}} of facilities {{in areas of}} weak <b>saturated</b> <b>soils</b> is becoming particularly relevant in recent years. This problem applies especially to objects {{of oil and gas}} industry. <b>Saturated</b> <b>soils</b> are characterized by a filtration anisotropy, an inhomogeneity and an ability to liquefy in violation of their structure because of water content. Therefore, the study of bearing capacity of such soils in the process of consolidation has significant practical importance in ensuring the reliability of structures. The formulation, the method and the algorithm for calculating the stress-strain state of weak <b>saturated</b> <b>soils</b> is described in this article. Solution of the consolidation task is based on the model of body forces of threecomponent soil considering the elastic-plastic deformation of its skeleton. Some results of calculations have been shown in this article...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Freezing <b>saturated</b> <b>soils</b> are {{mixtures}} of solid particles, water, and ice. Heat transfer in freezing soils {{is a complex}} process because of the multi-phase nature of the mixture. The phase change of the liquid part adds complexity, since not all water changes phase at the freezing temperature. Difficulties with convergence are known to appear when simulating the process. A numerical procedure for the soil freezing process is developed and implemented using the subroutine UMATHT in ABAQUS system. Examples of one-dimensional and two-dimensional freezing problems in <b>saturated</b> <b>soils</b> are presented in this paper...|$|R
25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} thrive in urban areas, especially in backyards, golf courses, parks, recreational areas, school grounds, and street verges, {{in which their}} presence may deter outdoor activities. If they enter homes or properties, they can harm pets if they are either caged, penned, tied or cannot escape. Nests can be built under pavements or even roads, as well as under driveways, foundations, lawns, edges of sidewalks, under patio slabs, in electrical boxes or near power lines. A colony can excavate huge quantities of soil, resulting in structural problems in driveways, pavings and walls, and can also cause the formation of potholes in roads. Additional damage by mounds can be inflicted on trees, yard plants, and pipes; some structures may also collapse. Colonies may migrate into human homes after heavy rain to take refuge from <b>saturated</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Constitutive {{models of}} {{partially}} <b>saturated</b> <b>soils</b> {{have been widely}} used in geotechnical engineering. Most of these models depend on complicated parameters; among them, soil suction is the most important one. However, the equipment and level of expertise required for determination of this parameter during a test procedure is beyond the capabilities of most of geotechnical laboratories. Thus, a behaviour model independent of soil suction may be very interested instead of such complicated laboratory measurements. In this research, a new behaviour model of partly <b>saturated</b> <b>soils</b> is presented. This model is constructed based on a series of collected data from different authors and validated with their experimental results. Employing a dramatic and continuous transition of soil strengths from a fully saturated to fully dry condition is the base of this model. Soil parameters which were used in this approach are moisture content, plasticity indices, saturated-drained internal friction angle and unconfined compressive strength of soil in dry and hardened states. Based on presented equation in this research and introduced effective parameters, it is possible to determine partially <b>saturated</b> <b>soils</b> shear strengths without any measurement of soil suction...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a mechanical model for non-isothermal behaviour of variably <b>saturated</b> <b>soils.</b> The model {{is based on}} an incrementally non-linear hypoplastic model for saturated clays and can therefore tackle the non-linear behaviour of overconsolidated soils. A hypoplastic model for non-isothermal behaviour of <b>saturated</b> <b>soils</b> was developed and combined with the existing hypo-plastic model for unsaturated soils based on the effective stress principle. The number of model parameters is kept to a minimum, and they all have a clear physical interpretation, to facilitate the model usefulness for practical applications. The step-by-step procedure used for the parameter calibration is described. The model is fi nally evaluated using a comprehensive set of experimental data for the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a variably saturated compacted silt. ...|$|R
