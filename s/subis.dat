The Great Cave lies in a large limestone block, about a kilometre long in general north to south direction and about half a kilometre wide, that is detached from the main Gunung <b>Subis</b> complex, by a valley between about 150 to 200 meters wide. The main Gunung <b>Subis</b> complex rises to about 394 meters above sea level at its highest point. The whole [...] "Gunung <b>Subis</b> Limestone Complex" [...] lies some 17 kilometres inland from the South China Sea coast, near the town of Batu Niah and about 65 kilometres south west of the town Miri. It is roughly heart shaped measuring five kilometres from its northern tip to the south and four kilometres across. The Gunung <b>Subis</b> is surrounded by a low countryside with gentle hills from which the small limestone massif and its smaller detached blocks rise rather abruptly out of the jungle, some with cliffs over 100 metres high. Though it is not an extensive cave system compared to others in Sarawak, it has been estimated to cover some 10 hectares and the roof rises to about 75 metres above the cave floor in some places. In geological terms, the limestones are part of the <b>Subis</b> Formation. This is dated to some 20 to 16 million years ago during the Early Miocene.|$|E

50|$|The {{population}} of eastern purple martins (nominate form P. s. <b>subis)</b> {{is dependent on}} artificial martin houses of wood or aluminum and fake plastic gourds, supplied by individuals and organizations fond of the bird. This tradition was in place even before the population crash; Native Americans {{are said to have}} hollowed out gourds and erected them for this purpose. The situation requires ongoing maintenance, as European starlings and house sparrows compete with martins as cavity-nesters, and will fight with martins over nest sites. Starlings have even been known to kill purple martins, especially nestling young, and house sparrows have been known to evict purple martins from their nests. Thus, unmonitored purple martin houses are often overtaken by more aggressive, non-native species. Purple martin proponents are motivated by the concern that the purple martin would likely vanish from eastern North America were it not for this assistance.|$|E
