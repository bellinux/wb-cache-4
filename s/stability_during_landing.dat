40|$|Abstract of poster {{presentation}} presented at 2011 Asics Conference of Science and Medicine in Sport (ACSMS). From {{the onset of}} puberty females are at {{a greater risk of}} sustaining a non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture compared to males. Increased anterior knee laxity (AKL) in females has been proposed as a possible mechanism for increased ACL injury risk, due to the associated decrease in knee joint <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> <b>landing</b> movements. Despite this association, there is a dearth of literature investigating the effects of increased AKL on lower limb landing biomechanics in adolescent girls...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{adolescent}} {{growth spurt}} {{is associated with}} rapid growth and hormonal changes, thought {{to contribute to the}} increased anterior cruciate ligament injury risk in girls. However, relatively little is known about these musculoskeletal and estrogen changes during the growth spurt in girls. Purpose: To investigate the longitudinal changes in estrogen as well as anterior knee laxity and lower limb strength and flexibility throughout the adolescent growth spurt in girls. Methods: Thirty-three healthy girls, age 10 - 13 yr, in Tanner stage II and 4 - 6 months from their peak height velocity were recruited. Participants were tested up to four times during the 12 months of their growth spurt, according to the timing of their maturity offset (test 1 : maturity offset = - 6 to - 4 months; test 2 : maturity offset = 0 months; test 3 : maturity offset = + 4 months; test 4 : maturity offset = + 8 months). During each testing session, anterior knee laxity, lower limb flexibility, and isokinetic strength as well as saliva measures of estradiol concentration were measured. Results: A significant (P = 0. 002) effect of time on anterior knee laxity was found from the time of peak height velocity, although no changes in estradiol concentration were displayed over time (P = 0. 811). Participants displayed a significant increase (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in isokinetic quadriceps strength over time, with no apparent increase in isokinetic hamstring strength. Conclusions: We speculate that increased quadriceps strength, combined with increased knee laxity and no accompanying hamstring strength development during the adolescent growth spurt in girls, might contribute to a decrease in their knee joint <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> <b>landing</b> tasks. These musculoskeletal changes could potentially increase anterior cruciate ligament injury risk at a time of rapid height and lower limb growth...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Recent {{in vitro}} {{research}} {{has suggested that}} anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction does not restore control of tibial rotation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore these findings in vivo and investigate rotational knee <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> <b>landing</b> and subsequent pivoting. Such an activity places higher demands on the knee, almost similar to those found during high-level sports. Type of Study: Case control series study. Methods: We assessed 11 patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction with the same arthroscopic technique using a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, 11 ACL-deficient subjects who had sustained the injury more than 1 year prior to testing, and 11 matched controls. Kinematic data were collected (50 Hz) with a 6 -camera optoelectronic system while the subjects performed the following task: they jumped off a 40 -cm platform and landed on the ground. After foot contact, the subjects were instructed to pivot at 90 degrees and walk away from the platform. The evaluation period was identified from initial foot contact with the ground with both legs, included the pivoting of the ipsilateral leg, and was completed on touchdown of the contralateral leg. Results: Significant differences were found between the reconstructed leg of the ACL group and the healthy control, and between the deficient leg of the ACL-deficient group and the healthy control. We also found no significant differences between the deficient leg of the ACL-deficient group and the reconstructed leg of the ACL reconstructed group. Conclusions: It was concluded that, under high-stress activities, ACL reconstruction may not restore tibial rotation to the previous physiological level, even though anterior tibial translation is restored. Future research on ACL reconstruction should focus on the development of new surgical procedures and/or grafts to address this problem. Level of Evidence: Level III...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND In girls, puberty is {{accompanied}} by the adolescent growth spurt, a large influx of oestrogen, {{as well as an}} increased risk of sustaining a non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. The rapid growth and hormonal changes experienced by girls throughout puberty are thought {{to play a role in}} this increased injury risk, contributing to altered lower limb inertial properties, ultimately affecting lower limb flexibility and strength, with the potential to influence landing biomechanics. However, the longitudinal changes in musculoskeletal structure and function, as well as oestrogen levels, in addition to the longitudinal development of landing technique throughout the adolescent growth spurt in girls, remains unclear. THESIS AIM The primary purpose of this thesis was to investigate the longitudinal changes in musculoskeletal structure and function, as well as the oestrogen levels, during the adolescent growth spurt in girls and the influence of these changes on lower limb landing biomechanics. METHODS Forty-six healthy girls, aged 10 - 13 years, were recruited for this longitudinal study based on their pubertal development (Tanner Stage II-III) and their time from peak height velocity (maturity offset; - 6 to - 4 months or 0 months). Participants were tested up to four times during the 12 months of their adolescent growth spurt, according to their maturity offset (Test 1 : maturity offset = - 6 to - 4 months, Test 2 : maturity offset = 0 months, Test 3 : maturity offset = + 4 months, Test 4 : maturity offset = + 8 months). During the laboratory test sessions, each participant’s anthropometric characteristics, oestrogen levels, anterior knee joint laxity, lower limb flexibility, isokinetic strength and landing biomechanics were collected and recorded. The landing task performed was a horizontal leap movement, during which ground reaction forces (1, 000 Hz), lower limb electromyography (1, 000 Hz) and kinematic data (100 Hz) were collected. Monthly tracking was also conducted, so as to estimate maturity offset using anthropometric data, as well as to determine monthly fluctuations in lower limb flexibility and strength. Results from this longitudinal study were analysed and presented in four chapters (Chapter 3 - 6), with each chapter systematically contributing to the overall thesis aim. The primary purpose of Chapter 3 was to determine the longitudinal changes in anthropometry, anterior knee joint laxity, lower limb flexibility and strength, as well as the oestrogen levels, in pubescent girls during their growth spurt. Based on the findings from Chapter 3, the effects of variations in hamstring muscle strength (Chapter 4) and anterior knee joint laxity (Chapter 5) on the lower limb landing biomechanics of these pubescent girls were investigated. Finally, based on the longitudinal musculoskeletal changes displayed by girls in Chapter 3, the final experimental chapter of this thesis investigated the longitudinal changes in lower limb landing technique displayed by pubescent girls through their adolescent growth spurt (Chapter 6). MAJOR CONCLUSIONS Based on the findings of this thesis it was concluded that during the adolescent growth spurt, pubescent girls display rapid growth of their lower limbs, an increase in anterior knee laxity, as well as a lag in the development of their hamstring muscle strength relative to their quadriceps muscle strength. The combination of these rapid and differential musculoskeletal structural and functional changes are thought to decrease knee joint <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> <b>landing</b> and are likely to contribute to the changes in landing technique that were evident during this time of rapid growth. The outcomes of this research provide a greater understanding of the lower limb musculoskeletal structural and functional changes throughout the adolescent growth spurt in girls, as well as the influence of these changes on landing technique in these pubescent girls...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to evaluate the effect of taping on the dynamic postural <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> a jump <b>landing</b> protocol in subjects with chronic ankle instability (CAI). Therefore, 28 subjects with CAI performed a sagittal and frontal plane landing task in a non-taped and taped condition. As main outcome measure, the dynamic postural control index (DPSI) was calculated. In addition, subjective feelings of instability and perceived difficulty level were assessed. Furthermore, mechanical effectiveness of the tape on the ankle joint was determined by registering 3 D kinematics. Three subjects were excluded based on discomfort <b>during</b> the <b>landing</b> protocol. Study {{results indicated that the}} tape reduced plantar flexion and inversion at the ankle at touch down and range of motion in the landing phase. There was, however, no effect on the DPSI nor on its directional subcomponents. Subjective feelings of stability with tape improved significantly, whereas perceived difficulty did not change. In conclusion, our taping procedure did not improve postural control during a sagittal and frontal plane landing task in subjects with CAI. Perceived instability did improve and is considered an important treatment outcome, which suggests that taping could be considered as a treatment modality by clinicians...|$|R
5000|$|Extensive {{wind tunnel}} testing {{performed}} at the Swedish Royal University of Technology and by the National Aeronautical Research Institute had also influenced aspects of the aircraft's aerodynamics, such as stability and trim across the aircraft's speed range. These tests had determined the required slenderness of the fuselage {{in order to ensure}} compatibility with the targeted critical Mach number, as well as supporting the use of a straight-through airflow system to ensure the maximum attainable thrust, in addition to the advantages of its ease of development. For the reason of lateral <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> take-off and <b>landing,</b> automatically-locking leading edge slots, which were interconnected with the flaps, were also deemed necessary. In order to further test the design of the swept wing, it was decided to modify a single Saab Safir, which received the designation Saab 201, with a full-scale wing for a series of flight tests. [...] The first 'final' sketches of the aircraft, incorporating the new information, was drawn in January 1946.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare dynamic {{stability}} and landing kinetics, on land and in water, between young and middle-aged adults performing plyometric exercises. Twenty adults were asked to volunteer: Young = 24. 40 ± 2. 63 years, n = 10 and middle-aged = 46. 80 ± 3. 05 years, n = 10. Participants performed three plyometric exercises (countermovement jump, squat jump, and drop landing) on land and in waist-deep water. Dynamic <b>stability</b> was assessed <b>during</b> <b>landing</b> for each exercise using a time to stabilization (TTS) paradigm. Kinetic measures included time to peak force, peak force, rate of force development (RFD), and impulse. Data were collected via a waterproof force plate positioned on an adjustable-depth pool floor and analyzed with a 2 (age) X 6 (condition) repeated measures ANOVA. Results revealed TTS was greater on land (1. 45 ± 0. 12 s) than in water (1. 35 ± 0. 12 s) for two jumps (p = 0. 01). Peak force, RFD, and impulse were greater on land (33...|$|R
40|$|Landing from jumps {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of injury within dance. A number of studies have {{reported}} a negative effect of shoe midsole thickness on lower limb kinematics during running due to the reduction in afferent sensory outputs from the foot's epithelium. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of varying midsole thicknesses in dance shoes on dynamic postural <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> a single-leg <b>landing.</b> Twenty-eight female undergraduate dance participants volunteered for the study. They carried out three trials under four conditions: barefoot and in ballet flats (2 mm midsole thickness), jazz shoes (7 mm), and dance sneakers (30 mm). The task consisted of a single-leg forward jump over a hurdle at 50 % of their maximal vertical jump height, landing on a force platform, and balancing for 3 seconds. The stability indices for vertical stability (VSI), anterior-posterior stability (APSI), medial-lateral stability (MLSI), and dynamic postural stability (DPSI) were calculated using Wikstrom's revised method. Significant differences were reported between the midsole thicknesses for both DPSI and VSI (p< 0. 01). No statistical differences were noted for the indices SPSI or MLSI. The present data agree with the running studies in that increased midsole thickness has a negative influence on landing stability...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to quantify <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> recovery from forward loss of balance in young and older adults, older single steppers (OSS) and older multiple steppers (OMS), and to identify the biomechanical factors associated with <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> balance recovery. Forward loss of balance was achieved by releasing participants from a static forward lean angle. Participants regained balance by taking one or more rapid steps. Stability was quantified using the margin of stability (MoS), which was computed as the anterio-posterior distance between the forward boundary of the base-of-support and the vertical projection of the velocity adjusted centre of mass. MoS at foot contact and at maximal knee joint flexion angle following foot contact (KJMAX) were smaller in older compared to young adults, and in OMS compared to OSS. Compared to young adults, older adults exhibited a shorter recovery step length, greater trunk flexion angles and exhibited smaller peak knee flexion angles. Trunk flexion angle at foot contact (r = - 0. 55) and step length (r = 0. 54) were significantly correlated with MoS at foot contact and together accounted for 51 % of the variance in MoS at foot contact. MoS at foot contact was significantly correlated with MoS at KJMAX (r = 0. 88) and together with peak knee flexion angle <b>during</b> the <b>landing</b> phase (r = 0. 60) and peak knee extension moment <b>during</b> the <b>landing</b> phase (r = 0. 47) accounted for 84 % of the variance in MoS at KJMAX. Overall findings suggest that stability in the first step is lower for older compared to young adults and for multiple compared to single steppers, and that spatial-temporal, kinematic and kinetic factors are associated with <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> recovery from forward loss of balance.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} hydrocolloids on the gelatinisation behaviour of hard wheat flour were investigated. Influence of guar, xanthan, Arabic, {{carboxy methyl cellulose}} (CMC) and tragacanth gums on wheat flour was studied using micro viscoamylograph. It was found that all hydrocolloids except tragacanth greatly modified the gelatinisation properties of wheat flour. Guar and xanthan significantly lowered the gelatinisation temperature, enhanced peak viscosity, increased the breakdown during cooking, promoted the <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> cooling and thus decreased the tendency to setback. Gum Arabic lowers the peak viscosity, reduces breakdown during heating and thus provides increased <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> cooking. The addition of CMC to the wheat flour resulted in maximum <b>stability</b> <b>during</b> cooling. It also produced large breakdown during heating which provided maximum destabilization and made the cooking easier. These results suggest that by adding gums gelatinisation properties of wheat flour can be greatly modified and this {{could be used for}} the improvement of different wheat products...|$|R
