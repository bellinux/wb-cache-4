5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, Automatic Train Control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab <b>signaling</b> <b>equipment</b> for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E

25|$|Ocelot transited the Panama Canal and, {{following}} a brief stop in San Diego, arrived at Pearl Harbor to undergo conversion to flagship for Service Squadron 10. The ship was fitted with extensive radio and visual <b>signaling</b> <b>equipment,</b> with radio and coding {{rooms in the}} superstructure, and berths for the squadron commander, staff officers, and enlisted men below. The conversion was completed in October, and Ocelot sailed via Eniwetok for Ulithi where she spent {{the next six months}} providing an administrative post at the advanced base. The movement of American forces closer to Japan necessitated advancing support elements as well, and on 24 May 1945 Ocelot shifted to San Pedro Bay, Leyte On 13 September Ocelot again moved, to Buckner Bay, Okinawa. Shortly after her arrival there, on 19 September 1945 Typhoon Ida struck.|$|E
500|$|Point Welcome was patrolling Area 1A1 {{immediately}} {{south of}} the DMZ {{in the early morning}} hours of 11 August 1966. At 03:40 the cutter was illuminated by an U.S. Air Force forward air controller (FAC) who mistook her for an enemy vessel. The FAC called in one B-57 Canberra tactical bomber and two F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber aircraft which proceeded to strafe the cutter for about one hour, each making from seven to nine passes. Point Welcome turned on all of her running and docking lights when first illuminated by the FAC aircraft and contacted the CSC by radio telling them that they were being illuminated by aircraft. During the first pass all of the crew on the bridge were wounded and the commanding officer, Lieutenant Junior Grade David Brostrom, was killed along with the helmsman, Engineman Second Class Jerry Phillips. All <b>signaling</b> <b>equipment,</b> electronics and radios were knocked out on the first pass. Point Welcome began evasive maneuvers at the direction of Chief Boatswains Mate Richard Patterson, who had assumed command after the executive officer was seriously injured. Patterson attempted to avoid the illumination lights of the attacking aircraft and move out of the way of the strafing aircraft. At 04:15 Patterson decided that the best course of action was to beach the cutter and move the wounded ashore, however when this was attempted, the crew came under fire from unknown sources from the shoreline. At 04:25 Point Orient and [...] arrived on the scene and started rescue proceedings. In addition to the commanding officer, one other crewman was killed, nine other crewmen were injured along with a RVN liaison officer and civilian freelance journalist Tim Page. The bridge of the cutter was severely damaged and despite nine [...] wide holes in the main deck, the hull was undamaged. Point Welcome was escorted back to Da Nang under her own power and required three months to repair the damage. Patterson saved the cutter and the surviving crew at great risk to himself. He was awarded a Bronze Star with the combat [...] "V" [...] device for his actions.|$|E

40|$|In {{the history}} of railway <b>signaling,</b> <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> evolved with the {{development}} of electronics technologies from machines to relays, electricity, electrons, and computers. Especially, since the establishment of JR East, technological breakthroughs have enabled the establishment of innovative systems such as ATOS, COSMOS, and digital ATC with computer and network technologies. Signal control at front-line train operations, however, still relied on wiring technologies, and this caused transport disruptions on the Chuo line in September 2003. We have been developing a new network signal control system as a measure to deal with this problem, and this paper describes what kind of research and development will be demanded now and in the future. 1 Development of railway <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> follows a vicious circle pattern; new <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> is introduced after a major accident in order to avoid reoccurrence of the same kind of accidents, then a new accident that reveals blind spots of that new <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> occurs, and again, a new measure is implemented. In the early stage of <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> development, accidents triggered the introduction of new <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> to answer the question of how <b>signal</b> <b>equipment</b> should prevent accidents. Today, new systems are being developed based on the need to answer the question of how operation efficiency and customer service can be improved while maintaining safety. Control of signals and point switches installed at operation sites however had problems since they used old-style wiring technologies. In this paper, I would like us to review {{the history of}} railway signal systems, discuss the innovative systems that have been created so far, including not only train operations but also transportation that have been carried out since the establishment of JR East. Then I would like to clarify the current signal system problems, and describe what future signal systems should be like. 2 Special feature articl...|$|R
