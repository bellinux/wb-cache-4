5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|Underway {{again on}} 6 December, Balao {{spent two days}} in {{training}} exercises and practice approaches with Coucal as her target. On 13 December, the submarine conducted communication and identification tests with friendly search planes and then began her patrol. No surface contacts came {{during the first two}} weeks, but her luck changed on 27 December when two s and two s crossed her track. The four warships maneuvered in a radical zigzag plan at a speed of , passing the submarine so rapidly that she only managed a shot at the second cruiser. Balao fired four torpedoes which overran their target. While rigging for depth charges, she heard three explosions, but upon surfacing, could see no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage.</b> The warships were long gone at their high speed.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{fuselage}} {{was destroyed in}} the fire. Exceptions included the nose and {{the underside of the}} cockpit. The tips of the wings and ailerons were nearly undamaged. The front wing spar was sufficiently intact that it was able to keep the wings together. The inner parts of the wing, including the spoilers, were destroyed, but two of the spoiler actuators were salvageable. The tail was largely intact. Most light alloy components in the engines were destroyed, although the compressor blades were intact and showed no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> prior to impact. Three components – the left main landing gear, an engine cowling and the outer right engine – were found between the runway and the wreckage, and had not been consumed in fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite big enough, chief, but {{it would}} be deeper in the water, and the heavier it is the harder it will bump against any rock it meets; the lighter they are the better. You see, this other canoe, which I dare say struck a dozen times on its way down, shows no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> except the two rents in the skin, that we can mend in a few minutes. Another thing is, two boats are {{absolutely}} necessary for this work of letting down by ropes, of which we may expect plenty more. If we had only one, we should be obliged to run every rapid. The only extra trouble that it will give us is at the portages. I think we had better stay here for two or three days, so as to give Jerry a chance of coming round. No doubt we could carry him over the portages just as we can carry the boats, but after such a knock on the head as he has had, it is best that he should be kept quiet for a bit. If his skull is not cracked he won't be long in getting round. He is as hard as nails, and will pull round in the tenth of the time it would take a man in the towns to get over such a knock. It is a pity the halt is not in a better place. There is not a shadow of a chance of finding game among these crags and bare rocks." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{story is}} told of the “loss” of the choir mixture arising from the {{somewhat}} ill-advised attempt of a verger {{to search for a}} gas leak with a naked flame. This action resulted in an explosion causing the loss of the original North Transept window and supposedly the Choir mixture. Curiously there was no apparent <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the case pipes or any other ranks. A probably more plausible explanation is that Edmund Schulze substituted the 2 rank Flauto Gambe in place of the Mixture originally specified in his father’s quotation.|$|E

The fact that all but four Eagles are {{non-operational}} and the main generators show no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> but are only putting out minimum power indicates that the sphere's occupants have purposefully compromised Alpha's defences. David Kano reveals that Clifford had accessed and scanned classified information during his mad session with Computer.

Victor Bergman comments that he thinks the aliens will not be surprised; he has a nasty feeling they are now being watched.|$|E
50|$|To my consternation I {{then saw}} the second gun-bearer, a most erratic shot, raising his rifle, from which I knew Bedoni was quite {{as likely to}} get the bullet as the Rhino. My shout of protest was too late; the report rang out, but mercifully the shot went aground, {{while at the same}} moment Bedoni lost his footing and fell {{just in front of the}} beast which blundered onwards {{straight}} over his outstretched form. His teeth were chattering and his wrist was badly bruised by the animal's foot, but otherwise there was no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> and in a few moments we were steadied enough to look for our quarry lying motionless close by.|$|E

50|$|An {{inability}} to form facial expressions {{on one side}} of the face may be the first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the nerve of these muscles. Damage to the facial nerve results in facial paralysis of the muscles of facial expression on the involved side. Paralysis is the loss of voluntary muscle action; the facial nerve has become damaged permanently or temporarily. This damage can occur with a stroke (cerebrovascular accident or CVA), Bell palsy, or parotid salivary gland cancer (malignant neoplasm) because the facial nerve travels through the gland. The parotid gland can also be damaged permanently by surgery or temporarily by trauma. These situations of paralysis not only inhibit facial expression but also seriously impair the patient’s ability to speak, either permanently or temporarily.|$|E

5000|$|Untamed {{was on a}} {{training}} exercise with the 8th Escort Group in the Firth of Clyde on 30 May 1943 acting as a target.In the second exercise that day, Untamed {{was used as a}} target for anti-submarine mortar practice by the yacht Shemara. When the submarine did not respond to attempts to contact her nor surface, assistance was summoned. Shemara located Untamed with sonar and heard the sounds of her engines being run and tanks being blown. [...] arrived but no more was heard from Untamed after 17:45 - nearly three hours from the first indication of a problem. Weather prevented divers inspecting the submarine until 1 June. There was no outward <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> and it was not until after Untamed was salvaged on 5 July 1943 that it was found that she had been flooded through a sluice valve.|$|E

50|$|On 17 April 2010, the {{president}} of German airline Air Berlin, {{in an interview with}} the newspaper Bild am Sonntag, stated that the risks for flights due to this volcanic haze were nonexistent, because the assessment was based only on a computer simulation produced by the VAAC. He went on to claim that the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt closed German airspace without checking the accuracy of these simulations. Spokesmen for Lufthansa and KLM stated that during their test flights, required by the European Union, there were no problems with the aircraft. On the morning of 17 April Lufthansa moved 10 aircraft from Munich to Frankfurt at low altitude following visual flight rules. There were no problems reported and no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the planes. The same day, an Airbus belonging to Ural Airlines attempted flying below the ash clouds from Moscow to Rimini. When the airplane was in Austrian airspace, the crew reported being low on fuel and diverted to Vienna, where the airplane landed safely.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a multi-camera system for parcel inspection which detects <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> and cues <b>of</b> tampering. The proposed {{system has been}} developed within the EU project SAFEPOST {{as a part of}} a multi-sensor scanning modality, to enhance safety and security of parcels travelling on the European Postal Supply Chain. Our work addresses in particular the safety of valuable goods, whose presence on the postal supply chain is in steady growth. The method we propose is based on extracting 3 D shape and appearance information, detecting in real-time <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> or tampering, and storing the model for future comparative analysis when required by the system. We provide an experimental evidence of the effectiveness of the method, both in laboratory and field tests.|$|R
