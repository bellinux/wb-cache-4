As the primary effort of the ARBiH offensive bogged down the same day, Kupres became the main objective. The 317th Mountain Infantry Brigade was added to augment the ARBiH force that made initial advances towards Kupres. The next day, as the ARBiH gradually advanced, elements of the 305th Mountain Brigade were also sent as reinforcements to the attacking force. By 23 October, the ARBiH moved close enough to Kupres to direct heavy mortar fire against the town. On 25 October, the ARBiH 7th Corps requested {{a meeting with the}} HVO Tomislavgrad Corps representatives to coordinate further advances in the area, however the HVO postponed the meeting until after 28 October due to replacement of the Tomislavgrad Corps commanding officer. On 27 October, the ARBiH 37th Light Infantry Brigade was added to the attack, slowly progressing from one mountain ridge to the next. In addition, elements of the 27th Mountain Infantry Brigade and a battalion of the 7th Conscripted Mountain Infantry Brigade joined the ARBiH push. On 28 November, the ARBiH General Staff committed a guards brigade attached to the General Staff to the battle.|$|E

The HVO wanted to reverse April 1992 loss of the town, home to a significant Croat community before the war, and to control the Tomislavgrad–Bugojno–Šipovo road. The ARBiH advance towards Kupres was planned as a <b>secondary</b> <b>axis</b> of its offensive towards Donji Vakuf, [...] to the northwest, codenamed Autumn-94. The ARBiH wanted to deny the VRS a supply route passing through Kupres in order to weaken VRS defence around Donji Vakuf.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} common LC phases is the nematic. The word nematic comes from the Greek [...] (...) , which means [...] "thread". This term {{originates}} from the thread-like topological defects observed in nematics, which are formally called 'disclinations'. Nematics also exhibit so-called [...] "hedgehog" [...] topological defects. In a nematic phase, the calamitic or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel. Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order. Most nematics are uniaxial: they have one axis that is longer and preferred, with the other two being equivalent (can be approximated as cylinders or rods). However, some liquid crystals are biaxial nematics, meaning that in addition to orienting their long axis, they also orient along a <b>secondary</b> <b>axis.</b> Nematics have fluidity similar to that of ordinary (isotropic) liquids but they can be easily aligned by an external magnetic or electric field. Aligned nematics have the optical properties of uniaxial crystals and this makes them extremely useful in liquid-crystal displays (LCD).|$|E

The matrix of allotments reflects the persistent use of the medieval layout; the division and multiplication of this module had its origin in the variations of the architectural typology. The space constructed is dominated by living spaces implanted in long narrow lots, of three- to four-storeys in height, with asymmetric facades consisting of windows along the various storeys and staircases along the lateral flanks.

2500|$|Beyond their {{propaganda}} and censorship efforts, Antonescu and his regime had a sizable impact on Romanian culture, art and literature. Owing to austere guidelines on culture {{and to the}} circumstances of wartime, this period's direct imprint is {{less than that of}} other periods in the country's history. Few large heroes' memorials were built during the war years. Memorials produced at the time were mainly roadside triptychs (troițe). The Heroes' Cult organization received expropriation rights to Bucharest's Jewish cemetery in 1942, and proposed to replace it with a major monument of this category, but that plan was eventually abandoned. Antonescu and his wife preferred donating to Orthodox churches, and were ktitors of churches in three separate Bucharest areas: Mărgeanului Church in Rahova, one in Dămăroaia, and the Saints Constantine and Helena Church in Muncii, where both the Marshal and his wife are depicted in a mural. After floods took a toll on his native Argeș County, the Marshal himself established Antonești, a model village in Corbeni (partly built by Ukrainian prisoners of war, and later passed into state property), while ordering hydroelectric exploitation of the Argeș River. He also had sporadic contacts with the artistic and literary environment, including an interview he awarded to his supporter, writer Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești. His 1946 trial was notably attended and documented by George Călinescu {{in a series of articles}} for Națiunea journal. Political humor of the 1940s preserved distinct images of the Romanian leader. Romanian jokes circulated under Antonescu's rule ridiculed his adoption of the title Marshal of Romania, viewing it as a self-promotion and dubbing him the [...] "Auto-Marshal". During the war, Soviet agitprop portrayed Antonescu and the other <b>secondary</b> <b>Axis</b> leaders as villains and servile dog-like creatures, representations notably present in musical theater and puppetry shows, as well as in press cartoons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Activity of the Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) pathway is {{essential}} to the establishment of body axes and tissue differentiation in bilaterians. Orthologs for core pathway members have been found in all metazoans, but uncertain homology of the body axes and tissues patterned by these signals raises questions about the activities of these molecules across the metazoan tree. We focus on the principal canonical transduction proteins (R-Smads) of the TGFβ pathway, which instruct both axial patterning and tissue differentiation in the developing embryo. We compare the activity of R-Smads from a cnidarian (Nematostella vectensis), an arthropod (Drosophila melanogaster), and a vertebrate (Xenopus laevis) in Xenopus embryonic assays. Results Overexpressing NvSmad 1 / 5 ventralized Xenopus embryos when expressed in dorsal blastomeres, similar to the effects of Xenopus Smad 1. However, NvSmad 1 / 5 was less potent than XSmad 1 in its ability to activate downstream target genes in Xenopus animal cap assays. NvSmad 2 / 3 strongly induced general mesendodermal marker genes, but weakly induced ones involved in specifying the Spemann organizer. NvSmad 2 / 3 was unable to induce a <b>secondary</b> trunk <b>axis</b> in Xenopus embryos, whereas the orthologs from Xenopus (XSmad 2 and XSmad 3) and Drosophila (dSmad 2) were capable of doing so. Replacement of the NvSmad 2 / 3 MH 2 domain with the Xenopus XSmad 2 MH 2 slightly increased its inductive capability, but did not confer an ability to generate a <b>secondary</b> body <b>axis.</b> Conclusions Vertebrate and cnidarian Smad 1 / 5 have similar axial patterning and induction activities, although NvSmad 1 / 5 is less efficient than the vertebrate gene. We conclude that the activities of Smad 1 / 5 orthologs have been largely conserved across Metazoa. NvSmad 2 / 3 efficiently activates general mesendoderm markers, but is unable to induce vertebrate organizer-specific genes or to produce a <b>secondary</b> body <b>axis</b> in Xenopus. Orthologs dSmad 2 and XSmad 3 generate a <b>secondary</b> body <b>axis,</b> but activate only low expression of organizer-specific genes that are strongly induced by XSmad 2. We suggest that in the vertebrate lineage, Smad 2 has evolved a specialized role in the induction of the embryonic organizer. Given the high level of sequence identity between Smad orthologs, this work underscores the functional importance of the emergence and fixation of a few divergent amino acids among orthologs during evolution. </p...|$|R

Dual axis trackers typically have modules oriented parallel to the <b>secondary</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation.

40|$|AbstractDuring chick gastrulation, {{inhibition}} of BMP signaling {{is required for}} primitive streak formation and induction of Hensen's node.

Grafts of cells expressing TSK {{in combination with the}} middle primitive streak induce an ectopic Hensen's node, while electroporation of TSK siRNA inhibits induction of the node. In Xenopus embryos, TSK can block BMP function and induce a <b>secondary</b> dorsal <b>axis,</b> while it can dorsalize ventral mesoderm and induce neural tissue in embryonic explants.

40|$|The startling {{capacity}} of the amphibian Spemann organizer to induce naïve cells to form a Siamese twin embryo with {{a second set of}} body axes is one of the hallmarks of developmental biology. However, the axis-inducing potential of the blastopore-associated tissue is commonly regarded as a chordate feature. Here we show that the blastopore lip of a non-bilaterian metazoan, the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, possesses the same capacity and uses the same molecular mechanism for inducing extra axes as chordates: Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We also demonstrate that the establishment of the <b>secondary,</b> directive <b>axis</b> in Nematostella by BMP signaling is sensitive to an initial Wnt signal, but once established the directive axis becomes Wnt-independent. By combining molecular analysis with experimental embryology, we provide evidence that the emergence of the Wnt/β-catenin driven blastopore-associated axial organizer predated the cnidarian-bilaterian split over 600 million years ago...|$|R

Expression of the TRAMP mRNA in mesenchyme cells during budding and its upregulation by retinoic acid were demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization.

To analyze its function, we attempted to block the BMP signaling pathway in Xenopus embryos by using a dominant-negative mutant of the BMP receptor. When the mutant receptor lacking the putative serine/threonine kinase domain was expressed in ventral blastomeres of Xenopus embryos, these blastomeres were respecified to dorsal mesoderm, eventually resulting in the formation of a <b>secondary</b> body <b>axis.</b> These findings suggest that endogenous BMP- 2 and BMP- 4 are involved in the dorsal-ventral specification in the embryo and that ventral fate requires induction rather than resulting from an absence of dorsal specification...|$|R
