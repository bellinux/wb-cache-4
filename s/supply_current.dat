25|$|The WRIM is used {{primarily}} {{to start a}} high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low <b>supply</b> <b>current</b> from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.|$|E
25|$|The {{sizes of}} the {{cavities}} determine the resonant frequency, {{and thereby the}} frequency of the emitted microwaves. However, the frequency is not precisely controllable. The operating frequency varies with changes in load impedance, with changes in the <b>supply</b> <b>current,</b> and with the temperature of the tube. This is not a problem in uses such as heating, or in some forms of radar where the receiver can be synchronized with an imprecise magnetron frequency. Where precise frequencies are needed, other devices, such as the klystron are used.|$|E

25|$|If {{a purely}} {{resistive}} load {{is connected to}} a power <b>supply,</b> <b>current</b> and voltage will change polarity in step, the power factor will be 1, and the electrical energy flows in a single direction across the network in each cycle. Inductive loads such as induction motors (any type of wound coil) consume reactive power with current waveform lagging the voltage. Capacitive loads such as capacitor banks or buried cable generate reactive power with current phase leading the voltage. Both types of loads will absorb energy during part of the AC cycle, which is stored in the device's magnetic or electric field, only to return this energy back to the source {{during the rest of}} the cycle.|$|E
25|$|The United States Revenue Cutter Service cutter Onondaga {{was built}} at Cleveland, Ohio in 1898 by the Globe Iron Works. She was a steel-hulled vessel {{equipped}} with a triple-expansion steam engine, Scotch boilers, and a single screw. She {{was one of the}} first RCS cutters built with electric generators to <b>supply</b> <b>current</b> for lights and call bells. Before Onondaga could be completed, she was transferred to U.S. Navy control because of the outbreak of the Spanish–American War on 24 March 1898 and the contractor was directed to cut the ship in half for transport to Ogdensburg, New York. She was reassembled and was finally accepted for service by the government 13 August and returned to Department of the Treasury control on 17 August at the conclusion of hostilities. She was placed in commission 24 October at Ogdensburg and ordered to report for duty at Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|The United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve could, on its own, <b>supply</b> <b>current</b> U.S. {{demand for}} about a month {{in the event of an}} emergency, unless it were also {{destroyed}} or inaccessible in the emergency. This could potentially be the case if a major storm were to hit the Gulf of Mexico, where the reserve is located. While total consumption has increased, the western economies are less reliant on oil than they were twenty-five years ago, due both to substantial growth in productivity and the growth of sectors of the economy with little oil dependence such as finance and banking, retail, etc. The decline of heavy industry and manufacturing in most developed countries has reduced the amount of oil per unit GDP; however, since these items are imported anyway, there is less change in the oil dependence of industrialized countries than the direct consumption statistics indicate.|$|E
30|$|The {{main idea}} of the energy source {{emulation}} is to control the voltage and the <b>current</b> <b>supplied</b> to the powered device {{by means of a}} digital system in an attempt to follow a modeled energy source. A possible architecture capable to digitally control the voltage and the <b>current</b> <b>supplied</b> to a generic load can be represented by a system which continuously measures the <b>supplied</b> <b>current</b> and immediately acts in feedback to the generated voltage following any predefined policy. To this purpose in our emulator prototype a main microcontroller equipped with both and ADC, which measures the <b>supplied</b> <b>current,</b> and a DAC, used to impose a particular output voltage, has been used.|$|R
30|$|The {{first set}} of {{experiments}} was carried out to deeply characterize the capability of the emulator to measure the <b>current</b> <b>supplied</b> to the powered device. For this purpose the emulator was programmed to generate a constant output in terms of voltage and, at the same time, to measure the <b>supplied</b> <b>current.</b> Understanding the capability to measure the <b>supplied</b> <b>current</b> is crucial because an error on its determination will introduce an obvious approximation on the model computation which results on a gap between emulation and reality regardless of the approximation of the implemented model.|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the main}} factors which govern the {{performance}} of an electrochemical grinding process include <b>current</b> <b>supplied,</b> rotation speed of the grinding wheel, the workpiece feed rate, the type of electrolyte used, electrolyte feed rate, and the workpiece's chemical properties.

Increasing the <b>supplied</b> <b>current,</b> rotation speed of the wheel, electrolyte feed rate, or the workpiece feed rate will {{lead to an increase}} in material removal rate (MRR), while decreasing these properties will do the opposite. If the workpiece is more reactive to the electrolyte used, then the material removal rate will increase.
