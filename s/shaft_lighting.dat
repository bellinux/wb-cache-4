5000|$|Gustave Trouvé next invented his “Photophore”, or {{battery-powered}} frontal headlamp, {{which he}} developed for a client, Dr Paul Hélot, an ear-nose-and throat specialist of Rouen. This wearable, direct <b>shaft,</b> <b>lighting</b> {{system could be}} oriented by head movements, so freeing the hands of its wearer. A file of correspondence between these two men enables one to place this invention during 1883. Trouvé soon modified their frontal headlamp both for use by miners, rescue workers, and later by speleologists, in dark surroundings, but also by tinting the light with various colors as theater jewelry for artiste troupes in Paris and Europe. The latter became known as “luminous electric jewels” and was the forerunner of today's wearable technology.In 1884, Trouvé fitted an electric boat with both electric horn and a bow-mounted frontal headlamp, the first time such electrical accessories had ever been fitted on any mode of transport. He developed a portable electric safety lamp. [...] In 1887, Trouvé, whose brand name was Eureka (Greek: εὕρηκα =“I have found”, translated into French “J’ai trouvé), developed his auxanoscope, an electric slide projector for itinerant teachers (1887).Around the same period, Trouvé, a confirmed bachelor uninterested in commercialization, turned his fertile mind skywards. Convinced that the future lay with heavier-the-air machines, he flew a tethered model electric helicopter, the ancestor of the Sikorsky Firefly. [...] He next built an ornithopter, the wings of which flapped using a rapid succession gun cartridges, enabling it to make a noisy {{but at the time}} unheard-of flight of 80 meters.|$|E

This paper proposes a method for creating outdoor images including <b>shafts</b> of <b>light</b> caused by mountains and clouds. In our method, <b>shafts</b> of <b>light</b> are displayed by subtracting the intensity of the shielded light.

40|$|The {{display of}} {{realistic}} natural scenes {{is one of}} the most important research areas in computer graphics. The rendering of water {{is one of the}} essential components. This paper proposes an efficient method for rendering images of scenes within water. For underwater scenery, the <b>shafts</b> of <b>light</b> and caustics are attractive and important elements. However, computing these effects is difficult and time-consuming since light refracts when passing through waves. To address the problem, our method makes use of graphics hardware to accelerate the computation. Our method displays the <b>shafts</b> of <b>light</b> by accumulating the intensities of streaks of light by using hardware color blending functions. Making use of a Z-buffer and a stencil buffer accelerates the rendering of caustics. Moreover, by using a shadow mapping technique, our method can display <b>shafts</b> of <b>light</b> and caustics taking account of shadows due to objects...|$|R
