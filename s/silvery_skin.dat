25|$|They operate {{very well}} in {{oxidizing}} atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen {{with a small amount}} of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as green rot, due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled <b>silvery</b> <b>skin</b> and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem is to see whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).|$|E
60|$|Enamoured of the tropics, {{despite the}} damage done me, I stopped in various places, and was a long while {{getting back to the}} splendid, {{temperate}} climate of California. I did my thousand words a day, travelling or stopping over, suffered my last faint fever shock, saw my <b>silvery</b> <b>skin</b> vanish and my sun-torn tissues healthily knit again, and drank as a broad-shouldered chesty man may drink.|$|E
60|$|There will be {{hardwood}} floors {{in my house}} beautiful. But these floors will not be polished mirrors nor skating-rinks. They will be just plain and common {{hardwood floors}}. Beautiful carpets are not beautiful to the mind that knows they are filled with germs and bacilli. They are no more beautiful than the hectic flush of fever, or the <b>silvery</b> <b>skin</b> of leprosy. Besides, carpets enslave. A thing that enslaves is a monster, and monsters are not beautiful.|$|E
60|$|The {{endogenous}} monster, {{indigenous to}} the Elysian Fields, {{is to the}} surrounding vegetation what the cockatrice is to the cock, the wyvern to the python. I should say 'was,' for all the replants at Madeira and the Canaries are modern, and resemble only big toothsticks. But 'dragons' proper have existed, and perhaps memories of these portents long lingered in the brain of protohistoric man. Even {{if they had been}} altogether fabulous, the fanciful Hellenic mind would easily have created them. The Dragoeiro with its boa-like bole, its <b>silvery,</b> light-glancing <b>skin,</b> and its scars stained with red blood, growing in a wild garden of glowing red-yellow oranges, would easily become the fiery saurian guarding the golden apples of the Hesperides.|$|R
40|$|Silvery {{hair and}} severe {{dysfunction}} {{of the central}} nervous system (Neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease or Elejalde Syndrome) characterize this rare autosomal recessive syndrome. The main clinical features include silver-leaden hair, bronze skin after sun exposure, and neurologic involvement. Large granules of melanin unevenly distributed in the hair shaft are observed. Abnormal melanocytes and melanosomes and abnormal inclusion bodies in fibroblasts may be present. We report a 10 -year-old girl with silver-leaden (<b>silvery)</b> hair, bronze <b>skin</b> color on sun-exposed areas, generalized hypopigmentation of covered body parts, and congenital seizures. The child was the elder of two children born of a consanguineous marriage. The younger sibling, a female neonate, had the same clinical presentation...|$|R
40|$|Psoriasis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} cutaneous diseases, the prevalence of psoriasis in population is around 2 - 3 %. Diagnosis is based on typical manifestation, anamnesis and histopathological examination. Effectality is assessed by localization, course and measure of the disease. Plaque psoriasis appears as raised areas covered with <b>silvery</b> white scaly <b>skin.</b> T-lymphocytes play the most important role in immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. There is a prevalence of Th 1 lymphocytes. Genetics factors have a role in predisposition to disease. Psoriasis is associated with the alleles from the MHC. In the treatment of psoriasis is usually used topical and systemic therapy and phototherapy. Biologic treatment of psoriasis is now possible due to the method of molecular genetic. We determine concetrations of sCD 28, sCD 30, endoglin, MCP- 1, Apo- 1 /fas and Fas ligand by ELISA. Follow-up file was made by 38 patients. We investigated importance of these markers for the diagnosis and monitoring of psoriasis. We detected that Apo- 1 /fas and sCD 28 are suitable markers for assignation of diagnosis, while Fas ligand, sCD 30 and endoglin may be used for monitoring of disease and evaluation the effectivity of therapy...|$|R
60|$|In passing, I may {{mention that}} among the other afflictions that jointly {{compelled}} the abandonment of the voyage, was one that is variously called the healthy man's disease, European Leprosy, and Biblical Leprosy. Unlike True Leprosy, nothing is known of this mysterious malady. No doctor has ever claimed a cure for a case of it, though spontaneous cures are recorded. It comes, they know not how. It is, they know not what. It goes, they know not why. Without the use of drugs, merely by living in the wholesome California climate, my <b>silvery</b> <b>skin</b> vanished. The only hope the doctors had held out to me was a spontaneous cure, and such a cure was mine.|$|E
60|$|I went to Australia {{to go into}} {{hospital}} and get tinkered up, after which I planned {{to go on with}} the voyage. And during the long weeks I lay in hospital, from the first day I never missed alcohol. I never thought about it. I knew I should have it again when I was on my feet. But when I regained my feet I was not cured of my major afflictions. Naaman's <b>silvery</b> <b>skin</b> was still mine. The mysterious sun-sickness, which the experts of Australia could not fathom, still ripped and tore my tissues. Malaria still festered in me and put me on my back in shivering delirium at the most unexpected moments, compelling me to cancel a double lecture tour which had been arranged.|$|E
60|$|The sun {{sickness}} got me, {{despite the}} fact that I had been in the tropics only a couple of years. I drank heavily during this time, but right here I wish to forestall misunderstanding. The drinking was not the cause of the sickness, nor of the abandonment of the voyage. I was strong as a bull, and for many months I fought the sun sickness that was ripping and tearing my surface and nervous tissues to pieces. All through the New Hebrides and the Solomons and up among the atolls on the Line, during this period under a tropic sun, rotten with malaria, and suffering from a few minor afflictions such as Biblical leprosy with the <b>silvery</b> <b>skin,</b> I did the work of five men.|$|E
50|$|The dikume is {{a silvery}} {{coloured}} fish with faint vertical barring. It grow {{to a maximum}} length of 11.2 cm. The most distinguishing feature of this species is that when freshly caught the capillaries swell with blood, particularly {{at the base of}} the fins, and oozes out tp stain the fishes otherwise <b>silvery</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the video, {{the ship}} is piloted by a {{humanoid}} alien species. Their distinctive features are <b>silvery</b> <b>skin</b> with dark metallic, scale-patterned features, metallic hair generally styled {{toward the back of}} the head and none of the sides (sometimes reminiscent of the mohawk style), and very large, solid black irises. Their tears, like their eyes, are also solid black. Burnley is the only one shown mostly-exempt from the styling, sporting only the eye modifications. The rest of the band has patterns cut into their hair, eye modifications, and more similar styling to the crew.|$|E

50|$|When the 31 {{boys and}} 30 girls are born they appear normal except for their unusual, golden eyes and pale, <b>silvery</b> <b>skin.</b> These {{children}} {{have none of}} the genetic characteristics of their parents. As they grow up, it becomes increasingly apparent that they are, {{at least in some}} respects, not human. They possess telepathic abilities, and can control others' actions. The Children (they are referred to with a capital C) have two distinct group minds: one for the boys and another for the girls. Their physical development is accelerated compared with that of humans; upon reaching the age of nine, they appear to be sixteen-year-olds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{episode is}} {{generally}} considered {{to be one of the}} best of the fourth series and eventually resulted in two sequels. Return of the Cybernauts in September 1967, starred Peter Cushing as Armstrong's revengeful brother, with Frederick Jaeger returning as his assistant Benson. The New Avengers episode The Last of the Cybernauts...? followed in 1976. Jeffrey S. Miller described the episode as [...] "a tale of industrial intrigue, with several business executives being violently dispatched by someone of apparently superhuman strength." [...] The Encyclopedia of Super Villains describes the Cybernauts as [...] "powerful androids with <b>silvery</b> <b>skin</b> and blank expressions". The 1998 film The Avengers pays homage to the episode with Uma Thurman playing Dr. Peel, a jujitsu expert and specialist in meteorology, [...] "battling a clone duplicate of herself".|$|E
50|$|Virtually all {{materials}} can give specular reflection, provided that their surface can be polished to eliminate irregularities comparable with light wavelength (a {{fraction of a}} micrometer). A few materials, like liquids and glasses, lack the internal subdivisions which give the subsurface scattering mechanism described above, {{so they can be}} clear and give only specular reflection (not great, however), while, among common materials, only polished metals can reflect light specularly with great efficiency (the reflecting material of mirrors usually is aluminum or silver). All other common materials, even when perfectly polished, usually give not more than a few percent specular reflection, except in particular cases, such as grazing angle reflection by a lake, or the total reflection of a glass prism, or when structured in certain complex configurations such as the <b>silvery</b> <b>skin</b> of many fish species or the reflective surface of a dielectric mirror.|$|E
