5|$|Following the Manchester United board's {{search for}} new investors, the Glazers {{purchased}} their first tranche of Manchester United shares on 2 March 2003, spending around £9million on a 2.9% stake, which they purchased through a holding company called Red Football. On 26 September 2003, {{it was reported that}} they had increased their share to 3.17%, taking their <b>shareholding</b> above the 3% threshold that required them to inform the club's management. There had already been considerable speculation {{about the possibility of a}} takeover of the club, either by the Glazers or by one of several other interested parties. By 20 October, they had increased their <b>shareholding</b> to 8.93%, and on 29 November it was reported that they owned around 15% of the club and had met David Gill, its chief executive, to discuss their intentions. On 12 February 2004, the Glazers increased their stake in the club to 16.31% and the following day's Financial Times reported that they had instructed Commerzbank to explore a takeover bid. The club's share price increased by 5% that day, valuing the club at a total of £741million. The Glazers increased their <b>shareholding</b> to over 19% the following June, although they were still not the largest shareholders. Their <b>shareholding</b> continued to increase, nearing 30% by October 2004. Upon reaching 30%, they would have to launch a formal takeover bid.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{football}} club {{was formed in}} 1875, it was not incorporated until 1903. The club remained a private company until 1988, when it was publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange. This public listing, combined with poor financial performance, made Hibs vulnerable to an attempted takeover in 1990 by Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer. This attempt was averted when Mercer was unable to acquire the 75% <b>shareholding</b> needed to liquidate the company.|$|E

40|$|Documents {{evidence}} on the interdependence between the mechanisms used to control the agency costs in Turkish manufacturing firms where the external control devices are restricted {{and most of the}} firms have concentrated ownership. The ownership concentration, board size and composition, managerial <b>shareholdings,</b> institutional <b>shareholdings,</b> and family <b>shareholdings</b> are the selected devices. Evidence reveals that the proportion of insiders on the board is positively related to the percentage of family <b>shareholdings</b> and negatively related to the percentage of foreign institutional <b>shareholdings</b> and ownership concentration. Board size shows a significant negative relation with all the control mechanisms except the debt ratio. The finding that the managerially controlled firms have lower debt ratio than the institutionally controlled firms and the family controlled firms supports the entrenchment hypothesis. The capital market seems to complement the institutional <b>shareholdings,</b> family <b>shareholdings,</b> and ownership concentration in monitoring the CEOs.

40|$|Prior studies {{argue that}} stable {{shareholders}} do not encourage firm managers {{to manage their}} earnings to achieve short-term earnings goals. They also state that firm managers with stable shareholders {{have an incentive to}} report smooth earnings to maintain long-term relationships with such shareholders. We focus on cross-shareholdings and stable <b>shareholdings</b> owned by financial institutions as stable <b>shareholdings</b> in Japan, and investigate the effect of these ownership structures on earnings management patterns. Specifically, we hypothesize that stable <b>shareholdings</b> are positively associated with the informational components of earnings smoothing, and negatively associated with big bath. Consistent with our hypotheses, we first find that as stable <b>shareholdings</b> increase, managers are more likely to conduct earnings smoothing that provides useful information to stable shareholders. Second, we reveal that managers are less likely to engage in big bath behavior as stable <b>shareholdings</b> increase. Finally, our additional analysis shows that stable <b>shareholdings</b> reduce incentives for managers to cut discretionary expenditures to meet short-term earnings benchmarks, implying that stable <b>shareholdings</b> could reduce the possibility of a myopic problem. These results suggest that managers with stable <b>shareholdings</b> tend to report smoother and less volatile earnings, and do not tend to pursue earnings management to attain short-term earnings targets.

5|$|The Glazers' <b>shareholding</b> {{increased}} {{gradually to}} 76.2% by 23 May, {{when they made}} their final offer of 300 pence per share, with a deadline of 3p.m. on 13 June. On 26 May, the Manchester United board wrote to the remaining shareholders indicating their intention to sell their own shares and advising the others to follow suit; in the same letter, chairman Sir Roy Gardner and non-executive directors Ian Much and Jim O'Neill offered their resignations. Despite the board's encouragement, the Glazers' share in the club had only reached 97.3% by 14 June, short of the 97.6% threshold required for a compulsory buyout of all remaining shareholders, prompting them to extend the deadline on their offer to purchase the remaining shares until 27 June. A statement released on 28 June said that Red Football's <b>shareholding</b> had reached 98% (259,950,194 shares), prompting a squeeze out of the remaining shareholders. The final valuation of the club was almost £790million (approximately $1.5billion at the exchange rate at the time).|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, the Boddington family <b>shareholding</b> had {{dwindled to}} around 40 per cent.

In 1961, the brewer Whitbread took a 13 per cent stake in the company. In 1962 the company purchased Richard Clarke & Co of Reddish, Stockport, adding 60 public houses to the firm.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{corporate}} governance (CG) index {{based on the}} requirements of the combined code to examine the effect of CG on major <b>shareholdings</b> of listed non-financial firms in the United Kingdom from 2005 to 2009. We also investigate whether this relationship has changed during the recent financial crisis. In particular, we test the effect of both the level and changes in CG on both the level and changes in total and alternative types of major <b>shareholdings.</b> The results from panel data regressions show that, for the whole studied period, there is a significant positive relationship between CG and total major <b>shareholdings.</b> However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that changes in CG affect changes in major <b>shareholdings.</b> We also find that “board composition and independence” is the only CG sub-index that affects total major <b>shareholdings.</b> Interestingly, we find that different sub-indices of CG appear to affect different types of major <b>shareholdings.</b> Our results also provide evidence that the relationship between CG and major <b>shareholdings</b> changes from insignificant before the financial crisis to significant during the financial crisis, suggesting that major shareholders believe that CG was particularly important during times of financial trouble...|$|R

They then managed to secure the stake of the third-largest stakeholder, Scottish mining entrepreneur Harry Dobson, taking their share total to 62% of the club. By 13 May, the Glazers had bought a further 12.8% stake taking their total ownership to 74.81%, just shy of the 75% threshold {{that would allow them}} to end the club's public limited company (PLC) status and delist it from the London Stock Exchange.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} extent to which the financial characteristics of firms are related to institutional <b>shareholdings.</b> The primary motivation to carry out the study comes from an earlier paper by hessel and Norman (1992), which showed that seven financial ratios discriminated between strongly-held and institutionally-neglected firms. As an extension of the study, the present study seeks to investigate the seven financial ratios among Malaysian companies by identifiying differences in the means of the seven ratios between a group of companies with substantial institutional <b>shareholdings</b> against another group of companies with negligible institutional <b>shareholdings.</b> The findings, from a sample of KLSE listed companies, broadly support the findings by Hessel and Norman (1992), in which firms with signiificant institutional <b>shareholdings</b> exhibited a significantly higher profitability ratio against firms that were neglected by institutional investors...|$|R
5|$|The club's parent company, Forth Investments plc, entered {{receivership}} in 1991. Sir Tom Farmer acquired {{control of}} the club from the receiver for £3million. Farmer has continued to fund developments of Easter Road and financial losses made by Hibs, although he has delegated control to other figures, such as Rod Petrie. As of 2014, the club was 98% owned by its holding company, H.F.C. Holdings Limited. This holding company is beneficially owned by Farmer (90%) and Petrie (10%). In December 2014, the club publicised plans to sell up to 51% ownership of the club to its supporters.

5|$|The {{height of}} the East Terrace was greatly reduced and a roof was erected in the mid-1980s. This work reduced the {{capacity}} to 27,000. Hibs {{was taken over by}} a consortium led by David Duff in 1987. The new regime spent approximately £1 million on executive boxes and refurbishments, but their policy of diversifying the business into property and public houses crippled the club financially when there was an economic downturn in the late 1980s. Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer attempted a takeover of Hibs in June 1990, with the intention of merging the two major Edinburgh football clubs. The Hibs fans protested against this and Mercer was prevented from gaining the 75% <b>shareholding</b> that was needed to close Hibs.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{shareholder}} on the Arsenal {{board is}} American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke. Kroenke first launched {{a bid for}} the club in April 2007, and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities, which acquired its first shares off David Dein in August 2007. Red & White Securities was co-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and Iranian London-based financier Farhad Moshiri, though Usmanov bought Moshiri's stake in 2016. Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9%). In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell-Smith and Danny Fiszman, taking his <b>shareholding</b> to 62.89%.

5|$|As {{managing}} director of the UERL from 1910, Stanley led further transport consolidation with the UERL's take-over of London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) in 1912 and the CLR and the C on 1 January 1913. The LGOC was the dominant bus operator in the capital and its high profitability (it paid dividends of 18 per cent compared with Underground Group companies' dividends of 1 to 3 per cent) subsidised the rest of the group. Through the UERL's <b>shareholding</b> in the London and Suburban Traction Company (LSTC), which it owned jointly with British Electric Traction, the UERL took control in 1913 of the London United Tramways, the Metropolitan Electric Tramways and the South Metropolitan Electric Tramways. The UERL also took control of bus builder AEC. The much enlarged group became known as the Combine. Only the MR (and its subsidiaries the Great Northern & City Railway and the East London Railway) and the W (by then fully owned by the London and South Western Railway) remained outside of the Underground Group's control.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, trade {{along the}} canal commenced; goods {{initially}} {{had to be}} unloaded at Foxhangers {{at the bottom of}} what is now Caen Hill Locks, transported up the hill by a horse-drawn railway, and reloaded into barges at the top. When the flight of locks opened in 1810, allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal, the rate of carriage per ton from London to Bath was £29s6d. This compared well with carriage by road, which cost £63s to £7 per ton, and trade on the canal flourished. In 1812, the Kennet and Avon Canal Company bought the Kennet Navigation, which stretched from Newbury to the junction with the Thames at Kennet Mouth, near Reading. The purchase from Frederick Page cost £100,000, of which £70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back gradually. The purchase was authorised by the Kennet Navigation Act of June 1813, which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at £24 each. At the same time work was undertaken to improve the Avon Navigation, from Bristol to Bath, with the Kennet and Avon Canal Company purchasing a majority <b>shareholding</b> in the Avon Navigation in 1816.|$|E
5|$|Moores {{eventually}} {{sold the}} club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9million. The pair paid £5,000per share, or £174.1m for the total <b>shareholding</b> and £44.8m to cover the club's debts. Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans' lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club. Martin Broughton was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale. In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of {{the club to}} be £350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of £55m, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion. The group's creditors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, took Gillett and Hicks to court {{to force them to}} allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, Mr Justice Floyd, ruled in favour of the creditors and {{paved the way for the}} sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal.
