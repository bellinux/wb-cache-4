40|$|The {{present study}} was a {{retrospective}} chart review (N= 128) that investigated the efficacy of profiles derived from the three factors of the Eating Inventory ® test * (EI) – cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and hunger – to predict successful weight loss in post surgical laparoscopic banding patients at 6 and 9 months post surgery. Although the EI is commonly used in bariatric presurgical assessment, few studies have found consistent relationships between presurgical factor scores and subsequent weight loss in this population. Based on restraint theory, 7 profiles (<b>high</b> CR, <b>super</b> <b>high</b> CR, <b>high</b> D, <b>super</b> <b>high</b> D, <b>high</b> H, <b>super</b> <b>high</b> H, and null) were derived from the raw scores on the subscales of the EI and tested for weight loss predictive ability using direct logistic regression. Results were mixed with <b>high</b> CR, <b>super</b> <b>high</b> CR, and null profiles accurately predicting successful weight loss. Raw scores on the three factors (cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and hunger) were tested individually for predictive ability using direct logistic regression. Overall {{results indicated that the}} profile model accurately predicted more cases than the general factor model. This study significantly contributes to both the bariatric presurgical assessment literature and the restraint theory literature. Suggestions for future research are offered...|$|R
