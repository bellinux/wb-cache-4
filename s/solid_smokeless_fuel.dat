It is expected that these emissions include sulphur and nitrogen oxides, VOCs, and volatile heavy metals and persistent organic compounds from coal. Coal carbonisation plant can be an important source of air contamination on a local scale...|$|E

5000|$|Superheated steam is {{injected}} continuously {{into the top}} of a retort filled by coal. At first, in contact with cool coal, the steam condenses to water acting as a cleaning agent. While temperature of coal rises, the destructive distillation starts. [...] Coal is heated at [...] to [...] in the absence of air. The carbonization temperature is lower compared with [...] to [...] for producing metallurgic coke. The lower temperature optimizes the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar, and therefore it is suitable for processing into fuels.

5000|$|Soon {{after the}} new Parliament assembled, in December 1931 Worthington {{accepted}} the offer from Ramsay MacDonald to act as his Parliamentary Private Secretary, an unpaid post which required him {{to keep in touch}} with the opinion of Government-supporting backbencher Members of Parliament about MacDonald and advise MacDonald how to maintain support. Busy with this duty it was not until April 1932 that he made his maiden speech in support of the Wheat Bill which brought in a subsidy to farmers growing wheat. The next month he called attention to the good example set by Parliament using <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel</b> and said that he would support legislation to make <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel</b> compulsory for London houses above a certain rental level. Worthington also strongly supported the use of hire purchase as [...] "thoroughly good and sound business".|$|R
50|$|This {{contained}} the retorts in which coal was heated {{to generate the}} gas. The crude gas was siphoned off and {{passed on to the}} condenser. The waste product left in the retort was coke.

50|$|Thomas Parker (22 December 1843 - 5 December 1915) was an English {{electrical}} engineer, inventor and industrialist. He patented {{improvements in}} lead-acid batteries and dynamos, {{and was a}} pioneer of manufacturing equipment that powered electric tramways and electric lighting. He invented the <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel</b> Coalite. He formed the first company to distribute electricity over a wide area.|$|R
50|$|Deerpark Mines, {{located about}} 3 km north of Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, were the largest {{opencast}} coalmines in Ireland, giving great employment to the area. Producing anthracite, a natural <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel,</b> which unlike {{other forms of}} coal {{is not a major}} contributor to air pollution and air pollution-related deaths. The mines were connected to the railway system in Ireland in 1919. This railway connection was closed in 1962.|$|R
5000|$|London also {{suffered}} from terrible air pollution, and this {{culminated in the}} [...] "Great Smog" [...] of 1952, which in turn triggered its on legislative response: the Clean Air Act 1956. The basic regulatory structure was to set limits on emissions for households and business (particularly burning coal) while an inspectorate would enforce compliance. It required zones for <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel</b> to be burned and relocated power stations.|$|R
50|$|Since the Rainhill Trials in 1829, it {{had been}} {{accepted}} that the smoke emitted by burning coal was a nuisance. Railway companies accepted the need to burn coke (a <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel)</b> in their locomotives, but this was much more expensive than coal, and several locomotive engineers sought a method by which coal could be burned smokelessly. One such engineer was McConnell, who designed a boiler suitable for coal in 1852.|$|R
25|$|English {{inventor}} Thomas Parker, who {{was responsible}} for innovations such as electrifying the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel</b> coalite, built the first production electric car in London in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries. Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects smoke and pollution were having in London.|$|R
5000|$|Passed {{only after}} several {{particularly}} severe smoke-polluted fogs (called [...] "smog") in London {{and the industrial}} towns had caused health problems, the Clean Air Act 1956 (which applied {{north and south of}} the border) reimbursed expenditure spent on the adaptation of fireplaces to burn <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel.</b> The work counted as an improvement for rent increase purposes under the Rent Act 1957. Eight percent of the cost (net of any reimbursement) could be added to the rent.|$|R
50|$|Another {{improvement}} {{was after the}} 1957 smog, when the estate was declared a smokeless zone. The houses had their old fireplaces converted for use with <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel,</b> which included fixed gas pokers in the hearths. The elderly {{man and his wife}} who lived in Mill Lane, Chadwell Heath and toured the estate in a horse-drawn cart on Saturday mornings selling logs and firewood (mostly tarred wood taken from the East End roads when they were replaced by tarmac) saw their business collapse overnight.|$|R
5000|$|The Act {{introduced}} {{a number of}} measures to reduce air pollution, especially by introducing [...] "smoke control areas" [...] in some towns and cities in which only <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuels</b> could be burned. By shifting homes' sources of heat towards cleaner coals, electricity, and gas, it reduced the amount of smoke pollution and sulphur dioxide from household fires. Reinforcing these changes, the Act also included measures to relocate power stations away from cities, and for the height of some chimneys to be increased.|$|R
50|$|The mineral {{was used}} during mummification ceremonies in ancient Egypt because it absorbs water and behaves as a drying agent. Moreover, {{when exposed to}} moisture, the {{carbonate}} in natron increases pH (raises alkalinity), which creates a hostile environment for bacteria. In some cultures, natron was thought to enhance spiritual safety for both {{the living and the}} dead. Natron was added to castor oil to make a <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel,</b> which allowed Egyptian artisans to paint elaborate artworks inside ancient tombs without staining them with soot.|$|R
50|$|Beattie was {{a highly}} {{innovative}} engineer, introducing the country's first successful 2-4-0 locomotive, pioneering feedwater heating, balanced slide valves and coal-burning fireboxes. Since the Rainhill Trials in 1829, it had been accepted that the smoke emitted by burning coal was a nuisance. Railway companies accepted the need to burn coke (a <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel)</b> in their locomotives, but this was much more expensive than coal, and several locomotive engineers sought a method by which coal could be burned smokelessly. One such engineer was Beattie, who designed a boiler suitable for coal in 1853.|$|R
5000|$|Cudworth {{had three}} main {{achievements}} on the SER: he planned {{the layout of}} Ashford Works {{and brought it to}} such a standard that the company was able to begin production of its own locomotives in 1853; with two of his classes (the [...] "Standard Goods" [...] 0-6-0 of 1855 and the 118 class 2-4-0 of 1859), practised locomotive standardisation on a scale unheard of on other contemporary railways; and, at a time when coke (a <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel,</b> but expensive) was normal for railways, designed a successful coal-burning firebox.|$|R
