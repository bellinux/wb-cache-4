After she had appeared in four pornographic films in the softcore and fetish genrestrample fetish specificallypublic discussion about the Year 2000 problem {{and the end of the}} world caused her to think that she might experience divine judgment for her lifestyle. She then became a Christian, married her boyfriend Jon, started and completed a course in cosmetology, left the sex industry, and became a hairdresser all by September 1999. In 2003, Veitch discovered that a friend of hers who was working as a stripper had died as a result of alcoholism. Veitch began to evangelize to strippers because <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had told her friend about the gospel before she died.|$|E
5|$|After her husband's death, Mary Shelley {{lived for}} a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa, where she often saw Byron and {{transcribed}} his poems. She resolved to live by her pen and for her son, but her financial situation was precarious. On 23 July 1823, she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her father-in-law enabled her to lodge nearby. Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson, Percy Florence, only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian. Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly. She managed instead to wring out of Sir Timothy a limited annual allowance (which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate), but {{to the end of}} his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers. Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband's poems, among other literary endeavours, but concern for her son restricted her options. Sir Timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published. In 1826, Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate after the death of his half-brother Charles Shelley, his father's son by Harriet Shelley. Sir Timothy raised Mary's allowance from £100 a year to £250 but remained as difficult as ever. Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin's circle, but poverty prevented her from socialising as <b>she</b> <b>wished.</b> <b>She</b> also felt ostracised by those who, like Sir Timothy, still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E
25|$|One of the show's most {{maligned}} storylines of all-time involved show matriarch Rachel Cory Hutchins being {{kidnapped and}} then impersonated by an evil doppelgänger countess, Justine Duvalier (also played by Victoria Wyndham). It was panned by the soap press as being {{worthy of a}} Mystery Science Theater 3000 level of ridicule. During the storyline, the show was dealt another major blow when fan favorite Paul Michael Valley was fired and his character, Ryan, was killed off. Fans were relieved when Justine's reign of terror was put to an end when Carl finished her off with a letter opener. Wyndham was quoted as liking the storyline at first, but after it played out, she stated that <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had never appeared in it.|$|E

25|$|Yang Yi Ru is a {{workaholic}} {{who never had}} {{time to take a}} break. Her family and friends decided to pull a prank on her to slow her down. They conned her into believing she only had six months to live, then packed her off to a vacation spot to clear her mind. She spent her first day on a sunny beach lamenting to a stranger that <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had the time to meet Mr. Right, get married and have kids. Unbeknownst to her, the stranger was a man from her past who was in love with her when they met years ago. He proposed to her the next day and she married him, but when the prank was revealed, her new husband felt cheated and unleashed his wrath on her.|$|E
25|$|Sada Abe {{was born}} in 1905. Her mother doted on Sada, who was her {{youngest}} surviving child, and allowed her to do as <b>she</b> <b>wished.</b> <b>She</b> encouraged Abe to take lessons in singing and in playing the shamisen, both activities which, at the time, were more closely associated with geishas and prostitutes than with classical artistic endeavor. Geishas were considered glamorous celebrities at the time, and Abe herself pursued this image by skipping school for her musical lessons, and wearing stylish make-up. As family problems over her siblings, sister Teruko and brother Shintaro, became more pressing, Abe was often sent {{out of the house}} alone. She soon fell in with a group of similarly independent teenagers. At the age of 14, during one of her outings with this group, she was raped by one of her acquaintances. Her parents initially defended and supported her, but she became a difficult teenager. As she became more irresponsible and uncontrollable, her parents sold her to a geisha house in Yokohama in 1922, hoping to find her a place in society with some direction. Toku Abe, Sada's oldest sister, testified that Sada wished to become a geisha. Sada herself, however, claimed that her father made her a geisha as punishment for her promiscuity.|$|E
500|$|Family matters {{also made}} Priestley's time in America difficult. His {{youngest}} son Harry died on December 11, 1795, probably of malaria. Mary Priestley died on September 17, 1796; {{she was already}} ill and never fully recovered after the shock of her son's death. On September 19 of that year Joseph wrote: [...] "This day I bury my wife....she had taken much thought in planning the new house and {{now that it is}} far advanced and promises to be everything <b>she</b> <b>wished,</b> <b>she</b> is removed to another." [...] After dinner on Monday 14 April 1800, various members of Priestley's household fell ill, with symptoms of food poisoning, which prompted the Reading Advertiser to falsely accuse Priestley's son William, of trying to poison them with arsenic.|$|E

500|$|By 2005, Veitch {{was working}} as a hairdresser in Riverside, California. One of her clients was Lori Albee, a {{housewife}} with two children and no experience with the sex industry. Veitch told Albee about her friend who had died and to whom <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had evangelized. Albee suggested that they start telling other strippers about Jesus. Matt Brown, Veitch's pastor at Sandals Church, arrived for a haircut and Veitch asked him for help to start an organization to minister to sex workers. He was interested. Veitch and Brown started Matthew's House, an organization they founded as [...] "a ministry to help people working in or addicted to the sex industry". They chose the name [...] "Matthew's House" [...] in reference to the Calling of Matthew, a gospel episode in which Jesus eats with sinners at the home of Matthew the Apostle.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} and loss left Lenore in emotional pain. [...] In her election night remarks she had said, [...] "I thought [...] {{would be an}} asset. It was disappointing to find that many people closed their minds just because I was a woman." [...] She expounded on this in an article she published the following year in Look magazine, describing the openly dismissive reaction she had gotten from both men and women. She wrote that, [...] "In factories, I encountered men in small groups, laughing, shouting, 'Get in the kitchen. George needs you there. What {{do you know about}} politics?'" [...] To a friend she wrote, [...] " [...] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep." [...] She told one of her children that <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had not run, and concluded that [...] "It's the most humiliating thing I know of to run for office." ...|$|E
500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Robbins as [...] "confident", [...] "ambitious", and [...] "cheerful". Shortly {{after her}} {{arrival in the}} show, Robbins became a love-interest for Torres (Ramirez). The {{relationship between the two}} is referred to by fans by the portmanteau [...] "Calzona". Torres' previous girlfriend Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) was written out of Grey's Anatomy in 2008, {{due to a lack of}} chemistry between the characters. Rhimes praised the chemistry between Robbins and Torres in contrast, comparing it to that between the show's primary couple Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Shepherd (Dempsey), and stating: [...] "They have that little thing that makes you want to watch them." [...] Rhimes named the addition of Capshaw to the cast as one of the elements of the season she was most proud of, commenting that <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> could have found Callie a love interest that [...] "sparkled" [...] sooner, but was pleased with eventually having found one in Robbins.|$|E

500|$|Ryan Brockington from New York Post lauded the song, writing [...] "it’s a very surprising, and {{somewhat}} brilliant, apology track where Taylor sings about wishing {{to fix a}} relationship <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't have ruined in the first place." [...] His point was echoed by Rudy Klapper from Sputnikmusic, who described the song as a [...] "regret-filled apology". Stephen M. Deusner from Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs-up and praised Swift as [...] "an expressive singer", calling the song [...] "a dark fantasy of apology and reconciliation" [...] which is [...] "a true heartbreaker". Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe graded {{the production of the}} song as [...] "B", complimenting the lyrics in particular, by writing [...] "it’s always a good sign when there’s a line as memorable as that one, the kind that lingers around in your head more than the song itself." [...] He also added that he [...] "appreciate(s) the restrained vocal, though a more varied melody would’ve made the chorus quite a bit more distinctive." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{released}} two {{highly successful}} albums, Mariah Carey and Emotions (1991), the singer {{had yet to}} embark on world tour because of stage-fright and the possible negative effects of singing vocally strenuous songs every night. Many critics were unconvinced with her reasoning, and accused her of manipulating her vocals in the studio. In response, Carey appeared on MTV Unplugged to perform a small selection of her songs live in 1992. For her rendition of [...] "Someday", she altered the arrangement and stripped it back {{to give it a}} rawer sound. This version was produced by Carey and Afanasieff and recorded live at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City on March 16, 1992. In the liner notes of #1 to Infinity, Carey expressed her dislike toward the original studio version on Mariah Carey and stated that <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> could [...] "delete some of the overproduction," [...] which is why she decided to include the MTV Unplugged version on the compilation instead. In addition to MTV Unplugged, the song was included on the set-list of Carey's Las Vegas residency show, Number 1 to Infinity (2015–17).|$|E
500|$|While {{promoting}} the album, Cole said [...] "R, rock and pop {{has always been}} my forte" [...] and called the music something <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had recorded [...] "at least five years ago". She revealed her dissatisfaction with being labeled a jazz singer and her desire to showcase her versatility as an artist, saying she aimed to [...] "put out some music that we hadn't heard {{in a long time}} from anybody, really". The project was Cole's first collaboration with R producer Dallas Austin. Rashod Ollison of The Virginian-Pilot wrote the album represented how [...] " [...] had hung up the gowns and returned to her soul roots"; in past performances, Cole would wear gowns when singing jazz. During the production of the album, Verve Records stipulated that it must include original material. One of the two new songs [...] "Five Minutes Away" [...] was based on Cole's experiences with Austin and keyboard player Chanz Parkman. Prior to the album's release, CBS News Caitlin Johnson wrote that it was [...] "a sharp turn for a woman perhaps best known for singing jazz standards." [...] She connected the project to Cole's decision to reinvent herself, saying that its title represented [...] "leaving the past behind".|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} stanza Elizabeth asks for less intense {{feelings}}, saying <b>she</b> is fragile. <b>She</b> <b>wishes</b> Anjou were less nice {{so that she}} could get over her feelings more easily. The fourth line means either that <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> could feel good or bad, which would seem to contradict the first line, or that <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> could show (and vent) these feelings properly, or perhaps that she could feel one extreme or the other, rather than both at once: high OR low. Finally, she says if she cannot be happier, she would like to die so that thoughts of love no longer trouble her. She doubts she will ever be fulfilled in terms of love. Whether she really wanted to die or said that for dramatic effect is unclear, and of course the overall sincerity of the poem is also unclear.|$|R

2500|$|Elizabeth Charlotte, {{worried that}} she would be put in a convent (a {{stipulation}} of her wedding contract in the event of Philippe's death) was assured by the king that she could remain at court as long as <b>she</b> <b>wished.</b> <b>She</b> burnt all the letters of Philippe's lovers through the years lest they fall into [...] "the wrong hands", noting that the scent of the perfumed letters nauseated her. Louis XIV assured the new Duke of Orléans, formerly the Duke of Chartres, that the past was forgotten and that henceforth he was to look on him as his father. The court was devastated and his old friend, Louis XIV's discarded mistress Madame de Montespan, was also greatly affected, the two having been very close.|$|E
2500|$|On April 1, 2007, Morissette {{released}} a tongue-in-cheek cover of The Black Eyed Peas's selection [...] "My Humps", which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied {{only by a}} piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively {{with a group of}} men and hits the ones who attempt to touch her [...] "lady lumps", had received 16,465,653 views on February 15, 2009. Morissette did not take any interviews for a time to explain the song, and it was theorized that she did it as an April Fools' Day joke. Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacy [...] "Fergie" [...] Ferguson responded by sending Morissette a buttocks-shaped cake with an approving note. On the verge of the release of her latest album, she finally elaborated on how the video came to be, citing that she became very much emotionally loaded while recording her new songs one after the other and one day <b>she</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> could do a simple song like [...] "My Humps" [...] in a conversation with Guy Sigsworth and the joke just took {{a life of its own}} when they started working on it.|$|E
