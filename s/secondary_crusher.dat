5000|$|Two Sandvik hybrid rolls crushers {{perform the}} primary and {{secondary}} crushing duties at gaps of approximately 60 and 40 mm respectively. These crushers were preferred over jaw crushers as they should cope better with the high clay content of the ore {{in the early years}} of operation. The <b>secondary</b> <b>crusher</b> product is conveyed into a Sepro scrubber where the material is washed to remove fines sticking to the coarser material. The majority of material from the scrubber reports to a double-deck screen, sizing at 9 and 4 mm. Oversize material (>9 mm) material from the scrubber and this screen is conveyed to two Sandvik cone crushers with a closed size setting of 12 - 15 mm, before returning onto the scrubber screen. Material between 9 and 4 mm in size reports to the DMS circuit. The undersize from the scrubber screen (<4 mm) is pumped onto a second screen where it is sized at 0.5 mm. The oversize for this screen makes up further DMS feed, and the undersize from this screen (< 0.5mm) reports to a large holding tank that stores feed for the gravity circuit.|$|E
50|$|Major {{equipment}} like boiler, turbine, auxiliaries like BFP, CEP, PA fans, bowl mills etc. were {{supplied by}} BHEL. In coal handling plant, major equipment like primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>crusher</b> were supplied by TRF and wagon tippler was supplied by Heavy Engineering Corporation (HEC). Since commissioning {{none of the}} unit could deliver the desired level of generation for various reasons. Some {{of the main reasons}} were problem in the boiler, turbine, mill and other unit auxiliaries and also in the coal handling plant. During July 2002, the plant was running at a very low PLF of 4.6%, very high auxiliary power consumption of 22.68% very high specific oil consumption of 59.12 ml/kwhr and height specific coal consumption of 0.85 kg/kwhr with a coal of GCV 3500 Kcal/kg. None of the units could deliver the required level of generation and the maximum PLF of the plant in the last twenty years of operation has been only 24.23%. As a result, the station had to be shut down. It had been found that although it was technically feasible to renovate the existing units of BTPS, {{it would not have been}} economically viable as the tariff works out to about Rs 3.16 per unit after carrying out R&M at an estimated cost of about Rs 7 billion. Hence, capital grant/viability gap funding of Rs 3.5 billion would have to be provided to bring down the tariff to an acceptable level of Rs 2.50 per unit. The alternative is NTPC's proposal to set up a new 750 MW (3 X 250 MW) Thermal Power Station at the same location, at a total project cost of approximately Rs Rs 44.9624 billion based on third quarter 2006 price level. The power station would be based on Fuel Gas Desulphurization (FGD) technology due to high sulphur content of Assam coal, involving additional cost of Rs 0.5 crores/MW approximately.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the recovery of}} oil from oil shale by use of proposed systems which incorporate beneficiation of the shale ore (that is, concentration of the kerogen) before the oil-recovery step. The objective was to identify systems which could be more attractive than conventional surface retorting of ore. No experimental work was carried out. The systems analyzed consisted of beneficiation methods which could increase kerogen concentrations by at least four-fold. Potentially attractive low-enrichment methods such as density separation were not examined. The technical alternatives considered were bounded by the <b>secondary</b> <b>crusher</b> as input and raw shale oil as output. A sequence of ball milling, froth flotation, and retorting concentrate is not attractive for Western shales compared to conventional ore retorting; transporting the concentrate to another location for retorting reduces air emissions in the ore region but cost reduction is questionable. The high capital and energy costs result largely from the ball milling step which is very inefficient. Major improvements in comminution seem achievable through research and such improvements, plus confirmation of other assumptions, could make high-enrichment beneficiation competitive with conventional processing.

40|$|Designing an {{efficient}} and economic mineral processing plant {{begins with the}} choice of the best and most economic comminution circuit based on ore properties and concentrate end-user’s specifications. This is because crushing and grinding for preparation of suitable feed for the downstream processes are cost intensive. The Itakpe iron ore processing plant presently produces a taiing material containing up to 22 % iron minerals mostly fines produced inevitably during comminution. This article analyzed the existing circuit and ore properties, and presents specific comminution tests that were undertaken in order to recommend an alternate and more effective circuit.

40|$|The Barrick Osborne {{concentrator}} {{has gone}} through a number of upgrades since commissioning and steadily increased production from the original 119 t/h design capacity to 265 t/h milling throughput in 2008. This was achieved incrementally over several years, by maximising operating efficiencies, in order to minimise capital expenditure, and take advantages of economies of scale; but more importantly it was reached with no measurable loss of recovery. Osborne currently processes a blend of underground with open pit material from the nearby Trekelano deposit. Following primary/secondary crushing, the material is processed through a rod/ball mill grinding circuit ahead of rougher/scavenger flotation that produces a copper concentrate. Osborne was seeking a further increase in plant throughput of the order of 15 per cent, but at more sustainable levels of <b>secondary</b> <b>crusher</b> plant utilisation. In early 2008. Osborne contracted Metso Minerals Process Technology Asia-Pacific and South America (MMPT) to review the entire process from run-of-mine feed to final copper concentrate. This review would be done concurrently, with surveys of both the crushing/grinding and notation circuits being performed at the same time. The outcome would be a steady-state model of the complete flow sheet allowing the crushing/grinding model to interact with the flotation circuit model such that overall process optimisation was possible. Two key outcomes for the operation are exploration of the operating limits of the currently installed plant, and projection of the logical next stage of potential capital plant expansions. This paper covers Part B or the flotation component of the project. A separate paper discussing Part A or crushing and grinding is also being presented at this conference. Surveys of the Osborne flotation circuit were performed along with a comprehensive review of the cell characteristics including measurements of the gas and froth phases of individual flotation cells. These data resulted in a size-by-size floatability component model of the complete circuit. This circuit model was then used to perform steady-state simulations to evaluate options to improve both overall circuit and individual cell performance. The grinding circuit model discussed in a separate paper or Part A of this project was then used interactively with the flotation circuit model to recommend the best operating regime to maximise overall efficiency. For example, the balance between increased crushing and grinding costs versus higher copper recovery and final concentrate grade. Due to changes in market conditions {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, the focus was shifted to prioritising operational changes rather than capital expansion modifications, in order to improve circuit performance...|$|E
40|$|MSc (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{iron ore}} mining {{industry}} {{makes use of}} various processes that result in the release of airborne dust into the surrounding atmosphere where workers are exposed, to produce a final product. The deposition in the lung and toxicological influences of airborne dust can be determined by their physical- and chemical characteristics. The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) regulations for hazardous chemical substances have no current system of how the physical- and chemical properties of particulates originating from specific areas will influence a worker‘s exposure and health, especially for ultrafine particles (UFP). It is therefore imperative to characterise airborne dust containing micrometer and UFP size particles originating from specific areas {{to determine if there}} are physical- and chemical characteristics {{that may or may not}} have an influence on the workers‘ health. Aim: This pilot study is aimed at the physical- and chemical characterisation of the airborne iron ore dust generated at the process areas of an opencast iron ore mine. Method: Sampled areas included the Primary-secondary crusher, Tertiary crusher, Quaternary crusher and Sifting house. Gravimetric sampling was conducted through the use of static inhalable- and respirable samplers in conjunction with optical- and condensation particle counters that were placed near airborne dust- emitting sources. Physical- and chemical characterisation was done with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Results: The results found in the study indicate high mass concentration levels of inhalable dust at all four process areas, as well as high levels of respirable dust found at the primary- <b>secondary</b> <b>crusher</b> area. Particle size distribution optical particle counter (OPC) results indicate that the majority of particles at all four process areas are in the region of 0. 3 μm in size. Condensation particle counter (CPC) results integrated with OPC results indicate that at the primarysecondary and Tertiary crushers the majority of particles are found to be in the size fraction < 0. 3 μm. SEM analysis indicates that particle agglomeration largely occurs in the airborne iron ore dust. Particle splinters originating from larger particle collisions and breakages are present in the airborne dust. EDS analysis indicates that the elemental majority of the airborne iron ore dust consists of iron, oxygen, carbon, aluminium, silicon, potassium and calcium. The elemental percentages differ from each process area where an increase in iron and decrease in impurities can be seen as the ore moves through the beneficiation process from the Primary-secondary crusher to the Sifting house. Conclusion: The results obtained from the physical- and chemical properties of the airborne iron ore dust indicate high risk of over-exposure to the respiratory system, as well as possible ultrafine particle systemic exposure, that may overwhelm the physiological defense mechanisms of the human body and lead to reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and the development of pathologies such as siderosis, silicasiderosis and lung cancer.

40|$|Abstract: Air {{injection}} rate {{as the key}} parameter of drilling air {{is directly related to}} the success of drilling procedure. In the previous studies, most of air {{injection rate}} models were built based on the vertical wells, which are not appropriate for horizontal and highly-deviated well and limit the wide application of air drilling to some extent. Based on the movement analysis of cuttings, this paper assumed that after the cuttings deposit to the low side of borehole, Air is injected to carry the cuttings out of the wellbore. Then, the starting velocity model in different hole angles is established through the stress analysis of cuttings motion, which can be used to calculate the minimum air injection rate. The numerical simulation results show that starting velocity of cuttings reaches the maximum in the hole angle 60 - 70 degrees. The larger diameter cuttings require a high starting velocity, which is difficulty to be transported. This means some appropriate methods should be applied for air drilling procedure, like using <b>secondary</b> <b>crush</b> tools.
