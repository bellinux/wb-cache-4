50|$|The Kiruna orebody {{was formed}} {{following}} intense volcanic activity. Iron-rich solutions precipitated the iron on to a syenite porphyry footwall. Then the ore bed {{was covered by}} further volcanic deposits, quartz porphyry, and sedimentary rocks. Later the whole body was tilted to its current dip of 50 to 60°. Having a grading of more than 60% iron and an average of 0,9% phosphorus, the ore contains a very pure magnetite-apatite mix.The original reserve of the Kiruna mine was around 1.8 billion tonnes of ore. In the beginning, surface mining was used, but the mine has been mined with the <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> mining method since the 1960s. As of 2008 the Kiruna mine had estimated proven reserves of approximately 602 million tonnes grading 48.5% iron with probable reserves of 82 million tonnes grading 46.7% iron. Measured, indicated and inferred resources add a further 328 million tonnes to the proven reserves. Until 1999 the deepest level of the mine reached 775 m, but after 1999 the new level went deeper reaching a depth of 1045 m. The 1045 m level can support current iron ore production until 2018.

In this paper, {{the application of a}} mesh-free method, called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), is demonstrated for simulating rock caving in a stratified deposit. The advantages for simulating caving processes using a mesh-free numerical framework are highlighted. Two different examples are chosen, one with elastic-brittle material behaviour with large yield strength (failure by brittle fracture) and the other with elasto-plastic material behaviour with relatively lower yield strength to allow ductile deformation of the rock mass.

In recent years a number of research centres have endeavoured to provide a mathematical model that indicates the chief characteristics of ore flow in the <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> mining method. Optimization of the design parameters for <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> has ensued {{with the objective of}} maximizing ore recovery while minimizing waste dilution. Past studies have been confined by two simplifying assumptions: that the region of flow be approximated by a simple mathematical function, and that the flow analysis is static, ie extraction is calculated by employing an idealized ore-waste boundary position for each ring. Further investigation into models of ore flow has been stimulated on two counts. 1. full scale tests have indicated that a more complex description is required; 2. as a design tool, a dynamic analysis that monitors the displacement of the broken rock mass during extraction would yield more realistic recovery predictions under operating conditions, and enable variations on the method to be evaluated. This study reviews the various formulations currently available, or being developed to describe the flow of granular material. A viable solution in a mining context would be three dimensional, time dependent, and incorporate stress conditions. Although workers in diverse fields have analyzed the problem no solution exists at present. The majority of studies are either empirical in nature, or deficient in one or other of the above criteria.

40|$|The virgin {{stress state}} in the rock mass is {{disturbed}} by mining, which leads to locally increased or decreased stresses. The rock mass in Sweden is generally composed of high strength brittle rock types, so the risk of seismicity and rockbursts (violent failures) increase with increasing depth of mining due to increasing stress levels. Seismicity is the rock mass response to deformation and failure. A seismic event is the sudden release of potential or stored energy in the rock. The released energy is then radiated as seismic waves. A rockburst {{is defined as a}} mining-induced seismic event that causes damage to openings in the rock. The most important factors influencing the occurrence and intensity of seismicity are virgin stress state, rock properties, and the influence of the mining method on the stress field. The Swedish cut-and-fill mines are comparable to the studied Canadian mines regarding stress state, mining method, and rock properties, so the same seismicity problems should be expected as mining depth increases. The Swedish <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> mines are not comparable to the studied open stoping mines, regarding stress state and the influence of mining on the stress field. The <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> mining method influences the virgin stress state over a larger area than open stoping methods, which means that the principal stresses around footwall drifts are of the same order or higher at the same depth. This means that seismic events of certain magnitude that are experienced at a depth of 2000 m in Canadian mines, can be expected to occur at less depth in the <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> mines. At present the damage caused by seismicity is limited and can be controlled with the standard stiff reinforcement. When the events become larger, the reinforcement must be complemented with more yielding and energy absorbing components. Practices regarding energy absorbing reinforcement and destressing of drifts should be studied and evaluated for application in the Swedish mines. The application of the correct reinforcement in seismic areas requires that these areas can be identified before seismicity start to occur. This identification can be accomplished by combining a geomechanical model of the mine with 3 D stress and energy modeling of the proposed mining sequence. The geomechanical model should include geological structures, properties and locations of different rock types, failure mappings, and rock mass classification. The purpose of the model would be to increase the understanding of the behavior of the rock mass, and to identify areas of high seismic hazard. In the mines where a model already exists, the model should be developed further, to connect geology with seismic events, and to elastic stress analysis on both small and large scale. A seismic monitoring system is an investment worth considering for mines experiencing seismicity, both for localization and estimation of magnitude of seismic events, but also to monitor the behavior of the rock mass during mining. This can provide valuable input for production planning, sequencing etc. Godkänd; 2004; 20070108 (mlk) </p...|$|E

The loose coverage rock is located in the stope for a long time, and it’s frequently squeezed from production blasting, impact effect and the colliding and breaking in the falling process, it comes into being a large number of powder and small pieces of rocks. The rock powder and small fragments have such characteristics-good mobility and strong permeability. With the increasement of mining depth, the rock powder and small fragments in the loose coverage rock will be earlier to reach the ores than the big fragments of the same level. As a result, ore dilution will prematurely appear.

40|$|<b>Sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> is an {{underground}} mass mining method used for extracting {{different types of}} ores from the earth crust. Mines using <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> (SLC) as the primary mining method are generally highly mechanized with standardized and independent unit operations. Mine development for caving operations are similar to other underground mining methods, however, the scale of production drilling and blasting performed in caving operations including SLC are larger than many other underground mining methods (such as room and pillar or cut and fill). Loading of the material from the production face in <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> is facilitated by the flow of material under gravity into the production face. A large amount of material is loaded from a limited opening termed as the draw point. Different unit operations (drilling, blasting, loading and transportation) are performed in isolation with each other which leads to standardized procedures and safe operation. The mine design allows for operational agility with respect to ore geometry and inclination. These features give SLC an advantage over other mining methods. However, SLC demands a caving conducive geology along with a large ore footprint. The mining method also registers higher percentage of dilution and ore loss compared to non-caving mining methods. Material flow in SLC has been studied extensively {{in the past five}} decades and different methods have been used to simulate material flow in caving operations. Physical models of different scales has been designed for simulating material flow by using sand, gravel or rocks and studying the movement of material inside the model. Initial physical models showed an ellipsoidal zone above the draw point from which material flowed into the draw point. However, subsequent modelling results disagreed with this notion of material flow. Numerical modelling techniques have also been applied to simulate material flow. The models were calibrated against mine or mill production data for optimization. Currently, marker trials are being used to understand material flow in SLC. Markers (numbered steel rods, RFID enabled markers) are installed in boreholes drilled inside the burden of a production ring and based on the recovery sequence of markers, material flow is predicted. Results from physical models, numerical models and marker trials along with mine experience have been used in the past to design draw control strategy for SLC operation. Initial draw control techniques were based on the assumption of uniform flow of material. But with the advancement in modelling techniques, draw control strategies have also changed. Ore flow simulation techniques developed to simulate material flow are being applied to predict the ore grade at draw point and hence help in draw control during the loading process. Recent draw control strategies in some mines have evolved to include production data and metal prices to optimize the loading process in SLC. Monitoring of the ore grade at the draw point is crucial in controlling dilution and increasing ore recovery. Present draw point monitoring technique predicts ore grade by exploiting the differences between ore and waste. The difference between ore and waste can be detected through visual observations, assay sampling or weight measurements. Draw point monitoring gives data for both regulation and calibration of draw control strategies, and provides important information regarding dilution and ore recovery during the loading process. Understanding material flow is vital for improving different aspects of SLC operation but draw control for SLC is an operational activity which regulates the loading process for a given mine design and material flow conditions. Therefore, an effective draw control requires a constant monitoring system and a constant calibration of the loading criteria’s through draw point monitoring for reducing dilution and improving ore recovery.

The finite element modeling code Phase 2 was used for a sensitivity analysis of rock strength parameters and tostudy factors that may influence initiation of caving of the hangingwall.

40|$|The {{literature}} discusses {{a number}} of theoretical, small, and full scale experimental programs, which have aimed at identifying parameters influencing <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> (SLC) material flow behaviour, and therefore ore recovery and dilution. Historically, parameters directly influencing flow behaviour {{have been found to}} include the geometry of the extraction layout and drives, sublevel height, blast ring design, material characteristics of the blasted and waste material, and draw control methodology. To date, no detailed analysis of parameters influencing full scale material flow behaviour and recovery in modern SLC mines has been documented in the literature. This paper outlines the analysis undertaken to identify parameters which influence material recovery at the Ridgeway SLC operation. Parameters analysed included those related to drawpoint location, drill and blast design, geology, drawpoint geometry, and draw control. To identify parameters influencing recovery, a Self-Organising Map (SOM) technique was adopted. SOM is considered an ideal tool for analysing complex geological and mining datasets, and for extracting relationships and patterns that typically are not evident by other means. The SOM analysis indicated that {{a number of}} drill and blast design parameters were directly or inversely correlated to material recovery at the Ridgeway SLC operation. Blasting parameters dominated correlations with recovery when compared to drawpoint and geological parameters...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} present-day {{functionality}} of large-scale <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> (SLC) at LKAB Kiruna a comprehensive measurement program was undertaken involving blast function, fragmentation and gravity flow. As {{part of this}} assessment, a fragmentation measurement trial was performed based on 3 D imaging ofthe draw-point and corresponding bucket load of the underground load-haul-dump (LHD) excavator. 3 D image data from stereo photogrammetry was collected and an automated image analysis strategy developed. A number of data sets were collected {{for each of the}} draw-point and LHD bucket, along withsieving results for four of the LHD bucket loads (totally about 70 tonnes). Two of the sieving results were used to inform the automated image analysis strategy, and two were held back as a comparison. Large variations in the visible particles are apparent when comparing corresponding draw-points and LHD bucketshighlighting the impact of sampling location and the need to measure large quantities of data in order to avoid bias from small samples. The results show that 3 D imaging and analysis can produce fully automated measurement and analysis of the visible particle size distribution. Although this {{is not the same as}} the sievesize distribution it provides useful estimation of both the larger size classes and a bulk estimate of fine material below approximately 60 mm. The 3 D stereo photogrammetry measurement system used produced very high 3 D point density but this was achieved using a custom up-sampling technique which significantly smoothed the data, removing small particles, smoothing edges, and this negatively affected the particle delineation algorithms.

40|$|<b>Sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> (SLC) is {{a highly}} {{productive}} mining method with the major disadvantages of irrepressible ore loss and dilution. The confined blasting situation of SLC rings is commonly regarded {{to have a significant}} impact upon the material flow characteristics and hence on the overall performance. The initial conditions for the ore flow after blasting are unknown, as both the blasted geometry and the fragmentation itself are normally hidden. However, when opening a new drawpoint and in hang-up situations an inspection of the actual conditions is feasible. For this purpose, a remotely operated 3 D photogrammetry system was custom built and used to reconstruct the ring front and/or cavity as a geo-referenced mesh model with colour information. Various blasting situations have been observed and this allowed a deeper study of the i) broken geometry and height, ii) over- and underbreak and their effects on subsequently blasted rings, iii) interaction effects between adjacent holes/rings, iv) drilling accuracy based on identified boreholes and v) mapping of geological structures and their influence on the blast result. The capabilities of the 3 D image acquisition system to evaluate the blasting results are demonstrated with an example, in which a series of blasts were surveyed. Monitoring under hang-up situations, has then revealed the actual effects from confined blasting and gravity flow related issues. The 3 D photogrammetry system is now increasingly being used to study hang-ups. By revealing and quantifying hitherto inaccessible information, the system {{has proven to be a}} valuable tool in increasing the understanding of both SLC breakage and flow.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a re-evaluation {{of a case}} study of an instrumented test drift in the Kiirunavaara mine. A 20 m long section of the test drift, located at the 514 m level in the Kiirunavaara mine, was instrumented in 1983, with the objective of studying the interaction of grouted rock bolts and hard rock masses subjected to changes in stresses induced by mining. During the test a large rock wedge was observed in the footwall side of the drift. Borehole extensometers, distometers, telescopic tube extensometers and rockbolts with strain gauges recorded the movement of the rock mass during the whole field measurement time. However, the actual failure process of the large wedge was not addressed in the original study. In this paper, this case was re-evaluated with the aim of increasing knowledge regarding of failure process of a large wedge in terms of deformation. A global-local numerical modeling approach was employed to reproduce the in situ conditions using the finite element program Phase 2 and Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC) software. The global approach was used to calculate the stresses induced during <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> in the mine. The stresses from the global model were applied to the local model which simulated the test drift behavior, and in which geological structures were explicitly modeled. The deformation experienced by the rock mass due to the wedge in the drift was calculated in the local model and compared to the measured deformation in the field. The field measurement results showed that a small fallout occurred at the same location as the large wedge acted as initiator of the large wedge movement. The numerical modeling results showed that the large wedge did not fall out. The large wedge was characterized by shear displacements.

40|$|There is {{a demand}} in mining for more {{investments}} in continuous loading methods {{in order to}} achieve higher productivity and lower costs. The creation of a better environment is another major goal which could be attained by using remote or automatic control of the continuously working machines. The loading and transportation of ore {{is an important part of}} underground mining. After blasting the ore must usually be moved to a chute connected with the main level where it is transported by train or truck to crusher and hoist. This thesis deals with the first link in this chain, i. e. loading and transportation of ore from the face to the chute in hard rock conditions (in Sweden). The blasted ore is relatively coarse and hard to handle in a continuous process. The development so far has there-fore been directed towards the later steps of the process where the ore has been crushed to a more convenient size. Today there are many applications of this, e. g. conveying and hoisting of crushed ore. At present there is no continuous technique for loading and transportation of ore from the face. This thesis presents a new technique for continuous loading and transportation of ore from the face underground, which has technical, economical and environmental potential in the future mine using remote or automatic control. The new technique consists of a developed digging arm loader together with a belt conveyor. The technique has been chosen comprehensively using systematics for evaluation, model tests with theory formation, specification of technical and environmental demands and projection of the new technique in a production system including a technical and economical systems analysis. The thesis shows that the system digging arm loader - belt conveyor has good possibilities to meet the technical and environmental demands. Economically the continuous system is better than the LHD in <b>sublevel</b> <b>caving</b> but not as good as the LHD used in the "continuous" lay-out. The digging arm loader - belt conveyor system has a good potential for future remote or automatic control. Godkänd; 1982; 20070502 (ysko...|$|E
