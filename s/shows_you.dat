I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out.

500|$|Apart {{from their}} protests, Theroux {{found them to}} be quite kind, and commented, [...] "It <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> what strange avenues the {{religious}} impulse can take you down. I think another part of the answer is that parts of the Christian Bible are pretty weird. There's a lot of weird stuff in there and when you take that and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he has sort of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and he was kind of a charismatic guy, and still is up to a point. He was a very verbal, very persuasive, an extremely compelling speaker. All these things added together combined to make a powerful influence." ...|$|E

500|$|During a MTV interview, Mars {{explained}} why the track {{was the first}} on the track list of the album [...] "It really <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> what this album is going to be, and just where I was when I started this album". He felt that anyone can easily relate to the record [...] "There's a moment in your life where you start going out every night, and it's so fun, but then you start to lose yourself; you {{get lost in the}} sauce". The singer compared the song's sentiment to [...] "Lookin' for Love In All the Wrong Places", adding [...] "It's another confession". In a different interview Mars furthered the concept of the track as it's about you [...] "losing yourself", which happened to him in L.A. during his early years. He added, [...] "If you're out there wilding out, drinking and partying, that's not real life." ...|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Steven Moffat {{said that}} putting dinosaurs on a {{spaceship}} was [...] "the secret of success". The idea to use dinosaurs in Doctor Who {{came from the}} special effects teams The Mill and Millennium FX. As [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] was a darker opening episode, [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] is more about fun. In Moffat's pitch to writer Chris Chibnall, he proposed, [...] "Maybe it's a ship heading towards Earth, and Earth is on alert". Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episodes [...] "42" [...] (2007), [...] "The Hungry Earth"/"Cold Blood" [...] (2010), as well as work for the spinoff series Torchwood. The Doctor had previously encountered dinosaurs in the 1974 serial Invasion of the Dinosaurs. Moffat suggested the spaceship was Silurian, and Chibnall, who had written {{the return of the}} Silurians in [...] "The Hungry Earth"/"Cold Blood", felt that it was [...] "a nice reveal and <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> more about them, even in a story that isn’t really about them".|$|E
500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'. I {{was thrilled}} with the plot. I know it moved very fast for some people, but I {{actually}} think that {{for some of these}} <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> don't need to understand everything. I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else I am going to do this year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E

500|$|Cy Grant, a Guyanese actor {{selected}} {{for the role of}} Lieutenant Green (Colonel White's assistant and Cloudbase's main computer operator and public announcer), had been known to the Andersons for singing topical calypsos on the current affairs programme Tonight. His casting influenced the decision to accept Edward Bishop as Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet's friend and mission partner), as Bishop recalled in an interview recorded in 1995: [...] "It was just that a girl in my agent's office happened to be on the ball. She represented this black actor by the name of Cy Grant and Gerry and Sylvia wanted to use him... And the girl said, 'Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we've just taken on a new, young American actor' – <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> how long ago it was – 'a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop.And we know how much you like American voices. Would you like to meet him as well?' He said, 'Okay, send him out.' So I went out and auditioned and got the job." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's dark nihilistic {{tone and}} violent nature was {{singled out by}} many critics as {{representing}} something unique {{in the world of}} video gaming. GameSpot concluded that, [...] "like it or not, the game pushes the envelope of video game violence and <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> countless scenes of wholly uncensored, heavily stylized carnage". Game Informer praised the game's audacity and competent technical capabilities, stating [...] "it's a frightening premise that places gamers in a psychological impasse. The crimes that you commit are unspeakable, yet the gameplay that leads to these horrendous acts is so polished and fierce that it's thrilling." [...] IGN complimented the game's overall challenge, calling it a [...] "solid, deep experience for seasoned gamers pining for some hardcore, challenging games". Watchmojo listed the game at #6 in its [...] "Top 10 Rockstar Games", calling it the publisher's [...] "most controversial game to date" [...] while adding that [...] "if you've got the stomach for it, the tense stealth experience is really exhilarating from start to finish".|$|E
500|$|The box set {{received}} mixed critical reception; R.L. Shaffer of IGN {{was critical}} {{in his review}} of it, calling the release was [...] "a complete waste" [...] and the bonus disc [...] "roughly 80 minutes of mediocre entertainment". He recommended fans purchase [...] "the <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> like instead, and start in the proper place, with the first season." [...] He ultimately gave the release an eight out of ten, however, stating [...] "while this set is certainly well rated" [...] in its content, he could not [...] "find a reason to recommend it". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club expressed confusion over the selection of material, suggesting to the network to release a [...] "straight-up Adult Swim best-of set with rarities". DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire felt the set was not [...] "good enough to warrant you re-buying them all", should buyers already own all six season volume releases. He gave the release an 85 out of 100, remarking the pilots as showing [...] "just how tough it must be to create a pilot, one that not only introduces characters and settings, but also promises a potential for weeks and perhaps years of additional stories." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on September 12, 2001, Philippines local time (approximately four {{hours after the}} September 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S.), Fischer was interviewed live by Pablo Mercado on the Baguio City station of the Bombo Radyo network. Fischer stated that he was happy that the {{airliner}} attacks had happened, while expressing his view on U.S. and Israeli foreign policy, saying [...] "I applaud the act. Look, nobody gets... that the U.S. and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians... for years." [...] He also said [...] "The horrible behavior that the U.S. is committing all over the world... This just <b>shows</b> <b>you,</b> that what goes around, comes around even for the United States." [...] Fischer also referenced the movie Seven Days in May and said he hoped for a military coup d'état in the U.S., [...] " [...] {{the country will be}} taken over by the military, they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders." [...] In response to Fischer's statements about 9/11, the U.S. Chess Federation passed a motion to cancel his right to membership in the organization. Fischer's right to become a member was reinstated in 2007.|$|E
500|$|A more {{negative}} review {{said that while}} [...] "Eclipse restores some of the energy New Moon zapped out of the franchise and has enough quality performances to keep it involving", the film [...] "isn't quite the adrenaline-charged game-changer for love story haters that its marketing might lead you to believe. The majority of the 'action' remains protracted and not especially scintillating should-we-or-shouldn't-we conversations between the central triangle." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a more positive review than {{for the first two}} films in the saga, but still felt the movie was a constant, unclever conversation between the three main characters. He criticized the [...] "gazes" [...] both Edward and Jacob give Bella throughout the movie, and noted that the mountain range that appears in the film looks [...] "like landscapes painted by that guy on TV who <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> how to paint stuff like that." [...] He also predicted that a lack of understanding for the film series in general would not bode well with the audience, stating, [...] "I doubt anyone not intimately familiar with the earlier installments could make head or tails of the opening scenes." [...] He gave the film 2 stars out of 4.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the premiere, Terri Schwartz of IGN {{praised the}} {{introduction}} of Ghost Rider and subsequent darker tone which [...] "will eventually allow [...] to sit more comfortably beside its corporate cousins over on Netflix", but did feel {{that there were some}} [...] "growing pains" [...] with the transition to more mature material. The A.V. Clubs Alex McCown-Levy called it [...] "a standard first episode back, in that it once again does a lot of table-setting, and not always in the most compelling manner". Levy felt that Ghost Rider's introduction was handled well for non-comic fans discovering the character with the show, but that the new positions of the series' main characters were more interesting and should have been focused on more. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said, [...] "I’m nervous for Season 4 overall, especially if said reinvention doesn’t goose the ratings like Marvel and ABC hope, but “The Ghost” is reason enough for some casual optimism." [...] He was positive about the new similarities to the darker series Daredevil, but felt that the series [...] "doesn’t have the firmest handle" [...] on Ghost Rider yet. Evan Valentine, writing for Collider.com, said that the series [...] "certainly benefits somewhat from taking a page from" [...] the Marvel Netflix series, highlighting the number of more mature elements in the episode's opening as [...] "a nice introduction that <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> this may not exactly be the same show you’ve gotten to know over the years." ...|$|E

500|$|Sarah Warn, {{editor-in-chief}} of lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com, {{thought that the}} portrayal of Emily and Naomi's relationship in the episode was [...] "a good example of a well-plotted, well-executed, and well-acted storyline coming to a satisfying conclusion", which she regarded as [...] "a noteworthy event given how few TV <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> can say that about". She felt that Emily's changing relationship with Katie as {{a significant part of}} her character development made her [...] "sympathetic and relatable to those who might have otherwise have difficulty relating to a lesbian character". One critic for PopSugar.com wrote that in this episode the [...] "drama was still in full flow" [...] despite the absence of principal characters Effy and Cook, and was impressed with the episode's [...] "uplifting ending". They believed that Ronni Ancona was [...] "fab" [...] as the twins' mother, and regarded Pandora and Doug's dance at the ball as a [...] "fantastic comic moment". Ellie Newton-Syms of InJournalism Magazine was [...] "thrilled" [...] with the conclusion of Katie and Emily's storyline. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, wrote that she [...] "almost [...] like joining in" [...] when Emily cried after breaking up with Naomi, and thought that the twins' secret language was [...] "very cute and adorable". Dan French, in a review for Digital Spy, highlighted the episode's [...] "dramas aplenty" [...] and believed Katie and Emily's parents to be [...] "slightly creepy". The Suns Keeley Bolger described Katie and Emily's falling out as [...] "spectacular".|$|E
500|$|Peggy and Frank {{were married}} {{on-screen}} on 1 April 1999. A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted {{she had been so}} nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous you can hold your hands up. It <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times extolled the film's {{ensemble}} voice {{talent and}} elaborate musical sequences, and declared Frozen was [...] "a welcome return to greatness for Walt Disney Animation Studios."

[...] Richard Corliss of Time stated that: [...] "It's great to see Disney returning to its roots and blooming anew: creating superior musical entertainment that draws on the Walt [...] tradition of animation splendor and the verve of Broadway present." [...] Richard Roeper wrote that the film was an [...] "absolute delight from start to finish." [...] Both Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune and Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the film's characters and musical sequences, which also drew comparisons to the theatrics found in Wicked. Emma Dibdin of Digital Spy awarded the film five out of five stars and called the film [...] "a new Disney classic" [...] and [...] "an exhilarating, joyous, human story that's as frequently laugh-out-loud funny as it is startling and daring and poignant. Hot {{on the heels of}} the 90th anniversary, it's impossible to imagine a more perfect celebration of everything Disney is at its best." [...] Frozen was also praised in Norwegian Sámi media as showcasing Sámi culture to a broad audience in a good way. Composer Frode Fjellheim was lauded by Norwegian Sámi President Aili Keskitalo for his contributions to the film, during the President's 2014 New Year's speech.|$|E

[...] Valentine called Robbie Reyes [...] "satisfactory" [...] and the Ghost Rider [...] "where things really shined"; [...] "ABC pretty much nail the look , and while he's obviously been tweaked to more accurately portray this new interpretation of the Spirit of Vengeance, he looks great in motion all the same ... his car has a particularly cool scene where it transforms mid air and lands in a fiery blast." [...] He called the Ghost Rider/Quake fight a highlight, and the latter's health issues [...] "an interesting twist". He concluded saying, [...] "the show still has all the flaws and strengths that [...] is known for ... if you're looking to rejoin your favorite agents for another solid romp with the added twist of throwing Ghost Rider into the mix, this one's for you." [...] Marc Buxton, also of Den of Geek, gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it [...] "a fun way {{to kick off the}} new season". He criticized the Ghost Rider transformation scene as [...] "way too CGI cartoony" [...] and negatively compared it to Grimm, but otherwise said that [...] "Ghost Rider feels right" [...] and much improved over the Nicolas Cage Ghost Rider films.
