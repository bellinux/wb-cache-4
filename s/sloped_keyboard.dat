40|$|Of {{the studies}} that {{considered}} negatively sloped keyboards, results showed improved comfort and postural effects while typing on keyboards; however, few studies of negatively <b>sloped</b> <b>keyboard</b> angles and their resulting effects on objective physiological measures, psychological measures, and performance have been performed. The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the effects of negative keyboard slopes on forearm muscle activity, wrist posture, key strike force, perceived discomfort, and performance to identify a negative keyboard angle or range of keyboard angles that minimizes exposure to hypothesized risk factors for hand/wrist work related musculoskeletal disorders. Ten experienced typists (4 males and 6 females) participated in a laboratory study to compare keyboard slopes ranging from 7 ° to – 30 °, at 10 ° increments from 0 ° to – 30 °, using an experimental wedge designed for use with QWERTY keyboards. Repeatability was examined by requiring participants to complete the experiment in two test sessions one week apart. Dependent variable data was collected during 10 minute test sessions...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the systematic effect that varying the slope angle of a computer keyboard along with varying keyboard height (relative to elbow height) have on wrist extension angle while typing. Thirty participants typed on a <b>keyboard</b> whose <b>slope</b> was adjusted to + 15 °, + 7. 5 °, 0 °, – 7. 5 °, and – 15 °. The height of the keyboard was set up such that participants’ wrists were at the same height as their elbows, above their elbows, and four cm below their elbows. Results showed that as <b>keyboard</b> <b>slope</b> angle moved downward from + 15 ° to – 15 °, mean wrist extension decreased approximately 13 ° (22 ° at + 15 ° slope to 9 ° at – 15 ° <b>slope).</b> <b>Keyboard</b> height had a similar effect with mean wrist extension decreasing from 21. 8 ° when the keyboard was lower than elbow height, to 7. 3 ° when the keyboard was higher than elbow height. Potential application of this research includes the downward <b>sloping</b> of computer <b>keyboards,</b> which could possibly be beneficial in the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the wrist...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{developing}} {{a new approach to}} seated work positions. It was conducted on 67 office workers who use the Video Display Terminal (VDT) as a major function of their working day. Muscle tension was measured by surface electromyography when subjects were asked to adopt four selected working postures. Pain was measured before and after ergonomic intervention on the Nordic scale, which was modified for this study. Performance was measured on timed typing tests. A psychosocial questionnaire was used to determine influences of job demands, and a diagnostic assessment was performed to determine symptoms and pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions. Furniture was used to place subjects in desired positions during the clinical testing sessions and the extended intervention period. The chair seat pan was adjusted to a forward tilt to promote a lordotic curve of the low back, resulting in an erect upper body and upright head position. The desk and keyboard were adjusted to the proper height for each worker. A neutral wrist position was obtained by lowering and tilting the keyboard away from the user. Results revealed muscle tension scores in the upper trapezius and forearm extensors were significantly reduced when the workers were placed with the head in a midline position, with forward-tilting seating and with use of a negative <b>sloping</b> <b>keyboard</b> tray. Subjects reported low pain scores at pretest so no changes were noted after intervention. Loss of control over job elements, lack of job satisfaction, and fear of job loss were related to an increase in muscle tension. Only fear of job loss correlated to increased pain levels. There was no relationship between any of the job demand factors and performance...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In last decades, {{due to the}} {{increase}} in the number of VDT works prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders has increased among users. One of the main risk factors for those problems might be related to the computer keyboards. Keyboards might lead to these problems, in different ways. Keyboard geometry is one of the main ways. As a result, the various types and shapes of personal computer keyboards have designed in order to provide a neutral or relaxed posture in the wrist and forearm areas. Slanted, <b>sloped</b> and tilted <b>keyboards</b> are the most important alternative keyboard designs for this mean.. Material and Method: In this paper, with a systematic approach, related studies were searched in authentic databases and finally eleven studies met to our inclusion criteria for review.. Result: findings in different studies showed that alternative keyboards clearly can provide an ergonomic neutral posture for the wrist and forearm. As a specific objective in the study, it was found that the best keyboard, to form an ideal posture for the wrist and forearm is ‘NIOSH keyboard‘ because of its ergonomic design.. Conclusion: Considering the positive effect of the alternative keyboards on the wrist and forearm postures, it is concluded that use of the alternative keyboards can decrease risk factors related to the wrist and forearm postures. Results can be applied by personal computer users, computer designers, occupational hygienists and ergonomists...|$|R
40|$|Design of {{computer}} keyboards {{no longer is}} limited to the flat keyboards that are typically shipped with personal computers. Keyboards now exist that are split into halves and these halves can be slanted away from each other (creating a triangle between the halves), sloped downward toward the visual display terminal, tilted upward like a tent, or simply separated. These design features are intended to alleviate discomfort and possible musculoskeletal disorders that have been suggested {{to be associated with the}} extensive use of conventional computer keyboards. The geometry of conventional keyboards requires the wrists to be in 10 ° to 15 ° of ulnar deviation and 20 ° of extension and the forearms to be nearly fully pronated while typing. A review of the available experimental data collected on 10 -digit touch typists indicates that (1) keyboards with a slant angle (half of the opening angle) of 10 ° to 12. 5 ° or keyboards with halves separated to approximately shoulder width are both effective in placing the wrist in near neutral (0 °) ulnar/radial deviation when typing, (2) wrist extension can be reduced to near neutral (0 °) when a keyboard with a negative slope of 7. 5 ° is used, contingent on the wrist rest also <b>sloping</b> with the <b>keyboard,</b> and (3) tilting the keyboard halves 20 ° to 30 ° is effective in reducing forearm pronation to approximately 45 °. These studies also indicate that experienced 10 -digit touch typists readily adapt (within 10 minutes) to these individual alternative keyboard features, and can type with approximately the same speed and accuracy as with the conventional keyboard. While placing the wrist and forearm in a more neutral position could, in theory, reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders, randomized controlled trials are necessary before strong recommendations can be made on the effectiveness of alternative keyboards for the prevention and/or treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. In the absence of these randomized controlled trials, the information in this article provides preliminary guidance to clinicians in their evaluation {{of computer}} keyboards and workstations and their recommendations to patients...|$|R
