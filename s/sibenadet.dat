40|$|AbstractViozan™ (<b>sibenadet</b> HCl, AR-C 68397 AA) {{is a novel}} dual D 2 {{dopamine}} receptor, β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist {{that has}} been investigated for efficacy in alleviating the symptoms of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The slowly progressive nature of this disease means that patients will require ongoing therapeutic management for many years, or even decades. With such long-term treatment, the safety profile of new agents will be of paramount importance. As part of the large-scale assessment of <b>sibenadet,</b> a 12 -month safety study has been conducted. Following completion of a 2 -week baseline period, 435 adults with stable, symptomatic, smoking-related COPD were randomized to receive either 500 μg <b>sibenadet</b> or placebo delivered via pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI), three times daily for 52 weeks. <b>Sibenadet</b> therapy was generally well tolerated, with the only notable differences seen in the incidence of tremor and taste of treatment (16 · 9 %vs. 4 · 1 % and 14 · 5 %vs. 4 · 1 % in the <b>sibenadet</b> and placebo groups respectively). There were a total of 79 patients with serious adverse events (SAEs), 43 (14 · 8 %) in the <b>sibenadet</b> pMDI group and 36 (24 · 8 %) in the placebo group. No clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or overall differences between treatment groups were noted. Similarly, there were no clinically {{significant differences between the two}} treatment groups for cardiac variables, or in vital signs. The secondary variables showed no notable differences with respect to lung function, exacerbations or health-related quality of life. Due to the effective β 2 -agonist properties, patients in the <b>sibenadet</b> group did, however, report reduced rescue medication usage at all timepoints. While the results of this study show that, overall, <b>sibenadet</b> therapy was well tolerated, the lack of sustained benefit reported in large-scale clinical efficacy studies means that <b>sibenadet</b> development will not be continued...|$|E
40|$|AbstractViozan™ (<b>sibenadet</b> HCl, AR-C 68397 AA) {{is a novel}} dual D 2 {{dopamine}} receptor, β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, developed {{specifically to}} treat the key symptoms of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), breathlessness, cough and sputum. The dual sensory nerve modulation and bronchodilator effects of <b>sibenadet</b> have been demonstrated in initial dose-ranging studies of patients with COPD and large-scale clinical evaluation has now been completed. <b>Sibenadet</b> efficacy was determined by assessing symptomatic changes, as defined by the novel assessment tool, the Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS©). The findings of two placebo-controlled studies are reported. These multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies recruited over 2000 patients with stable COPD, randomized to receive <b>sibenadet</b> (500 μg) or placebo, pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) (three times daily) for a period of 12 or 26 weeks. Diary cards were completed daily by patients throughout the study to record BCSS scores, peak expiratory flow (PEF), study drug and rescue bronchodilator usage, changes in concomitant medication and adverse events. The primary endpoints were defined as change from baseline to the final 4 weeks of the treatment period in mean BCSS total score, and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) measured 1 hour after administration of the final dose of study drug and expressed {{as a percentage of the}} predicted FEV 1. In addition, clinic assessments were made to determine changes in pulmonary function, health-related quality of life, perception of treatment efficacy and adverse events. Despite initial improvements in mean daily BCSS total scores in patients receiving <b>sibenadet,</b> the difference in the change from baseline to the final 4 weeks of the treatment period between the two treatment groups was neither statistically significant, nor considered to be of clinical importance. Although marked bronchodilator activity was seen early on with <b>sibenadet</b> treatment, the duration of effect diminished as the studies progressed. <b>Sibenadet</b> use was not associated with any safety concerns. These studies, utilizing the novel BCSS, have clearly illustrated that, despite initial symptomatic improvement with <b>sibenadet</b> therapy, this clinical benefit was not sustained over the course of the study...|$|E
40|$|AbstractViozan™, (<b>Sibenadet</b> HCI, AR-C 68397 AA) is a dual D 2 {{dopamine}} receptor, β 2 -adrenoceptor {{that combines}} bronchodilator activity with the sensory afferent modulating effects associated with D 2 -receptor agonism. Investigation in animal models of key {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) symptoms {{has demonstrated that}} <b>sibenadet</b> effectively inhibits sensory nerve activity, thereby reducing reflex cough, mucus production and tachypnoea. The results of the early clinical evaluation of this novel agent are reported. An initial proof of concept study (Study I) aimed to determine the clinical potential of this novel agent by assessing the effects of three doses of <b>sibenadet</b> therapy relative to placebo, with two commonly used bronchodilators, intended to provide a benchmark against which <b>sibenadet</b> activity could be judged. In all, 701 patients were randomized to one of three <b>sibenadet</b> dose groups (400, 600 or 1000 μgex valve), salbutamol 200 μg, ipratropium bromide (IB) 40 μg or placebo, all three times daily via pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) for 4 weeks. Once the results of Study I had been evaluated, a dose-ranging, study (Study 2) involving 872 patients randomized to receive <b>sibenadet</b> (45, 270, or 495 μgex actuator), or placebo all three times daily via pMDI, for 6 weeks commenced. Both studies were preceded by a 2 -week baseline phase and followed by a 2 -week follow up period. The primary efficacy variable identified changes in key COPD symptoms over the treatment period (compared with baseline data) as determined by the novel Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS©). In addition, data on lung function, health-related quality of life and adverse events were collected. Patients receiving <b>sibenadet</b> therapy three times daily exhibited statistically significantly greater improvements in BCSS total score than those receiving placebo or bronchodilator therapy alone. A clear dose-response was evident in Study 2. Symptom improvement in this study was also accompanied by improved lung function and healt-related quality of life. <b>Sibenadet</b> therapy was well tolerated with an adverse events profile comparable to current bronchodilator therapy. These data were viewed as extremely encouraging, warranting further, large-scale clinical investigation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the rationale for}} the development of dual dopamine D 2 -receptor and β 2 -adrenoceptor agonists as potential treatments for the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The putative involvement of pulmonary sensory afferent nerves in mediating the key COPD symptoms of breathlessness, cough and excess sputum production is outlined and the hypothesis that activation of D 2 -receptors on such nerves would modulate their activity is developed. This premise was tested, in a range of animal models, using the first of a novel class of dual dopamine D 2 -receptor and β 2 -adrenoceptor agonists, <b>sibenadet</b> HCI (Viozan™, AR-C 68397 AA). In the course of these studies it was demonstrated that <b>sibenadet,</b> through activation of D 2 -receptors, inhibited discharge of rapidly adapting receptors and was effective in reducing reflex-induced tachypnoea, mucus production and cough in the dog. <b>Sibenadet,</b> through its activation of β 2 -adrenoceptors, was also shown to be an effective bronchodilator with a prolonged duration of action following topical administration to the lungs. These studies also indicated that <b>sibenadet</b> had a wide therapeutic ratio with respect to expected undesirable side-effects such as emesis and cardiovascular disturbances. These results provided a compelling rationale for the initiation of a clinical development programme with <b>sibenadet</b> for the treatment of COPD...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn {{addition}} to breathlessness and cough, excessive mucus production {{is one of}} the main symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Excess mucus coupled with deteriorating mucociliary clearance is associated with a decline in lung function and an increased risk of death from pulmonary infection. The effect of ViozanTM (<b>Sibenadet</b> HCI, AR-C 68397 AA), a novel dual D 2 dopamine receptor, β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, on mucociliary clearance was investigated together with that of a β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, salbutamol. Using a double blind, parallel group study design, 15 patients with COPD, all habitual smokers, were randomised to receive nebulised sidenadet (3 mg tid; n= 7) or salbutamol (5 mg tid; n= 8) for 10 days. Lung mucociliary clearance rates were measured, by a standard radioaerosol technique, before and after the treatment period, as were 24 -h sputum volumes. Both <b>sibenadet</b> and salbutamol therapies resulted in significant (P< 0. 02) enhancement of lung mucociliary clearance. The 24 -h sputum volume was significantly reduced following <b>sibenadet</b> therapy (P< 0. 03) whereas salbutamol therapy had no effect. Our results, in {{addition to}} illustrating the effects of a standard β 2 agonist on mucociliary clearance, strongly suggest the potential dual benefit of dual-agonist compounds in lessening sputum production whilst simultaneously enhancing mucociliary clearance. For reasons unconnected with the present study, development work on this specific formulation is no longer proceeding...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe need {{to manage}} the key {{symptoms}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) (breathlessness, cough and sputum) is an important treatment objective. Viozan™ (<b>sibenadet</b> HCl, AR-C 68397 AA) is a novel dual D 2 dopamine receptor, β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, which combines conventional bronchodilatory activity with the sensory nerve modulation afforded by dopamine agonism. The efficacy of this agent in relieving patient symptoms has been determined in a series of large-scale clinical studies; the results of a 3 -month, placebo-controlled multi-centre study are reported. Effect on patient symptoms was determined using a novel patient-reported assessment instrument, the Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS©). Patients with smoking-related COPD were required to complete a 2 -week baseline period before being randomized to one of three treatment groups; <b>sibenadet</b> (500 μg three times daily) plus placebo (twice daily); salmeterol (50 μg twice daily) plus placebo (three times daily); placebo (twice daily) plus a second placebo (three times daily). All treatments were delivered via pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) for 12 weeks. From enrolment, patients were required to complete daily diary cards to record symptoms of breathlessness, cough and sputum, medication use and adverse events. The primary outcome measure was the difference between the mean BCSS total score measured over the baseline period and the mean BCSS total score in the final 4 weeks of the treatment period. Secondary measures included assessment of lung function, rescue medication use, exacerbations, health-related quality of life, opinion of efficacy and safety. Although an initial reduction in BCSS total score (indicating symptom improvement) was seen with <b>sibenadet</b> therapy, this effect was not maintained for the study duration. Salmeterol therapy, however, resulted in a sustained reduction in BCSS total score. No notable benefit over placebo was seen in lung function, exacerbations or health-related quality of life with either active treatment. While {{the results of this study}} failed to demonstrate sustained efficacy with <b>sibenadet</b> therapy, they do indicate the value of symptom assessment in the clinical evaluation of new drugs for the treatment of COPD...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{identify}} healthcare resource use patterns associated with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), resource utilization (RU) data collection was integrated into a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of Viozan™ (<b>sibenadet</b> HCI). This study enrolled patients with symptomatic, smoking-related COPD, randomized to receive <b>sibenadet</b> or placebo for a 52 -week treatment period. A questionnaire establishing typical pre-trial, COPD, randomized to RU was completed by each patient. Subsequent data were collected by means of an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) at 30 -day intervals (14 time points) during the study and in the follow-up period. The IVRS system facilitated data collection and minimized inconvient to the patients. Subsequent data were collected by means of an Interactive Voice Response System health services during the year-long study was high. No overall trend for lower RU was associated with <b>sibenadet</b> therapy, which correlates with the lack of sustained clinical effect seen in studies conducted concurrently. These data do, however, provide valuable information on RU associated with COPD and insights into adjustments associated with changes in disease course. Physicians were seen to be the most common source of care for patients with COPD and more of the patients with severe COPD (stage III) than mild (stage I) were seen to utilize the most expensive resources (e. g. inpatient hospital care). For those patients who experienced an exacerbation during the trial (irrespective of treatment group), resource use was increased during the periods when an exacerbation was reported when compared with the periods before or after an exacerbation. The proportion of cases attending the physician doubled and with a trip to the Emergency Room (ER) increased approximately ninefold during the reporting period in which the exacerbation occurred compared with the previous month. This study has shown that use of an IVRS, even in elderly patients, is an effective means of gathering RU data over long periods. The study findings suggest that the advent of effective therapeutic interventions, particularly any with the ability to minimize exacerbations and limit disease progression, could impact on the health care services used and potentially reduce associated costs...|$|E
40|$|Molecular packing in two polymorphs of <b>sibenadet</b> {{hydrochloride}} (AR-C 68397 AA, Viozan™) is investigated using {{a combined}} experimental 1 H double-quantum (DQ) solid-state magic-angle spinning {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} and computational (gauge including projected augmented wave calculation of chemical shifts) approach. For Form I, NH-NH and NH-OH 1 H DQ peaks are observed corresponding to nearest distances of 2. 62 and 2. 87 Å, respectively, for the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding arrangement in the single-crystal X-ray diffraction structure. The same 1 H DQ peaks at the same 1 H chemical shifts are observed for Form II, {{for which there is}} no single-crystal diffraction structure, indicating the same intermolecular hydrogen-bonding arrangement of the benzothiazolone moieties as in Form I. 1 H DQ build-up (as a function of the DQ recoupling time) curves are presented for the resolved NH-NH and NH-OH DQ peaks for the two polymorphs. For Form I, the ratio of the maximum intensity for the NH-OH and NH-NH DQ peaks is in excellent agreement with the ratio of the summed squares of the H-H dipolar couplings, as determined using H-H distances from the crystal structure up to 4 Å. Small differences in the 1 H DQ build-up behaviour for the two polymorphs are attributed to differences in the longer-range NH-OH distances associated with different inter-layer arrangements. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ...|$|E
