25|$|Originally {{an amateur}} entertainer, {{he took his}} first steps to professionalism while serving in the Italian army in Abyssinia under General Baldissera in 1890. A troupe of {{theatrical}} performers the general hired to entertain his soldiers did not materialise. Fregoli offered to fill in and was an immediate success. General Baldissera subsequently had Fregoli posted, not as a soldier but as a performer, to the theatre at Massowah, which he used to entertain soldiers. Fregoli became the director and stage manager of the theatre and casino. After a year he returned to Italy and performed in Rome, Genoa and Florence. In the audience at Florence was a government <b>registry</b> <b>clerk,</b> Ugo Biondi, who {{was so impressed with}} Fregoli's performance that he sought him out and asked for some lessons in how to follow in his footsteps. Fregoli generously complied and Biondi went on to be another great quick change artist-first claiming to be a pupil but later set up as the 'original' Fregoli.|$|R
50|$|Cianciulli {{was born}} in Montella. While still a young girl, she {{attempted}} suicide twice. In 1917 she married a <b>registry</b> office <b>clerk,</b> Raffaele Pansardi. Her parents did not approve of the marriage, as they had planned to marry her to another man. She claimed that on this occasion her mother cursed them. The couple moved to Pansardi's native town, Lauria, in 1921 where Cianciulli was sentenced for fraud and imprisoned in 1927. When released, the couple moved to Lacedonia. Their home was destroyed by an earthquake in 1930, and they moved once more, this time to Correggio, where Cianciulli opened a small shop. She was very popular and well-respected within her neighborhood.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{setting of}} the novel is the Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths of some {{ambiguous}} and unnamed city. This municipal archive holds the record cards for all residents of the city stretching back endlessly into the past. The protagonist is named Senhor José; the only character to be given a proper name (all of the others are referred to simply by some unique and defining characteristic). Senhor José is around fifty years old and has worked as a low-level clerk in the Central Registry for more than twenty years. His residence, where he lives alone, adjoins the building and contains the only side entrance into it. Lost in the tedium of a bureaucratic job, he starts to collect information about various famous people and decides, one evening, to use the side entrance to sneak in and steal their record cards. On one nocturnal venture he grabs the record card of an [...] "unknown woman" [...] by mistake and quickly becomes obsessed with finding her. Senhor José uses his power as a <b>registry</b> <b>clerk</b> to gather information from her past neighbors and, when it is suggested to look her up in a phone book, he ignores the advice choosing instead to keep his distance. The search begins to consume him and affects his work enough to draw attention from the Registrar, head of the Central Registry, who, strangely, begins to regard Senhor José with sympathy. This special attention given to a clerk by the Registrar is unprecedented in the known history of the Central Registry and begins to worry his fellow employees. Senhor José further neglects his duties as a civil servant and risks his career to pursue a woman he knows basically nothing about.|$|R
40|$|Medication-related {{problems}} (MRPs) are {{a common}} issue that lead to suboptimal healthcare outcomes and increased healthcare cost. Overall, older adults have {{a high risk of}} experiencing MRPs due to large medication consumption and recession of biological functions. One approach to reduce such a risk is for elderly patients to use comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs), the fundamental service of Medication Therapy Management (MTM). The Centers of Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) has been promoting CMRs among Medicare Part D beneficiaries since 2009, such as offering of an annual free CMR to eligible MTM beneficiaries and making “CMR completion rate” a quality rating (Star) measurement for Part D plans. However, statistics from the report of CMS 2017 Star rating measures showed that the CMR completion rate among MTM eligible was still low. Even though Medicare Part D beneficiaries ultimately make the decision, there are insufficient U. S. studies examining patient perceived factors affecting their use of CMRs. Thus, there is critical need to better understand decision making for using CMRs from a consumer perspective. This dissertation project aimed to explore Medicare Part D beneficiaries’ perceptions on using a CMR, using a conceptual framework adapted from consumer decision making, which consisted of internal need, external influence, perceived risks of using CMRs, and alternative comparison. The dissertation project also aimed to describe how CMR recipients and non-recipients were different and to identify main factors associated with Medicare Part D beneficiaries’ decision making for using CMRs. To achieve these objectives, this study used an exploratory sequential mixed-method approach in a cross-sectional setting. Semi-structured personal interviews were conducted as the qualitative phase followed by self-administered mailed survey as the quantitative phase. Both interview questions and survey items were developed based on the conceptual framework, though findings from qualitative phase informed the survey item generation as well. Survey items and administration were further refined using a panel of expert review and pilot study. A convenient sample consisted of older adults recruited from one pharmacy in Iowa and a <b>senior</b> <b>registry</b> maintained by University of Iowa was used for the qualitative phase (n = 13). The quantitative study sample were randomly selected from each sampling frame: 1) elderly residents of the States of Florida (n = 320), Washington (n = 320), Wisconsin (n = 320), and Pennsylvania (n = 320) covered in a commercial mailing list; and 2) older adults included in the same <b>senior</b> <b>registry</b> used for the qualitative phase (n = 460). The study inclusion criteria were: 1) must be at least 65 years old in 2016, 2) must be taking at least one prescription currently, and 3) must be a Medicare Part D beneficiary. A thematic analysis was conducted for qualitative data, using MaxQDA version 12. Descriptive analysis and multiple logistic regression modeling were used to analyze data of the quantitative phase, using SAS version 9. 4. A total of 13 study participants were included in the qualitative analysis, of which 5 were CMR recipients. The thematic analysis yielded five themes, which supported the use of the conceptual framework (i. e. internal need, external influences, perceived risks of using CMRs, and alternative comparison) to understand Medicare Part D beneficiaries’ decision making for using CMRs. Plus, consumers who received a CMR expressed a positive attitude towards them. Safety worriers or knowledge seekers appeared more likely to use CMRs while physician believers or privacy worriers are more likely to not use CMRs. Meanwhile, awareness of CMRs remains low after being available for 7 years, possibly due to an infrequent marketing activity. An overall usable response rate of 26. 8...|$|R

40|$|CANCER {{registries}} are {{now found}} throughout the world (Waterhouse et al [...] 1976) and much research {{is based on the}} information provided by them (e. g. Alderson, 1974). Population-based registries (as opposed to hospital-based registries) aim to register every patient who is diagnosed as having a malignant disease while resident in the registry area, so as to provide incidence rates for malignant disease in that area. In practice, full registration is rarely if ever achieved. The method of obtaining first notification of a case of malignancy differs even amongst the registries in England and Wales. An important source of information is the Registrar General, who sends to cancer registries copies of the death certificates of those persons who are cited on the certificate as having a malignant disease, and who are resident in the registry area at the time of death. This system is common to all cancer registries in England and Wales. However, the main source of information for these registries is the hospital service, and at least 3 different methods of collecting hospital information are used. For example, the South Thames Cancer <b>Registry</b> employs) eripatetic <b>clerks</b> who visit hospitals to extract the necessary information (Payne, 1969), the Welsh Cancer Registry uses the hospital activity analysis syste...|$|R
40|$|Background: Frail {{elderly people}} often have poor oral hygiene, {{contributing}} to oral health {{problems that can}} detract significantly from quality of life. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to describe oral health status of frail elderly individuals using the Revised Oral Assessment Guide-Jonkoping (ROAG-J), a mouth assessment instrument that can be used in daily nursing care Methods: Data were obtained from the Swedish <b>Senior</b> Alert quality <b>registry</b> in one Swedish municipality. ROAG-J assessments on admission to elder care and one subsequent occasion were used. ROAG-J measurements documented oral health in nine areas: voice, lips, oral mucosa, tongue, gums, teeth, saliva, swallowing, and presence of any prostheses or implants. Assessments were made by nursing staff during the course of daily nursing care Results: Individuals 65 years of age or older and receiving elder care services (N = 667) were involved; 1, 904 assessments made between November 2011 and March 2014 were used for the analysis. On the basis of both assessments, less than one third of participants had oral health problems. No significant difference in any of the oral health variables was found between first and subsequent assessments. At first assessment, men and women differed in tongue health (p <. 01); at the subsequent assessment, gender differences in voice (p <. 05), mucous membranes (p <. 003), tongue (p <. 01), and saliva (p <. 006) were observed Discussion: Most participants had good oral health. Assessments made by nursing staff using the ROAG-J demonstrate that this tool can be used in daily nursing care, where different, important oral conditions may be encountered. However, knowledge about oral health conditions and the ROAG-J instrument is important to ensure high validity. The ROAG-J enables nursing staff to detect problems in the mouth and to guide decisions related to oral health intervention...|$|R
