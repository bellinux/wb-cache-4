5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E

25|$|Electron {{diffraction}} is {{most frequently}} used in solid state physics and chemistry to study the crystal structure of solids. Experiments are usually performed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), or a <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM) as electron backscatter diffraction. In these instruments, electrons are accelerated by an electrostatic potential {{in order to gain}} the desired energy and determine their wavelength before they interact with the sample to be studied.|$|E
25|$|To achieve {{high-resolution}} in electron microscopes {{and other}} electron beam instruments (such {{as those used}} for electron beam lithography), {{it is helpful to}} start with an electron source that is small, optically bright and stable. Sources based on the geometry of a Mueller emitter qualify well on the first two criteria. The first electron microscope (EM) observation of an individual atom was made by Crewe, Wall and Langmore in 1970, using a <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> equipped with an early field emission gun.|$|E

25|$|The optical microscope, <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope,</b> X-ray {{diffraction}} and {{petrographic analysis}} {{can be used}} to determine the types and distribution of minerals in slag. The minerals present in slag are good indicators of the gas atmosphere in the furnace, the cooling rate of the slag and the homogeneity of the slag. The type of ore and flux used in the smelting process can be determined if there are elements of un-decomposed charge or even metal pills trapped in the slag.|$|E
25|$|Other {{completely}} {{different approach to}} microscopy is electron microscope (EM), which gives a beam of electrons {{in order to be}} focused onto the desired specimen with a design capable of giving a magnifying power up to 100,000 times.6 Electron microscopes are also used but very little when compared to light microscopes. (TEM) transmission electron microscope is more difficult to use and requires more sample preparation than <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM) and thus have found very few applications in forensic science.|$|E
25|$|In {{the front}} {{part of the}} thorax a {{conspicuous}} red halo is visible, forming a roughly circular stain with a diameter of seventeen millimetres. In 1998 it was suggested this might represent {{the remains of the}} decayed liver, a blood-rich organ. That the red pigment was indeed derived from blood was in 2011 confirmed: a <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> analysis indicated that the substance consisted of limonite, hydrated iron oxide, a likely transformation product of the original haemoglobin. Also biliverdine was present, a bile component expected in the liver. The blood might also partly have originated from the heart and the spleen, two similarly blood-rich organs, with reptiles positioned between the two lobes of the liver.|$|E

25|$|A <b>scanning</b> <b>{{electron}}</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM) {{is a type}} of {{electron microscope}} that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition. The electron beam is scanned in a raster scan pattern, and the beam's position is combined with the detected signal to produce an image. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer. Specimens can be observed in high vacuum in conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in variable pressure or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments.|$|E
25|$|Zircon {{has played}} an {{important}} role during the evolution of radiometric dating. Zircons contain trace amounts of uranium and thorium (from 10 ppm up to 1 wt%) and can be dated using several modern analytical techniques. Because zircons can survive geologic processes like erosion, transport, even high-grade metamorphism, they contain a rich and varied record of geological processes. Currently, zircons are typically dated by uranium-lead (U-Pb), fission-track, cathodoluminescence, and U+Th/He techniques. For instance, imaging the cathodoluminescence emission from fast electrons {{can be used as a}} prescreening tool for high-resolution secondary-ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS) to image the zonation pattern and identify regions of interest for isotope analysis. This is done using an integrated cathodoluminescence and <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> Zircons in sedimentary rock can identify the sediment source.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, Quanguo Li et al. {{determined}} the plumage coloration of Microraptor {{based on the}} new specimen BMNHC PH881, which also showed several other features previously unknown in Microraptor. By analyzing the fossilized melanosomes (pigment cells) in the fossil with <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> techniques, the researchers compared their arrangements to those of modern birds. In Microraptor, these cells were shaped {{in a manner consistent}} with black, glossy coloration in modern birds. These rod-shaped, narrow melanosomes were arranged in stacked layers, much like those of a modern starling, and indicated iridescence in the plumage of Microraptor. Though the researchers state that the true function of the iridescence is yet unknown, it has been suggested that the tiny dromaeosaur was using its glossy coat as a form of communication or sexual display, much as in modern iridescent birds.|$|E

25|$|In 1932, Ernst Lubcke of Siemens & Halske {{built and}} {{obtained}} images from a prototype electron microscope, applying concepts {{described in the}} Rudenberg patent applications. Five years later (1937), the firm financed the work of Ernst Ruska and Bodo von Borries, and employed Helmut Ruska (Ernst’s brother) to develop applications for the microscope, especially with biological specimens. Also in 1937, Manfred von Ardenne pioneered the <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> The first commercial electron microscope was produced in 1938 by Siemens. The first North American electron microscope was constructed in 1938, at the University of Toronto, by Eli Franklin Burton and students Cecil Hall, James Hillier, and Albert Prebus; and Siemens produced a transmission electron microscope (TEM) in 1939. Although contemporary transmission electron microscopes are capable of two million-power magnification, as scientific instruments, they remain based upon Ruska’s prototype.|$|E
25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis forms slow growing, {{brown or}} black colonies. As is common amongst black yeasts, E. dermatitidis is an {{anamorphic}} fungus with multiple conidial forms. This morphological plasticity has complicated taxonomic determination {{based solely on}} physical appearance. Young colonies are described as waxy, mucoid, smooth, and yeastlike. Over time pigmented aerial hyphae develop, and older colonies are described as appearing filamentous and velvety. Conidia are between globular and elliptical in shape, and form {{at the mouth of}} short annellidic conidiogenous cells. Annellations can only be observed by electron microscopy. Prior to analysis by <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope,</b> the condiogenous cells were observed to form from non-annelated phialides and phialides without collarettes. These observations caused the species to be erroneously provided with its own monotypic genus, Wangiella. The species name Wangiella dermatitidis is still commonly used in the scientific literature.|$|E
25|$|There are {{uncertainties}} {{with this}} approach using current microscopy techniques. If {{it is possible to}} replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone, then the resolution afforded by a <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> would suffice for such a technique. However, as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events (particularly at synapses, but also at other places on the neuron's cell membrane), this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions. It may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons, through the use of sophisticated immunohistochemistry staining methods that could then be read via confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, as the physiological genesis of 'mind' is not currently known, this method {{may not be able to}} access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity.|$|E
