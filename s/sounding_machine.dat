25|$|Fish Hawk {{also was}} {{outfitted}} to conduct general scientific {{research related to}} fisheries, including depth sounding, measuring {{the temperature of the}} sea bottom, and collecting marine animals and plants. She had a hoisting winch with 1,000 fathoms (6,000 feet; 1,829 meters) of steel cable for trawling and dredging, an otter trawl, a 9-foot (2.75-meter) beam trawl, an 11-foot (3.6-meter) beam trawl, a 17-foot (5.2-meter) beam trawl, Blake and Chester rake dredges, and a tangle bar, the latter an iron axle and wheels with deck swabs or bundles of rope yarn on chains that Fish Hawk could drag along the sea bottom to capture marine animals and plants.

25|$|The Patterson {{was named}} for Carlile Pollock Patterson, fourth Superintendent of the Coast Survey and first of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The New York Times {{credited}} the design to Commander Colby Mitchell Chester, USN, at that time Hydrographic Inspector in USC Naval architect Samuel Hartt Pook, U.S. Naval Constructor, was credited with supervising the drawings. She was built of wood in James D. Leary's yard at Williamsburg (Brooklyn) New York. Frames were white oak with cedar tops; planking, beams and lower deck were yellow pine, the upper deck was white pine. Her hull was fitted with iron diagonal braces, and five watertight bulkheads (3 wood, 2 iron). Power was a Cross compound vertical steam engine (one source reports 356hp, another source says 215 ihp; this difference may represent different calculation or measurement methods) and she could carry 133 tons of coal as fuel. Her machinery was constructed by Neafie & Levy of Philadelphia. She was rigged as a barkentine with double topsail yards; standing rigging was galvanized charcoal-iron wire. Her boats were two steam launches, two cutters, two whaleboats, and a dinghy. Her deckhouse, 13 × 62ft, included the engine and boiler rooms, galley, pantry, and a drafting room. She carried a Sigsbee piano-wire <b>sounding</b> <b>machine,</b> state-of-the-art for deep-water hydrography, holding five miles of wire. Lieutenant Richardson Clover, USN, supervised construction and became her first commander.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the potential influence of audience design on interpreters’ behaviour in the genre of interpreted government press conferences. The interpreters of these government press conferences are required to follow the principle of ‘faithfulness, accuracy and completeness’ but casual observation suggests that the interpreters do depart from this principle. The hypothesis on which the present study is founded is that audience design, that is the adjustment of a speaker’s output to suit a particular participation framework, is involved in interpreters’ performance. In order to test this hypothesis, the theoretical framework of the study draws upon theories from interpreting studies, sociolinguistics and pragmatics. The investigation is carried out through a study of participation frameworks, face management strategies and information management strategies in an authentic corpus constructed by the author, comprising three interpreted and televised press conferences held by the Chinese Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are chosen to analyze the selected parameters in order that recurrent patterns can be identified. The study confirms the hypothesis that the interpreters’ behaviour varies in accordance with the particular audience (i. e. the primary intended receiver) that they have in mind to serve at any given moment. This study shows that human factors are involved and challenges the public perception that interpreters are mere <b>sounding</b> <b>machines</b> with little or no personal agency.

In addition to the measurement results of the amount of load, the penetration rate and the number of rotations, the area loosened due to ground subsidence was identified by paying attention to the scuttle frequency considering subsidence frequency specific to a NSWS test (machine) as a parameter.

Massey’s <b>sounding</b> <b>machine</b> could then be hauled in and the depth could be read off the dials in fathoms.

Again, the device was designed to operate alongside a lead and line. In this case, the buoy would be pulled behind the ship and the line threaded through the pulley. The lead could then be released. The buoy ensured that the lead fell perpendicular to the sea floor even when the ship was moving. The spring-loaded pulley would then catch the rope when the lead hit the sea bed, ensuring an accurate reading of the depth.|$|E
