5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> are produced further {{away from the body}} than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. <b>Some</b> <b>signs</b> are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from African American English.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005–06 season, UConn showed <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> of improvement, {{winning the}} Big East Tournament and beating Georgia in the Sweet Sixteen {{thanks to a}} fadeaway 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left by senior Barbara Turner. Behind a home state crowd, UConn almost upset #1 ranked Duke in the {{regional}} final, before falling in overtime by 2 points.|$|E
5|$|When Secretariat first {{retired to}} Claiborne Farm, his sperm showed <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> of immaturity, {{so he was}} bred to three non-Thoroughbred mares in December 1973 to test his fertility.

5|$|They {{are named}} after Franz Reuleaux, a 19th-century German {{engineer}} who pioneered {{the study of}} machines for translating one type of motion into another, and who used Reuleaux triangles in his designs. However, these shapes were known before his time, for instance by the designers of Gothic church windows, by Leonardo da Vinci, who used it for a map projection, and by Leonhard Euler {{in his study of}} constant-width shapes. Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the shape to guitar picks, pencils, and drill bits for drilling square holes, as well as in graphic design in the shapes of <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> and corporate logos.|$|E
5|$|As Erica moved {{towards the}} south and {{subsequently}} to the north, the cyclone strengthened, becoming equivalent to a tropical storm according to the JTWC by 1500UTC on 5 March. Erica later attained maximum sustained winds of 105km/h (65mph 1-minute sustained). However the system began to move against {{the direction of the}} wind shear environment, and it lost much of its organization. On 7 March at 2230UTC, Erica lost cyclone status and degenerated into a tropical low. The remnant circulation moved slowly to the northeast, and the wind shear conditions abated. As a result, Erica began to gain <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> of organization. At this time the remnants moved towards the southeast {{as a result of an}} upper-level trough developing over Australia.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{organized}} into a tropical cyclone in the Andaman Sea, {{the origins of}} the 1999Odisha cyclone {{can be traced back to}} an area of convection that began developing in the Sulu Sea on October21. Despite <b>some</b> <b>signs</b> of development, wind shear suppressed outflow and prevented any significant organization. Tracking westward, the disturbance encountered a more favorable environment in the South China Sea; as a result, thunderstorm activity began to increase. Prompted by these changes, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 02:00UTC on 23October. However, the system failed to develop any further before wind shear reemerged in the Gulf of Thailand, causing convection to diminish and resulting in the cancellation of the TCFA. On 24October, the storm crossed the Malay Peninsula and moved into the Andaman Sea by 03:00UTC the following day. Although the environment remained moderately unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the disturbance organized, developing fair outflow, a strong rainband, and additional convection. At 06:00UTC on 25October, the system became a tropical depression while centered 550km (340mi) east of Port Blair. As such, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as BOB03. With the storm now steadily organizing, the JTWC once again issued a TCFA at 19:30UTC on 25October; early the following day, the IMD assessed that the nascent depression had strengthened into a cyclonic storm. At the time, the storm was located 325km (200mi) south-southeast of Rangoon, Myanmar.|$|E
