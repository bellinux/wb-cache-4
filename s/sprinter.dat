40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} the anthropometry of <b>sprinters</b> and people {{belonging to the}} normal population. The height and body mass (BM) distribution of <b>sprinters</b> (42 men and 44 women) were statistically compared to the distributions of American and Danish normal populations. The main results showed that there was significantly less BM and height variability (measured as standard deviation) among male <b>sprinters</b> than among the normal male population (US and Danish), while female <b>sprinters</b> showed less BM variability than the US and Danish normal female populations. On average the American normal population was shorter than the <b>sprinters.</b> There was no height difference between the <b>sprinters</b> and the Danish normal population. All female groups had similar height variability. Both male and female <b>sprinters</b> had lower body mass index (BMI) than the normal populations. It is likely {{that there is no}} single optimal height for <b>sprinters,</b> but instead there is an optimum range that differs for males and females. This range in height appears to exclude people who are very tall or very short in stature. <b>Sprinters</b> are generally lighter in BM than normal populations. Also, the BM variation among <b>sprinters</b> is less than the variation among normal populations. These anthropometric characteristics typical of <b>sprinters</b> might be explained, in part, by the influence the anthropometric characteristics have on relative muscle strength and step lengt...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the step {{characteristics}} during the acceleration phase (0 — 30 m) of a 100 -m sprint with reference to the step-type of <b>sprinters.</b> 59 male collegiate <b>sprinters</b> (season best time: 10. 68 ± 0. 22 s) were recorded running in 100 -m races using 10 high-speed video cameras (300 fps). The step variables, such as step-frequency (SF), step-length (SL), contact time, and flight time of each step in the acceleration phase (0 — 30 m) and maximum speed phase (30 — 60 m) were calculated. Cluster analysis was used to classify the subjects according to step-type as indicators for the ratio of SF and SL in the 30 — 60 m section. In addition, each of the step-type groups was divided into two sub-groups (good and poor <b>sprinters)</b> according to the mean speed in the 30 — 60 m section. The main results were as follows: (1) <b>Sprinters</b> were classifiable into 3 step-type groups; SL-type (n= 22), SF-type (n= 24), and Mid-type (n= 13). (2) Among these groups, there were no differences in the 100 -m race times and mean speeds during the 0 — 30, 30 — 60, and 60 — 100 m sections, although SL-type <b>sprinters</b> were taller and had a higher SLindex than SF-type <b>sprinters.</b> SF-type <b>sprinters</b> took a larger numbers of steps over the 100 -m distance and showed a higher SFindex than SL-type and Mid-type <b>sprinters.</b> (3) In the 0 — 30 m and 30 — 60 m sections, the contact and flight times of SL-type <b>sprinters</b> were longer than those of SF-type <b>sprinters.</b> (4) In SL-type <b>sprinters,</b> the SF of good <b>sprinters</b> was higher than that of poor <b>sprinters</b> at the 5 th step, and the SL of good <b>sprinters</b> was longer than that of poor <b>sprinters</b> from the 7 th to 15 th steps, and in the 30 — 60 m section. (5) SF-type <b>sprinters</b> showed no significant differences in the SL, but the SF of good <b>sprinters</b> was higher than that of poor <b>sprinters</b> from the 7 th to 16 th steps and in the 30 — 60 m section. These results indicate that there are differences in step characteristics during the acceleration phase according to step-type, and that the step characteristics during the acceleration phase may affect the acceleration ability needed to develop a maximum sprint speed. These findings could be useful for devising training methods for improvement of 100 -m sprint performance according to step-type...|$|R
5|$|Chambers transitioned {{into the}} senior ranks soon after, taking the 100m silver medal behind his British {{teammate}} Darren Campbell at the 1998 European Championships. He achieved a new personal best in September at the 1998 IAAF World Cup with {{a run of}} 10.03s for third place and won a relay gold medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games he was a 100m semi finalist and set a games record {{as part of the}} 4×100m relay team. His ability attracted the attention of former <b>sprinter</b> and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mike McFarlane, who became his coach. He came first in the 100m in the 1999 European Cup, then at a meet in Nuremberg he became only the second European <b>sprinter</b> (after Linford Christie) to break the ten second barrier with a time of 9.99s. Fellow British <b>sprinter</b> Jason Gardener scored a time of 9.98s in Lausanne soon after, becoming the third Briton to break the barrier.

He received a two-year athletics ban in 2003 after testing positive for THG, a banned performance-enhancing drug.|$|E
30|$|Similar to able-bodied <b>sprinters,</b> most of {{the medals}} for the 100 -m sprint in past Paralympic Games and IPC Athletics World Championships were {{dominated}} by West African (WA) and Caucasian (CC) amputee <b>sprinters,</b> not Asian (AS) <b>sprinters.</b> Although these results indicate differences in sprint performance due to ethnicity, {{little is known about}} the ethnicity and spatiotemporal parameters of the 100 -m sprint for amputee <b>sprinters.</b> The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in the spatiotemporal parameters of WA, CC and AS <b>sprinters</b> with bilateral and unilateral transtibial amputations during a 100 -m sprint. We analyzed 6 WA, 28 CC, and 10 AS amputee <b>sprinters</b> from publicly available Internet broadcasts. For each <b>sprinter’s</b> run, the average speed, average step length, and step frequency were calculated by using the number of steps in conjunction with the official race time. No significant differences were found in the spatiotemporal parameters of the 100 -m sprint for the WA and CC groups. On the other hand, the average speed of the AS group was significantly lower because of its shorter step length during the 100 -m sprint. The results suggest that WA and CC <b>sprinters</b> would perform similarly during a 100 -m sprint, but AS <b>sprinters</b> would not.|$|R

50|$|During the race, {{the lead}} out rider {{may choose to}} hug the {{measurement}} line {{on the inside of}} the track giving them the shortest path around the track. Likewise, they may choose to hug the <b>sprinter's</b> line (a red line 85 cm up track) to force their opponent to come higher over the top of them.

30|$|Previous studies {{comparing}} fascicle length among subjects {{reported that}} fascicle length was different between <b>sprinters</b> and non-sprinters (Abe et al. 2001), and between <b>sprinters</b> and distance runners (Abe et al. 2000); it was longer in <b>sprinters.</b> This {{may be caused}} by innate factors and not training plasticity. In <b>sprinters,</b> it is obvious that a larger shortening velocity of the muscle fibre is needed. As mentioned in the introduction, a long fascicle (i.e., large numbers of sarcomere in series) can shorten faster than a short fascicle (Bodine et al. 1982; Sacks and Roy 1982; Spector et al. 1980). Taken together, those with a naturally long fascicle lengths may become <b>sprinters,</b> because obtaining a long fascicle with resistance training would be difficult, considering {{the results of the present}} study.|$|R
