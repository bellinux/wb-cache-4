It is especially important to try to develop planning and management approaches that actually integrate traditional knowledge and western management systems. In northern Canada, modern comprehensive land claim agreements have been negotiated and signed {{with the intent of}} transferring lands, rights, and resource management responsibilities. Many important lessons can be derived from the integrated approach to conservation and resource planning undertaken in the Gwich’in Settlement Area. This paper outlines the key management structures and the systematic processes used to try and incorporate Gwich’in traditional knowledge. Successes and failures are highlighted and key strategies and tools are outlined as well. Key barriers included staff resistance, western-science biases, and community concerns about western-approaches. Key solutions were the use of culturally appropriate planning tools, full involvement of community groups, the setting of integrated, <b>strategic</b> <b>research</b> <b>agendas,</b> the development of traditional knowledge policies, and the development of other concrete mechanisms for incorporating local values and knowledge.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAntibacterial {{resistant}} {{infections are}} rising continuously, resulting in increased {{morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. With no new antibiotic classes entering {{the market and the}} possibility of returning to the pre-antibiotic era, the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR) was established to address this problem. We aimed to quantify the scale and scope of publicly funded antibacterial resistance research across JPIAMR countries and at the European Union (EU) level to identify gaps and future opportunities. MethodsWe did a systematic observational analysis examining antibacterial resistance research funding. Databases of funding organisations across 19 countries and at EU level were systematically searched for publicly funded antibacterial resistance research from Jan 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 2013. We categorised studies {{on the basis of the}} JPIAMR <b>strategic</b> <b>research</b> <b>agenda's</b> six priority topics (therapeutics, diagnostics, surveillance, transmission, environment, and interventions) and did an observational analysis. Only research funded by public funding bodies was collected and no private organisations were contacted for their investments. Projects in basic, applied, and clinical research, including epidemiological, public health, and veterinary research and trials were identified using keyword searches by organisations, and inclusion criteria were based on the JPIAMR <b>strategic</b> <b>research</b> <b>agenda's</b> six priority topics, using project titles and abstracts as filters. FindingsWe identified 1243 antibacterial resistance research projects, with a total public investment of € 1 · 3 billion across 19 countries and at EU level, including public investment in the Innovative Medicines Initiative. Of the total amount invested in antibacterial resistance research across the time period, € 646 · 6 million (49 · 5 %) was invested at the national level and € 659 · 2 million (50 · 5 %) at the EU level. When projects were classified under the six priority topics we found that 763 (63 %) of 1208 projects funded at national level were within the area of therapeutics, versus 185 (15 %) in transmission, 131 (11 %) in diagnostics, 53 (4 %) in interventions, and only 37 (3 %) in environment and 39 (3 %) in surveillance. InterpretationThis was the first systematic analysis of research funding of antibacterial resistance of this scale and scope, which relied on the availability and accuracy of data from organisations included. Large variation was seen between countries both in terms of number of projects and associated investment and across the six priority topics. To determine the future direction of JPIAMR countries a clear picture of the funding landscape across Europe and Canada is needed. Countries should work together to increase the effect of research funding by strengthening national and international coordination and collaborations, harmonising research activities, and collectively pooling resources to fund multidisciplinary projects. The JPIAMR have developed a publicly available database to document the antibacterial resistance research collected and can be used as a baseline to analyse funding from 2014 onwards.

40|$|CSA Oceans {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} policy needs CSA Oceans has completed its preliminary analysis of policy needs. The public deliverable {{reports on the}} current status of marine and maritime policies relevant to JPI Oceans and identifies examples of science to policy mechanisms. The report uses stakeholder input to identify the needs of different policies to fulfil their objectives. One of the underlying issues is thought to be a lack of integration between marine and maritime activities. It was suggested that new technologies, integrated systems and greater data sharing could be the key to developing more holistic management strategies. Stakeholders also identified several examples of effective science to policy mechanisms which include ICES, the IPCC assessment, and science-policy activities of the European Marine Board. Evidence for the public deliverable was gathered from three stakeholder consultation exercises conducted in 2013. This involved a series of stakeholder workshops, a national funding agencies questionnaire, and an online consultation. Next steps The next step for CSA Oceans - Work Package 5 is to build on the findings of the first deliverable. The next deliverable will develop case studies, based on the examples identified, and suggest how JPI Oceans could improve science to policy mechanisms in Europe.

40|$|Europe’s recent <b>strategic</b> {{aviation}} <b>research</b> <b>agenda,</b> Flightpath 2050, {{asks for}} enabling four hour or less door-to-door travel time for 90 % of all Intra-European travelers. To statistically deduce passenger air travel times, {{this paper presents}} a spatio-temporal graph search and passenger allocation algorithm that combines aggregated demand data and published flight schedules. The results indicate that 90 % of all current Intra-European air ravelers require four hour or less from origin airport to destination airport, rather than from door-to-door. Most passengers require 60 - 90 minutes to reach their final destination airports, but markets with a travel time etween 90 and 210 minutes experienced greater growth rates. The share of journeys that {{take a long time}} to complete is highest for departures in the early morning or around noon. The vast majority of all Intra-European passengers travel direct and the directness of the overall system increased from 2002 to 2012, largely due to the emergence of low cost carriers.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{have evolved}} into large and complex systems {{and are now}} one of the major {{technologies}} used in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Extensive research on WSNs has {{led to the development of}} diverse solutions for all layers of software architecture, including protocol stacks for communications. For example, more than one hundred distinct medium access control protocols and fifty routing and transport-level solutions have been proposed. This multitude of solutions is due to the limited computational power and restrictions on energy consumption that must be accounted for when designing typical WSN systems. The performance of a given high-level application task may depend strongly on the specific composition of the system's protocol stack, the run-time specifics of the underlying operating system, and the potential non-deterministic behavior of the devices used in the network. This makes it very difficult to identify the optimal software architecture for any particular situation. In many cases, software components must be developed specifically for each combination of task, environment and hardware. It is therefore challenging to develop, test, and validate even small WSN applications and this process can easily consume significant resources. This dissertation investigates various approaches for making the testing and validation of large scale WSN systems more efficient. The theoretical contribution presented is a method that enables the accurate reproduction of phenomena occurring inside real sensor node hardware and software at all layers of abstraction. This will expedite the design, development, and testing of WSN functionality. The main technical contribution is a prototype of a simulation framework named Symphony, which implements the proposed method. The framework's key feature is its ability to perform ultra-large scale holistic experiments on WSN functionality with millions of nodes using configurable levels of abstraction. The behavior observable using Symphony is very similar to the run-time behavior that developers would observe in reality. This is achieved via the virtualization of real-world operating systems and by using measurement-based hardware emulation and software component models. The impact of this dissertation is twofold. First, the proposed methodology and associated development framework will facilitate the education and training of specialists in the future IoT. Second, from a more long-term perspective, the thesis paves the way to solutions for several critical problems that have been highlighted in many <b>strategic</b> <b>research</b> <b>agendas</b> concerning the development of future industrial systems, including the streamlined validation of equipment and service interoperability across different vendors and application domains, and the rapid integrated design of future large scale CPS.
