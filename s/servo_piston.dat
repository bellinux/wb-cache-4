50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} {{are used}} in several hydro applications, including turbine couplings, blade bolts, turbine wheel to shaft bolting, pelton turbine nozzles, <b>servo</b> <b>piston</b> nuts, bearing housings, and ball valves. Multi-jackbolt expansion bolts provide additional benefit for shaft couplings, because they generate both radial and axial forces, creating the interference fit necessary. MJTs can also easily achieve the high preloads required on Kaplan turbine crossheads and <b>servo</b> <b>piston</b> rods.|$|E
50|$|The gyros were {{connected}} to air valves on an associated supply line. This lowered or raised the pressure {{on one side of}} a <b>servo</b> <b>piston,</b> the other side being attached to the original supply without passing through the valve. Any precession of the gyros, due to movement of the aircraft, caused the pistons to move due to the differential pressure. This motion was smoothed by an oil-filled dashpot, one {{for each of the three}} servos.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} assistance is supplied by a <b>servo</b> <b>piston</b> {{operating in a}} cylinder integral with the steering box casting. The teeth of a rack projecting from the piston mesh with a sector of a spur gear machined into the sector shaft. A roller in the sector shaft meshes with the helical track on the cam, and the two together are responsible for providing the variable ratio. No external lockstops are provided as they are incorporated into the steering box.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007 it was {{announced}} that the cause of the crash was a failure of the hydraulic flight control system, caused by coating flaking off from <b>servo</b> <b>pistons.</b> The loosened plasma coating flakes blocked the return valves of the servos, causing the aircraft to abruptly lose its maneuverability. Copterline did not have the authority to service or even open these components. However, in the final report, Copterline was criticized for omitting a periodic leak test of the hydraulic flight control system that could have revealed the problem. The Finnish authorities were also criticized for insufficient supervision.|$|R
50|$|The {{governor}} {{is connected to}} the output shaft and regulates the hydraulic pressure depending on the vehicle speed. The engine load is monitored either by a throttle cable or a vacuum modulator. The valve body is the hydraulic control center that receives pressurized fluid from the main pump operated by the fluid coupling/torque converter. The pressure coming from this pump is regulated and used to run a network of spring-loaded valves, check balls and <b>servo</b> <b>pistons.</b> The valves use the pump pressure and the pressure from a centrifugal governor on the output side (as well as hydraulic signals from the range selector valves and the throttle valve or modulator) to control which ratio is selected on the gearset; as the vehicle and engine change speed, the difference between the pressures changes, causing different sets of valves to open and close. The hydraulic pressure controlled by these valves drives the various clutch and brake band actuators, thereby controlling the operation of the planetary gearset to select the optimum gear ratio for the current operating conditions. However, in many modern automatic transmissions, the valves are controlled by electro-mechanical servos which are controlled by the electronic engine control unit (ECU) or a separate transmission control unit (TCU, also known as transmission control module (TCM).|$|R
30|$|The two {{sensitivity}} indexes of {{the system}} return oil pressure, the total <b>piston</b> stroke of <b>servo</b> cylinder,the initial <b>piston</b> position of <b>servo</b> cylinder, the effective bulk modulus and the conversion mass are small under the nine selected working conditions. While the two sensitivity indexes of the natural frequency of servo valve, the damping ratio of servo valve, the system supply oil pressure, the internal leakage coefficient, the effective <b>piston</b> area of <b>servo</b> cylinder, the proportional gain, the force sensor gain and the viscous damping coefficient are large.|$|R
50|$|When {{steering}} effort is applied {{at the wheel}} it is transmitted to the rotor, which transmits the effort to the hour glass cam {{by means of the}} torsion bar. The rotor is normally centred in its sleeve by the torsion bar but manual {{steering effort}} twists the torsion bar, permitting the rotor to turn within its sleeve, opening the way for hydraulic fluid pressure to be applied to one or other side of the <b>servo</b> <b>piston,</b> thus assisting in turning the front wheels.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{geometric}} {{complexity and}} high fluid speeds involved in high {{pressure die casting}} (HPDC) combine to give strongly three-dimensional fluid flow with significant free surface fragmentation and splashing. A Lagrangian simulation technique that is particularly well suited to modelling HPDC is smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Materials are approximated by particles that are free to move around rather than by fixed grids, enabling the accurate prediction of fluid flows involving complex free surface motion. Validation of isothermal SPH flow predictions for the casting of a <b>servo</b> <b>piston</b> head using water analogue experiments is presented. Comparison with MAGMAsoft predictions provides information of the relative strengths of these two approaches. The SPH simulations were better able to capture the key details of the fluid motion and splashing, particularly the relative rates of flow around sharp bends and through thin sections. Validation of flow predictions coupled to temperature and solidification using short shots are also presented. The bulk features of the final solid castings are in good agreement with the predictions. Several automotive examples of SPH simulated HPDC flows are presented, ranging from simple cases such as a <b>servo</b> <b>piston</b> to steering column components and a full engine rocker cover. These show unprecedented detail in the fluid free surfaces, particularly in the extent of fragmentation and void formation. These results together combine to demonstrate that SPH modelling of HPDC has now reached a level where both isothermal and thermal simulations can be performed in reasonable computation times for large scale automotive castings and provide {{a high degree of}} predictive accuracy...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} design and {{analysis}} of a fluidic pneumatic position <b>servo.</b> Rolling diaphragm <b>piston</b> actuators are used for the system drive, and a hydrostatic gas journal bearing is used as the position sensor. The servo has a 1 inch range which is monitored using an electrical capacitive position transducer that was built {{as an integral part}} of the system. Open-loop frequency response testing provides the basis for a mathematical model of the system. The servo response is linear at frequencies up to 3 Hertz. The frequency response appeared to be limited by the design of the gas bearing sensor, and it is felt that an order of magnitude improvement could result from an improved design...|$|R
30|$|When an {{output curve}} {{force is applied}} to a {{horizontal}} servo cylinder with a heavy load, the piston rod bears a dynamic partial load based on the installation and load characteristics, which significantly affects the frequency response and control accuracy of the servo cylinder. Based on this partial load, increased friction can lead to cylinder bore scuffing, leakage, lack of output power, or even system failure. In this paper, a novel asymmetric static-pressure support structure is proposed based on the principle of hydrostatic support. The radial component force of a dynamic partial load is balanced by cooperation between the support oil cushion of the variable hydraulic pressure support structure, oil cushion of the supportive force, and the damper. Adaptive control of the <b>servo</b> cylinder <b>piston</b> rod, guide sleeve, and piston, as well as the cylinder oil film friction between lubricated surfaces is achieved. In this paper, theoretical design and analysis of the traditional hydrostatic bearing structure and novel structure are presented. A hydraulic dynamic shear scissor is used as a research target to derive a structural dynamic model. Comparative simulations are performed using Matlab Simulink. Additionally, flow field analysis of the novel structure is performed, which verifies the rationality and feasibility of the proposed structure and system.|$|R
30|$|During <b>servo</b> operation, the <b>piston</b> and {{piston rod}} are {{subjected}} to gravity and partial loading from unbalanced radial components. This force can be adjusted within a certain range using the force generated by pressure changes in the oil chambers of {{the upper and lower}} oil pads, which result from changes in the gap between the piston rod and seal oil edge. This ensures that the piston rod, guide sleeve, and cylinder maintain gaps in an appropriate range to facilitate oil film lubrication and reduce friction between the piston rod and guide sleeve, and piston and cylinder. This results in increased system load-bearing capacity and anti-eccentric load capacity, as well as wear-free operation over wide speed and load ranges, which significantly increases the reliability and longevity of horizontal hydraulic cylinders.|$|R
30|$|Yet {{sensitivity}} analysis {{has a few}} applications in hydraulic system. Vilenus [18] applied trajectory {{sensitivity analysis}} to the valve-controlled cylinder system of the logging machine and the mathematical model of this system was simplified to fifth order model where the servo valve flow-pressure nonlinearity and dead zone nonlinearity were taken into consideration. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of ten main parameters containing viscous damping coefficient, conversion mass, internal leakage coefficient of <b>servo</b> cylinder, effective <b>piston</b> area of <b>servo</b> cylinder, effective bulk modulus, servo valve gain, nature frequency of servo valve, damping ratio of servo valve, conversion coefficient and system supply oil pressure is obtained with parameters change 1 % under single working condition. The sensitivity analysis {{results indicated that the}} sensitivity of piston rod area of the servo cylinder, servo valve gain, conversion flow coefficient and system supply oil pressure is large and that of viscous damping coefficient, internal leakage coefficient of the servo valve, damping ratio of servo vale and nature frequency of the servo valve is relatively small under the same working condition. Furthermore, Farasat et al. [19] founded the fourth order linear mathematical model of the valve-controlled cylinder position control system where the servo valve flow-pressure nonlinearity is linearized partially. The sensitivity of other parameters, such as servo valve torque motor constant, servo valve area constant, orifice opening of metering valve, system return oil pressure, supply oil volume, return oil volume and input signal voltage, is given with parameters change 1 % under single working condition by four sensitivity evaluation methods including VILENUS method, revised VILENUS method, Entirety index method and Individual characteristics method. The analysis results indicated that the sensitivity of effective <b>piston</b> area of <b>servo</b> cylinder, flow coefficient, conversion mass and input signal voltage is relatively small. Kong et al. [20 – 22] first established the fifth linear order mathematical model for the hydraulic drive unit of quadruped robot and derived the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Aimed at the imprecise conclusion of sensitivity analysis obtained from the linear model, some nonlinear models are also established. Besides, the sensitivity mathematical expressions with nonlinear and time-varied parameters are derived under the trotting gait working conditions. Kong et al. [23] derived the mathematical model of the second order trajectory sensitivity analysis based on the mathematical model of the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Therefore, the situation where the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis accuracy of some parameters is not high is improved. Then the experimental verification is conducted.|$|R
