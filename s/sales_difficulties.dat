50|$|In August 2000, with {{continuing}} domestic <b>sales</b> <b>difficulties,</b> a {{joint venture}} was formed with Mayflower, now owners of the Dennis and Alexander brands. The joint venture, known as TransBus International, included only the United Kingdom bus manufacturing operations, including Plaxton and Northern Counties. Henlys held a 30% stake in the joint venture, which employed 3,300 employees at seven locations. The traditional brands of Alexander, Dennis and Plaxton were replaced by TransBus International. In 2004 Mayflower Group failed, and TransBus International went into administration. It was soon bought out by new businesses Alexander Dennis and a new incarnation of Plaxton.|$|E
50|$|The 3rd Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) {{took place}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between September 14 and September 21, 1978. It showcased 85 films, the lowest number of films in the festival's history. In Praise of Older Women {{directed}} by George Kaczender {{was selected as the}} opening film. When the Ontario Film Review Board objected to a 40-second scene between Marilyn Lightstone and Tom Berenger, co-producer of the film Robert Lantos cut the scene for the theatrical run. Despite that, some of the TIFF staff managed to smuggle original uncut version of the film and run it into the theatre. The news got lots of publicity from press, which increased public interest in the film resulting in an increased number of tickets <b>sales.</b> <b>Difficulties</b> arose when audiences waiting outside the theatre noticed that each ticket admitted two person thus causing anger in the crowd. The audience who were not able to get seats during the first screening were invited to a later screening. The People's Choice Award was introduced this year, which is given to a feature film chosen by a vote of the festival audience.|$|E

The wine producers as well as the state have to adjust themselves to the new rules and to the new legal framework. The paper has analysed the current situation in the Croatian wine sector, explored the need for establishment of an institution that could help producers in wine marketing as well as the role of the government. According to the survey 73. 6 % wine producers sell their wine exclusively on the domestic market and 26. 4 % producers sell it on both domestic and international market. The results have indicated that 53. 6 % of the producers expect wine <b>sale</b> <b>difficulties</b> after Croatia enters the EU.

5000|$|President George Washington, in {{his address}} to the Seneca nation in 1790, {{described}} the pre-Constitutional Indian land <b>sale</b> <b>difficulties</b> as [...] "evils", asserted that the case was now entirely altered, and publicly pledged to uphold their [...] "just rights". In March and April of 1792, Washington met with 50 tribal chiefs in Philadelphia—including the Iroquois—to discuss closer friendship {{between them and the}} United States. Later that same year, in his Fourth Annual Message to Congress, Washington stressed the need for building peace, trust, and commerce with America's Indian neighbors: I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier, and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory. To enable, by competent rewards, the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them, as agents, would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If, in addition to these expedients, an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes, and for carrying on trade with them, upon a scale equal to their wants, and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion, its influence in cementing their interests with our’s sic could not but be considerable. In 1795, in his Seventh Annual Message to Congress, Washington intimated that if the U.S. government wanted peace with the Indians, then it must give peace to them, and that if the U.S. wanted raids by Indians to stop, then raids by American [...] "frontier inhabitants" [...] must also stop.|$|R
50|$|A further {{rationale}} is {{that under}} the principle of freedom of contract, if debtors wish to enjoy the additional protection of the formalities of judicial foreclosure, it is their burden to find a lender willing to provide a loan secured by a traditional conventional mortgage instead of a deed of trust with a power of <b>sale.</b> The <b>difficulty</b> in finding such a lender in nonjudicial foreclosure states is not the state's problem. (Obviously, any rational lender {{in such a state}} would be skeptical of the creditworthiness of a person expressly requesting such protection.) Courts have also rejected as frivolous the argument that the mere legislative act of authorizing or regulating the nonjudicial foreclosure process thereby transforms the process itself into state action.|$|R
5000|$|In this promotion, some Coca-Cola cans had cash prizes or gift {{certificates}} inside instead of Coca-Cola. The prizes were spring-loaded to {{pop out of}} the opening once the can was opened. The prize would either be money, from $1 to $500, or coupons redeemable for trips or merchandise. The total giveaway of cash and prize coupons was $4 million. The original plan was to randomly distribute about 750,000 MagiCans among the 200 million cans of Coca-Cola Classic in circulation at any one time. [...] To make the cans feel and weigh normal, and prevent people from easily finding the prize cans, a sealed area within the cans {{was filled with a}} mixture of chlorinated water and foul-smelling ammonium sulfate to discourage drinking.

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that there {{is the need to}} study the issues of formation of scientifically based logistics solutions. Moreover, by analogy with the systems theory in engineering, it comes to research of the effectiveness of these decisions in conditions of limited, incomplete and often inaccurate information. In general, the management of the logistics process is based on the adopted corporate policies and involves the coordination of related solutions in various areas (scientific, technical, economic, marketing, <b>sales,</b> etc.). The <b>difficulty</b> of solving this problem is the complexity of combining all these elements to achieve the long-run objective that is to optimize the logistics process in view of the strategic objectives of the organization.|$|R

25|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Metroid Prime, Nintendo asked Retro Studios {{to produce a}} sequel. The developers decided against recycling {{the features of the}} first game while creating , and instead used new sound models, weapon effects, and art designs. A multiplayer component was also added to the game. On April 2003, Steve Barcia left the company. Michael Kelbaugh, who had worked with Nintendo for over 15 years, was appointed president, a job he retains to this date. Retro tried to include some extras, such as a hidden version of Super Metroid, but were halted by the short development time. Producer Kensuke Tanabe later revealed in an interview that the game was just about thirty percent complete three months before the strict deadline Nintendo had set for a release in the 2004 holiday season. The critical reception for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes was very positive, but earned some criticism on the game's high <b>difficulty.</b> <b>Sales</b> for Echoes were lower than the first Prime, with a total of 800,000 units.|$|R

40|$|Forecasting sales {{accurately}} for a {{new product}} is difficult and complex due to non-availability of past data. However, such forecast information is crucial for successful introduction of new products which, in turn, determines the survival of companies, in many cases. Decisions relating to new products depend critically on reliable period-by-period sales forecasts (otherwise called forecast time series) as early as possible in the new product development cycle. This information is crucial in assessing cash flow and NPV relating to the new product. There have been many attempts to use growth curves (otherwise called diffusion models), such as the Bass model. These models made use of past data about analogous products to do this task. However, this method, although considered the best method, available, has many problems, such as identifying analogous products which can reliably mimic the new product in its <b>sales</b> characteristics. These <b>difficulties</b> explain why the accuracy of forecasts reported by such methods is, at best, 50 %. Here we propose an innovative conceptual framework to obtain time series data required for forming the growth curve for the new product by bootstrapping the growth curve models with a novel 'Forecast market' mechanism. The effectiveness of the 'Forecast market' in obtaining accurate estimates of the time series data itself is likely to be enhanced by letting the 'Forecast market' participants use product information ranging from simple pictures of the product to high-end virtual reality systems which enable them to visualise and appreciate the features of the new product...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of the companies {{has changed in the}} last 5 - 6 years: they became cautious and suspicious about partners and other economic actors. This is a direct consequence of the large number of insolvent and liquidated companies, and other effects of the economic and financial crisis. The impaired financing options, the sharp fall of <b>sales</b> caused <b>difficulties</b> for companies. In general, the financial and liquidity situation of the companies is getting worse, so new financial policies are needed. To make the financial activities efficient, it is indispensable that the policy makers are aware of the real financial and liquidity situation of their own companies. But, in order to conduct successful business relationships, enterprises {{need to be aware of}} the financial situation of their partners as well. Intensified trade relations between the EU member states will require these companies to learn more about financial and liquidity situations. This present paper examines two countries, namely, a Hungarian and a Romanian region’s commercial companies financial and liquidity situations of the 2010 - 2012 periods. The article presents the subject both from theoretical and practical data aspects too. Based on the available e-data reports, the investigation starts with the net working capital’s examination. The working capital management has a crucial role in their financing policies. The size of the net working capital affects the degree of financial policy’s flexibility. The negative net working capital calls the attention for financial problems. The study continues with the calculation of traditional liquidity ratios, which may also reflect the liquidity situation of the companies. It is recommended not to accept the results of these indicators without calculating any other liquidity ratios. These indicators show an actual situation, so they can distort reality (positive or negative). Other indicators and methods are needed to assess the real situation. The study was completed with the analysis of indebtedness and profitability as well. These indicators can play a big role in the financial and liquidity situation of the companies. The indebtedness ratio shows the presence of large foreign capital, which can help in difficult liquidity moments. But the large amount of foreign capital also presents a risk for the company. The effectiveness level of the company shows the company’s profitability, which is essential for the long–term viability. This comparative analysis paper studies three key years of the economic and financial mondial crisis. The results, the trends of the indicators values hopefully will lead to an increase in trust between the partners...|$|R
50|$|Conventionally, the SFPP is {{considered}} a failure. Virginia Glandon, one of the historians who have most researched the company describes the falling circulation of Sinn Féin in the following way:Sinn Féin’s circulation grew, then dropped steadily during the years 1909 through 1911. The number of copies distributed {{during the week of}} 3 September 1909 totalled 64,515; with 25,515 copies going to various agents throughout Ireland, 32,482 to Eason’s, a major Dublin outlet, 5,472 to cash sales, and 1,044 to subscribers. During the week of 16 January 1910, the daily circulated 29, 961 copies and the weekly only 3,463. In financial difficulty from the outset, the daily collapsed during that same month, but with its failure, the weekly raised its circulation to 6,307 during March of that year. … As of 3 March 1911, Sinn Féin circulated only 4,452 copies a week.This approach (also adopted by Michael Laffan and Kevin Rafter) does not take readership into account. Mathew Staunton has argued that the core business of the SFPP was propaganda and that in spite of falling <b>sales</b> and financial <b>difficulties</b> Griffith and his colleagues were very successful in achieving their aims: A conservative estimate would put readership at five or six times the number of newspapers sold, somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 and, if we consider these impressive figures, it is clear that in terms of propaganda the operation was a success Unfortunately for the SFPP, this success did not translate into a large sum of money and would not have generated more than £100, which represents only half of what was necessary to run the newspaper. On top of that, unlike Eason & Son who paid their bills promptly every month, the smaller agents who were dotted all over the country seem to have been far less diligent and it was sometimes necessary to send a representative of the SFPP to collect overdue payments in person.|$|R
40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the potential}} for, {{and extent of}} barriers to, effective consumer participation in the Victorian energy market. It makes recommendations {{as to how the}} Victorian retail market could be improved and simplified for consumers. Some of the key findings of the research relate to the level of understanding of Victorian consumers in the energy market.  The report, in line with previous reports from the Essential Services Commission and the Australian Energy Market Commission, finds that many Victorian consumers find it difficult to understand offer information.  In fact, 42 per cent of consumers surveyed as part of this research indicated that they found it difficult to understand offer information. This compared to the 32 per cent who found it comparatively easy.   The research also provides evidence of ongoing problems of mis-selling by door to door <b>sales</b> representatives and <b>difficulties</b> finding reliable information through other channels such as commercial price comparison services.  This compromises the ability of consumers to access quality information upon which to make well-informed consumption decisions.   The findings suggest that the effectiveness of consumer participation in the Victorian market is less than optimal and may not be placing adequate competitive pressure on energy retailers.  A number of recommendations are made in the report that include: approaches to improve the simplicity and comparability of offers through regulatory reform; the introduction of an education and information program for Victorian energy consumers; the introduction of a regulatory code in order to improve comparison services; and the development an energy retailer rating scheme.   CUAC hopes that this report will be closely considered by all stakeholders so that we can achieve improvements to both the Victorian and national market in the interests of all energy consumers.   CUAC will be hosting an event involving all stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report in further detail early in 2012.  Keep an eye out for future announcements of this event so that you can participate in this important policy debate.      See also: Highlights from Improving energy market competition through consumer participatio...|$|R
