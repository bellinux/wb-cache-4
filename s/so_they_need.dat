25|$|During {{pregnancy}} and breastfeeding, women must ingest enough nutrients {{for themselves and}} their child, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K). In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in developing countries and increased the risk of death during childbirth. A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).|$|E
25|$|The onboard passive {{hydrogen}} maser and rubidium clocks are very stable {{over a few}} hours. If they were left to run indefinitely, though, their timekeeping would drift, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to be synchronized regularly with a network of even more stable ground-based reference clocks. These include active {{hydrogen maser}} clocks and clocks based on the caesium frequency standard, which show a far better medium and long-term stability than rubidium or passive hydrogen maser clocks. These clocks on the ground are gathered together within the parallel functioning Precise Timing Facilities in the Fucino and Oberpfaffhofen Galileo Control Centres. The ground based clocks also generate a worldwide time reference called Galileo System Time (GST), the standard for the Galileo system and are routinely compared to the local realizations of UTC, the UTC(k) of the European frequency and time laboratories.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} thin {{materials}} which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of stockinette fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, laminated layers of nylon and butyl rubber known as Trilaminate or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With {{the exception of the}} rubber-coated stockinette, membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to be made slightly over-sized and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.|$|E

500|$|Including Nala, The Lion King {{has only}} three major female {{characters}} {{in comparison to}} the film's total of nine male ones. Shepherd University's Emmylou Allen observed that Nala is introduced [...] "as a dominating young girl" [...] who ultimately matures into [...] "a strong woman" [...] by the film's conclusion. Mouse Morality: The Rhetoric of Disney Animated Film author Annalee R. Ward wrote that Nala's role in The Lion King reflected [...] "a 1990s feminist reversal". In her book Biblical Allusions, author Lindsay Bacher acknowledged that Nala is often depicted as a stronger and more responsible character than Simba, despite observations that The Lion Kings female characters lack agency. Leab identified Nala as Simba's [...] "equal" [...] who is [...] "a more naturally sound leader throughout the film, while Simba tends to be comparatively a bit more immature and in need of multiple characters propelling him into responsible/rightful action." [...] Physically, Nala is also a stronger and more skilled fighter than Simba, proven by the character's ability to overwhelm him in battle, which is reminiscent [...] "of the physical power of lionesses in the real nature." [...] However, as strong as she is, Nala has little impact elsewhere; author Brian K. Pennington wrote in his book Teaching Religion and Violence that [...] "Nala's assertions of gender equality are clearly groundless, since only a male lion can stop Scar." [...] New Yorks David Denbey dismissed Nala's athleticism as nothing more than Disney's attempt to [...] "disguise [...] essential boss-daddy ethos." [...] Bacher believes that had The Lion King featured Nala as the Pride Lands' hero as opposed to Simba, the film could have avoided having a [...] "patriarchal structure." [...] Leab concluded that [...] "the main and most problematic aspects of the film" [...] remain that The Lion King [...] "boils down to the fact that an entire group of strong female characters are unable to confront a single male oppressor; to do <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to be led by a dominant male." [...] Leab continued, [...] "It almost sucks more that Nala is such a strong ... female character and still ends up constrained by this plot device", accusing the film of depicting women as weak.|$|E
2500|$|The site of Salisbury was a {{naturally}} flat and marshy meadow, bounded by a rough kopje. The pioneers were about [...] short of Mount Hampden, but Pennefather climbed the kopje, surveyed the open veld {{and insisted that}} it was [...] "magnificent", <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> go no further. He reported back to Rhodes in triumphant tones: [...] "Site selected ... All well. Magnificent country. Natives pleased to see us". On the morning of 13 September 1890, about 10:00, the officers and men of the Pioneer Column paraded atop the kopje before an improvised flagstaff. With the column standing to attention, Lieutenant Edward Tyndale-Biscoe hoisted the Union Jack, a 21-gun salute was fired, and three cheers were given for the Queen. Work then began on the fort, which was completed {{by the end of}} September. The Pioneer Column was then disbanded.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 10 {{concludes with}} Inflammable Gass accidentally {{releasing}} a [...] "Pestilence", which he fears will kill {{everyone on the}} Island; [...] "While Tilly Lally & Scopprell were pumping at the air pump Smack went the glass.
