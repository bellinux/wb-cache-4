MethodsThe chemical composition of cholesterol and fatty acids was analyzed in eight different types of meat and feijoada 1 in relation to different methods of preparation. ResultsFeijoada, when prepared with the beans and meats in separate pots, has less cholesterol (12. 1 vs. 16. 1 mg, respectively, p= 0. 005) and saturated fat (1. 4 vs. 1. 9 mg, p= 0. 046) than when it is prepared in a single pot. Broiled chicken without the skin has less saturated fat when compared with <b>skinless</b> fried <b>chicken</b> (1, 505 vs. 7, 645 mg, p= 0. 049).

5000|$|As {{the market}} for chicken wings became larger {{restaurants}} began to create and {{use a variety of}} sauces in addition to buffalo sauce. Some of these new chicken wing sauces were influenced by Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Caribbean, and Indian cuisines. Other flavors created by restaurants include unique combinations, such as Blueberry BBQ Wing Sauce and Maple/Bacon Glaze for example, to help keep customer interest and grow their businesses. Because of the increased cost in the price of chicken wings, and a desire by some diners for a neater eating experience, restaurants began to offer a menu item called [...] "boneless wings," [...] sometimes marketed under the name wyngz. Boneless wings are essentially small pieces of <b>skinless,</b> boneless <b>chicken</b> breast that are coated in flour and spices then fried or baked. They are usually coated in or served with similar sauces as chicken wings. The growth of popularity in recent years in Buffalo wing consumption and restaurants serving wings have led to actual and perceived shortages of chicken wings in the United States during certain times.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of two dietary energy sources, soy bean oil, and sucrose on regulatory mechanisms of meat preservation. Twenty one day-old Hubbard commercial broilers were randomly allocated into two dietary treatment groups with six replicates per treatment, and four broilers per replicate. All birds were coded for the influence of energy source: fat based diet (FD), and sugar based diet (SD). Formulated grower diets were isonitrogenous and isocaloric. The chickens were slaughtered and then boneless, <b>skinless</b> ground <b>chicken</b> tight meat was prepared. Both raw and cooked meats were analyzed for lipid and protein oxidation, and sensory panel evaluation. In addition, meat from the small muscles of the raw thigh was used to evaluate other meat quality characteristics. Proximate analyses showed no significant differences between both dietary treatments on protein, ash and moisture percentage values. Meat samples of the group that was fed FD showed higher significant values of both TBARS and total carbonyl at day 7 of storage time. However, samples of the second group (Fed SD) showed lower values of both ultimate pH and water separation % using raw thigh meat. The effect of FD treatment on the meat composition appeared clearly especially on fat percentage content. In addition, meat samples obtained from chickens fed SD showed better significant values of the overall acceptability attribute. According to the current findings, sucrose could be an excellent alternative to oil in dietary broilers which improved the meat preservation bio-system, and post-mortem storage stability...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Extreme paleness of <b>skinless,</b> {{boneless}} <b>chicken</b> breasts sampled {{from the}} packaging {{area of a}} commercial processing plant was investigated. Six hundred fillets were collected during 10 visits to the same processing plant and were classified as normal (n = 300) and pale (n = 300) according to visual assessment by the principal investigator. Color (spectrocolorimetry) and pH of each fillet were measured within 1 h following collection. Fillets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and pooled samples of pale and normal meat were later analyzed for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), percentage mois-ture, total pigment, myoglobin, and iron concentrations. Color characteristics (L, a, and b values), pH, total pigment, myoglobin, and iron concentrations were all {{found to be significantly}} different in pale meat when compared with normal chicken breast. The TBARS values and percentage moisture for the two groups were not different. Analyses of L, a, and b values revealed that the L characteris-tic was a good color indicator {{that can be used to}} distinguish normal from pale samples, with both high sensitivity and high specificity. Moisture uptake in postchilled, pale fillets could not account for the decrease in total pigment concentration and myoglobin content.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of tannic acid (TA) on the oxidative stability and the quality characteristics of ground chicken breast meat. Five treatments including (1) control (none added), (2) 2. 5 ppm TA, (3) 5 ppm TA, (4) 10 ppm TA, and (5) 5 ppm butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) were added to boneless, <b>skinless</b> ground <b>chicken</b> breast meat, and used for both raw and cooked meat studies. For the raw meat study, the ground chicken breast meat was packaged in oxygen-permeable bags and stored at 4 °C for 7 days. For the cooked study, raw ground meat samples were vacuum-packaged in oxygen-impermeable vacuum bags, cooked in-bag to the internal temperature of 75 °C, re-packaged in oxygen-permeable bags, and then stored. Both raw and cooked meats were analyzed for lipid and protein oxidation, color, and volatiles (cooked meat only) at 0, 3, and 7 days of storage. Raw meats with 10 ppm of TA added had significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) lower lipid and protein oxidation than other treatments during storage. In addition, TA at 10 ppm level maintained the highest color a*- and L*-values during storage. Cooked chicken breast meat with 5 and 10 ppm TA added produced significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) lower amounts of off-odor volatiles than other treatments. Among the volatile compounds, the amount of hexanal increased rapidly during storage for cooked meat. However, meats with 5 and 10 ppm TA added showed the lowest amount of hexanal and other aldehydes related to lipid oxidation, indicating a strong antioxidant effect of TA in cooked chicken breast meat. Furthermore, the differences in aldehydes among the treatments were bigger in cooked than in raw meat, indicating that the antioxidant effect of TA in cooked meat was greater than that in raw meat. Therefore, TA at > 5 ppm can be used as a good natural preservative in cooked chicken meat to maintain its quality during storage...|$|R

5000|$|As an {{explanation}} of why unusual meats would taste more like chicken than common alternatives such as beef or pork, different possibilities have been offered. One idea is that chicken has a bland taste because fat contributes more flavour than muscle (especially {{in the case of}} a lean cut such as a <b>skinless</b> <b>chicken</b> breast), making it a generic choice for comparison. Also, chicken reportedly has lower levels of glutamates that contribute to the [...] "savory" [...] aspect of taste known as umami; processing or tenderizing other meats would also lower glutamate levels and make them taste more like chicken. Modern poultry, particularly mass-produced chicken and turkey, is particularly bland in taste, as animals are bred for large muscle mass that grows faster than naturally breeding fowl; trace chemicals in the meat that would give it a distinctive flavor would thus be dispersed through larger amounts of muscle with less time to accumulate, thus giving lower concentrations per ounce of meat and creating a more generic taste.|$|E
50|$|Recipes {{for chicken}} mull vary {{slightly}} {{from person to}} person, but it is usually made by first cooking a whole chicken by boiling or parboiling, allowing a rich broth to form. The chicken is then removed from the pot and the meat is pulled from the bones or cut off with a knife. The skin, bones and fat are removed as well. Sometimes boneless, <b>skinless</b> <b>chicken</b> breasts are used instead of a whole chicken. A thickening of milk or cream is made (and sometimes evaporated milk is added as well) and added to the broth. Several sleeves of saltine crackers can be crumbled into broth and chicken mixture {{as it is the}} more common method of thickening the mull. The chicken is usually ground up in a meat grinder, although sometimes it is cut into small pieces. The chicken is then added back into the liquid along with salt, pepper and butter or margarine. Various other ingredients may be added to the stew according to local tradition, (such as diced potatoes or onions); a more common addition is varying amounts of hot sauce.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer-based}} tool (available at: www. wisc. edu/foodsafety/meatresearch) {{was developed}} for predicting pathogen growth in raw pork, beef, and poultry meat. The tool, THERM (temperature history evaluation for raw meats), predicts the growth of pathogens in pork and beef (Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella serovars, and Staphylococcus aureus) and on poultry (Salmonella serovars and S. aureus) during short-term temperature abuse. The model was developed as follows: 25 -g samples of raw ground pork, beef, and turkey were inoculated with a five-strain cocktail of the target pathogen(s) and held at isothermal temperatures from 10 to 43. 3 C. Log CFU per sample data were obtained for each pathogen and used to determine lag-phase duration (LPD) and growth rate (GR) by DMFit software. The LPD and GR were used to develop the THERM predictive tool, into which chronological time and temperature data for raw meat processing and storage are entered. The THERM tool then predicts a log CFU value for the desired pathogen-product combination. The accuracy of THERM was tested in 20 different inoculation experiments that involved multiple products (coarse-ground beef, <b>skinless</b> <b>chicken</b> breast meat, turkey scapula meat, and ground turkey) and temperature-abuse scenarios. With the time-temperature data from each experiment, THERM accurately predicted the pathogen growth and no growth (with growth defined as log CFU 0. 3) in 67, 85, and 95 % of the experiments with E. coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella serovars, and S. aureus, respectively, and yielded fail-safe predictions in the remaining experiments.

Both raw and cooked meats were analyzed for lipid and protein oxidation, volatiles, and color at 0, 3, and 7 days of storage. Oregano essential oil significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) lipid and protein oxidation, and improved color stability of raw and cooked meat. However, oregano oil at 400 ppm showed the strongest effect for all these parameters. Hexanal was the major aldehyde, which was decreased significantly (p < 0. 05) by oregano oil treatment, in cooked meat. Overall, oregano essential oil at 100 – 400 ppm levels could be a good preservative that can replace the synthetic antioxidant in chicken meat...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of electron beam irradiation in reducing microbial contamination and extending shelf-life in chicken breast fillets was investigated. Because electron beam irradiation can possibly increase lipid oxidation in cooked breast fillets, vacuum packaging was also investigated {{as a means}} of minimizing the effects of lipid oxidation on breast fillets. Boneless, <b>skinless</b> <b>chicken</b> breast fillets were subjected to electron beam irradiation doses of 0. 8, 1. 0, and 1. 8 kGy and stored up to 42 days at 4 C. Breast fillets were also packaged and stored in vacuum packaging in an attempt to reduce effects of electron beam irradiation on lipid oxidation in breast fillets. Microbial analyses were conducted to determine population levels of coliforms, generic E. coli, total aerobic bacteria, psychrotrophs, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in the fillets. Color determination, sensory evaluation, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were used as parameters {{to determine the effects of}} electron beam irradiation on overall quality of breast fillets. Results suggested that even the minimum dose of 0. 8 kGy was effective in eliminating coliforms, generic E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in irradiated samples. Population levels of total aerobic bacteria and psychrotrophs were not completely eliminated, but even the minimum dose of 0. 8 kGy resulted in a substantial decrease in population levels. Vacuum packaging had no effect on population levels. All three levels of irradiation resulted in an increase in a* values or redness of the products with vacuum packaged samples having higher a* values. Results from sensory evaluation indicated that increasing levels of irradiation and storage time resulted in less acceptable products. However, fewer TBARS were observed in breast fillets that had been vacuum packaged and then irradiated indicating that less lipid oxidation occurred. As storage time increased, TBARS also increased, but at a lower rate in both non-irradiated and irradiated vacuum packaged breast fillets. ...|$|E
