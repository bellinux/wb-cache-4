5|$|In June 2016, Ariel Sabar {{published}} an article in The Atlantic which identified the previous owner of the papyrus as Walter Fritz, rather than Laukamp, and provided further evidence for supposing that the papyrus was a forgery. Fritz initially denied being the papyrus' owner, but later admitted to it. Fritz was a former Egyptology student who left his job at a German museum after items from the museum went missing. For several years, he ran pornography websites featuring his wife, who believes that she can channel God and Michael the Archangel; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>even</b> published a book of sayings that she believes God transmitted through her. The Atlantic speculated that Fritz may have been motivated to forge the text by financial issues - Fritz had recently been unable to sell his house - or a desire to make The Da Vinci Code a reality; he denies having any financial problems, but had seen The Da Vinci Codes film adaptation. Sabar had found that Fritz once ran an art website where he sold artworks which resembled ancient manuscripts. Fritz denied that he or anyone else forged the Gospel of Jesus' Wife, but admitted {{that he may have}} been able to do so had he tried. Fritz also stressed to Sabar that he never once claimed that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife was a genuinely ancient text.|$|E

With her dark long hair and beauty, she so impressed the theater director Max Reinhardt, that he offered the part of First Angel in a revival of his and Hugo von Hofmannsthal's adaptation of Calderón's The Great Theater of the World for the Salzburg Festival of 1934. Werfel, however, did not think Manon had the training for such an important role, having only performed in a few theater productions that he had directed himself to entertain her mother and their friends on the long back porch of Haus Mahler in Breitenstein, a porch designed by her father in 1916. So, as her stepfather, Werfel refused to allow Manon the opportunity.|$|E

One of the producers of the track, Fernando Garibay, recalled that the inspiration came from the events {{that took place in}} August 2010, when Proposition 8 was overturned in California.

It debuted at position 15 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and reached eight the next week, but was present there for only two weeks.

We all know he wrote it for financial gain and the truth {{had little to do}} with it", after the book {{was released}}. With Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 1, she added that [...] " [...] really went through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, and I ended up writing him a letter saying, 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't want to have anything to do with it – and please leave my friends alone'." [...] The singer said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>even</b> sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about – that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial began}} in June 1934 before Justice William Ives with {{three days of}} {{testimony}} from MacMillan. [...] Brownlee's lawyer, Arthur LeRoy Smith, used his cross examination {{to call into question}} almost everything MacMillan said. [...] To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton, he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs, dated before <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>even</b> met Brownlee. [...] He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction, which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton, the city had been engulfed in a blizzard. [...] Moreover, the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until {{more than a year after}} that date. [...] In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid's room while staying with the Brownlees, Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee's room. [...] After MacMillan conceded her mistake, Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee's room had a large deadbolt on the door: if she had feared Brownlee, why had she not used it? [...] "Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said," [...] was the plaintiff's response. [...] MacMillan, when questioned, admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932, which she had initially placed at six weeks, was actually only four. [...] When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May, Smith showed that Brownlee had been out of town for all but ten nights of that period.|$|E

In a diary entry dated 16 January 1945, Shanina wrote that despite her wish to be in a safer place, some unknown force was drawing her to the front line. In the same entry she wrote that she had no fear and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>even</b> agreed to go [...] "to a melee combat." [...] The next day, Shanina wrote in a letter that she might {{be on the verge of}} being killed because her battalion had lost 72 out of 78 people. Her last diary entry reports that German fire had become so intense that the Soviet troops, including herself, had sheltered inside self-propelled guns. On 27 January Shanina was severely injured while shielding a wounded artillery officer. She was found by two soldiers disemboweled, with her chest torn open by a shell fragment. Despite attempts to save her, Shanina died the following day near the Richau estate (later a Soviet settlement of Telmanovka), [...] southeast of the East Prussian village of Ilmsdorf (...) [...] Nurse Yekaterina Radkina remembered Shanina telling her that she regretted having done so little. By the day of Shanina's death the Soviets had overtaken several major East Prussian localities, including Tilsit, Insterburg and Pillau, and approached Königsberg. Recalling the moment Shanina's mother received notification of her daughter's death, her brother Marat wrote: [...] "I clearly remembered mother's eyes. They weren't teary anymore.... 'That's all, that's all'—she repeated". Shanina was buried under a spreading pear tree on the shore of the Alle River—now called the Lava— and was later reinterred in the settlement of Znamensk, Kaliningrad Oblast.|$|E
