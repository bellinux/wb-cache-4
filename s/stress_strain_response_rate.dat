40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} {{moisture}} and temperature on high <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>responses</b> of S 2 -glass–vinyl ester woven composites {{have been studied}} in this work. Compressive properties and micro-structural damage progression under high strain rate loading have been investigated using the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar technique. The compressive stress pulse is applied through the thickness direction (TD) {{as well as through}} the filler direction. The <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>responses</b> at <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> ranging 490 – 1470 s 1 under various environmental conditions have been investigated and the relevant failure modes have also been identified by optical and scanning electron microscopic examinations. The results indicate that moisture and temperature degrade the compressive failure strength under high strain rate loading. The level of such degradation is seen to vary with strain rates and loading direction. In general, the failure strength and failure strain of both dry and wet samples are seen to be increased under high strain rate loading. The strain rate sensitivity of the woven composites is more significant if the failure is dominated by the resin materials. High temperature tests were conducted at temperatures ranging 23 – 204 C. The maximum rate effect is observed below the glass transition temperature, Tg (121 C) specifically for TD specimens. Microbuck-ling of the fiber, kinking and fiber splitting are the major failure modes for the specimens loaded in filler direction. The specimens loaded in the thickness direction mostly failed under matrix cracking. KEY WORDS: woven composites, high strain rate, moisture and temperature effects...|$|R

Data was obtained at high strain rates and large strains using the split Hopkinson pressure bar technique. This information, plus additional data from the literature, was used to critically evaluate {{the ability of the}} Johnson Cook material model to represent the deformation and failure response of Ti- 6 AMV and 2024 -T 3 under conditions relevant to simulations of engine containment and the influence of uncontained engine debris on aircraft structures. This model is being used in the DYNA 3 D finite element code, which is being developed/validated for evaluating aircraft/engine designs relative to the federal airworthiness standards and for improving mitigation/containment technology. The results of the experimental work reported here were used to define a new set of material constants for the strength component of the Johnson Cook model for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and 2024 -T 3. The capabilities and limitations of the model are reviewed. The model can accurately represent the stress-strain response of the materials. The major concern with the Johnson Cook material model is its ability to accurately represent the <b>stress</b> - <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>response</b> at <b>strain</b> <b>rates</b> greater than 10 {sup 3 }- 10 {sup 4 } s{sup {minus} 1 }. Additional work is also needed to adequately account for failure via shear localization, which was the dominant failure mode at high strain rates in both materials.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the cyclic deformation processes and their interaction with the kinetics of stage-I crack growth under stress control is rudimentary in copper single crystals. This understanding is necessary to conceive a method for summing damage under variable amplitude loading. In this thesis a detailed investigation of the cyclic <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>response</b> and stage-I crack growth kinetics under both constant and variable amplitude stress control has been undertaken. ^ It is found that the cyclic <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>response</b> of copper single crystals depends upon the starting conditions of the test. The absence or presence of PSB 2 ̆ 7 s in a crystal can be controlled by varying the startup. If PSB 2 ̆ 7 s exist in the crystal then the cyclic <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>response</b> does not show saturation behavior and instead the plastic strain increases throughout life. On the other hand the cyclic <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>response</b> saturates if PSB 2 ̆ 7 s do {{not exist in the}} crystal. ^ The increase in plastic strain in crystals containing a population of PSB 2 ̆ 7 s is tied to the nucleation of new PSB 2 ̆ 7 s. Thus, the volume fraction of PSB 2 ̆ 7 s, and hence the nucleation sites for cracks, keeps increasing throughout life under stress control as opposed to under strain control where the volume fraction of PSB 2 ̆ 7 s at a certain strain is fixed. Since PSB 2 ̆ 7 s are nucleation sites for cracks, the population of cracks is found to be much larger in stress control than under strain control. ^ The growth of this population of cracks is proportional to the cumulative strain under both constant and variable amplitude fatigue except that under variable amplitude fatigue the constant of proportionality is modified. The population reaches a critical density, and the fatigue life is said to be exhausted, when the average separation of the cracks is equal to the strain relaxation region (an idea developed by Ma and Laird). Methods for summing damage under constant and variable amplitude stress controlled fatigue are proposed that predict the number of cycles necessary to achieve the critical population density. ...|$|R

This method however has a limited applicability due to the simplifying assumptions such as perfect bond. A numerical model for simulation of tensile behavior of reinforced cement-based composites is presented to capture the inefficiency of the bond mechanisms. In this approach the role of interface properties which are instrumental in the simulation of the tensile response is investigated. The model simulates the tension stiffening effect of cracked matrix, and evolution of crack spacing in tensile members. Independent experimental results obtained from literature are used to verify the model and develop composite tensile <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>response</b> using alkali resistant (AR) glass textile reinforced concrete.

40|$|Rock mass modulus can be {{a useful}} {{property}} {{in the design of}} foundations. Rock mass modulus is defined as the <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>response</b> of a rock mass in-situ. The <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>response</b> of the rock mass can be estimated by directly measuring the <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> relationship via in-situ field tests, such as the pressuremeter, or it can be estimated from the results of laboratory intact specimen tests. Intact laboratory test results are often reduced to account for imperfections or discontinuities and other properties of the rock mass that may be present in the entire system, but are not easily replicated in the lab. The rock mass modulus can be used to design piles, drilled shafts and shallow foundations that are typically employed on Missouri Department of Transportation projects. Most current methods of estimating this modulus requires coring and sampling the material, transporting samples back to a lab with appropriate equipment, extruding and preparing samples and finally performing triaxial tests and estimating the modulus from the resulting <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> curves. Shale formations found in Missouri are typically sensitive to changes in moisture content and disturbance from sampling and sample preparation. Generally lab tests are only performed on samples that can withstand the disturbances associated with sampling and preparation. Therefore lab tests generally yield values of intact modulus and the insitu rock mass modulus must be estimated or implied from these results. The pressuremeter test (PMT) offers a potentially better method to assess the in-situ rock mass modulus. The PMT allows testing of difficult to sample materials, e. g., shale, under in-situ stress and structure conditions resulting in a modulus more representative of the shale mass. Pressuremeter tests were performed at five sites in Missouri and the results were reduced to yield rock mass modulus. Intact samples of shale recovered from each site and returned to the laboratory for unconsolidated undrained and unconfined triaxial tests to yield intact modulus values. In general, the modulii from the intact specimens were equal to or less than the in-situ modulii measured using the pressuremeter. In these practical cases, the modulii from the intact specimens did not require any reduction to provide rock mass modulus. Rather, the modulii from the intact specimens could be used directly as the rock mass modulii. This result is surprising, but not unheard of...|$|R

In uniaxial compression, cadmium undergoes adiabatic shear banding at strain rates > 10 s^- 1 and temperature up to 423 K. The intensity of this adiabatic shear banding reduces as the temperature is increased or the strain rate is reduced. This adiabatic shear banding is the only major microstructural response, in the present test region, that promotes cracking. At temperatures greater than 473 K the flow becomes homogeneous and no adiabatic shear banding is observed. The strain rates and temperatures existing during sliding are estimated using a simple non-iterative procedure and superimposed on the <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>response</b> map. At sliding speeds < 1. 0 ms^- 1 the near surface regions are likely to undergo adiabatic shear banding induced cracking. As the velocity of sliding increases the subsurface temperature increases making the regions close to the surface move towards regions of lower adiabatic shear banding intensity and finally to regions of homogeneous flow. It is seen that wear rates when the near surface <b>strain</b> <b>rate</b> <b>response</b> is expected to be adiabatic shear banding, which promotes cracking, is higher than when the near surface regions are in the homogeneous flow region.

40|$|When {{cyclically}} loaded in tension, superelastic Nickel Titanium (NiTi) undergoes a characteristic shakedown behavior which dramatically changes its hysteretic stress–strain response. As many uses of superelastic NiTi involve cyclic loading, a detailed {{understanding of the}} interaction between phase transformation and associated plasticity is necessary to predict the lifetime behavior of NiTi devices. Earlier macroscopic studies have dealt with this phenomenon on a bulk material level, but its microstructural origin and small scale analogues remain largely uninvestigated. To that end, low cycle, low strain-rate fatigue tests were performed on superelastic NiTi sheet to examine the local damage and accumulation of plastic deformation that contribute to the evolution of its <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>response.</b> Local <b>strain</b> measured in situ with Scanning Electron Microscopy Digital Image Correlation was matched with individual microstructural features – such as individual parent grains and grain neighborhoods – measured with Electron Backscatter Diffraction. Martensitic transformation associated with superelasticity was inferred from the full-field strain maps captured each load cycle. Special attention was paid to the particular martensite variants and twinning modes that nucleate in the first cycle and their similitude to subsequent martensite transformation. In addition, cyclic behavior such as martensite retention and ratcheting, strain memory of both martensite and austenite configurations, and damage accumulation are also considered...|$|R
40|$|The use of flush {{or nearly}} flush repairs for {{composite}} structures to maintain strict aerodynamic {{outer mold line}} requirements is a technology that is increasingly becoming essential to maintaining composite-dominated aircraft structures. Unfortunately, {{there are only a}} limited number of studies on scarf repairs and patches. The published studies have described both experimental and numerical/analytical evaluation of the strains and failure loads of tension and compression loaded test articles and considered optimization of repair geometry, such as scarf angle, (e. g. [1]). Present work is a part of study aimed at evaluation of the effects of a broader range of parameters and is focused on evaluation of the effects of patch composition and adhesive properties. Our goal is to establish and verify three-dimensional strength prediction framework for repair optimization. A novel Critical Failure Volume (CFV) strength prediction method [2] was applied. The strength prediction was based on the state of stress in the 0 ° plies by taking into account the redistribution of stress due to adhesive failure. The nonlinear <b>stress</b> <b>strain</b> <b>response</b> of the adhesive was characterized on separate tests performed for cured neat resin specimens and included in the analysis. Experimental setup [3] was based on utilization o...|$|R
30|$|There {{are a few}} {{limitations}} in this study. First, snowball sampling might create a biased sample, and the sample size was small (n[*]=[*] 15). Second, the study solely consisted of Chinese casino employees. Thus, {{it is not clear}} if the results would apply to non-Chinese employees working in other gaming venues. Lastly the accuracy of the interviewees’ self-reports may be questioned. Nevertheless, this exploratory study increases our understanding of Macau casino employees’ experience of work <b>stress,</b> <b>stress</b> <b>strains,</b> coping <b>responses</b> and gambling behavior. The identification of job stressors and risk factors for problem gambling is useful for designing appropriate interventions. The study results also have policy implications for employee stress prevention and responsible gambling.|$|R
40|$|The {{machinability}} of a thermoplastic {{compound that}} consisted of 52 vol % ceramic particles and 48 vol % thermoplastic binders was investigated. To investigate the machining mech-anisms, various blends of a ductile polymer (ethylene ethyl acrylate (EEA)) and a brittle polymer (isobutyl methacrylate (IBMA)) were used as thermoplastic binders. The fraction of IBMA to EEA in the blend was increased from 0 to 50 vol%. As the IBMA content was increased, the thermoplastic com-pound exhibited a stiffer <b>stress</b> versus <b>strain</b> <b>response</b> under compression because of the brittle nature of the IBMA poly-mer. The machinability of the thermoplastic compound was remarkably improved with increased IBMA content because of the mitigation of the extensive deformation of the thermo-plastic compound. I...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{finite element}} (FE) models {{naturally}} output displacement or acceleration response data. However, {{they can also}} be used to compute stress, internal forces, and <b>strain</b> <b>response.</b> When coupled with a boundary element model (BEM) of the fluid surrounding the structure, a fully coupled analysis can be performed. Modeling a diffuse acoustic field in the BEM fluid provides an excitation like that found when the structure is placed in a reverberation chamber. Fully coupling the structural FE model to the acoustic BEM model provides a means to predict not only the acceleration response of the panel to diffuse field loading, but also the ability to predict the dynamic <b>stress</b> and <b>strain</b> <b>response.</b> This type of model has been available with current predictive tools, but experimental validation of the prediction of dynamic <b>stress</b> or <b>strain</b> is difficult to find. An aluminum panel was instrumented with accelerometers and strain gages and hung in a reverberation room and subjected to a diffuse acoustic field. This paper presents the comparison of the experimental and predicted results...|$|R
40|$|Process {{optimization}} within modern manufacturing {{is generally}} supported {{through the use}} of finite element based process models. Although the measurement of data at slower rates (10 - 4 s- 1 to 1 s- 1) is well established, there exists a challenge in generating accurate data for higher strain rate (10 s- 1 to 200 s- 1) processes such as forging. Specialist equipment is required to determine the basic <b>stress</b> / <b>strain</b> <b>response</b> of materials in this range of strain rates. In the current work the capabilities of a novel servo-hydraulic forging simulator machine with capability for moderate and high deformation rates will be discussed. Furthermore, the route followed for optimizing the experimental procedure will be considered and some of the challenges highlighted...|$|R
