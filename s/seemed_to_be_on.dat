5|$|The 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Grande Prêmio do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 March 1995 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil. It was the firstround of the 1995 Formula One season. The 71-lap {{race was}} won by Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team after {{starting}} from second position. David Coulthard {{finished second in}} a Williams, with Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari. Damon Hill, who started the race from pole position, spun out while leading on lap30 with an apparent gearbox problem, which was later {{found to be a}} suspension failure. Schumacher's win came despite Benetton encountering steering problems with his car during Friday practice, leading to him crashing heavily and necessitating steering component changes {{for the rest of the}} event. Despite Schumacher's victory, Hill proved to be faster during the race, and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> course for a comfortable victory before his sudden retirement.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{from the}} laity took longer to surface. This {{resistance}} focused on two things: the King's right to demand military service, {{and his right}} to levy taxes. At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, {{in his capacity as}} Marshal of England, objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King; if the King intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony. In July, Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Constable of England, drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances, in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced. Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy. This one was particularly provocative, because the King had sought consent only from a small group of magnates, rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament. While Edward was in Winchelsea, preparing for the campaign in Flanders, Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax. As the King left the country with a greatly reduced force, the kingdom <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the verge of civil war. What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause. Edward signed the Confirmatio cartaruma confirmation of Magna Carta and its accompanying Charter of the Forestand the nobility agreed to serve with the King on a campaign in Scotland.|$|E

25|$|In {{the twelfth}} stage, Heusghem {{attacked}} Alavoine again. Alavoine punctured {{six times in}} that stage, which {{made it impossible for}} him to keep up with Heusghem. Heusghem won over 35 minutes on Alavoine, and more than 10 minutes on second-placed Lambot, which was enough to take over the lead. Heusghem was at that point the strongest rider in the race, and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the way to the overall victory in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The National Awami Party <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> its way {{to victory}} in the 1959 elections, when the {{civilian}} President Iskandar Mirza was ousted in a coup by the military, under Commander-in-Chief Ayub Khan. One of Ayub Khan's first decisions after he came to power was to outlaw political activity and imprison politicians.

Lenglen withdrew from the tournament, which would be her last appearance at the courts of Wimbledon.|$|E
25|$|Bodine's racing career <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> track {{right from}} the start as his father and grandfather, Eli Bodine Jr. and Sr. built Chemung Speedrome just a year after he was born. He began {{learning}} his racing skills at this track in the micro-midget division when he was only five years old. He had such an itch to race that he disguised himself as a lady and entered a Powderpuff Division Race when he was 15. In 2011, he drove for Tommy Baldwin Racing in the Sprint Cup Series, alternating between the Nos. 35 and 36 teams, with sponsorship from Luke & Associates.|$|E
25|$|In 1144 Zengi conquered Edessa, a crusader stronghold, {{which led}} to a new crusade from Europe in 1148. In the {{meantime}} Zengi was assassinated and his territory was divided among his sons, one of whom, Nur ad-Din, emir of Aleppo, made an alliance with Damascus. When the European crusaders arrived, they and the nobles of Jerusalem agreed to attack Damascus. Their siege, however, was a complete failure. When the city <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the verge of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls, and were driven back. By 1154, Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din's control.|$|E

25|$|Success <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> {{the horizon}} for Odom and Dogpatch USA, but the many {{unforeseen}} events of the 1970s cast a dark shadow on Odom's dreams. Attendance figures throughout that decade were woefully short of expectations. In 1973, interest rates began to skyrocket, and a nationwide energy crisis kept many tourists home. In a bout of cancellations nicknamed the Rural purge, American television networks eliminated many shows with country themes, and the popularity of hillbillies waned. The Li'l Abner restaurant chain was never built. The proposed Li'l Abner TV series was never made; a pilot was produced and premiered as a television special on ABC-TV, but it received poor reviews and no network purchased the series.|$|E
25|$|Despite further rumours that {{he would}} resign, Beatty {{remained}} in office when the Conservatives took power {{in the autumn of}} 1924. Supported by the First Lord of the Admiralty William Bridgeman, he clashed with the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, once again over the number of cruisers required by the Royal Navy. At this stage of his career Churchill was opposed to what he saw as excessive defence spending. This may seem odd in light of his previous and subsequent reputation, but in the 1920s no major war <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the horizon. Beatty also at this time pressed hard for the return of responsibility for naval aviation from the newly formed Royal Air Force to the Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|In the Dayton Regional, Connecticut prevailed easily. They {{held their}} first three opponents to under 40 points each. While Florida State, in the {{regional}} final, managed to 50, the Huskies scored 90. This set up a game against Baylor in a semifinal game. The Baylor Bears would not go so easily. The Huskies <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the same track as prior games, with a 13-point lead at halftime. Kalana Greene scored the first basket of the second half, extending the lead to 15 points. However, Baylor then scored the next twelve points, cutting the lead to three. Connecticut, which had missed eight consecutive shots, began hitting again, and their defense held Baylor without a field goal for over seven minutes. UConn scored 16 points during the stretch and rebuild the lead. UConn {{would go on to}} win the game 70–50, to reach the championship game.|$|E

25|$|The leftmost attack column {{crossed the}} Ill {{downstream}} at the hamlet of Noffles {{early in the}} morning. It was supposed to veer {{to the right and}} get behind Jellacic's defenses, but it was repulsed. The left-center column assaulted the Blasenberg height but it too was defeated. A third column {{to the left of the}} main road attacked the Saint Michael's Wood but met the same fate as the other columns. Masséna sent 12 battalions charging up the main road while a small force tried a right hook around the flank of the entrenchments. The flanking force made headway before being stalled. Jellacic made economical use of his outnumbered force. Masséna's main assault in front failed and was sent on its way by a final counterattack by Jellacic's men. In the early going the French troops captured about 500 prisoners and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the verge of victory, but the heavy defensive fire and rocks thrown at them finally turned them back.|$|E
25|$|Later that night, DDP and Rhyno faced Kane and the Undertaker. During the match, {{there was}} {{interference}} from the Alliance.

Backstage, many WWF and Alliance wrestlers were fighting each other, and the WWF <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the losing end of things. A truck was seen driving up to the arena, however, and Austin came out with his cue stick and proceeded to beat down any WCW and ECW wrestlers in his path. He then came to the ring, trash-talking on the way down, and beat down the Alliance wrestlers, giving Stunners {{to most of the}} men in the ring. The WWF wrestlers had cleaned house and were standing tall. The WWF seemed to be in good shape for the upcoming pay-per-view with Austin's return.|$|E

After a dismal 4–18 start, the Braves <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> pace for a last place finish. On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the Brooklyn Dodgers. The consecutive losses put their record at 26–40 and the Braves were in last place, 15 games behind the league-leading New York Giants, who had won the previous three league pennants. After a day off, the Braves started to {{put together}} a hot streak, and from July 6 through September 5, the Braves went 41–12. On September 7 and 8, the Braves took two of three games from the New York Giants and moved into first place. The Braves tore through September and early October, closing with 25 wins against six losses, while the Giants went 16–16. They were the only team, under the old eight-team league format, to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.|$|E

25|$|After {{meeting in}} Acre in June, the crusading kings Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany agreed with Melisende, Baldwin III {{and the major}} nobles of the kingdom to attack Damascus. Zengi's {{territory}} had been divided amongst his sons after his death, and Damascus no longer felt threatened, so an alliance had been made with Zengi's son Nur ad-Din, the emir of Aleppo. Perhaps remembering attacks launched on Jerusalem from Damascus in previous decades, Damascus {{seemed to be the}} best target for the crusade, rather than Aleppo or another city to the north which would have allowed for the recapture of Edessa. The subsequent Siege of Damascus was a complete failure; when the city <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the verge of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls, and were driven back. The crusaders retreated within three days. There were rumours of treachery and bribery, and Conrad III felt betrayed by the nobility of Jerusalem. Whatever the reason for the failure, the French and German armies returned home, and a few years later Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din's control.|$|E

With a required rate of over 5 runs per over, an Australian win was almost certainly out of the question. The openers Hayden and Slater again began well as Australia reached 166/3 in 45 overs. With only 30 overs remaining {{in the day and}} Steve Waugh looking solid, a draw <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the cards. But Harbhajan Singh dismissed Waugh and Ponting in quick succession to trigger a dramatic Australian capitulation. Tendulkar then removed Gilchrist for a first ball duck, completing Gilchrist's first and only king pair. It was only his 16th game, and he had won all the 15 previous games. In his next two overs, Tendulkar dismissed Hayden and trapped Warne lbw with a perfectly pitched googly. Harbhajan then took the final two wickets to take his match tally to 13 wickets and complete a sensational 171 run Indian victory.

Barrichello took the chequered flag to win his first grand prix since the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix in , and record the 100th win by a Brazilian driver in Formula One (including the victories of Emerson Fittipaldi, José Carlos Pace, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna, Felipe Massa and Barrichello). Hamilton came second, while Finn Räikkönen came home in third. Kovalainen came fourth, while Nico Rosberg had a reasonably quiet race as he came home in fifth. Fernando Alonso came sixth in his home race, championship leader Jenson Button came seventh, while Robert Kubica came eighth, only his second points scoring finish so far this season. Neither Red Bull's Vettel or Webber scored a point, while Barrichello moved into second place in the drivers championship. Button kept his lead although he only added two points to his tally. Brawn edged further ahead in the constructors' championship by scoring 12 points with Red Bull not scoring a single point this weekend.|$|E
