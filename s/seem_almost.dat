25|$|In the Hollywood clubs, a {{new breed}} of {{performers}} laid down a baffling hip array of new sounds…Most important of all these, though, was Frankie Laine, a big lad with 'steel tonsils' who belted out torch blues while stomping his size twelve foot in joints like Billy Berg's, Club Hangover and the Bandbox…Laine's intense vocal style owed nothing to Crosby, Sinatra, or Dick Haymes. Instead he drew from Billy Eckstine, Big Joe Turner, Jimmy Rushing, and with it Laine had sown the seeds from which an entire new perception and audience would grow…Frank Sinatra represented perhaps the highest flowering of a quarter century tradition of crooning but suddenly found himself an anachronism. First Frankie Laine, then Tony Bennett, and now Johnnie (Ray), dubbed 'the Belters' and 'the Exciters,' came along with a brash vibrancy and vulgar beat that made the old bandstand routine which Frank meticulously perfected <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> invalid.|$|E
25|$|Monks, as a rule, were laymen, nor at {{the outset}} was the abbot any exception. For the {{reception}} of the sacraments, and for other religious offices, the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church. This rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or {{at a distance from}} a city, and necessity compelled the ordination of some monks. This innovation was not introduced without a struggle, ecclesiastical dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher spiritual life, but, before the close of the 5th century, at least in the East, abbots <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> universally to have become deacons, if not priests. The change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the 7th century. The ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils. Thus at the first Council of Constantinople, AD 448, 23 archimandrites or abbots sign, with 30 bishops.|$|E
500|$|The colours, {{which now}} appear so fresh and spring-like with pale pink, apple green, vivid yellow and sky blue against a {{background}} of warm pearly grey, were so discoloured by candle smoke as to make the pictures <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> monochrome. The restoration has removed the filter of grime to reveal the colours again. However, the restoration was met with both praise and criticism. Critics assert that much original work [...] by Michelangelo – in particular pentimenti, highlights and shadows, and other detailing painted a secco – was lost in the removal of various accretions.|$|E

[...] Of the writers in Salinger's generation, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist John Updike attested that [...] "the short stories of J. D. Salinger really opened my eyes as to how you can weave fiction out {{of a set of}} events that <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> unconnected, or very lightly connected... stick in my mind as really having moved me a step up, as it were, toward knowing how to handle my own material." [...] The critic Louis Menand has observed that the early stories of Pulitzer Prize-winner Philip Roth were affected by [...] "Salinger's voice and comic timing".|$|E
500|$|Most controversially, {{the film}} {{resolves}} with {{the suicide of}} one of the main characters (contrary to the spirit if not the letter of the Production Code). Film historian Steve Haberman, in his audio commentary for the 2005 Warner Bros. DVD release of the film, characterized Jacqueline as the film's philosophical center, noting her existentialist views: [...] "Her life is the very nightmare version of life that Val Lewton portrays in many of his movies: a meaningless existence, trying to find meaning, always failing and in the end seeking a sort of peace through death." [...] Film scholar J.P. Telotte echoed this sentiment, stating: [...] "The Seventh Victim explores certain ineffable fears that always haunt the human psyche, especially a fear of meaninglessness or the irrational which can make death <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> a welcome release from life." ...|$|E
500|$|... 1. 'Relative Size: According to Goffman, {{relative}} size can {{be defined}} as “one way in which social weight–power, authority, rank, office, renown- is echoed expressively in social situations through relative size, especially height”. With relative size, women are generally shown smaller or lower than men in terms of girth and height. Although men tend to be biologically taller or larger than females, Goffman suggests that this size difference is manipulated in man-made advertisements to convey difference in status or power in certain social situations. The concept that relative size conveys social status remains relevant even when women are portrayed as the taller or larger individual on screen or in print. Goffman states that on the few occasions when women are pictured taller than men, the men <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> always to be subordinated in social class status and/or depicted as inferior.|$|E

500|$|Boyd {{said he was}} {{partially}} inspired by the generation of English writers who matured between the wars: [...] "I am fascinated by the life and work of that generation of English writers who were born {{at the beginning of}} the century and reached maturity by the time of World War II. People like Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene and Anthony Powell, obviously, but also less well known writers—Henry Green, Lawrence Durrell, Cyril Connolly and William Gerhardie. The last two in particular lurk closely behind Logan." [...] Both real and imagined characters are blended [...] into this context, where historical personages are typically used to concentrate the historical significance of a novel's plot, Mountstuart's encounters with them are superficial, leaving only an impression of both parties' small-mindedness. John Mullan found the conceit most effective during the New York journal, where Boyd satirises figures in the Abstract Expressionist movement during the 1950s [...] "whose characters <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> beyond invention." ...|$|E
500|$|Spins Joe Levy {{named the}} song the only [...] "great" [...] dance record on Like a Prayer, and also {{observed}} that [...] "Keep It Together" [...] was a [...] "girly-disco" [...] song that drew influences from Sister Sledge's [...] "We Are Family" [...] and Madonna's own [...] "Into the Groove". Stephen Holden from The New York Times {{believed that the}} song brought the pop-funk style and hippie happiness of Sly and the Family Stone. Journalist J. D. Considine, while reviewing Like a Prayer for Rolling Stone, felt that [...] "Keep It Together" [...] portrayed [...] "an impressive invocation {{of the importance of}} family". Considine was concerned that since the confessional nature of the songs on Like a Prayer evoked strong emotions from the listener, [...] "Keep It Together" [...] would probably <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> trivial by comparison to them. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic believed that the song constituted of deep funk music. Louis Virtel of The Backlot gave the song a positive review, calling it a [...] "rollicking family reunion" [...] that is the [...] "sunny side of “Oh Father’s” grim familial reckoning." [...] Kenneth Partridge from Billboard described the song as a mid-tempo synth-funk tune with a [...] "tense" [...] groove, on which Madonna offers an olive branch to her estranged father and siblings.|$|E
500|$|Boyd has {{previously}} {{written about the}} 20th century through two characters: The New Confessions was a fictional memoir, and Nat Tate a spoof biography. In Any Human Heart, Boyd uses the journal form as a fresh angle to pursue the subject from: [...] "I wanted to invent my own exemplary figure who could <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> as real as the real ones and whose life followed a similar pattern: boarding school, university, Paris in the 20s, the rise of Fascism, war, post-war neglect, disillusion, increasing decrepitude, and so on—a long, varied and rackety life that covered most of the century." [...] Boyd sets Mountstuart's life within its context, tracing the grand arc of events during the 20th century by depiciting Mountstuart as swept along {{in the flow of}} history - he serves in World War II, sees the cultural revolution in the 1950s and 60s, and takes advantage of modern transport in his extensive travels around the world. Rather than being re-told in hindsight, their importance in context, historical events are seen through the petty lens of every-day living. For example, in an entry from the 1920s, Mountstuart notes [...] "Coffee with Land Fothergill at the Cadena. She was wearing a velvet coat that matched her eyes. We talked a little stiffly about Mussolini and Italy and I was embarrassed to note how much better informed she was than I." ...|$|E

500|$|Walter Evert, {{discussing}} {{the debate in}} 1965, justified the final lines of the poem to declare [...] "The poem, then, accepts the urn for the immediate meditative imaginative pleasure that it can give, but it firmly defines the limits of artistic truth. In this it is wholly consistent with all the great poetry of Keats's last creative period." [...] Hugh Kenner, in 1971, explained that Keats [...] "interrogates an urn, and answers for it, and its last answer, about Beauty and Truth, may <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> intolerably enigmatic". To Kenner, the problem with Keats's Beauty and Truth statement arises out of the reader's inability {{to distinguish between the}} poet, his reflections on the urn, and any possible statement made by the urn. He concluded that Keats fails to provide his narrator with enough characterization to be able to speak for the urn. Charles Rzepka, in 1986, offered his view on the matter: [...] "The truth-beauty equation {{at the end of the}} 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' offers solace but is finally no more convincing than the experience it describes is durable." [...] Rick Rylance picked up the debate again in 1990 and explained that the true meaning of the final lines cannot be discerned merely by studying the language. This posed a problem for the New Critics, who were prone to closely reading a poem's text.|$|E

Guy Blackman of The Sunday Age wrote: [...] "The distorted vocals and stilted production of first single 'Sexyback' make Timberlake's claim to be 'bringing sexy back'... <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> laughable."

You'd think it takes massive balls to do something like that, but given the shrill, squeaking vocals cheeping through his ghastly little gobhole, it's safe to assume he's got testes the size of capers. He's practically a human dog whistle, the shrieking, high-pitched, mosquito-lunged ponce." ...|$|E
500|$|Mother Gothel has {{garnered}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} film critics. Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times {{felt that the}} character was given the film's [...] "best lines and tunes". Film4 described Gothel as a [...] "fun" [...] character [...] "to the extent that she risks making the good guys seem a bit dull." [...] Hailing Gothel as the film's [...] "pièce de résistance", Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies wrote that Gothel [...] "performs ...

IGN's Jim Vejvoda penned, [...] "Mother Gothel nearly steals the show, with her overprotective tyranny being made to <b>seem</b> <b>almost</b> rational". Dubbed Disney's [...] "first passive-aggressive villain" [...] by Helen O'Hara of Empire, the author reviewed, [...] "the fact that [...] is entirely bereft of superpowers and reliant on her considerable wits to keep her going makes her strangely admirable". Writing for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Cathy Jakicic called the character [...] "a great contemporary villain" [...] who [...] "many daughters (and mothers) will find ... funny and a little too familiar". In The New York Times A. O. Scott's opinion, [...] "The Disney pantheon is full of evil stepmothers, though none quite match Mother Gothel for sheer sadistic intensity." [...] According to Jake Coyle of the Southtown Star, Gothel is [...] "one of Disney's best" [...] villains, while Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News dubbed the character [...] "one reason to love Disney". Michael Smith of the Tulsa World reviewed Gothel as [...] "perfectly wicked as she kills Rapunzel's dreams". Kirk Baird of The Blade identified Gothel as the film's [...] "strongest character". Colin Covert of the Star Tribune commented, [...] "In her own way, Gothel is scarier than Snow White's wicked stepmother" [...] because the character [...] "doesn't cast spells; she's fully capable of manipulating, guilt-tripping and emotionally undermining the girl". Several comparisons have been made between Gothel and the Evil Queen in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), while several critics observed the character's likeness to singer Cher; Peter Howell of the Toronto Star joked that Gothel is [...] "suspiciously Cher-like in her quest for eternal youth".|$|E

2500|$|Bruce Eder of AllMusic {{praises the}} box set for [...] "present a {{surprisingly}} rich and diverse overview of Shankar's career". Eder continues: Each disc is different enough from what came before {{so that the}} listener is constantly surprised by new discoveries, and the last disc, {{with the addition of}} the voices, is the most delightful of all, spotlighting Shankar the composer and leader as well as Shankar the instrumentalist, and offering a rich, bracing body of music that stands apart from most listeners' associations with his work from the 1960s and early 1970s.
