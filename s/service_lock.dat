In contrast to generic computing systems, these dedicated systems have very specific run-time support requirements, which are not properly fulfilled by general-purpose operating systems. The impossibility to anticipate which applications will be executed results in generic operating systems being forced to provide an extensive set of services targeted at making all resources available to all applications. The standardization of such generic system <b>services</b> <b>locked</b> general-purpose operating system inside a hard shell that prevents innovations from reaching applications.

40|$|International audienceQuality-of-service and SLA {{guarantees}} {{are among}} the major challenges of cloud-based services. In this paper we first present a new cloud model called SLAaaS — SLA aware Service. SLAaaS considers QoS levels and SLA as first class citizens of cloud-based services. This model is orthogonal to other SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS cloud models, and may apply to any of them. More specifically we make three contributions: (i) we provide a novel domain specific language that allows to describe QoS-oriented SLA associated with cloud services; (ii) we present a general control-theoretic approach for managing cloud service SLA; (iii) we apply the proposed language and control approach to guarantee SLA in various case studies, ranging from cloud-based MapReduce <b>service,</b> to <b>locking</b> <b>service,</b> and higher-level e-commerce service; these case studies successfully illustrate SLA management with different QoS aspects of cloud services such as performance, dependability, financial energetic costs...|$|R
