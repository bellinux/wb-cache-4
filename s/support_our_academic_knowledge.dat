Scheingold’s and Sarat’s law and society scholarship contributes to our knowledge of lawyering, the law, work with clients and social movements, and the interplay between what Ewick and Silbey have called 2 ̆ 2 legality 2 ̆ 2 and the social world. Their cross-disciplinary work makes {{a significant contribution to}} the social sciences {{as well as to the}} field of legal studies. This review examines the utility of cause lawyering as a concept that contributes to <b>our</b> <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> base as well as to the 2 ̆ 2 actual 2 ̆ 2 work of lawyering. Scheingold and Sarat push the boundaries of the legal-centric framework of the scholarship on lawyers in their examination of the relationship between cause lawyering and the legal democratic state.

40|$|In {{the words}} of Justin Lewis (1991), any screen {{production}} power lies in its encounter with the audience. One cannot exist without the other. As he immediately proceeds to acknowledge, however this idea is "often difficult to grasp empirically" (p. 61) {{and the issue of}} how the idea works in practice remain full of methodological confusion and perplexity. This article reviews the contemporary shift and the importance of understanding of audience preferences, perspectives, behaviours, and routines towards the production of films, movies, and television production in Malaysia. It proceeds to examine the comparatively underdeveloped state of Malaysian research about screen production audience, and the variety of incentives to develop such research. The distance between academic and industry research in Malaysia is discussed, and the possible explanations of gap in <b>our</b> <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Malaysian screen and film audiences are ofered. Finally, the article considers possible means to approach the meaningful study of the media reception process within Malaysian audiences or viewers. The audience profile is considered as a key factor for programming of screen production. Understanding audience and their preferences could sustain continuous programming and development of new production. This article advocated the need for the profssionals in the industry to incalculate such understanding and call for more qualitative research into audience analysis for sustainable development of the industry in this country...|$|R
40|$|Higher education’s {{scholars}} utilize online {{catalogs and}} library finding aids with ease. However, {{for the larger}} community, accessing scholars’ Selected Works and online galleries with topical themes is a helpful intermediary step. Non-scholars often explore and produce scholarship, seek out obscure online sources and gladly volunteer to document cultural resources. Every day historically valuable ephemera is thrown away due to an ignorance of its value to research. Special Collections Librarians partnering with Scholarly Communication Specialists utilize social media to create a gateway and make certain that taxpaying interested parties do not miss the wealth of primary sources compiled over centuries by librarians and archivists. We hope this ease of access to information will encourage casual researchers to <b>support</b> <b>our</b> <b>academic</b> efforts. It may also result in donations of unique letters, photographs, diaries, ephemera and inaccessible publications. The Special Collections galleries allow exhibits of unique photographs, ephemera, oral histories and manuscripts. Scholars create personal selected works sites to showcase individual research projects and collections. University faculty, teachers, adults, and amateur historians can use these accessible resources to gather information and create items to motivate, entertain or educate others.

Yet, amidst the plethora of research on probation practice, much of it officially sponsored, the life experiences and motivations of practitioners seem on occasion to be virtually invisible.

We were able to forge a great relationship with the Communication Studies Director– the libraries’ liaison and the Communication Studies Director authored a textbook chapter together about the library for all COM 101 classes. Last but not least, collaboration in an open communicative environment took the fear out of assessment: everyone understood we were assessing the PROCESS not the person, for the success of our students; the focus was learning outcomes and <b>supporting</b> <b>our</b> students for <b>academic</b> success and lifelong learning...|$|R

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper (Webb, 1999) I argued that recent trends in English legal education, {{specifically}} the moves towards mass provision {{of a more}} flexible, performative and outcome-driven curriculum - have been consistent with a shift towards a strongly post-Fordist reconstruction of liberal educationalism. In this paper I intend to develop that argument {{in the context of}} European Union policy on higher education, culminating (thus far) in the Bologna Declaration of 1999. Since the early 1990 s the EU's version of 'a learning society' has evolved into a post-Fordist, market vision for higher education. This paper will focus particularly on the study of EU policy and its implementation as an examplar {{of the ways in which}} (legal) higher education is becoming globalized. Globalization is, of course, a core element of post-Fordist political economy. However, I suggest we should not restrict our attention purely to political economy's concern with the internationalisation (or Americanisation) of education markets. The notion of the 'learning society' suggests a reconfiguring of both the structural forms of social organisation which make up the milieu of legal education, and <b>our</b> conception of <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> itself. This process I will characterise, following Nederveen Pieterse (1995), as one of "structural hybridization". The paper will conclude by reflecting on some of the threats and opportunities such hybridization seems to offer. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary of Main Findings ‘The Pedagogic Quality and Inequality in University First Degrees Project’ was a {{longitudinal}} investigation of sociology and related social science degree courses in four universities. Its main objectives were to investigate what social science students value about their university education {{and differences in}} curriculum and teaching in different universities. The main findings are summarised below and relate to defining, improving and measuring the quality of undergraduate courses. Defining good quality undergraduate courses • High quality undergraduate courses are those in which students engage with <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> in transformative ways. Courses in different disciplines {{are likely to be}} transformative in different ways. • In sociology-related social sciences, academic engagement is transformative in three ways: students gain access to an understanding of <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> that is interesting and relevant to their lives; it changes the way that they understand themselves and their place in the world; and they gain an enhanced understanding of society. Such outcomes emphasise the importance of maintaining sociology-related social science courses across the sector. • Good teaching is vital if students are to engage with <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> in transformative ways. Improving the quality of undergraduate courses • Improving teaching is central to improving the quality of undergraduate courses. • Good teaching is multidimensional and improving it is timeconsuming and challenging. • A focus on quality enhancement that supports lecturers is in danger of being obscured by the emphasis in recent policy documents on improving quality through competition. Measuring the quality of undergraduate courses • Key measures of the quality of undergraduate courses are students’ engagement with <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and good teaching. • When quality is measured by engagement with <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge,</b> the ranking of the universities in the study is very different from that in national higher education league tables. • Without engaging meaningfully in <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge,</b> students are unlikely to gain much benefit from studying an undergraduate degree. So in order to be valid measures of the quality of undergraduate courses, national higher education league tables, Key Information Sets and the National Student Survey need to take account of students’ engagement with <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge...</b>|$|R

40|$|Historically, teacher {{assigned}} grades {{have been}} seen as unreliable subjective measures of <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge,</b> since grades and standardized tests have traditionally correlated at about the 0. 5 to 0. 6 level, and thus explain about 25 - 35 % of each other.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that, in the {{conventional}} bilevel programming problem, the coefficients in both objective functions and constraints are deterministic or crisp. However, in practice, we may be faced with some situations where the coefficients in the problem are uncertain. To tackle these uncertain coefficients, stochastic and fuzzy approaches are commonly used, and accordingly stochastic and fuzzy bilevel programming problems are proposed. In stochastic bilevel programming problems [19], the coefficients are viewed as random variables with known probability distributions; whereas in fuzzy bilevel programming problems [20, 21], the coefficients are regarded as fuzzy sets with known membership functions. It is worth mentioning that the probability distributions and the membership functions are of great importance to formulate and solve these two classes of problems. However, it is a complicated task for decision makers to choose appropriate probability distributions or membership functions {{in the case of}} stochastic or fuzzy uncertainties. To efficiently cope with the uncertainties, there emerges the interval programming, which becomes a prominent tool for tackling decision problems with uncertain parameters and it only requires to calculate the bounds of the uncertain coefficients. On this basis, the interval bilevel programming problem, whose coefficients of both objective functions or constraints are interval numbers, begins to attract more and more researchers, but to the best of <b>our</b> <b>knowledge,</b> <b>academic</b> papers about this kind of problem are still few.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the multi-faceted phenomenon of knowledge conceptions. The aim is to describe the meaning of “academic knowledge” in today’s knowledge society {{from the perspective of}} “education” (a term used here in relation to the ‘liberal arts’ tradition as used in the English language or in German ‘bildung’) and “commodisation”. These two perspectives create a field of tensions in higher education. The study analyses the flow of knowledge in the process of commodisation - partly through a network of relations between societally-relevant actors, partly through career geography. The actors studied are: the state, the university, the university departments and the graduates/students. The research ‘design is a descriptive case study of Karlstad University during the years 1997 - 2007. The theoretical approach combines two perspectives; commodisation of <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and career geography. Commodisation is studied by the developments in higher education seen from a wider national and international perspective. Career geography entails both a geographical mobility and a social mobility of the students. The results show that there are different conceptions about <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> from the different actors. Two different perspectives of commodisation of <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> have been found, one from the “top down” perspective and one from the “bottom up” perspective. The top down perspective means that commodisation is driven mostly by the state and then is followed by the university and the university departments. In the bottom up perspective, commodisation is driven by the students. Furthermore, the results from the study of the Swedish state reveal an increasingly clear commodisation of <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> with emphasis on economic growth, regional development and international competition.  However, Karlstad University’s and the university departments’ view of knowledge differs somewhat from that of the state’s, and aims instead to combine ‘commodisation of knowledge’ with ‘knowledge as education’ in its efforts to be a ‘learning university’. It is also shown that students appreciate this combined view. On a general level, the main argument from this dissertation is {{that it is necessary to}} place more attention on how to obtain a balance between the commodisation of <b>academic</b> <b>knowledge</b> and knowledge as “education” in today’s higher education system...|$|R
