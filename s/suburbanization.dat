5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote <b>suburbanization</b> by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{manufactured}} 3.4 {{percent of}} total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking tenth among the 48 states. In Eastern Massachusetts, following World War II, the economy was transformed from one based on heavy industry into a service-based economy. Government contracts, private investment, and research facilities led to a new and improved industrial climate, with reduced unemployment and increased per capita income. <b>Suburbanization</b> flourished, and by the 1970s, the Route 128 corridor was dotted with high-technology companies who recruited graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education.|$|E
5|$|Arlington was {{established}} in the 1880s by settlers and the area was platted as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Arlington area became home to projects under the direction of federal relief agencies, including a municipal airport that would serve as a naval air station during World War II. Beginning in the 1980s, Arlington experienced the effects of <b>suburbanization,</b> growing by over 450 percent by 2000 and annexing the unincorporated area of Smokey Point to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged <b>suburbanization,</b> which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E
5|$|The city's skyline {{changed in}} the 1960s and 1970s with the {{construction}} of office towers around the Empire State Plaza and at the uptown campus of SUNY Albany, mainly under the direction of Governor Nelson Rockefeller. While Albany experienced a decline in its population due to urban sprawl and <b>suburbanization,</b> many of its historic neighborhoods were saved from destruction through the policies of Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd, the longest-serving mayor of any city in the United States. In the early 21st century, Albany has experienced growth in the high-technology industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector.|$|E
5|$|With city jobs {{moved to}} the towns and villages around Utica during the <b>suburbanization</b> of the postwar period. This led to the {{expansion}} of the nearby Town of New Hartford and the village of Whitesboro. Utica's lack of quality academic and educational choices, when compared to Syracuse under an hour away, contributed to its decline in local businesses and jobs as some economic activity moved to Syracuse during the 1990s. Utica's population fell while population in the county increased, reflecting a statewide trend of decreasing urban populations outside New York City. Residents who remain in the city struggle to handle poverty issues stemming from social and economic conditions caused partially by a smaller tax base; this adversely affects schools and public services.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{federal highway}} {{subsidies}} and postwar development encouraged outward migration as residents moved to gain newer housing; this <b>suburbanization</b> significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made {{efforts to create}} new attractions, such as the Gateway Arch, which construction became a focus {{of the civil rights}} movement to gain non-segregated jobs in the skilled trades. The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace substandard housing by new public housing projects such as PruittIgoe. A combination of factors resulted in this being notoriously unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and gentrification have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly downtown. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle with crime and perceptions of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the 2010 U.S. Census.|$|E
5|$|The Spokane {{metropolitan}} area consists of Spokane County. As of the 2013 census estimates, the Spokane {{metropolitan area}} had {{a population of}} 535,724. Directly east of Spokane County is the Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Kootenai County, Idaho, anchored {{by the city of}} Coeur d'Alene. The urban areas of the two MSAs largely follow the path of Interstate 90 between Spokane and Coeur d'Alene. The Spokane area has suffered from <b>suburbanization</b> and urban sprawl in past decades, despite Washington's use of urban growth boundaries; the city ranks low among major Northwest cities in population density and smart growth. The Spokane and Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) are now included in a single Combined Statistical Area (CSA) by the Office of Management and Budget. The Spokane–Coeur d'Alene CSA had around 698,170residents in 2015.|$|E
25|$|In the post-World War II period, Milford—like many Connecticut towns—underwent {{significant}} <b>suburbanization.</b> Interstate 95 was {{routed through}} town, and the Milford section {{was completed in}} 1958.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} years, {{government}} contracts, private investment, and research facilities {{helped to create}} a modern industry, which reduced unemployment and increased per capita income. All of these economic changes encouraged <b>suburbanization</b> {{and the formation of}} a new generation of well-assimilated and educated middle-class workers. At the same time, <b>suburbanization</b> and urban decay highlighted differences between various social groups, leading to a renewal of racial tension. Boston, a paragon of the problems in Massachusetts cities, experienced numerous challenges that led to racial problems. The problems facing urban centers included declining population, middle-class flight, departure of industry, high unemployment, rising taxes, low property values, and competition among ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{years after}} World War II were {{a time of}} rapid <b>suburbanization</b> as new housing was built outside the city limits. This {{resulted}} in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities, which the county found difficult to provide. At the same time, <b>suburbanization</b> led to a declining tax base in the city, although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services supported only by city taxpayers. After years of discussion, a referendum was held in 1958 {{on the issue of}} consolidating city and county government. It failed to gain approval although it was supported by elected leaders of both jurisdictions: County Judge Beverly Briley of Davidson and Mayor Ben West of Nashville.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{restructuring}} and <b>suburbanization</b> caused {{the loss of}} many jobs and affluent residents, leaving Bridgeport struggling with problems of poverty and crime. In the 21st century, conversion of office and factory buildings to residential use, and other redevelopment is attracting new residents.|$|E
25|$|A greater {{percentage}} of whites and lesser percentage of citizens of other ethnic groups than in urban areas. However, Black <b>suburbanization</b> grew between 1970 and 1980 by 2.6% {{as a result of}} central city neighborhoods expanding into older neighborhoods vacated by whites.|$|E
25|$|St. Louis, {{like many}} Midwestern cities, {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 20th century due to industrialization, which provided jobs to new generations of immigrants and migrants from the South. It reached its peak population of 856,796 at the 1950 census. <b>Suburbanization</b> from the 1950s through the 1990s dramatically reduced the city's population, as did restructuring of industry and loss of jobs. The effects of <b>suburbanization</b> were exacerbated by the relatively small geographical size of St. Louis due to its earlier decision to become an independent city, and it {{lost much of its}} tax base. During the 19th and 20th century, most major cities aggressively annexed surrounding areas as residential development occurred away from the central city; however, St. Louis was unable to do so.|$|E
25|$|Post-World War II <b>suburbanization,</b> {{encouraged}} by federal subsidies for highways, drew more established white residents {{out of the}} city. In {{the latter part of}} the 20th century, restructuring of industry and railroads resulted in a massive loss of industrial jobs in Baltimore. These changes produced problems of depopulation, unemployment and poverty.|$|E
25|$|The Pine Barrens is at {{risk from}} {{increasing}} development and <b>suburbanization</b> in the area. A threatened species of frog, the Pine Barrens tree frog, has a disjunct population there. American black bears are finding their {{way back into the}} Pine Barrens after a history of hunting and trapping had driven them out.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildup of}} defense {{industries}} for World War II turned around the state's economy from the Great Depression, {{as hundreds of}} thousands worked to defeat the Axis powers. Following the war, the state experienced significant <b>suburbanization</b> around all the major cities, and most central cities shrank. The Thruway system opened in 1956, signalling another era of transportation advances.|$|E
25|$|In later years, Westlakes Terrace, {{like other}} low-income housing projects, yielded mixed results. The {{provision}} of cheap housing {{proved to be}} inadequate compensation {{for the loss of}} thousands of urban jobs, the decline of public transportation, the advent of <b>suburbanization,</b> {{and a host of other}} trends that adversely affected urban dwellers. Westlakes Terrace was recently converted to other purposes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{writers and}} {{academics}} have {{written on the}} subject of the increasing <b>suburbanization</b> of the U.S. For instance, some social scientists point out the role played by racism. During World War I, the massive migration of African Americans from the South resulted in an even greater residential shift toward suburban areas. The cities became seen as dangerous, crime-infested areas, while the suburbs were seen as safe places to live and raise a family, leading to a social trend known in some parts of the world as white flight. This phenomenon runs counter to much of the rest of the world, where slums mostly exist outside the city, rather than within them. With the increasing population of the older, more established suburban areas, many of the problems which were once seen as purely urban ones have manifested themselves there as well. These social scientists suggest that the historical processes of <b>suburbanization</b> and decentralization are instances of white privilege that have contributed to contemporary patterns of environmental racism.|$|E
25|$|Like most former {{industrial}} {{cities of}} the Great Lakes region in the United States, Buffalo is recovering from an economic depression from <b>suburbanization</b> {{and the loss of}} its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States, and its population has been spreading out to the suburbs every census since then.|$|E
25|$|To {{combat the}} {{dispersal}} of <b>suburbanization,</b> Fayetteville {{has worked to}} redevelop its downtown through various revitalization projects; it has attracted large commercial and defense companies such as Purolator, General Dynamics and Wal-Mart Stores and Distribution Center. Development of the Airborne & Special Operations Museum, Fayetteville Area Transportation Museum, Fayetteville Linear Park, and Fayetteville Festival Park, which opened in late 2006, have added regional attractions to the center.|$|E
25|$|The {{demographic}} {{transformation of}} the county following World War II, however, forced a change. The rapid <b>suburbanization</b> of those years brought with it a dramatic rise in traffic and crime that threatened to overwhelm the 33 separate law enforcement agencies then operating within Suffolk County. Voices demanding a unified county police force, {{similar to the one}} already operating in neighboring Nassau County, grew louder.|$|E
25|$|The theaters {{successfully}} {{showed a}} variety of serious theater, vaudeville shows, and movies for more than forty years. However, during the years following World War II, <b>suburbanization</b> {{and the rise of}} television led to the decline of the theaters. Fire broke out in the Ohio in 1964, and the other Playhouse Square theaters were struck by vandalism. Between May 1968 and July 1969, all the theaters closed except the Hanna.|$|E
25|$|Eight whiskey distilleries opened nearby {{after the}} end of Prohibition. When Louisville began an attempt to annex and tax them during the Great Depression, they talked the {{residents}} of Shively into incorporating separately (finalized May 23, 1938) and annexing their district instead. Their $20-million revenue stream left the small city well funded, despite its becoming the state's fastest-growing city during the 1950s as white flight and <b>suburbanization</b> reached Louisville.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1980s, the city shifted its {{economic}} base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine and biotechnology. Although Huntington successfully shifted the focus of its economy and remains a viable city, the population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 86,353 people {{lived in the city}} proper in 1950, a combination of <b>suburbanization</b> and economic turbulence caused a sharp decrease in population to just 51,475 in 2000.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} 20th century, the area shifted its {{economic}} base to education, tourism, and services, {{largely based on}} healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people {{lived in the city}} proper in 1950, a combination of <b>suburbanization</b> and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.|$|E
25|$|The town can {{be roughly}} {{divided into three}} geographies: the village has a small-town atmosphere, much of Route 20A is heavily commercialized, and the {{majority}} of the town's area is farmland. One of the main issues faced by the community today is urban sprawl. The increasing presence of big-box stores on Route 20A has been welcomed by some residents, who appreciate the convenience of nearby retailers, and discouraged by others, who oppose the <b>suburbanization</b> of the small town.|$|E
25|$|The Clinton Street area {{remained}} a thriving middle-class residential neighborhood throughout {{the first half}} of the century. After World War II, <b>suburbanization</b> began and many of the residents moved out of the city. The poorer residents who replaced them, particularly west of Northern Boulevard, could not get mortgages or home improvement loans, and in the 1960s and 1970s the area began to show the signs of early urban decay, as buildings began to be abandoned and crumbled.|$|E
25|$|The new {{building}} {{was completed in}} 1923. For {{almost half a century}} afterwards, the store remained the region's major retailer, although it did not grow as it had in its earlier years. By the early 1970s, however, increasing <b>suburbanization</b> and the growth of the automobile had given it its first serious competition, {{in the form of the}} South Hills Mall. Luckey Platt opened a branch at one, the Dutchess Mall, roughly 10 miles south of Poughkeepsie near Fishkill, but it still lost customers.|$|E
25|$|San Jose lies {{close to}} the Pacific Ocean and close to San Francisco Bay (a small portion of its {{northern}} border touches the bay). Santa Clara Valley is the population center of the Bay Area and, like the hub and spokes of a wheel, surrounding communities emanate outwards from the valley. This growth, in part, has shaped the greater Bay Area {{as it is today}} in terms of geographic population distribution and the trend of <b>suburbanization</b> away from the valley.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{growth in}} the United States {{encouraged}} the <b>suburbanization</b> of American cities that required massive investments for the new infrastructure and homes. Consumer patterns were also shifting at this time, as purchasing power was becoming stronger and more accessible to {{a wider range of}} families. Suburban houses also brought about needs for products that were not needed in urban neighborhoods, such as lawnmowers and automobiles. During this time commercial shopping malls were being developed near suburbs to satisfy consumers' needs and their car–dependent lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Attendance and {{involvement}} {{declined in the}} early 20th century as West Somers felt the effects of <b>suburbanization</b> and the taking of large tracts of local land to create the reservoirs of the New York City water supply system. By the 1950s the church building had suffered such severe decline and neglect that its porch columns had to be replaced. Further restoration and renovation, including moving the church from its original site in the early 21st century, preceded the building's listing on the National Register.|$|E
25|$|Long a major {{population}} center and site of worldwide automobile manufacturing, Detroit {{has suffered a}} long economic decline produced by numerous factors. Like many industrial American cities, Detroit reached its population peak in the 1950 census. The peak population was 1.8 million people. Following <b>suburbanization,</b> industrial restructuring, and loss of jobs (as described above), by the 2010 census, the city had less than 40 percent of that number, with just over 700,000 residents. The city has declined in population in each census since 1950.|$|E
25|$|William and Sarah {{had eight}} children, but {{after her death}} in 1926, {{none of them would}} inherit the farm. Instead, her husband sold the {{property}} to a local developer. By that time the growth of the railroad, and the early development of the county's parkway network had brought <b>suburbanization</b> to northern Westchester. Large farms like the one that had been in the family for {{a century and a half}} were slowly disappearing, and after the sale the Williams–DuBois farm joined them, subdivided into the smaller, purely residential lots that exist today.|$|E
25|$|Construction and {{maintenance}} of outhouses in the US is subject {{to state and local}} governmental restriction, regulation and prohibition. It is potentially both a public health issue, which has been addressed both by law and by education of the public as to good methods and practices (e.g., separation from drinking water sources). This also becomes a more prevalent issue as urban and suburban development encroaches on rural areas, and is an external manifestation of a deeper cultural conflict. See also urban sprawl, urban planning, regional planning, <b>suburbanization,</b> urbanization and counterurbanization.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} practices of redlining, mortgage discrimination, and racially restrictive covenants {{contributed to the}} overcrowding and physical deterioration of areas where minorities chose to congregate. Such conditions are considered to {{have contributed to the}} emigration of other populations. The limited facilities for banking and insurance, due to a perceived lack of profitability, and other social services, and extra fees meant to hedge against perceived profit issues increased their cost to residents in predominantly non-white suburbs and city neighborhoods. According to the environmental geographer Laura Pulido, the historical processes of <b>suburbanization</b> and urban decentralization contribute to contemporary environmental racism.|$|E
