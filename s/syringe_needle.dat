5|$|Holly {{runs away}} from home and a {{large-scale}} police investigation is put in place to find her. Many other residents in the village suspect Loretta's boyfriend Jake of being her kidnapper, unaware that she is safe and hiding in Darren's flat. Loretta leaves Jake after she begins to doubt his innocence but later reconciles with him. After Jake finds Holly he chases her, she falls over and takes a blow to the head and falls into a coma. Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him. Loretta once more begins to doubt him. Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss). After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days. She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside. Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a <b>syringe</b> <b>needle</b> but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle. After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having {{to accept the fact that}} Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay. She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam. At first Jake thought she was looking for a home. However, when he saw them both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed. When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him that Adam was harassing her. This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta. However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him. Adam explains that Loretta had told him about Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope that Adam would take her back.|$|E

A polymer solution, sol-gel, particulate suspension or melt is loaded into the syringe and this liquid is extruded from the needle tip at a constant rate by a syringe pump. Alternatively, the droplet {{at the tip of}} the spinneret can be replenished by feeding from a header tank providing a constant feed pressure. This constant pressure type feed works better for lower viscosity feedstocks.|$|E
50|$|The autoinjector {{keeps the}} needle tip {{shielded}} prior to injection {{and also has}} a passive safety mechanism to prevent accidental firing (injection). Injection depth can be adjustable or fixed and a function for needle shield removal may be incorporated.

Once the injection is completed some auto injectors have visual indication {{to confirm that the}} full dose has been delivered.Autoinjectors contain glass syringes, which can make them fragile and contamination can occur. More recently, companies have been looking into making autoinjector syringes out of plastic to prevent this issue.|$|E

30|$|PVA {{solutions}} {{were prepared}} by dissolving PVA in acetic acid aqueous solution at 90 °C with constant stirring {{for at least}} 4  h. The electrospinning setup (Kato Tech, Kyoto, Japan) {{used in this study}} consists of a syringe with a flat-end metal needle (1.20 -mm inner diameter, NN- 1838  N, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), a syringe pump for controlled the feeding rate, a grounded cylindrical stainless steel mandrel, and a high-voltage DC power supply. In a typical electrospinning process, PVA solution was transferred into a syringe and delivered to the tip of the <b>syringe</b> <b>needle</b> by the syringe pump at a constant feed rate (1.0  ml/h). A 12 -kV positive voltage was applied to the PVA solution via the stainless steel <b>syringe</b> <b>needle.</b> The subsequently ejected polymer fiber was collected on the rotating cylindrical stainless steel mandrel, which was rotated during the electrospinning process (150  rpm). The distance between the tip of the needle and the surface of the mandrel was about 14  cm.

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} clinic effects and {{complication}} of Ahmed glaucoma valve(AGV) implantation in refractory glaucoma {{by using the}} 23 G <b>syringe</b> <b>needle</b> direct puncture the sclerotic tunnel. METHODS: Forty-four cases(44 eyes) of refractory glaucoma underwent AGV implantation by useing the 23 G <b>syringe</b> <b>needle</b> direct puncture the sclerotic tunnel. The intraocular pressure(IOP), visual acuity, and complication of post-operation were contrasted with those of pre-operation. RESULTS:The success rate was 84. 1 %, the mean preoperative IOP in research group was 52. 1 ± 10. 1 mmHg, and the last follow up mean IOP was 15. 6 ± 6. 9 mmHg. Compared with the preoperative visual acuity, 11 eyes increased, 27 eyes had no changes and 6 eyes decreased. The main post-operative complications included shallow anterior chamber(4 eyes), choroidal detachment(3 eyes), drainage tube shift(1 eye), hyphema(6 eyes), drainage tube blockage(1 eye), expulsive choroidal hemorrhage(1 eye), and fiber wrap of drainage tray(5 eyes). CONCLUSION: AGV implantation by direct puncture the sclerotic tunnel is feasible and easy. It avoids of making sclerotic petal and the xenogenic sclera transplanting, simplified the operation technique, prevent the leakage of around tube. The shallow anterior chamber rate is lower. It is an effective procedure for refractory glaucoma...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this ex vivo study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of three different irrigation techniques, ProRinse® <b>syringe</b> <b>needle,</b> ProUltra® PiezoFlow TM, and EndoActivator®, in cleaning the canals and isthmuses of human mandibular molars using a software program ImageJ. Materials and Methods : A custom-made metal cube was {{used to create a}} sealed canal system. Eighty extracted mandibular molars were randomly divided into four equal groups. Teeth were mounted; sectioned at 2, 4, and 6 mm; and reassembled into the metal cube. Chemo-mechanical preparation was done for all teeth. The teeth were divided into four groups for final debridement: Group 1 (control group) received only needle irrigation, group 2 used the ProRinse® <b>syringe</b> <b>needle</b> with 5 % NaOCl irrigation within a 1 -mm working length, group 3 used ProUltra® PiezoFlow TM ultrasonic agitation for 30 seconds, and group 4 used the EndoActivator® system to agitate for 30 seconds.

Statistical analysis was completed using an ANOVA test and Tukey′s test. Results: The results showed no statistically significant difference in canal or isthmus cleanliness between the four groups. However, there was a statistically significant difference (P < 0. 05) in isthmus cleanliness in group 4 at the 4 -mm level.
