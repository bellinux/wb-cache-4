5|$|Another song {{sequence}} ("Suraj Hua Maddham") involving Khan and Kajol {{was shot}} with {{the backdrop of}} the Pyramids of Giza in the city of Cairo in Egypt. Due to the lighting conditions, the crew could shoot only between 7 and 9am in the morning. As a result, the song took <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> film. In addition, Kajol suffered from a minor injury while filming for the song, as she had experienced a bad fall.|$|E
5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> pass a town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E

The Israeli general staff needed <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> assess the actual disposition of the Jordanian forces around Latrun and Jerusalem because these latter were thought to be at several locations in the country.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{billions of}} small black cubes appear across the globe. The Doctor arrives and he, Amy, and Rory {{are taken to}} UNIT headquarters, where Commander Kate Stewart {{explains}} {{that they have not}} been able to analyze the cubes' function. The Doctor waits with Amy and Rory for <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> monitor the situation, and gets to know Rory's father, Brian. The Doctor deems the cubes harmless and departs, though instructs Brian to keep watch.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{downtown}} buildings were damaged in a major tornado in March 2008, scattering glass from several hundred feet. It took workers <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> clean the buildings and remove all of the loose shards of glass from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of its windows replaced. Window blinds and other office objects from the tall buildings were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|The Treasury {{announced}} {{the new design}} on December 19, 1921. Photographs of Baker and de Francisci examining the final plaster model appeared in newspapers, along with written descriptions of the designs, since the Treasury at that time took the position that it was illegal for photographs of a United States coin to be printed in a newspaper. Secretary Mellon gave formal approval to the design on December 20. As {{it would take the}} Mint <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> produce working dies, the first strike of the new coins was scheduled for December 29.|$|E
5|$|American forces finally {{halted the}} North Korean advance {{in a series}} of engagements in the {{southern}} section of the country. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, opening a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, North Korean forces took Chinju to the west, pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for more North Korean attacks. US formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force in the west withdrew for <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E

5|$|In July 1939, Stevens and Colonial Treasurer Alexander Mair {{attempted}} to address Spooner's unwillingness to accede to cabinet decisions regarding ministerial expenditure {{by creating a}} committee of four, consisting of Mair, Stevens, Spooner and Bruxner, to approve all expenditure. Furious at this gesture, Spooner resigned on 21 July 1939 as Minister and Deputy Leader, citing a 'disagreement in government policy on relief works' as the reason. Despite Spooner's departure, {{the stability of the}} government was to be short. On 1 August 1939, Spooner carried a motion of no confidence in Stevens in the house, which unexpectedly passed by two votes, owing to the absence of several ministers. On 3 August Stevens tendered his resignation to the Governor, Lord Wakehurst, but was granted <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> remain until his successor was chosen.|$|E
5|$|In mid-November 1942, Junyō was tasked {{to provide}} air {{cover for the}} convoy {{bringing}} reinforcements for the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal during the three-day-long Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The ship's fighters were unable to do so; seven transports were sunk and the remaining four transports were damaged. In December 1942 – January 1943, the carrier covered several convoys that brought reinforcements to Wewak, New Guinea and her air group was based there for <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> protect the forces there before returning to Truk on 20 January. The ship then covered the evacuation of forces from Guadalcanal through early February.|$|E
5|$|In the west, US {{forces were}} pushed back {{repeatedly}} before finally halting the North Korean advance. Forces from the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly {{arrived in the}} country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing the 19th Infantry Regiment back and leaving routes to the Pusan open for North Korean forces. US units were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the North Korean force on the west flank withdrew for <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> re-equip and receive reinforcements.

5|$|Redback spiderlings cohabit on the {{maternal}} web for <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> a week, {{during which time}} sibling cannibalism is often observed. They then leave by being carried on the wind. They follow light and {{climb to the top}} of nearby logs or rocks before extending their abdomens high in the air and producing a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long gossamer thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. This behaviour is known as ballooning or kiting. Eventually, the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web. They sometimes work cooperatively, climbing, releasing silk and being carried off in clusters. Juvenile spiders build webs, sometimes with other spiders.|$|E
5|$|The Arcturus did not {{encounter}} the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe {{was hoping to}} study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin and Saba. In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on the border between the two. He sailed along the border between the currents for <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> document it, theorizing that it could be the cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Niño.|$|E
5|$|The ENIAC (1946) was {{the first}} machine that was both {{electronic}} and general purpose. It was Turing complete, with conditional branching, and programmable to solve {{a wide range of}} problems, but its program was held in the state of switches in patchcords, not in memory, and it could take <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> reprogram. Researchers such as Turing and Zuse investigated the idea of using the computer's memory to hold the program as well as the data it was working on, and it was mathematician John von Neumann who wrote a widely distributed paper describing that computer architecture, still used in almost all computers.|$|E

5|$|Watts-Russell {{suggested}} {{it would be}} enjoyable for the Breeders record at a studio in Scotland called the Palladium. It was a house that included a recording studio on the first floor, as well as bedrooms upstairs. The band members sometimes recorded wearing their pajamas, and more than once went to a local pub without changing into regular clothes. The studio was booked for two weeks, but the album itself only took <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> record; during the remaining time, the Breeders recorded a John Peel session, and a television crew filmed a video of the band.|$|E
