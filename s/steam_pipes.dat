5|$|The {{class was}} heavily used by British Railways: 29 {{locomotives}} required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to excessive wear. Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use, and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted: the inside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> of Maunsell's original design {{were replaced by}} outside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> emerging from the smokebox, behind the smoke deflectors. From 1957, some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal, though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on the entire class. Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and water consumption. The final set of modifications constituted the fitting of new injectors and Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|According to Admiral Kummetz' report, {{the first}} torpedo hit Kesselraum 2 (boileroom 2, {{just under the}} funnel) and the second hit Turbinenraum 2/3 (the turbine room for the side shafts). Boiler 1 had already been {{destroyed}} by gunfire. Only one boiler remained, but the <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> through boiler 1 and 2 and turbine room 2/3 had been damaged and turbine 1 for the main shaft lost its power. By 04:34, the ship had been severely damaged, but had successfully passed through the firing zone; the Norwegian guns could no longer bear on her. The 15cm guns in the Kopås battery were all standing in open positions with a wide sector of firing. After the torpedo hits, Blücher was still within range. The battery asked for orders, but Eriksen concluded: The fortress has served its purpose. With all propellers stopped, about 60% of the electric power gone, Blucher quickly lost speed and at about 04:50 dropped anchors at Askoholmene.|$|E

5|$|The cost {{increased}} to almost AU£55,000, {{for a variety}} of reasons. It was originally intended for the ship to travel between ports in New Guinea and Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Increasing casualty numbers in the New Guinea campaign meant that the hospitals in Queensland would quickly become unable to deal with the quantity of the casualties and the nature of their injuries, so a longer voyage to Sydney was required. The Army demanded that additional facilities and conversions be added to the original plans such as expanded bathing and washing facilities, hot water made available to all parts of the ship through installation of a calorifier, the rerouting of all <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> away from patient areas, and ventilation arrangements suitable for tropical conditions. The unions representing the ship's crew requested improved living and dining conditions, including new sinks in the food preparation areas and the replacement of flooring in the quarters and mess rooms.|$|E
5|$|The Russians did {{not believe}} that super firing turrets offered any {{advantage}} as they discounted the value of axial fire, believed that broadside fire was much more important and also believed that super firing turrets could not fire while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast interfering with the open sighting hoods in the lower turret's roof. They therefore designed the ships with a 'linear' arrangement (lineinoe raspolozhenie) of turrets distributed over the length of the ship. This arrangement had several advantages because it reduced the stress on the ends of the ship since the turrets were not concentrated {{at the end of the}} ship, increased stability because the lack of elevated turrets and their barbettes, improved the survivability of the ship because the magazines were separated from each other and gave a lower silhouette. Disadvantages were that the magazines had to be put in the middle of all the machinery, which required <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> to be run through or around them and the lack of deck space free from blast. This greatly complicated the placement of the anti-torpedo boat guns which ultimately had to be mounted in the hull, closer to the water than was desirable.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the design}} is that the firebox is directly above the rear power unit, which limits its size. With two power bogies, flexible <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> must be provided to all cylinders. This was difficult to achieve with 19th Century technology. Early Mallet locomotives had compound cylinders, so high pressure steam was provided to the rigid power unit, while the front cylinders (requiring flexible <b>steam</b> <b>pipes)</b> received low pressure steam.|$|E

25|$|Both {{diethyl ether}} and carbon {{disulfide}} have exceptionally low autoignition temperatures which increase greatly the fire {{risk associated with}} these solvents. The autoignition temperature of carbon disulfide is below 100°C (212°F), so objects such as <b>steam</b> <b>pipes,</b> light bulbs, hotplates, and recently-extinguished bunsen burners are able to ignite its vapours.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the high quality of his steam engines, sales {{increased}} a great deal and it became apparent that a new engine assembly shop was required. Murray designed this himself, and produced a huge three-storeyed circular building known as the Round Foundry. This contained a centrally mounted steam engine to power all of the machines in the building. Murray also built a house for himself adjoining the works. The design of this was pioneering, as each room was heated by <b>steam</b> <b>pipes,</b> so that it became known locally as Steam Hall.|$|E
25|$|During repairs, workers {{found the}} bodies of 66 West Virginia sailors who were trapped below when the ship sank. Several were lying atop <b>steam</b> <b>pipes,</b> in the only {{remaining}} air bubble of flooded areas. Three were found in a storeroom compartment, where they had survived for a time on emergency rations and fresh water from a battle station; a calendar {{indicated that they were}} alive through 23 December. Although the remaining crew and shipyard workers were confronted with a monumental task because of the damage to her port side, West Virginia sailed from Pearl Harbor on 7 May 1943 to Bremerton, Washington and a complete rebuild at the Puget Sound Navy Yard.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the station, guests boarded a large, open-air aerial tram vehicle. There, a live guide aboard the tram informed {{them that they were}} being evacuated off of Manhattan Island and over to Roosevelt Island during Kong's attack. The tram's radio was tuned to the police emergency frequency so that guests could be informed of Kong's location in the city. The tram traveled above the streets of downtown New York City where guests could view Kong's path of destruction. There was a water geyser from a broken fire hydrant, broken <b>steam</b> <b>pipes,</b> crashed and overturned cars, and a subway train partly derailed from its elevated track. A police chopper described the scene around the tram over the radio, alerting that Kong was approaching the tramway and that he was grabbing a power pole. Kong's silhouette could briefly be seen as a spotlight shone on a building ahead of the tram. As the tram passed the power pole, it tipped over and its electrical transformer exploded, unleashing a shower of sparks and fire, which ignited the derailed elevated subway train.|$|E
50|$|More than 12 similar Con Edison <b>steam</b> <b>pipe</b> explosions have {{occurred}} in New York City since 1987. One {{of the most significant}} events occurred near Gramercy Park in 1989, killing two Con Edison workers and one bystander, and causing damage of several million U.S. dollars.

A fragment from the flight deck armour penetrated the hangar deck armour and passed through the centre boiler uptakes, the centre boiler room itself, and an oil tank before it came {{to rest in the}} inner bottom. The fragment severed the <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> in the centre boiler room and forced its evacuation, cutting the ship's speed to [...] The blast on the flight deck blew the Avenger closest to it over the side and set another one on fire. Shrapnel from the blast peppered the island, causing the bulk of the casualties, and severed many electrical cables, including those for most of the ship's radars.

500|$|The {{base was}} also the {{location}} of an experimental system of <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> in 1957, to test the viability of using steam to melt the snow on the runways. Pipes were spaced at different intervals in the experiment. That same year, the first KC-135 Stratotanker, christened the [...] "Aroostook Queen", arrived at Loring. By December, all of the KC-97s had left, and by April 1958, 20 KC-135s had arrived, allowing the 42nd Air Refueling Squadron to reach full operational capacity in May. [...] Later that year, an alert force was created at Loring, consisting of six B-52's. The following year, {{in response to a}} conflict in Lebanon, the entire wing was placed on alert.|$|E
500|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II {{made it impossible}} to remove her from service, and as a consequence she never received the scheduled modernisation afforded to other capital ships such as the battlecruiser [...] and several of the s.

These problems also reduced her steam output so that she was unable to attain her designed speed.|$|E

500|$|Other {{modifications}} {{included the}} lengthening of valve travel, and fitting larger outside <b>steam</b> <b>pipes</b> {{to streamline the}} flow of steam into the cylinders. Fifteen locomotives of this revised design were built in 1927, and some were given [...] six-wheeled tenders for use on the Southern Railway's Central section. This allowed the locomotive to be turned on the shorter turntables found on {{this part of the}} network. From new, {{the rest of the class}} was equipped with the Urie [...] eight-wheel bogie tender, which allowed the class to operate on the extended freight routes of the Southern Railway's Western section. The standardisation measures undertaken by both Urie and Maunsell were soon vindicated by the fact that tenders and other parts were swapped with those of other classes on the Southern Railway when locomotives were under overhaul.|$|E
500|$|On 2 September 1944, SED Private Arnold Kramish, and two civilians, Peter N. Bragg, Jr., an NRL {{chemical}} engineer, and Douglas P.

It is vaguely organic, and almost depicted as a life-form. Similarly, Calcifer is a demonic figure in the book, as compared to the [...] "endearing" [...] persona and image that he has in the film. Both film and novel try to render fantastic elements as mundane and ordinary things. Although they are set in a fantasy universe, the characters are often shown performing routine tasks, like cooking breakfast or washing up, in contrast to the heroic actions typical of a fantasy universe.
