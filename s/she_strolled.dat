60|$|<b>She</b> <b>strolled</b> away. The waiter {{remained}} patiently {{upon the}} threshold.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>strolled</b> away, and Ainslie watched Ida, {{whose eyes}} were {{following}} Miss Weston at the tennis net.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>strolled</b> off, humming a tune to herself. Lord Saxthorpe {{watched her}} with a shadow upon his plain, good-humoured face.|$|E
60|$|The same room, {{with the}} lights turned up and the {{curtains}} drawn. Ellie comes in, followed by Mangan. Both are dressed for dinner. <b>She</b> <b>strolls</b> to the drawing-table. He comes between {{the table and the}} wicker chair.|$|R
5000|$|Betty {{receives}} {{an invitation to}} a party from her elderly relative, Grampy. As <b>she</b> <b>strolls</b> along singing [...] "I'm On My Way to Grampy's", she is joined by two moving men, a fireman and a traffic cop - all who irresponsibly drop everything (including a piano, a burning house and a traffic jam) to go to Grampy's party.|$|R
5000|$|I Want it All I Want It Now was {{exhibited}} at the Or Gallery in Vancouver in 2003, which included the video installation Please Please Please, which [...] "depicts Slade’s point of view as <b>she</b> <b>strolls</b> {{through the streets of}} Vancouver leading from her studio to the Or Gallery as she accompanies herself in song, covering The Smiths’ Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>strolled</b> on, more scornful and {{helpless}} than ever. Apparently {{it did not}} matter what one said to Lady Pippinworth; her pout kept it within the proprieties.|$|E
60|$|She found a {{path between}} high hedges, that wandered away through the grounds, and along this <b>she</b> <b>strolled</b> until she reached a rose arbor with a {{comfortable}} bench.|$|E
60|$|She obeyed him, {{depositing}} {{it carefully}} {{in a safe}} place. Then <b>she</b> <b>strolled</b> around the room, finding pictures little to her taste, and finally threw herself into an easy-chair.|$|E
50|$|The {{inspiration}} for the characters {{is said to have}} come to Hasegawa as <b>she</b> was <b>strolling</b> along the beach one day.|$|R
5000|$|Princess Zhukovski laughs when {{he pulls}} his gun on her. He is unable to chase her as <b>she</b> coolly <b>strolls</b> towards the door, confessing all. He threatens to shoot her, but she shrugs. The story ends as: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So sorry, dad," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>strolling</b> {{up to the}} table. [...] "I {{understood}} that you were alone. Here are the roses," [...] she added, laying them upon the table without enthusiasm. [...] "Are you coming up west for luncheon to-day?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>strolled</b> {{across the}} hall and looked in at the study. The Marquis was seated in an easy-chair, reading a volume of Memoirs. She crossed the room towards him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>strolled</b> {{across the}} lawn to where Cecil was still {{knocking}} the croquet balls about. Jeanne sank into her place, and Forrest looked {{at her for a}} few moments attentively.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>strolled</b> away. The Prime Minister {{sank back}} upon a couch. His air of well-bred content with himself and life fell {{away from him}} the moment his hostess was out of sight.|$|E
5000|$|Opening {{on a sunny}} high school, birds chrip, flags fly, {{and school}} mascots fight. A blonde woman arrives to end Andrew (the mascot)'s fight. The woman is Becky Freeley, the school's {{guidance}} counselor. Becky cheerfully intones that she knows exactly how difficult high school can be. She meets with kids like Russell - who's failing remedial PE and {{may or may not}} have head lice. But she claims to love the kids, and that they love her back. <b>She</b> <b>strolls</b> past a group of African Americans, cluelessly spouting, [...] "What's the haps, peeps?" [...] She later swipes a Danish from a chunky girl, saying that it may fill the hole in her mouth, but [...] "not the hole in her soul." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{an awful}} business," [...] he continued. [...] "I don't see how I'm {{ever going to}} find her. I hoped <b>she</b> might <b>stroll</b> down to the Spa in the evening, and I've been hanging about the gates ever since six. I hadn't the threepence to go in." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Hignett, having rallied {{from her}} moment of weakness, {{glared at the}} new arrival dumbly. She could not place Jane. From the airy way in which <b>she</b> had <b>strolled</b> into the room, she {{appeared}} {{to be some sort of}} a nurse; but she wore no nurse's uniform.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thats true," [...] said Elinor, reluctantly. Marian {{turned away}} and quietly resumed her {{conversation}} with Douglas. After a minute <b>she</b> <b>strolled</b> with him into the garden, whither Marmaduke had already retired to smoke.|$|E
60|$|So <b>she</b> <b>strolled</b> to the gate, {{glancing up}} now and again. There, sure enough, was Siegmund coming, the towel hanging over his shoulder, his throat bare, {{and his face}} bright. She stood in the mottled shade.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{was sitting}} {{out in the}} garden, showing some of the little ones how to do their crochet--it was the play-time after dinner--and I just went to her and whispered in her ear, and so <b>she</b> <b>strolled</b> quietly by the window.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see. You {{mean that}} {{anything}} {{in the shape of}} mixed bathing and moonlight <b>strolls</b> <b>she</b> conducted solely in your company?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Early one morning, a taxi {{pulls up}} at Tiffany & Co. on Fifth Avenue in New York City, from which elegantly dressed Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) emerges. After {{looking into the}} shop's windows, <b>she</b> <b>strolls</b> home. Outside her apartment, she fends off Sid Arbuck (Claude Stroud), her date from the {{disastrous}} night before. Inside the apartment building, Holly can't find her keys so she buzzes her landlord, Mr. Yunioshi (Mickey Rooney), who begrudgingly lets her in. Later, she is awakened by new neighbor Paul Varjak (George Peppard), who rings her doorbell {{to get into the}} building. The pair chat as she dresses to leave for her weekly visit to Sally Tomato (Alan Reed), a mobster incarcerated at Sing Sing prison. Tomato's lawyer, O'Shaughnessy, pays her $100 a week to deliver [...] "the weather report".|$|R
60|$|The {{daughter}} of this accomplished woman now reappeared, in company with Miss Ruck, with whom <b>she</b> had been <b>strolling</b> through the outlying {{parts of the}} garden.|$|R
60|$|When Aleema was gone, Yillah went forth {{into the}} glen, and wandered among the trees, and reposed by {{the banks of}} the stream. And ever as <b>she</b> <b>strolled,</b> looked down upon her the grim old cliffs, bearded with {{trailing}} moss.|$|E
60|$|He {{disappeared}} {{through the}} swing doors. <b>She</b> <b>strolled</b> {{across the room}} to where her friends were sitting in a circle, laughing and talking. Her father, who had just come in and joined them, gripped her by the arm as she sat down.|$|E
60|$|Her {{tone was}} unhurried, her manner {{expressed}} no indignation. Yet as <b>she</b> <b>strolled</b> towards the gate, David felt the colour drained from his cheeks, felt the wicker {{sides of his}} chair crash {{in the grip of}} his fingers. He rose and hurried after her.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Red Carpet" [...] {{was directed by}} Hisashi Kikuchi, and was uploaded onto the singer's YouTube channel on November 19, 2015. It opens with Amuro walking through two large doors, wearing a coat-like dress; on the DVD editions of the single, a special customization function allows the viewer to change the colour of the dress. <b>She</b> <b>strolls</b> through several streets and sits down briefly on a small bench-seat, with {{several members of the}} public, including a young couple and small children. The second chorus has her gazing through a fashion boutique, admiring several pairs of heels. By the bridge section, sparks fall from the sky and are seen behind Amuro as she looks upwards. Whilst the final chorus has her dancing as the sparks fall, the visual ends with the singer walking up several steps and posing for the camera.|$|R
6000|$|I {{understood}} {{quite well}} what <b>she</b> meant. We <b>strolled</b> on slowly. I refrained {{from looking at}} her. And {{it was as if}} answering my own thoughts that I murmured-- ...|$|R
60|$|Maxwell {{would not}} answer her. He went out, and <b>she</b> saw him <b>strolling</b> {{down the path}} to the rocks. She took the {{manuscript}} and began to read it over.|$|R
60|$|At first <b>she</b> <b>strolled</b> {{slowly through}} the streets, but presently, {{increasing}} her pace, resolved to take the lad for a country walk. At Tranquil Vale she paused to tie up her boot-lace, and, satisfying herself that Bassett was still in pursuit, set off again.|$|E
60|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} the time {{appointed}} for the walk Panchita tripped demurely out of her gate in a thin, trim white lawn and sailor hat. <b>She</b> <b>strolled</b> up the sidewalk and slowed her steps at Dry Valley's gate, her manner expressing wonder at his unusual delinquency.|$|E
60|$|But {{in spite}} of the evident hatred of her husband's family, the Empress {{appeared}} to be entirely unconcerned and at her ease as <b>she</b> <b>strolled</b> about among the groups of her guests with a kindly glance and a pleasant word for each of them. A tall, soldierly man, brown-faced and moustached, walked beside her, and she occasionally laid her hand with a caressing motion upon his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... --but did {{not last}} long. The Raja's {{daughter}} -- for the principal maiden was a princess -- soon left her companions, who were scooping up water with their palms and dashing it over one another's heads, and proceeded to perform the rites of purification, meditation, and worship. Then <b>she</b> began <b>strolling</b> with a friend {{under the shade of}} a small mango grove.|$|R
50|$|On 24 January 2012 she was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for the animated short film A Morning <b>Stroll.</b> <b>She</b> shared her nomination with Grant Orchard at the 84th Academy Awards.|$|R
50|$|A decade later, Yongyuan {{returns to}} Beijing and {{encounters}} Anran, now a teenage pre-med student. She’s grown {{up to be}} played by Chinese beauty Gao Yuanyuan (“Caught in the Web”), who in this movie always looks as if <b>she’s</b> just <b>strolled</b> out of a fashion spread. He’s now portrayed by Hong Kong action star Nicholas Tse (“The Bullet Vanishes”), who’s just as pretty as she is.|$|R
