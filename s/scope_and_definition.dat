40|$|Remanufacturing is an {{important}} strategy in the manufacturing industry. A life cycle assessment (LCA) {{is often used to}} measure whether, and to what extent, a remanufactured product is ‘better’ for the environment than a newly produced equivalent. In order to obtain valid and meaningful outcomes, LCA standards and guidelines need to be followed. However, for the system boundaries selection in the LCA for remanufacturing the standards and guidelines offer insufficient guidance to practitioners. This paper reports on a literature review conducted to analyze how {{the first step in the}} LCA, i. e., the goal <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> stage, is shaped in prior LCAs for remanufactured products. The review suggests that the goal <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>definitions</b> are often shrouded in obscurity in prior LCAs for remanufactured products. Moreover, different perspectives that shape the goal <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>definitions</b> are identified <b>and</b> their meanings and assumptions analyzed. An illustrative case study of a real-life remanufactured product demonstrates how different perspectives in the goal <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> stage lead to different LCA models and different LCA outcomes.

Kranzbühler argued {{during and after the}} Nuremberg Trials that the Nuremberg Trials expanded the scope of war crimes by prosecuting generals on account of the military preparation of war, lawyers on account of their participation in certain legislation, and industrialists on their participation in the war economy. Kranzbühler doubted that such a broad expansion of the previous definition of a war crime (which was historically confined mainly to violations of the rules of war by members of the armed forces and armed hostilities by non members) would not have authority in the future. Furthermore, Kranzbühler questioned {{the manner in which it}} was applied at Nuremberg - particularly that his client, Grand Admiral Dönitz, was charged with crimes against the laws of war, yet U.S. Admiral Nimitz (who did similar acts as Dönitz) was never charged.|$|E

During this period, he also worked under President Antonio Cassese of Italy and prepared a Memorandum on the Law of Genocide that would become influential in the ICTY's jurisprudence in the years that followed. In 1997, at age 30, he successfully argued the first appeals case before the ICTY in the case of Prosecutor v Erdemovic concerning the defence of duress in the mass-execution of 1,200 Muslims in Srebrenica in July 1995. He also drafted the Prosecutor's submissions on several fundamental questions of international criminal law - on the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and grounds of liability - in the landmark case of Prosecutor v Tadic. He was also involved in drafting the indictments against leadership figures such as Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic, and Ratko Mladic. As Legal Advisor, he also wrote influential commentaries in Human Rights Quarterly on the mutually reinforcing relationship between peace and justice in the former Yugoslavia and organized high-level meetings with Harvard Law School and the Åbo Akademi Institute in Finland bringing together the ICTY Prosecutor with Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg and other key figures in the UN Peace Conference.|$|E

50|$|The {{role the}} FRS plays in EPA {{is to provide}} an accurate, {{authoritative}} facility record. The European model of environmental regulation is for facilities to be assigned a number when the plant created, and all permits are linked to that number. The U.S. environmental regulatory system is based on multiple environmental laws, with somewhat varying <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions.</b> The separate regulatory system established under each law contributes its separate set of permit information to a central data system, which has to match the facility records based on the business rules outlined above. Further complicating the issue, many programs use self-reported information, which encourages gaming the system to reduce the apparent environmental impact of a production facility. One other structural problem is that many environmental programs are delegated to the states, which further complicates facility interaction at the federal level. These structural problems prevent EPA from having as complete a picture of American pollution as its European counterparts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{is one of}} {{the tools}} that quantifies the inputs and outputs and evaluates the {{potential}} environmental impact during the entire life cycle of a product, process or service. However, one of the limitations in a conventional LCA is that time is rarely taken into consideration in LCA methodology. The consideration of time in an LCA is mostly considered in the <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). Therefore, this paper reviews the time consideration in each phase of LCA methodology from goal <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> <b>definition</b> to LCIA. Moreover, the possibility of improvement, such as the time load in LCA is also reviewed. Key words: Life cycle assessment Time load LCA Life cycle impact assessmen...|$|R

40|$|This report {{forms the}} basis to revise the {{existing}} EU Green Public Procurement (GPP) criteria for Food and Catering services. This will assist in the reduction of negative impacts of the, public procurement of these services, on the environment, human health and natural resources. The revision of EU GPP requires in-depth information about the technical and environmental performance of the service group as well as about the current procurement processes. The scientific body of evidence gathered will be cross-checked with sector experienced stakeholders, to develop consensus on how the criteria should be revised to deliver optimum environmental improvements. This Report {{which will be the}} basis for producing the draft EU GPP criteria proposals that will be discussed in the Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) meetings. Chapter 1 focuses on the <b>definition</b> for <b>and</b> <b>scoping</b> of Food <b>and</b> Catering Services to overview of the different <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> to narrow down the services in order to obtain a homogenous scope. Chapter 2, market analysis, presents the market overview and the market structure by focusing on the contract catering market. The environmental analysis (Chapter 3) provides a detail analysis of the main environmental hotspots for the food product categories by reviewing a number of LCA studies. Other non-LCA aspects including ethical and health consideration are also summarised. The technical analysis focus on the current schemes and labels identified as important for the revision of the current EU GPP criteria. Chapter 4 provide improvement options, based on the best sector practices and national cases studies which could assist the revision of the EU GPP, and reduce the sectors environmental impacts, by drawing on findings from the market and technical analysis.
