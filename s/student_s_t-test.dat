The PSS process improves particle spherocity and surface morphology for coating by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Angular fully dense particles melt in an argon-hydrogen plasma jet at between 32 - 36 kW, and become spherical due to surface tension. Surrogate CeO 2 powder was used in place of UO 2 for system and process parameter development.

Methods Structured national telephone survey of ambulatory care physicians, four thematic blocks with 21 questions (5 point Likert scale). 511 office-based general practitioners and specialists. Main outcome measures were the application of Clinical Practice Guidelines in daily practice, preference for sources of guidelines and degree of knowledge and acceptance of EBM. In the data analysis Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for explorative analysis of correlations. The comparison of groups was performed by Student's t-test. Chi 2 test was used to investigate distribution of two or more categorical variables. Results Of the total study population 55. 3 % of physicians reported already using guidelines in the treatment of patients. Physicians in group practices (GrP) as well as general practitioners (GP) agreed significantly more with the usefulness of guidelines as a basis for patient care than doctors in single practices (SP) or specialists (<b>S)</b> (<b>Student's</b> <b>t-test</b> mean GP 2. 57, S 2. 84, p Conclusion Despite a majority of physicians accepting and applying CPGs a large group remains that is critical and opposed to the utilization of CPGs in daily practice and to the concept of EBM in general.

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} the compliance {{and degree of}} satisfaction of nulligravida (has not given birth) and parous (had already given birth) women who are using intrauterine devices (IUDs). Methods A cross-sectional cohort study was conducted comparing nulligravida and parous women who had had an IUD inserted between July 2009 and November 2011. A total of 84 nulligravida women and 73 parous women were included. Interviews were conducted with women who agreed to participate through telephone contact. Statistical analysis was performed with <b>Student</b> <b>s</b> <b>t-test</b> and Mann-Whitney test for numeric variables; Pearson s chi-square test to test associations; and, whenever pertinent, Fisher s exact test for categorical variables. A survival curve was constructed to estimate the likelihood of each woman continuing {{the use of the}} IUD. A significance level of 5 % was established. Results When compared with parous women, nulligravida women had a higher education level (median: 12 vs. 10 years). No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the nulligravida and parous women with respect to information on the use of the IUD, prior use of other contraceptive methods, the reason for having chosen the IUD as the current contraceptive method, reasons for discontinuing the use and adverse effects, compliance, and degree of satisfaction. The two groups did not show any difference in terms of continued use of the IUD (p = 0. 4).

40|$|Background and Aim: Colonic stenting is a {{novel and}} privileged {{therapeutic}} option for malignant obstructions of the large bowel, especially as a bridging procedure to elective surgery. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare {{the efficacy of the}} traditional surgical approach with stent placement in the management of obstructing colorectal tumours. Patients and Methods: Thirty-three patients with malignant colonic obstruction were retrospectively studied. Of them, 17 underwent a diversion colostomy (group I), while 16 were treated with SEMS (group II). Early outcome, late outcome and duration of hospitalisation were evaluated. For statistical analysis chi-square and <b>Student.</b> <b>s</b> <b>t-test</b> were used (statistical significance level P< 0. 05). Results: One death in each group occurred within the first 3 days following colonic decompression. One case of pulmonary embolism (group I) and one case of asymptomatic colonic perforation (group II) were the only early morbid situations complicating decompressing interventions. Elective surgery was finally performed on 10 patients in group I and in 9 patients in group II. One case of early local recurrence after tumor resection was observed in the stenting group. The cumulated mortality rate was estimated at 6. 9 % and 9. 1 % and cumulated morbidity rate at 20. 7 % and 9. 1 % for the two groups respectively. The mean time of hospitalization was significantly longer in the colostomy group. Conclusions: SEMS are effective for the temporary treatment of malignant occlusions of the large bowel and particularly advantageous not only because of their technical simplicity but also good tolerance and quality of life which they offer epecially in cases of locally or distally extended disease...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTraditionally, {{audio quality}} and video quality are {{evaluated}} separately in subjective tests. Best practices within the quality assessment community were developed before many modern mobile audiovisual devices and services came into use, such as internet video, smart phones, tablets and connected televisions. These devices and services raise unique questions that require jointly evaluating both the audio and the video within a subjective test. However, audiovisual subjective testing {{is a relatively}} under-explored field. In this paper, we {{address the question of}} determining the most suitable way to conduct audiovisual subjective testing {{on a wide range of}} audiovisual quality. Six laboratories from four countries conducted a systematic study of audiovisual subjective testing. The stimuli and scale were held constant across experiments and labs; only the environment of the subjective test was varied. Some subjective tests were conducted in controlled environments and some in public environments (a cafeteria, patio or hallway). The audiovisual stimuli spanned a wide range of quality. Results show that these audiovisual subjective tests were highly repeatable from one laboratory and environment to the next. The number of subjects was the most important factor. Based on this experiment, 24 or more subjects are recommended for Absolute Category Rating (ACR) tests. In public environments, 35 subjects were required to obtain the same <b>Student.</b> <b>s</b> <b>t-test</b> sensitivity. The second most important variable was individual differences between subjects. Other environmental factors had minimal impact, such as language, country, lighting, background noise, wall color, and monitor calibration. Analyses indicate that Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) are relative rather than absolute. Our analyses show that the results of experiments done in pristine, laboratory environments are highly representative of those devices in actual use, in a typical user environment...|$|E

40|$|Although elder self-neglect is {{the most}} common form of elder mistreatment, its {{pathophysiology}} is not well understood. Alpha-tocopherol is a lipid soluble antioxidant required for the preservation of cell membranes. Since the association between tocopherol and cognitive impairment in older adults has been described, we explored the possibility of its role in elder self-neglect. OBJECTIVE: (1) To determine whether serum tocopherol levels are associated with elder self-neglect, and (2) to assess the association of serum tocopherol levels and cognitive function in elder self-neglect. METHODS: Serum tocopherol levels were measured in a cohort of 67 self-neglecting elders and 67 matched controls, recruited for the Consortium for Research in Elder Self-neglect of Texas. Pearson s correlation tests were performed to assess bivariate associations between serum tocopherol levels and cognitive function. RESULTS: Mean serum alpha-tocopherol levels were 10. 8 +/- 4. 7 ug/mL in self-neglect group and 13. 0 +/- 4. 9 ug/mL in control group (p = 0. 006, unpaired <b>student</b> <b>s</b> <b>t-test).</b> None of the participants from either group had alpha-tocopherol level lower than the reference range. Mean serum gamma-tocopherol levels were 2. 0 +/- 1. 0 ug/mL in self-neglect group and 2. 0 +/- 1. 1 in control group (p= 0. 83). Proportion of the elders with gamma-tocopherol level lower than the reference range were 4. 5 % (3 / 66) in self-neglect group and 10. 4 % (7 / 67) in control group (p= 0. 32, Fisher s Exact Test). Among the self-neglecting elders, no association was found between serum alpha-tocopherol levels and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Wolf-Klein Clock Drawing Test (CDT) scores (r =- 0. 42, p= 0. 75 for MMSE; r= 0. 08, p= 0. 54 for CDT). No association was found between serum gamma-tocopherol levels and the MMSE or the CDT (r=- 0. 12, p= 0. 35 for MMSE; r= 0. 05, p= 0. 68 for CDT). CONCLUSION: In our sample, neither alpha-tocopherol nor gamma-tocopherol appears to have a role in pathophysiology of elder self-neglect.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} today {{the leading cause}} for cancer related deaths among women in Europe. Decreased {{mortality}} among breast cancer patients has been observed over the last twenty years, where {{development and use of}} targeted therapies, utilizing hormone dependence, are believed {{to be part of the}} reason. Some subtypes of breast cancer still have poor prognoses for patients, where basal-like/triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have the worst predictions. Most basal-like tumors are triple negative, i. e. they lack expression of hormone receptors (estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR)) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2). Targeted treatment options for these patients are therefore limited, but use of glutaminase inhibitors have shown to be a potential treatment option for these patients. TNBC models have shown to be more dependent on L-glutamine and respond better to the glutaminase inhibitor CB- 839 than ER-positive models, both in in vitro and in vivo xenograft models. CB- 839 is currently under early stage clinical trials, but more information about the metabolic response of CB- 839 in basal-like tumors is needed to identify patients likely to respond to treatment with CB- 839. A patient-derived xenograft model named MAS 98. 12, displaying a basal-like/TNBC phenotype, has previously been established and is characterized in this study. The aim of this study is to add more information about the metabolic response of CB- 839 treated basal-like MAS 98. 12 tumors in mice. Tumor tissue and serum samples from CB- 839 treated mice (n= 6) and control mice (n= 5) were harvested after injection of [5 - 13 C]L-glutamine. 13 C and 1 H MR spectra were acquired and analyzed by integration, multivariate analyzes (PCA and PLS-DA), and univariate analyzes (<b>Student</b> <b>s</b> <b>t-test</b> and Wilcoxon rank sum test). Significantly higher levels of L-glutamine were found in tumor samples treated with CB- 839 than in controls, suggesting that CB- 839 inhibits conversion from L-glutamine to L-glutamate. A previous study of CB- 839 showed no effect on tumor growth in basal-like PDX model MAS 98. 12 when treated with CB- 839. Overall, these results imply that MAS 98. 12 tumors are not dependent on L-glutamine for tumor growth. 13 C-labeled L-glutamate and L-lactate were also observed in the MR spectra of tumor tissue, but no significant differences were found between with CB- 839 treated mice and controls. In serum samples, a significantly higher level of 13 C-labeled L-glutamine was also detected in CB- 839 treated mice compared with controls, suggesting that CB- 839 leads to a decrease in the overall uptake of L-glutamine from the bloodstream to other organs of the mouse...|$|E

Desempenham suas funções junto à equipe de SF visando essencialmente à promoção à saúde. No contexto de trabalho desses profissionais, tem sido possível perceber diversas situações de desgaste, as quais podem gerar comprometimento à qualidade de vida (QV) dos mesmos. Visualizar a dinâmica laboral dos trabalhadores de enfermagem é essencial no planejamento de políticas públicas e sociais que visem ambientes organizacionais mais saudáveis. Este estudo objetivou analisar a relação entre o contexto de trabalho e a QV da equipe de enfermagem da ESF de Uberaba (MG). Trata-se de uma pesquisa quantitativa, seccional, realizada com 92 profissionais de enfermagem, entre maio e agosto de 2012. O projeto foi aprovado pelo Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa em Seres Humanos da UFTM, protocolo nº 2278. Os participantes responderam um instrumento contendo variáveis sociodemográficas, econômicas e de trabalho; outro, para avaliação do contexto de trabalho (ECORT); e outro, para avaliação da QV (WHOQOL- bref). Os dados foram duplamente digitados no programa Microsoft Excel®, e importados ao SPSS, versão 20. 0, para análise. Foram {{realizadas}} análises descritivas de todas as variáveis quantitativas. Para verificar possíveis associações entre as variáveis, foi utilizado o coeficiente de correlação de Pearson (r) para variáveis quantitativas (bivariadas), o coeficiente de correlação de Spearman para as variáveis qualitativas ordinais, o Teste t de Student para amostras independentes e, quando necessário, o teste de Mann-Whitney, como alternativa não paramétrica. Ainda foram realizadas duas regressões lineares múltiplas, tendo o domínio ambiental e o psicológico de QV como desfecho e as variáveis preditoras; sexo, idade, categoria profissional, presença de doença ocupacional e o domínio condições de trabalho da ECORT. Os participantes eram majoritariamente do sexo feminino (94, 6 %), com idade entre 25 e 35 anos (41, 3 %) e tinham companheiro (51, 1 %). Quanto ao perfil profissional, 90, 2 % tinham 5 anos ou 8 mais na profissão; 93, 5 % referiram não possuir doença ocupacional, 76, 1 % referiram não ter faltado ao trabalho ou ter estado de licença e 69, 6 % declararam não ter sofrido acidente ocupacional no último ano. O domínio mais afetado da ECORT foi o de condições de trabalho, sendo que, os itens que mais impactaram negativamente foram referentes ao bem estar dos funcionários, ao barulho e a não existência de política de progressão funcional. O domínio do WHOQOL- bref que apresentou menor escore foi o ambiental (58, 25 pontos). Os enfermeiros apresentaram maiores escores de QV se comparados aos técnicos de enfermagem, para os domínios, físico e ambiental. Os homens apresentaram médias mais altas em todos dos domínios de QV, sendo estatisticamente significante para o domínio ambiental. O grupo com doença ocupacional apresentou pior QV quanto aos domínios físico, psicológico e meio ambiente, ao ser comparado com o grupo sem doença ocupacional. Concluiu-se com os resultados da análise de regressão linear múltipla que, ser mulher, apresentar doença ocupacional e piores condições de trabalho, impactaram negativamente no domínio ambiental de QV; e, ter piores condições de trabalho e presença de doença ocupacional impactaram negativamente o domínio psicológico de QV.

In these professionals working context, it has been possible to notice various exhaustion situations, which may compromise {{their quality of life}} (QOL). The capacity to visualize the labor dynamics of nursing workers is essential to the planning of social and public policies which aim healthier organizational atmospheres. This study aimed to analyze the relation between the working context and QOL of the nursing staff of FHS in Uberaba (MG). It is a quantitative and sectional study carried out with 92 nursing professionals between May and August of 2012. The project has been approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Research on Human Beings from UFTM, protocol number 2278. The participants answered an instrument containing sociodemographic, economic and work variables; one for working context assessment (ECORT); and another one for the QOL assessment (WHOQOL- bref). The data have been double typed on Microsoft Excel®, and imported to SPSS, version 20. 0, for analysis. Descriptive analyses of all quantitative variables were carried out. In order to verify possible associations among the variables, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used for quantitative (bivariate) variables, the Spearman correlation coefficient for the ordinal qualitative variables, the <b>Student</b> <b>s</b> <b>t-test</b> for independent samples and, when necessary, the Mann-Whitney test, as a non-parametric alternative. Two multiple linear regressions were also carried out and had the environmental and the psychological of QOL domain as a conclusion and the predictor variables; sex, age, professional category, presence of occupational disease and the ECORT working conditions domain. Most participants were females (94. 6 %), aged between 25 and 35 (41. 3 %) and had a partner (51. 1 %). Regarding the professional profile, 90. 2 % had been in the field for 5 or more years; 93. 5 % affirmed they do not have occupational disease, 76. 1 % declared they had not skipped work or gotten leave of absence and 69. 6 % declared they had not had occupational accident in the past year. The most affected ECORT domain was working conditions, and the most negatively impacting items were the ones referring to employee welfare, noise and the absence of the functional progression policy. The WHOQOL- bref domain with the lowest score was the environmental (58. 25 points). The nurses presented higher QOL scores when compared with the nurse technicians, for the physical and environmental domains. Men showed higher averages in all QOL domains, which was statistically significant for the environmental domain. The group with occupational disease presented the worst QOL in relation to the physical, psychological and environmental domains, when compared to the group without occupational disease. The conclusion after the results of the multiple linear regression was that, being a woman, presenting occupational disease and worse working conditions, impacted negatively in the QOL environmental domain; and, having worse working conditions and the presence of occupational disease impacted the QOL psychological domain...|$|E

The results showed that a high dose of OT, at 24 hours in non-pregnant female mice (Day 0 group) elevated the hepatic triglycerides, accompanied by hepatoesteatosis and increased plasma ALT and AST. OE was found in them, evidenced by high concentration of DC and MDA. At delivery, the experimental pregnant females did not present any modification of the parameters described in the Day 0 group, evidencing that at 21 days after the administration of a high OT dose, {{the effect of the}} anibiotic was not maintained, a similar result was obtained in the females at the time of weaning.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates a state 2 ̆ 7 s {{economic environment}} subsequent {{to a state}} tax modification for evidence of change in business presence. ^ Sponsors of economically motivated state tax policy initiatives generally adopt a tax reduction program {{in order to improve}} a state 2 ̆ 7 s business climate and to stimulate a state 2 ̆ 7 s economy. The results of previous empirical studies researching the possible linkage between tax reduction and economic stimulation is inconclusive. ^ This dissertation examines the economic period subsequent to New York State 2 ̆ 7 s 1987 tax policy change in order to detect shifts in business presence within New York. Detecting shifts in business presence after a state tax reduction provides evidence of a nexus between tax initiatives and economic stimulation. ^ Time series models were developed to incorporate the economic environment prior to the 1987 tax modification in New York. The specific monthly time series data examined were: employment in non-agriculture, the unemployment rate, and the business activity index. Quarterly income tax collection were also examined as a measure of economic prosperity. ^ Three different research methods were employed to examine the four time series. The three methods were, CuSum chart of quality control, sequential application of the Student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>t-test,</b> and dummy variable multiple regression. ^ The results of the analysis provide some basis for concluding that a linkage between tax reduction and economic stimulation is not as robust as legislators perceive. None of the time series examined exhibited long term improvement. ^ Another implication of this dissertation is that the methods of quality control generate earlier signals as to the ineffectiveness of New York State 2 ̆ 7 s tax modification than either the Student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>t-test</b> or dummy variable multiple regression. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{delineation}} {{of relationships}} between selected personality characteristics and need achievement is a logical area of investigation given the critical importance of motivation in contemporary society. However, little is known {{in regard to the}} personality dimensions which are correlates of need achievement. Females in need achievement research are also a neglected area and females were investigated on an equal basis with males in this study. The subjects were seventy male and seventy-six female adolescents. These students were enrolled in accelerated or Group I sophomore, junior, and senior classes at Dwight D. Eisenhower High School in New Berlin, Wisconsin. All of these students possessed grade-point averages above 3. 0 on a 4. 0 scale. The predictor variables were the seven factor-analytically derived scales of the Thurstone Temperament Schedule. The criterion measure was the Mehrabian Measures of Achieving Tendency [...] 1978 Revision. To determine the relationships between the predictor variables and the criterion, the statistical procedures of stepwise multiple regression and double cross-validation were utilized. Ferguson 2 ̆ 7 s (1971) procedure for evaluating the significance of differences between correlation coefficients was employed along with the Chi-square technique for determining if a relationship exists between the criteria of sex and need achievement. Supplementary analyses were also carried out utilizing factor-analytic procedures and the Student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>t-test.</b> The multiple regression analyses produced statistically significant R 2 ̆ 7 s (p 3 ̆c. 05) for the aggregate or combined population and the male and female subsamples.
