5|$|Contemporary batik is {{not limited}} to {{traditional}} or ritual wearing in Bali. Some designers promote batik Bali as elegant fabric {{that can be used to}} make casual or formal cloth. Using high class batik, like hand made batik tulis, can show <b>social</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even {{footwear}} {{indicated a}} person's <b>social</b> <b>status.</b> Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. The Romans also invented socks for those soldiers required {{to fight on}} the northern frontiers, sometimes worn in sandals.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{has a big}} hip hop scene. This music {{became popular}} during the 1980s. The {{presence}} of a large African and Caribbean community helped to its development, it gave a voice, a political and <b>social</b> <b>status</b> for many minorities.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use of knots was in Norigae, {{traditional}} Korean ornaments worn by women to decorate clothing. Norigae {{were used by}} all ages and <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> to emphasize the beauty of Korean traditional costume, as well as decorate pockets carried separately. Though these knots were used across all <b>social</b> <b>statuses,</b> there were also cases when only specific people were allowed to use them. For example, only high government officials were allowed to use knots for decorating fans.|$|R
50|$|A status set is a {{collection}} of <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> that an individual holds. A person may have status of a daughter, wife, mother, student, worker, church member and a citizen.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of Communist rule in China, the <b>social</b> <b>status</b> of women {{improved}} greatly. Women were empowered to work outside the home. Communist rule also brought {{about the end of}} practices such as foot binding, child marriages, prostitution, and arranged marriages. China has seen a decrease in domestic violence due to government-supported grassroots programs to counter these practices. Women in rural areas remain largely uneducated.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 6 {{looks at}} {{solutions}} to the problem. Cowen praises the development of India and China as producers and consumers, {{the role of the}} internet in enlarging the scientific community, and a growing consensus for the reform of educational policy in the US. He further suggests for the <b>social</b> <b>status</b> of scientists to be raised to at least as strong a motivating factor as money can.|$|E
30|$|Firstly, for the {{operationalization}} of concepts, {{the present}} study assumes an equal relationship between participants’ <b>social</b> class <b>status</b> and that of his/her family’s. Some researchers argue against this approach, but they failed to identify alternatives. At the same time, many {{studies have demonstrated that}} the father’s <b>social</b> class <b>status</b> positively influences the children’s social class status; similarly, the husband’s <b>social</b> class <b>status</b> is positively associated with the wife’s <b>social</b> class <b>status</b> (Zhang 2003). This research identifies participants’ <b>social</b> class <b>status</b> through a series of individual data points, such as owning a property (e.g. {{whether or not they are}} business owners), the extent to which one’s job required skill, and the degree of power domination at the workplace, and further classifies participants into business owners, new middle class, old middle class, working class, and peasants.|$|R
50|$|A further {{focal point}} of the Centre’s work is human rights {{education}} and facilitating dialogue between people from different backgrounds, <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> and lifestyles. Additionally, they offer seminars, training courses and projects on related topics.|$|R
50|$|The 'March' {{debate was}} seen by Mary Dorothy George as a public {{reflection}} {{of the changes in}} British society associated with industrialisation, democracy and shifting <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> - changes welcomed by some and not by others.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the high}} value placed on works of art, even famous artists were of low <b>social</b> <b>status</b> among the Greeks and Romans, who {{regarded}} artists, artisans, and craftsmen alike as manual labourers. At the same time, {{the level of}} skill required to produce quality work was recognized, and even considered a divine gift.|$|E
5|$|Following {{closely in}} the {{footsteps}} of Sir Walter Scott, the novel uses its truthful historical backdrop to tell a fictional story of people who sculpted the past. The novel addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful trickery, and <b>social</b> <b>status.</b> While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's later work, the novel marks a turning point in his life and artistry.|$|E
5|$|Francis Walsingham matriculated at King's College, Cambridge, in 1548 {{with many}} other Protestants but as an {{undergraduate}} of high <b>social</b> <b>status</b> did not sit for a degree. From 1550 or 1551, he travelled in continental Europe, returning to England by 1552 to enrol at Gray's Inn, one of the qualifying bodies for English lawyers.|$|E
25|$|Passed a Village Ordinance, {{resulting}} in the Company not sanctioning the authority and traditional social position {{of a large number}} of traditional elites and local chiefs. This consequently alienated them and undermined their roles and <b>social</b> <b>statuses.</b>|$|R
50|$|This is {{the meaning}} that the roles of and {{relationships}} among participants give {{to the understanding of}} the text. These relationships may be permanent or temporary. The contribution to meaning by <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> of the participants also fall within this feature.|$|R
5000|$|... the {{relatively}} primitive social milieu of the New World. He faced unfamiliar and challenging social institutions: the labor system that relied on black slaves, extraordinarily fluid <b>social</b> <b>statuses,</b> distasteful business methods, unpleasant conversational quirks, {{as well as}} variant habits of dress, food, and drink.|$|R
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan scored {{their first}} {{international}} hit with H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), satirising {{the rise of}} unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with <b>social</b> <b>status</b> (building on a theme introduced in The Sorcerer, love between members of different social classes). As {{with many of the}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically {{near the end of the}} story.|$|E
5|$|Leighton Meester, who {{portrayed the}} {{character}} in the television drama, has described Blair as being insecure about her <b>social</b> <b>status.</b> At times, this anxiety creates flaws and complexities which contribute to character development. In Meester's view, the true Blair is ultimately a good girl at heart.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have often}} {{connected}} {{the notion of}} karma to the determinism in the caste system in India. Just like {{in the case of}} karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social differences to stay unchanged. This would be the case when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate. Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve <b>social</b> <b>status</b> in the present, {{as in the case of}} someone ordaining as a monk for a few years. And vice versa, if someone's <b>social</b> <b>status</b> quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out. Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and demerit. In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a motivator in trying to improve the situation through merit-making. Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, the earned value gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by <b>social</b> <b>status</b> at birth.|$|E
50|$|His {{leadership}} style was non-hierarchical. He believed {{in listening to}} all employees {{no matter what their}} ranks or <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> were. He also believed in letting his employees take risks to innovate. Moreover, he believed business needed to be conducted discreetly and stressed the need for confidentiality.|$|R
50|$|In many romantic comedies, the {{potential}} couple comprises polar opposites, two {{people of different}} temperaments, situations, <b>social</b> <b>statuses,</b> or all three (It Happened One Night), who would not meet or talk under normal circumstances, and the meet cute's contrived situation provides the opportunity for these two people to meet.|$|R
50|$|As in {{mainland}} Japan, historical names in Okinawa are more complicated. People with different <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> bore {{different kinds of}} names, maintained several names to use in different occasions, and sometimes changed them in their lifetime. Okinawan names underwent great changes after the Ryūkyū Kingdom fell under the Satsuma Domains control.|$|R
5|$|Shama was {{uncertain}} about {{the identity of}} Kanhopatra's father, but suspected {{that it was the}} town's head-man Sadashiva Malagujar. Kanhopatra spent her childhood in the palatial house of her mother, served by several maids, but because of her mother's profession, Kanhopatra's <b>social</b> <b>status</b> was demeaningly low.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{takes place}} during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought {{profound}} changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher <b>social</b> <b>status</b> is a major theme in the book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters– especially young Rastignac, {{who grew up in}} the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.|$|E
5|$|The twenty men who {{composed}} the initial council were {{of different ages}} (the youngest was 25; the oldest 66), <b>social</b> <b>status,</b> professions, and political affiliations. There were eight lawyers, four priests, three agronomists, two financiers, a doctor, a publisher, and an engineer. Eight of the members were Christian democrats and seven were not affiliated. All except one had gained degrees in tertiary education. The council's last surviving member, Aleksandras Stulginskis, died in September 1969.|$|E
50|$|Other historians {{assert that}} while Chaucer was on {{mainland}} Europe in 1372-73 {{and it could}} have been possible that he met Petrarch or Boccaccio, it is unlikely because of their different <b>social</b> <b>statuses.</b> Most however, agree, that whether Chaucer ever met Petrarch or Boccaccio, he was heavily influenced by their works.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{socio-cultural}} cognitive literacy predictors {{for reading}} literacy (RL), tested in 314 fourth graders {{from two different}} levels of <b>social</b> economic <b>status</b> in Lima, Peru. The following variables were tested as predictors: word decoding, vocabulary, motivation to read, reading strategies, intellectual maturity, gender, home literacy climate and <b>social</b> economic <b>status.</b> RL (reading literacy) was measured using an adapted version of the PIRLS Reading Literacy test. By using structural equation modelling, a total of 34 {{percent of the variance}} in RL could be explained. In addition to word decoding and vocabulary, motivation and <b>social</b> economic <b>status</b> were discovered to be directly predictive of RL. Furthermore, <b>social</b> economic <b>status</b> and home literacy climate were discovered to be important factors in determining the variation in other predictor variables. Intellectual maturity and gender did not appear to be significant factors contributing to RL level...|$|R
5000|$|All of José’s five {{novels are}} in set in Rosales, Pangasinan in Luzon, Philippines. José uses a {{variation}} of styles for the novels.

5|$|There are {{two phases}} for P. rebeli {{complete}} {{integration into the}} Myrmica schencki ant colony: initial integration and full integration. In both stages of integration, the P. rebeli caterpillar is brought into the brood nest; however, in full integration, the P. rebeli also achieves its high <b>social</b> <b>status</b> within the host society. That status is crucial for surviving periods of host colony stress such as food shortage.|$|E
5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher <b>social</b> <b>status,</b> despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E
5|$|Aburish {{asserts that}} Nasser was not distressed by his {{frequent}} relocations, which broadened his horizons {{and showed him}} Egyptian society's class divisions. His own <b>social</b> <b>status</b> was well below the wealthy Egyptian elite, and his discontent with those born into wealth and power grew throughout his lifetime. Nasser {{spent most of his}} spare time reading, particularly in 1933 when he lived near the National Library of Egypt. He read the Qur'an, the sayings of Muhammad, the lives of the Sahaba (Muhammad's companions), and the biographies of nationalist leaders Napoleon, Atatürk, Otto von Bismarck, and Garibaldi and the autobiography of Winston Churchill.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{study by}} M. Keels, it was {{determined}} that when low-income families are moved from poor neighborhoods to suburban neighborhoods, there are reductions in delinquency in children. [...] When comparing different <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> of families, the environment of a neighborhood turns out to be major factor in contributing to the growth of a child.|$|R
40|$|For modern {{societies}} {{the importance}} of education has increased so much that it has itself become one of the great topics of our time. Education is a complex phenomenon that can be observed from different angles and aspects. The evolution of education changed from insufficiently institutionaluzed forms of exclusion to large membership of marginal importance for <b>social</b> roles and <b>statuses,</b> and to its direct and decisive influence on the distribution of social roles, on acquiring <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> and, in this context, on modernizing of the society...|$|R
25|$|Structure 4 is Chalcatzingo’s largest structure, an almost-square {{platform}} measuring approximately 70m (230ft) on each side. Burials of high-status {{individuals have}} been excavated here, with jade ornaments and a magnetite (iron ore) mirror. Most of the village's burials were located under the floors of houses—individuals representing the whole variety of <b>social</b> <b>statuses</b> were buried this way.|$|R
