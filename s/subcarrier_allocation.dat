In the first one, known as the block <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme, each user is assigned a block of adjacent subcarriers whereas in the second one, known as interleaved <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme, the total subcarriers are uniformly interleaved across all users. In this study, and since {{we are dealing with}} ICI, we consider the interleaved <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme because {{it is well known that}} this scheme suffers more from ICI compared to the block <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme [18].|$|E

40|$|Multiuser Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (MU-OFDM) {{is one of}} the promising techniques for future cellular and wireless networks for achieving high downlink capacities. The objective of the next generation cellular and wireless networks, which are based on (MU-OFDM) is to increase the network efficiency by maximizing the total throughput of the system and minimizing the overall transmit power for a given quality of service (QOS). The sum capacity of MU-OFDM is maximized when each subchannel is assigned to the user with the best channel-tonoise ratio for that subchannel. Ever increasing demand for high throughput, low delay and low Outage probability can be met by using Adaptive Resource Allocation in OFDM Technology. In optimal resource allocation algorithms the subcarrier and power allocation should be done simultaneously but it is computationally complex. In order to reduce the complexity of resource allocation algorithms the subcarrier and power allocation is done separately and this is called sub-optimal <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> and sub-optimal power allocation. Z. Shen et al. in [9] has given both suboptimal <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> and sub-optimal power allocation algorithms. In this paper we have proposed two methods of <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> based on <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> method in [9], and compared them with <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> algorithm of [9]. Comparison is made between <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> algorithms only by considering equal power distribution among subcarriers instead of sub-optimal power allocation scheme given in [9]. The simulation results show the improvement in the sum capacity (total data rate achieved) with the proposed methods of <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> over the <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> in [9].

40|$|For {{orthogonal}} {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM), resource scheduling {{plays an important}} role. In resource scheduling, power allocation and <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> are not independent. So the conventional two-step method is not very good for OFDM resource allocation. This paper proposes a new method for OFDM resource allocation. This method combines evolutionary algorithm (EA) with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions (KKT conditions). In the optimizing process, a set of <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> programs are made as a population of evolutionary algorithm. For each <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> program, a power allocation program is calculated through KKT conditions. Then, the system rate of each <b>subcarrier</b> <b>allocation</b> program can be calculated. The fitness of each individual is its system rate. The information of optimizing subcarrier and power allocation can be interacted with each other. So, it can overcome the shortcoming of the two-step method.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a joint {{resource}} allocation problem is studied in a multi-service Single Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) wireless network. Mobile users request various services with different Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics and they determine in a distributed and non-cooperative manner a joint <b>subcarrier</b> and power <b>allocation</b> towards fulfilling their QoS prerequisites. Initially, a well-designed utility function is formulated to appropriately represent users’ diverse QoS prerequisites {{with respect to}} their requested service. The <b>subcarriers</b> <b>allocation</b> problem is solved based on a multilateral bargaining model, where users are able to select different discount factors to enter the bargaining game, thus better expressing their different needs in system resources {{with respect to their}} requested service. The subcarriers mapping is realized based either on the localized SC-FDMA method where the subcarriers are sequentially allocated to the users or the distributed SC-FDMA via considering the maximum channel gain policy, where each subcarrier is allocated to the user with the maximum channel gain. Given the subcarriers assignment, an optimization problem with respect to users’ uplink transmission power is formulated and solved, {{in order to determine the}} optimal power <b>allocation</b> per <b>subcarrier</b> assigned to each user.
