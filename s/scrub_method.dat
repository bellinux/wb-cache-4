Deuterated climbazole {{was used as the}} internal standard. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in positive mode was applied for the detection of climbazole. For quantification, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transition 293. 0 > 69. 0 was monitored for climbazole, and MRM transition 296. 0 > 225. 1 for the deuterated climbazole. The linear range ran from 4 to 2000 ng mL(- 1). The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 1 ng mL(- 1) and 4 ng mL(- 1), respectively, which enabled quantification of climbazole on artificial skin and human scalp at ppb level (corresponding to 16 ng cm(- 2)). For the sampling of climbazole from human scalp the buffer <b>scrub</b> <b>method</b> using a surfactant-modified phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution was selected based on a performance comparison of tape stripping, the buffer <b>scrub</b> <b>method</b> and solvent extraction in in vitro studies.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} the waterless hand washing method for surgical anti-sepsis, we conducted a microbial sampling study, comparing it to a conventional surgical <b>scrub</b> <b>method.</b> A total of 18 operating-room nurses were undertaking the following three-hand washing protocols : scrubbing with blushes using 4 w/v% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and also rubbing with CHG, followed by application of a 0. 2 w/v% CHG with ethanol (HS) preparation. (conventional method); rubbing with CHG and application of HS (two-stage surgical scrub method; TSS); rubbing with anti-septic soap and application of HS (waterless method; WL). Microbial sampling was conducted after hand washing using the glove juice method. No statistically significant differences in bacterial numbers were found among these three methods. The number of bacterially positive subjects was significantly higher in the conventional method than the TSS method. These results indicate that there are adverse effects of blush-scrubbing, as the detected bacteria were related to normal skin flora. As such, the WL method for hand anti-sepsis appears to be equivalent to the conventional surgical scrubbing method in terms of microbial detection. The WL method should therefore be introduced as a standard hand anti-sepsis method at the time of surgery because it is cost-effective as well as time-efficient...|$|E

The surgery team members who are in contact with the tissue sections under surgery when doing surgical operations play a significant and substantial role in preventing and controlling the infections through observing the rules and regulations of the infection control in the surgery rooms. The current study has been undertaken for the purpose of determining the surgery room personnel performance regarding the observation of the infection control principles in Jahrom’s training hospital surgery rooms. the current is a descriptive-analytical study of the cross-sectional type which has been conducted in 2011 in Jahrom’s medical sciences university. The total number of 80 individuals from the surgery room personnel participated in the current study. The data collection tool was a checklist which recorded the surgery room personnel’s performance regarding the observation of the infection control in three times in a day through invisible supervision and then according to the scores obtained for each of the personnel their performances were classified in four levels of weak, medium, good and very good. The data gathered through this method was analyzed by SPSS and the statistical tests such as CH-Square tests and Fischer’s exact test. {{the results of the study}} indicated that some of the principles of controlling infection in Jahrom’s treatment and training centers surgery rooms are not practiced by the study population and that it has also been found out that the surgery room technicians’ performance is better and the surgeons’ performance is weaker than the others. Besides, the surgery team performance considering the observation of the scrubbing principles is their weakest point in their overall performances. since the results obtained by the author of the current study is indicative of the idea that the study participants are not attentive to some of the infection control principles in the surgery rooms, thus it is suggested that there is a need for in-service training courses, getting the infection control-prevention committees more actively participating and exerting supervisory mechanisms in the surgery rooms and also the use of the new antiseptic materials for surgery room scrubbings, and also it is suggested that the common and traditional <b>scrubbing</b> <b>methods</b> should be replaced by new <b>scrubbing</b> <b>methods.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} sustainable process for simultaneous removal of waste gases such as NO, NO 2, and SO 2 by an electrochemically generated Ag(I) /Ag(II) redox mediator system. High removal efficiency was achieved for NO and SO 2 by the wet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>method</b> at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This removal is achieved through oxidation and absorption by contacting the gaseous stream with redox mediator ions that offer specific or selective solubility for the solute gases to be recovered in a wet scrubber. The process parameters such as gas velocity, liquid velocity, Ag(I) concentration, and HNO 3 concentration were investigated to explore the possibility of complete removal of waste gases. The Ag(I) /Ag(II) -based mediated electrochemical oxidation process proved to be quite effective for simultaneous removal of NO, NOx, and SO 2 from the simulated flue gas mixtures containing NO and SO 2 over a wide concentration range of 100 - 400 ppm.

The traditional water <b>scrubbing</b> <b>method</b> suffers from high energy consumption due to the concentrated NH 3 from aqueous ammonia. Therefore, it is desirable to develop novel absorbents for the efficient, reversible and environmentally-friendly recovery of NH 3. In this paper, a series of hydroxyl-functionalized imidazolium ILs ([EtOHmim]X, X = [NTf 2], [PF 6], [BF 4], [DCA], [SCN] and [NO 3]) were designed and prepared. Their physical properties and NH 3 absorption capacities under different temperatures and pressures were systematically investigated. The effects of hydroxyl cation, anionic structures, pressure and temperature on absorption performance were sufficiently studied. In addition, the absorption mechanism was investigated in detail by spectral analysis and quantum chemistry calculations. Compared with conventional IL [Emim] X, a higher absorption capacity was achieved by introducing the hydroxyl group on the imidazolium cation. The mechanism results showed the fascinating absorption performance of the task-specific ILs was attributed to the stronger hydrogen bonding interaction between NH 3 and the H atom of the hydroxyl group. Considering the excellent absorption performance, high thermal stability, and super reversibility, this type of IL provides great improvement over conventional IL and shows their enormous potential in NH 3 recovery. </p...|$|R
30|$|At present, the {{implementation}} of stringent regulations of NOx emission requires {{the development of new}} technologies and improvement of currently used methods for NOx removal from exhaust gas. Effective reduction of NOx emissions from both stationary and mobile sources poses a major challenge. Technologies for the NOx removal can be divided into combustion control and post-combustion treatment. Combustion control aims at reducing the formation of NOx during the combustion of fossil fuel (Adewuyi et al. 1999). Post-combustion control methods include a variety of techniques such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) (Zhang et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2015), selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) (Lee et al. 2008), thermal DeNOx and scrubbing. SCR can remove NOx with an efficiency of 80 – 95  % and it has been applied in power plants extensively. Up to date, SCR is also considered {{as one of the most}} promising techniques for ocean-going ships. But it requires additional space, high investment and operating cost. Another major concern of SCR is the deleterious effect of SO 2 -laden flue gas on the life of catalyst which is an important factor of this technology’s cost. SNCR approach requires high reaction temperature (900 – 1000  °C) with an elaborate temperature control to avoid ammonia slip and to achieve effective NOx removal. <b>Scrubbing</b> <b>method</b> is one of the advanced air pollution control technologies. It has the ability of removing other acid gases and particulates simultaneously (Makansi 1990).|$|R

Methods: In this interventional study, 52 patients who were supposed to undergo oph-thalmology surgery using local anesthesia were studied. Patients were randomly as-signed to two groups of intervention, who received hand massage before surgery (n = 27) and control (n = 25). Massaging lasted for 5 minutes (2. 5 minutes on each hand) before surgery. Stroking and <b>scrubbing</b> <b>methods</b> were performed by 2 trained research-ers. Anxiety level, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were measured before and after the intervention in both groups. Anxiety was evaluated using Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.

Cyclic voltammetric studies of the reduction of MNNG in acidic media showed three reduction waves. The first reduction step was assigned to be the reduction of the nitroso group and the second and third steps the reduction of the nitro group. The second peak was selected for the analysis as it was found to give a constant high current at pH below 1 and it was stable up to 40 days under normal daylight exposure and bubbling air at slow flow rate. Optimised parameters for the sensitive differential pulse polarographic technique were determined and the sampling conditions were investigated. The standard addition method was used to reduce the marix interference and the peak current was measured by the difference of current before and after UV irradiation so as to eliminate the interference caused by trace metals and electroactive and UV stable organic compounds present in air.

40|$|Abstract. The {{dependence}} of human being {{on fossil fuels}} has decreased significantly the conventional energy resources. To overcome this problem it is required alternative substitute fuels which are cheap and accessible which biogas {{is one of the}} fuels. Nevertheless, the use of biogas has not yet been maximized because of the low calorific value which is produced from the process without purification. The circulated water absorption method is one mean of effective biogas purification. Under this method it is expected to increase the level of methane (CH 4) and to reduce both the level of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). In order to obtain the aim, the research was carried out under variations of water and biogas volumetric flow rate. The results show that the highest quality of biogas produced was under the variation of water volumetric flow rate of 15 lt/min with biogas volumetric flow rate of 1 lt/min which increased the level of methane (CH 4) from 59. 36 % to 62. 8 % and decreased the carbon dioxide (CO 2) content from 33. 53 % to 26. 8 %, and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) from 208. 33 to 86 ppm. Lower biogas and water volumetric rates allowed longer contact between biogas molecule and absorbent. This resulted in an opportunity for absorbent more active to dissolve carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in biogas. These compounds then flowed outward of the scrubbing unit along with the absorbent. The research proved that the raw biogas purification by circulated water <b>scrubbing</b> <b>method</b> was an effective mean in enhancing the quality of biogas...|$|R

Bags of hydrated lime placed {{inside the room}} will supplement existing <b>scrubbing</b> <b>methods</b> or a dedicated lime scrubber {{may be used for}} CO 2 regulation during the storage period. The amount of lime needed depends on the length of the storage period, the apple variety, storage temperature, atmosphere composition and use of Nitrogen generators, etc. In the past, lime use was based on a half pound of lime per bushel of apples for a three-month storage period. This works out to be 10 fifty-pound bags per 1, 000 bushels of fruit. The exact amount needed for a specific set of storage conditions will need to be determined from experience. Either “chemical ” or “agricultural” hydrated lime can be used. Each type is suitable if it is fresh, high in calcium, and of adequate fineness. Particle size is indicated on the bag; at least 95 percent should pass a 100 -mesh sieve. Chemical grade is usually finer and more expensive than agricultural grade. “High calcium ” hydrate is more reactive than lime containing large amounts of magnesium. The calcium and magnesium content is stated on the bag in terms of percent calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO) contained in the original limestone. For efficient CO 2 removal, the assay should show “ 70 % to 75 % CaO ” and “less than 2 % MgO. ” Only fresh hydrated lime is effective in removing carbon dioxide, and lime will gradually loose its freshness over time because it continuously absorbs CO 2 from the air.

Hard disk drives that fit in current personal computers {{have the capacity}} that requires tons of transistors to achieve in 1970 s. Today, {{we are at the}} beginning of the era of non-volatile memory (NVM). NVMs provide excellent performance such as random access, high I/O speed, low power consumption, and so on. The storage density of NVMs keeps increasing following Moore?s law. However, higher storage density also brings significant data reliability issues. When chip geometries scale down, memory cells (e. g. transistors) are aligned much closer to each other, and noise in the devices will become no longer negligible. Consequently, data will be more prone to errors and devices will have much shorter longevity. This dissertation focuses on mitigating the reliability and the endurance issues for two major NVMs, namely, NAND flash memory and phase-change memory (PCM). Our main research tools include a set of coding techniques for the communication channels implied by flash memory and PCM. To approach the problems, at bit level we design error correcting codes tailored for the asymmetric errors in flash and PCM, we propose joint coding scheme for endurance and reliability, error <b>scrubbing</b> <b>methods</b> for controlling storage channel quality, and study codes that are inherently resisting to typical errors in flash and PCM; at higher levels, we are interested in analyzing the structures and the meanings of the stored data, and propose methods that pass such metadata to help further improve the coding performance at bit level. The highlights of this dissertation include the first set of write-once memory code constructions which correct a significant number of errors, a practical framework which corrects errors utilizing the redundancies in texts, the first report of the performance of polar codes for flash memories, and the emulation of rank modulation codes in NAND flash chips...|$|R

Consequently, a technology review has been conducted to identify and compare applicable off-gas processing alternatives should NO, emission abatement be required. Denitrification processes can be separated into two distinct categories, wet or dry, depending upon whether or not NO{sub x} is absorbed into an aqueous solution. The dry methods of removal are generally more efficient (> 90 %) than wet scrubbing approaches (> 60 %); however, most dry approaches are applicable only to NO,. Of the dry removal methods, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) using NH 3 reductant and a hydrogen zeolite catalyst appears to be the most suitable technology for reducing HWVP NO{sub x} emissions should emission abatement be required. SCR is a relatively simple, well established technology that produces no secondary waste stream and is applicable {{to a wide range of}} NO{sub x} concentrations (500 to 30, 000 ppm).

Unlike dry NO, <b>scrubbing</b> <b>methods,</b> the wet techniques are not specific to NO{sub x}, so they may support the process in more than one way.

To select an effective cleaning method the three essential factors to be considered such as cleaning chemistry, the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>method</b> and other process parameters. This study investigates the effectiveness of brush cleaning, ultrasonic cleaning and combination of brush and ultrasonic cleaning on removal of contamination, surface defects and brush life time. In this study, the cleaning efficiency was compared for the parts cleaned with ultrasonics, nylon brush, Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) brush and combination of ultrasonics and nylon brush. The life time of brush was studied for both nylon and PVA brush. The techniques used to identify the contamination are SEM, EDX and optical microscope. The microscopic result indicates that the removal efficiency was high for the parts cleaned with ultrasonics (90. 5 %) and PVA brush (90. 2 %) as compared to Nylon brush (77. 4 %). This {{is due to the fact}} that for PVA brush the fluid was being pumped in and out of brush pores (during compression and elastic recovery of the brush), carries the contamination away from the surface and also the contact area between the contamination surface and brush was more. From Liquid Particle Count (LPC) analysis, the > 0. 3 mic particle counts is almost two times lower for parts cleaned with ultrasonics as compared to parts cleaned with brushes. This indicates that 58 / 132 kHz washing followed by 470 kHz DI rinsing effectively removes sub- micron particles from the surface compared to brush cleaning. The defects caused by brushes on the surface of the slider bar is almost 1 % for nylon brush cleaning, 0. 4 % for PVA brush cleaning and 0 % for ultrasonic cleaning. From experimental study, it can be seen that the life time of PVA brush was shorter than Nylon brush by 75 times. The contamination increased after 50 th run for PVA brush and after 700 th run for nylon brush. This is due to the fact that after brush damage (after 50 th run for PVA and 700 th run for nylon) the brush can not effectively remove the contamination and also re-deposition of contamination from brush...|$|R

This creates a great deal of crystalline silica- containing dust in a confined space and is extremely hazardous to the drill operators. As high as 2000 times the threshold limit value has been measured in previous studies, and some drill operators contracted silicosis within 1 year. An in situ dust removal system, using wet <b>scrubbing</b> and ventilation <b>methods,</b> was designed, fabricated, and field tested and proved to be effective in removing up to 98 percent of the dust generated in a 1 -m diameter caisson...|$|R

The physical methods include containment, dilution, combustion, adsorption, activated carbon, sand, soil, compost beds, oxygen injection, masking agents and wet scrubbers. The chemical methods include chemical oxidation, catalytic filtration, chemical adsorption, catalytic combustion, electrochemical treatment, nitrate dosing, and chemical <b>scrubbing.</b> Biological <b>methods</b> include trickling filters, aeration tanks, stripping towers, sulphur oxidising bacteria, anaerobic biological reduction and lagoons. Thermal methods are thermal conditioning, incineration and flares. The research included: • A review of available information on sulphide removal and treatment. • A review of all methods for sulphide removal to determine effectiveness, applicability and removal efficiency. • A review current of experiences in Ireland with sulphide abatement including three site visits. • Selection of a method for trial at Aughinish Alumina to abatement sulphide emissions from an industrial effluent treatment process. • Review of trial results {{with a view to}} installation of permanent system. The trial consisted of the installation of a Bio-reactor which cultured bacteria specific to the treatment of sulphide in wastewaters with low organic content and resistant to pH variations.

40|$|Abstract Background Scrub typhus is a mite-borne {{bacterial}} infection of humans caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi that causes a generalized vasculitis that may involve the tissues of any organ system. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify factors associated to severe complications from <b>scrub</b> typhus. <b>Methods</b> We conducted this prospective, case-control study on scrub typhus patients who presented to the Department of Internal Medicine at Chosun University Hospital between September, 2004 and December, 2006. Cases were 89 scrub typhus patients with severe complications and controls were 119 scrub typhus patients without severe complications. Results There were significant differences in the absence of eschar, white blood cell (WBC) counts, hemoglobin, albumin, serum creatinine, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and active partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) between the two groups. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only the following four factors were significantly associated with the severe complications of scrub typhus: (1) age ≥ 60 years (odd ratio [OR] = 3. 13, P = 0. 002, confidence interval [CI] = 1. 53 - 6. 41), (2) the absence of eschar (OR = 6. 62, P = 0. 03, CI = 1. 22 - 35. 8, (3) WBC counts > 10, 000 /mm 3 (OR = 3. 6, P = 0. 001, CI = 1. 65 - 7. 89), and (4) albumin ≤ 3. 0 g/dL (OR = 5. 01, P = 0. 004, CI = 1. 69 - 14. 86). Conclusions Our results suggest that clinicians should be aware of the potential for complications, when scrub typhus patients are older (≥ 60 years), presents without eschar, or laboratory findings such as WBC counts > 10, 000 /mm 3, and serum albumin level ≤ 3. 0 g/dL. Close observation and intensive care for scrub typhus patients with the potential for complications may prevent serious complications with subsequent reduction in its mortality rate. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} in-scanner head {{movement}} on functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) signals has long been established as undesirable. These effects have been traditionally corrected by methods such as linear regression of head movement parameters. However, a number of recent independent studies have demonstrated that these techniques are insufficient to remove motion confounds, and that even small movements can spuriously bias estimates of functional connectivity. Here we propose a new data-driven, spatially-adaptive, wavelet-based method for identifying, modeling, and removing non-stationary events in fMRI time series, caused by head movement, without the need for data <b>scrubbing.</b> This <b>method</b> involves the addition of just one extra step, the Wavelet Despike, in standard pre-processing pipelines. With this method, we demonstrate robust removal of a range of different motion artifacts and motion-related biases including distance-dependent connectivity artifacts, at a group and single-subject level, using a range of previously published and new diagnostic measures. The Wavelet Despike is able to accommodate the substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity of motion artifacts and can consequently remove a range of high and low frequency artifacts from fMRI time series, that may be linearly or non-linearly related to physical movements. Our methods are demonstrated by the analysis of three cohorts of resting-state fMRI data, including two high-motion datasets: a previously published dataset on children (N= 22) and a new dataset on adults with stimulant drug dependence (N= 40). We conclude that there is a real risk of motion-related bias in connectivity analysis of fMRI data, but that this risk is generally manageable, by effective time series denoising strategies designed to attenuate synchronized signal transients induced by abrupt head movements.

40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) {{involvement}} is a known complication of scrub typhus {{which range from}} mild meningitis to frank meninigoencephalitis. Aims and objectives: To study the clinical feature, laboratory parameters and response to treatment of <b>scrub</b> typhus meningitis/meningoencephalitis. <b>Methods</b> and Materials: This is a hospital based prospective observational study from North Eastern India. Diagnosis was based on clinical features and positive serological test (Weil's Felix test and IgM antibody card test). Results: 13 patients of scrub typhus with features of meningitis/meningoencephalitis were included. The mean duration of fever before presentation was 5. 61 ± 3. 08 days and 4 (30. 76 %) patients had eschar. Altered sensorium, headache, seizure and meningeal sign were present in 13 (100 %), 13 (100 %), 6 (46. 15 %) and 10 (76. 92 %) patients respectively. Mean CSF protein, glucose and Adenosine deaminase was 152. 16 ± 16. 88 mg/dl, 55. 23 ± 21. 7 mg/dl, and 16. 98 ± 7. 37 U/L respectively. Mean total count of CSF leukocyte and lymphocyte percentage was 46. 07 ± 131 cell/cumm and 98. 66 ± 3. 09 % respectively. Tablet doxycycline with or without injection azithromycin was used and that shows good response 15. 38 % of patients died {{and all of them}} had multi organ dysfunction.

40|$|Background Fungal endophytes inhabit symptomless, living {{tissues of}} all major plant {{lineages}} to form one of earth’s most prevalent groups of symbionts. Many reproduce from senesced and/or decomposing leaves and can produce extracellular leaf-degrading enzymes, blurring {{the line between}} symbiotrophy and saprotrophy. To better understand the endophyte–saprotroph continuum we compared fungal communities and functional traits of focal strains isolated from living leaves to those isolated from leaves after senescence and decomposition, {{with a focus on}} foliage of woody plants in five biogeographic provinces ranging from tundra to subtropical <b>scrub</b> forest. <b>Methods</b> We cultured fungi from the interior of surface-sterilized leaves that were living at the time of sampling (i. e., endophytes), leaves that were dead and were retained in plant canopies (dead leaf fungi, DLF), and fallen leaves (leaf litter fungi, LLF) from 3 – 4 species of woody plants in each of five sites in North America. Our sampling encompassed 18 plant species representing two families of Pinophyta and five families of Angiospermae. Diversity and composition of fungal communities within and among leaf life stages, hosts, and sites were compared using ITS-partial LSU rDNA data. We evaluated substrate use and enzyme activity by a subset of fungi isolated only from living tissues vs. fungi isolated only from non-living leaves. Results Across the diverse biomes and plant taxa surveyed here, culturable fungi from living leaves were isolated less frequently and were less diverse than those isolated from non-living leaves. Fungal communities in living leaves also differed detectably in composition from communities in dead leaves and leaf litter within focal sites and host taxa, regardless of differential weighting of rare and abundant fungi. All focal isolates grew on cellulose, lignin, and pectin as sole carbon sources, but none displayed ligninolytic or pectinolytic activity in vitro. Cellulolytic activity differed among fungal classes. Within Dothideomycetes, activity differed significantly between fungi from living vs. non-living leaves, but such differences were not observed in Sordariomycetes. Discussion Although some fungi with endophytic life stages clearly persist for periods of time in leaves after senescence and incorporation into leaf litter, our sampling across diverse biomes and host lineages detected consistent differences between fungal assemblages in living vs. non-living leaves, reflecting incursion by fungi from the leaf exterior after leaf death and as leaves begin to decompose. However, fungi found only in living leaves do not differ consistently in cellulolytic activity from those fungi detected thus far only in dead leaves. Future analyses should consider Basidiomycota in addition to the Ascomycota fungi evaluated here, and should explore more dimensions of functional traits and persistence to further define the endophytism-to-saprotrophy continuum...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} series of studies relating to pad-wafer and brush-wafer contact characterization in planarization and post-planarization processes. These are also evaluated with the purposes of minimizing environmental impact and reducting cost of ownership. Firstly, a new method using spectral analysis based on real-time raw friction data is developed to quantify the total amount of mechanical interaction in the brush-fluid-wafer interface in terms of stick-slip phenomena in post-planarization <b>scrubbing.</b> This new <b>method</b> is remarkable from the standpoint of its potential to eliminate having to perform a multitude of experiments needed for constructing and interpreting Stribeck curves, and its application to processes where Stribeck curves fail to yield any useful data. Moreover, this method is applied to investigate the effect of brush roller design on scrubbing process and to analyze behaviors of eccentric brushes. In order to study pad-wafer contact in planarization processes, a mechanical characterization method (incremental loading test) is developed and applied to analyze different types of pads and pad surfaces subjected to various treatments. Along with optical interferometry and theoretical analysis, flow resistance due to pad land area topography can be estimated. The greatest contribution of this dissertation involves development of real pad-wafer contact area measurement technique using confocal microscopy. The real pad-wafer contact area is a difficult property to measure in planarization, yet it is a key feature to further understand the process. A custom-made sample holder with a sapphire window and a miniature load cell is used to collect confocal images at controlled values of down force. At last, the two newly developed techniques (incremental loading test and real pad-wafer contact area measurement using confocal microscopy) together with dual emission UV enhanced fluorescence imaging are utilized to investigate conditioning effects in planarization process...|$|R
