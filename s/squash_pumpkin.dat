5|$|Cucurbita (Latin for gourd) is a genus of {{herbaceous}} vines in {{the gourd}} family, Cucurbitaceae, {{also known as}} cucurbits, native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five species are grown worldwide for their edible fruit, variously known as <b>squash,</b> <b>pumpkin,</b> or gourd depending on species, variety, and local parlance, and for their seeds. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria, {{which is in the}} same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe. These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels, and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} an {{important}} pollinator of cultivated crops of <b>squash,</b> <b>pumpkins,</b> and related plants. A squash field with a healthy population of squash bees can be completely pollinated with {{no need for the}} introduction of honeybees. This ground-nesting bee often spends its entire life in an irrigated crop field, and there it can face a number of hazards, such as tillage and pesticides. The bumblebee Bombus impatiens has also been found to be a good pollinator of <b>squash,</b> <b>pumpkins</b> in particular.|$|R

Specifically, the Cucurbitaceae (gourd family) include some food species, such as <b>squash,</b> <b>pumpkin</b> (both from Cucurbita), watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris), and cucumber and melons (Cucumis).

50|$|Southeastern Native American {{culture has}} formed the {{cornerstone}} of Southern cuisine from its origins till the present day. From Southeastern Native American culture came {{one of the main}} staples of the Southern diet: corn (maize), either ground into meal or limed with an alkaline salt to make hominy, using a Native American technology known as nixtamalization. Corn was used to make all kinds of dishes from the familiar cornbread and grits to liquors such as whiskey, which were important trade items. Though a lesser staple, potatoes were also adopted from Native American cuisine and were used in many ways similar to corn.Native Americans introduced the first non-Native American Southerners to many other vegetables still familiar on southern tables. <b>Squash,</b> <b>pumpkin,</b> many types of beans, tomatoes (though Europeans initially considered them poisonous), many types of peppers, and sassafras all came to the settlers via the native tribes.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Several {{species from}} the Cucurbitaceae family {{including}} muskmelon, watermelon, cucumber, pumpkin, and squash {{were used to}} evaluate their tolerance in a laboratory test to two herbicides (Stomp and Acetochlor) widely used in crop cultivation. The effects of concentration and site of herbicide action {{on the length of}} primary roots and hypocotyls as well as seedling fresh weight were studied. The results showed that the cultivars differed greatly in their sensitivity to the herbicide action. The difference in the growth responses was not only species-, but also cultivar-specific. In addition, there was a difference in the herbicide acting site on plants which depended on the kind of cucurbits crops. Based on the tolerance to the action of both herbicides the studied species can be classified as follows: watermelon, <b>squash,</b> <b>pumpkin,</b> muskmelon, cucumber. The tolerance differences of the studied cucurbits crops can be used in cultivation practice...|$|E
40|$|Intensification of {{agriculture}} in Tonga, notably through squash-pumpkin production, has {{lead to increased}} use of agrichemicals. These agrichemicals, both fertilisers and pesticides, pose a risk to the fragile environment and water resources of the raised atolls of Tonga. We have used water flux meters (WFM) to monitor both {{the quantity and quality}} of drainage leaving the rootzone of <b>squash</b> <b>pumpkin</b> growing on Tongatapu. Here we discuss the results from non-suction WFMs in relation to the loss of nitrogen during the establishment phase of the squash. During this establishment of the squash, over days-of-year (DOY) 200 - 245, some 350 mm of rain fell, and about 70 % of this left the rootzone as drainage in this humid environment. The concentration of nitrate-N in the drainage water was around 50 ppm, indicating that not only had the initial fertiliser dressing of 62 kg-N/ha been lost, but also some of N mineralised from the ploughed-in grass had also drained away. Eliminating the initial N-fertilisation at planting would reduce the nitrogen load on the groundwater, and save on fertiliser costs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCucurbita pepo (<b>squash,</b> <b>pumpkin,</b> gourd), a worldwide-cultivated {{vegetable}} of American origin, {{is extremely}} variable in fruit characteristics. However, the information associated with genes and genetic markers for pumpkin is very limited. In {{order to identify}} new genes and to develop genetic markers, we performed a transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) of two contrasting pumpkin cultivars. Leaves and female flowers of cultivars, ‘Big Moose’ with large round fruits and ‘Munchkin’ with small round fruits, were harvested for total RNA extraction. We obtained a total of 6 GB (Big Moose; [URL] and 5 GB (Munchkin; [URL] sequence data (NCBI SRA database SRX 1502732 and SRX 1502735, respectively), which correspond to 18, 055, 786 and 14, 824, 292 150 -base reads.
