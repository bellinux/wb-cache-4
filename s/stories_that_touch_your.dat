Ratings were generally very good {{during the summer months}} during its eight years on Thursday nights despite competition from Knots Landing on CBS and Hill Street Blues on NBC. It was around this time that the program started using the Brock Brower-written signoff line [...] "We're in touch, so you be in touch" [...] to end each program, which continues to be used to now (the program also used the line [...] "Around {{the world and into your}} home, the <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> life" [...] as the introduction during the show's opening titles for much of the 1990s).|$|E

It’s about what and about how. I mean that. This is not a pro-Hollywood or anti-Hollywood position. I learned to love cinema via the studio movies and of course Scorsese films, Spielberg films, and Hitchcock. All of them did studio pictures with very strong voices. It’s about finding this margin of expressing and exploring the things <b>that</b> <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> sensitive points.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for morally sustainable leadership, i. e., leadership with an awareness of both light and dark sides contained {{in the role of}} the leader, as symbolized by the archetype of the king. A narrative enquiry aiming at the study of fictive stories authored by management theorists and practitioners from different contexts, interweaving collective individual elements, brings to light how issues of leadership goodness are related to each other and to other themes. The stories are presented as archetypical tales, <b>that</b> is, <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>touch</b> profound aspects of culture and the psyche. They reveal what happens when people are asked to imagine a good manager, and how this results in tragic ironic representations, rather than tales of straightforward goodness. © The Author(s) 2012...|$|R
