The distinguishing feature is that lawyers may submit bids with any fee arrangement they prefer: an <b>hourly</b> <b>rate,</b> a fixed fee or a "mixed fee", {{which is a}} time-capped fixed fee plus an <b>hourly</b> <b>rate</b> for any additional hours should the case take longer than expected. This format of selling legal services is unusual in that it both forces lawyers to compete directly against each other and allows clients to easily compare these dierent oers.
