40|$|Ensemble methods {{represent}} {{a relatively new}} approach to motif discovery that combines the results returned by "third-party" finders {{with the aim of}} achieving a better accuracy than that obtained by the single tools. Besides the choice of the external finders, another crucial element for the success of an ensemble method is the particular strategy adopted to combine the finders' results, a. k. a. learning function. Results appeared in the literature seem to suggest that ensemble methods can provide noticeable improvements over the quality of the most popular tools available for motif discovery. With the goal of better understanding potentials and limitations of ensemble methods, we developed a general software architecture whose major feature is the flexibility with respect to the crucial aspects of ensemble methods mentioned above. The architecture provides facilities for the easy addition of virtually any third-party tool for motif discovery whose code is publicly available, and for the definition of new learning functions. We present a prototype implementation of our architecture, called CE 3 (Customizable and Easily Extensible Ensemble). Using CE 3, and available ensemble methods, we performed experiments with three well-known datasets. The results presented here are varied. On the one hand, they confirm that ensemble methods cannot be just considered as the universal remedy for "in-silico" motif discovery. On the other hand, we found some encouraging regularities that may help to find a general set up for CE 3 (and other ensemble methods as well) able to guarantee substantial improvements over <b>single</b> <b>finders</b> in a systematic way...|$|R
50|$|Folders existed as {{a concept}} on the {{original}} MFS-based Macintosh, but worked completely differently from {{the way they do}} on modern systems. They were visible in Finder windows, but not in the open and save dialog boxes. There was always one empty folder on the volume, and if it was altered in any way (such as by adding or renaming files), a new Empty Folder would appear, thus providing a way to create new folders. MFS stored all of the file and directory listing information in a <b>single</b> file. The <b>Finder</b> created the illusion of folders, by storing all files as a directory handle/file handle pair. To display the contents of a particular folder, MFS would scan the directory for all files in that handle. There was no need to find a separate file containing the directory listing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Laser based {{detection}} and tracking of persons {{can be used}} for numerous tasks. While a <b>single</b> laser range <b>finder</b> (LRF) is sufficient for detecting and tracking persons on a mobile robot platform, a network of multiple LRF is required to observe persons in larger spaces. Calibrating multiple LRF into a global coordinate system is usually done by hand in a time consuming procedure. An automatic calibration mechanism for such a sensor network is introduced in this paper. Without the need of prior knowledge about the environment, this mechanism is able to obtain the positions and orientations of all LRF in a global coordinate system. By comparing person tracks, determined for each individual LRF unit and matching them, constrains between the LRF units can be calculated. We are able to estimate the poses of all LRF by resolving these constrains. We evaluate and compare our method to {{the current state of the}} art approach methodically and experimentally. Experiments show that our calibration approach outperforms this approach. I...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about new and {{improved}} computational methods to analyze complex biological data produced by advanced biotechnologies. Such data is not only very large {{but it also is}} characterized by very high numbers of features. Addressing these needs, we developed a set of methods and tools that are suitable to analyze large sets of data, including next generation sequencing data, and built transparent models that may be interpreted by researchers not necessarily expert in computing. We focused on brain related diseases. The first aim of the thesis was to employ the meta-server approach to finding peaks in ChIP-seq data. Taking existing peak finders we created an algorithm that produces consensus results better than any <b>single</b> peak <b>finder.</b> The second aim was to use supervised machine learning to identify features that are significant in predictive diagnosis of Alzheimer disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment. This experience led to a development of a better feature selection method for rough sets, a machine learning method.   The third aim was to deepen the understanding of the role that STAT 3 transcription factor plays in gliomas. Interestingly, we found that STAT 3 in addition to being an activator is also a repressor in certain glioma rat and human models. This was achieved by analyzing STAT 3 binding sites in combination with epigenetic marks. STAT 3 regulation was determined using expression data of untreated cells and cells after JAK 2 /STAT 3 inhibition. The four papers constituting the thesis are preceded by an exposition of the biological, biotechnological and computational background that provides foundations for the papers. The overall results of this thesis are witness of the mutually beneficial relationship played by Bioinformatics in modern Life Sciences and Computer Science...|$|R
40|$|Mobile robots {{have made}} {{tremendous}} impact in our modern lives today, and its development {{is set to}} continue further. One {{of the most important}} domains to allow the interaction of mobile robots with human is its ability to know where it is in its environment, and how to navigate through it. This ability, however, needs algorithm has become more complex and requires high computational ability due to the demand for high accuracy, real time implementations and multi-tasking requirements. These are partly due to the need of multi-sensory system. This paper presents the use of <b>single</b> laser range <b>finder</b> for the mobile robot mapping and localisation system. The localisation algorithm is developed using scan matching method which is incorporated with K-nearest neighbours (KNN) classification. The mobile robot and the developed algorithm are tested in static environment. The results of the location estimation are able to achieve 80 % of accuracy for each scan location with the distance range of ± 2 cm compared to the real location. As conclusion, the simple flow of the algorithm is suitable to replace the complex and high computational algorithm and system...|$|R
50|$|The {{system worked}} by using sites known as Y-Stations. Each station had 5 radio {{operation}} systems. Each consisted of an omnidirectional transmitter an omnidirectional receiver and a direction finder. This allowed each site to control 5 fighters. The transmitter would {{send out a}} signal which {{was picked up by}} the FuG16ZY in the fighter (known as the Y Fighter), this repeated the signal back on a frequency 1.9 MHz lower than the transmitted frequency. Using the direction finder (DF) the angle was measured. Range was calculated by a timing system connected to both the transmitter and the omnidirectional receiver. Height could not be measured. However voice could be transposed onto the ranging signal allowing the ground controller to talk and listen to the pilot of the plane he was controlling, hence the pilot could report altitude when requested to do so. Controlling a single fighter was of not much use in practice so the Luftwaffe developed group control, where a Y-Fighter was {{part of a group of}} fighters intercepting an allied bomber stream, The Y-Fighter was painted a distinctive colour and the rest of the flight simple followed him. The flight leader could also listen into the ground controller channel and hear what the ground controller was saying while also being able to talk to the flight. The Y-Fighter was never the group controller. the system was susceptible to jamming on the FuG16ZY wavelength but was at least partially usable for the rest of the war. Controllable range was approx 250 km depending on aircraft height. One source mentions that relay stations could be used to extend the radio range. The relay station would consist of a <b>single</b> transmitter/receiver/DF <b>finder</b> system without the rest of the communication and guidance systems of the main Y site. The radio system used was a modified FuG16 radio. The Y-Site also contained other systems such as radio communications for talking to area control.|$|R

When asked after the attack just how he knew where Akagi was, Rochefort (who commanded HYPO at the time) said he recognized her [...] "same ham-fisted" [...] radio operators. (The Japanese contend that radio operators were left behind {{as part of the}} deception operation.) The critical DF-tracked radio transmissions show bearings that could have not come from the strike force. Emissions monitored from CAST, or CAST's report Akagi was off Okinawa on 8 December 1941, are examples, though some transmissions continue to be debated. The contention that [...] "low-powered" [...] radio (such as VHF or what the U.S. Navy called TBS, or talk between ships), might have been used, and detected, is contradicted as impossible due to the tremendous distances involved and when contact was lost, it was routinely presumed it was because low-powered radio and land line were being used. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for specific RDF reports remain wanting. [...] "A more critical analysis of the source documentation shows that not one <b>single</b> radio direction <b>finder</b> bearing, much less any locating [...] "fix," [...] was obtained on any Kido Butai unit or command during its transit from Saeki Bay, Kyushu to Hitokappu Bay and thence on to Hawaii. By removing this fallacious lynchpin propping up such claims of Kido Butai radio transmissions, the attendant suspected conspiracy tumbles down like a house of cards." ...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional {{regulators}} {{that bind}} to their target mRNAs through base complementarity. Predicting miRNA targets is a challenging task and various {{studies showed that}} existing algorithms suffer from high number of false predictions and low to moderate overlap in their predictions. Until recently, very few algorithms considered the dynamic nature of the interactions, including the effect of less specific interactions, the miRNA expression level, {{and the effect of}} combinatorial miRNA binding. Addressing these issues can result in a more accurate miRNA:mRNA modeling with many applications, including efficient miRNA-related SNP evaluation. We present a novel thermodynamic model based on the Fermi-Dirac equation that incorporates miRNA expression in the prediction of target occupancy and we show that it improves the performance of two popular <b>single</b> miRNA target <b>finders.</b> Modeling combinatorial miRNA targeting is a natural extension of this model. Two other algorithms show improved prediction efficiency when combinatorial binding models were considered. ComiR (Combinatorial miRNA targeting), a novel algorithm we developed, incorporates the improved predictions of the four target <b>finders</b> into a <b>single</b> probabilistic score using ensemble learning. Combining target scores of multiple miRNAs using ComiR improves predictions over the naïve method for target combination. ComiR scoring scheme can be used for identification of SNPs affecting miRNA binding. As proof of principle, ComiR identified rs 17737058 as disruptive to the miR- 488 - 5 p:NCOA 1 interaction, which we confirmed in vitro. We also found rs 17737058 to be significantly associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in two independent cohorts indicating that the miR- 488 - 5 p/NCOA 1 regulatory axis is likely critical in maintaining BMD in women. With increasing availability of comprehensive high-throughput datasets from patients ComiR is expected to become an essential tool for miRNA-related studies. © 2012 Coronnello et al...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the mapping of an unknown environment. Mapping of an environment {{can be accomplished by}} asking the question “What is in my world?” whilst moving through the environment. Once the objects occupying the ‘world’ have been discovered, the locations of these objects are stored somewhere (for example on paper), so that the environment can be navigated at a later stage. In the context of robots, a map provides the robot with a certain degree of “intelligence”. Several different types of applications are available for robots with “intelligence”; ranging from mining applications, to search and rescue situations, to surveillance applications and recognisance applications. The research hypothesis posed by this dissertation is as follows: Produce a human readable map for an unknown defined structured environment using a <b>single</b> laser range <b>finder</b> (LRF). The focus was on mapping environments resembling mine tunnels. In mine tunnel environments sensors, such as wheel odometers, can fail. This failure makes it advantageous to be able to create a map of the environment with the data obtained solely from the LRF. For this dissertation, the following restrictions were placed on the environment being mapped. It had to be structured (i. e. the environment could be described by simple geometric primitives such as lines); it had to be static (the only entity allowed to move in the environment was the LRF to obtain data); and the environment had to be defined (i. e. have a starting and ending point). During the course of this Masters research, it was discovered that {{in order to create a}} human readable map, one has to determine the accurate localisation of the sensor in the environment whilst mapping. The described scenario is a typical problem in mapping and is referred to as the ‘simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem’. This dissertation shows results when mapping was done with – and without – accurate localisation. The final approach used to create the human readable map consisted of determining scan matched odometry (based on a feature matching and ICP algorithm). The scan matched odometry is incorporated into a grid-based SLAM technique that utilises a particle filter to accurately determine the position of the sensor in the environment, in order to create a human readable map of the environment. The algorithm used (as described) was able to close loops (i. e. the mapping algorithm was able to handle the sensor returning to its starting point) and it produced satisfactory results for the types of environments as required by the scope of this dissertation...|$|R
