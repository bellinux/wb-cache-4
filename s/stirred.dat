5|$|In the Cayman Islands, gusts to 51mph (82km/h) <b>stirred</b> up rough seas with 810ft (2.53m) waves, {{which caused}} some light erosion along {{southern}} and western shores.

5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in <b>stirred</b> liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E

5|$|Sponges are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics.

The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.|$|E

40|$|Samples {{with one}} through three passes with 100 % overlap were created using {{friction}} <b>stir</b> processing (FSP) {{in order to}} locally modify the microstructure and mechanical properties of a cold-rolled Al- 5083 alloy. A constant traverse speed and two different rotational speeds were used for processing. The results indicated that single-pass FSP caused dynamic recrystallization in the <b>stir</b> zone, leading to equiaxed grains with high angle grain boundaries. The grain size increased with increasing the rotational speed. The product of ultimate tensile strength and total elongation of the <b>stir</b> zone was significantly enhanced {{compared with that of}} the base metal. During the annealing heat treatment, abnormal grain growth (AGG) occurred throughout the <b>stir</b> zone when a low rotational speed was adopted.

The application of multiple process passes did not change the grain size and mechanical properties of the <b>stir</b> zone significantly. The expanding of AGG in the <b>stir</b> zone was inhibited as the number of passes was increased...|$|R
