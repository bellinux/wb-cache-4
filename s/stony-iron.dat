5|$|Ida is {{classified}} as an S-type asteroid based on ground-based spectroscopic measurements. The composition of S-types was uncertain before the Galileo flybys, but was interpreted to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the Earth: ordinary chondrite (OC) and <b>stony-iron.</b> Estimates of Ida's density are constrained to less than 3.2g/cm3 by the long-term stability of Dactyl's orbit. This all but rules out a <b>stony-iron</b> composition; were Ida made of 5g/cm3 iron- and nickel-rich material, {{it would have to}} contain more than 40% empty space.|$|E
5|$|The <b>stony-iron</b> Pallasite meteorites are not {{connected}} to the Pallas asteroid, being instead named after the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas. The chemical element palladium, on the other hand, was named after the asteroid, which had been discovered just before the element.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stony-iron</b> meteorites {{constitute}} the remaining 1%. They are {{a mixture of}} iron-nickel metal and silicate minerals. One type, called pallasites, {{is thought to have}} originated in the boundary zone above the core regions where iron meteorites originated. The other major type of <b>stony-iron</b> meteorites is the mesosiderites.|$|E
25|$|Most meteorites are stony meteorites, classed as chondrites and achondrites. Only about 6% of meteorites are iron meteorites or a {{blend of}} rock and metal, the <b>stony-iron</b> meteorites. Modern {{classification}} of meteorites is complex. The review paper of Krot et al. (2007) summarizes modern meteorite taxonomy.|$|E
25|$|Meteorites have {{traditionally}} been divided into three broad categories: stony meteorites are rocks, mainly composed of silicate minerals; iron meteorites that are largely composed of metallic iron-nickel; and, <b>stony-iron</b> meteorites that contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material. Modern classification schemes divide meteorites into groups according to their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy. Meteorites smaller than 2mm are classified as micrometeorites. Extraterrestrial meteorites are such objects that have impacted other celestial bodies, {{whether or not they}} have passed through an atmosphere. They have been found on the Moon and Mars.|$|E
500|$|Ida was {{classified}} as an S-type asteroid based on the similarity of its reflectance spectra with similar asteroids. S-types may share their composition with <b>stony-iron</b> or ordinary chondrite (OC) meteorites. The composition of the interior has not been directly analyzed, but {{is assumed to be}} similar to OC material based on observed surface color changes and Ida's bulk density of 2.27–3.10 g/cm3. OC meteorites contain varying amounts of the silicates olivine and pyroxene, iron, and feldspar. Olivine and pyroxene were detected on Ida by Galileo. The mineral content appears to be homogeneous throughout its extent. Galileo found minimal variations on the surface, and the asteroid's spin indicates a consistent density. Assuming that its composition is similar to OC meteorites, which range in density from [...] 3.48 to 3.64 g/cm3, Ida would have a porosity of 11–42%.|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, {{only a few}} hundred {{meteorite}} finds had ever been discovered. More than 80% of these were iron and <b>stony-iron</b> meteorites, which are easily distinguished from local rocks. To this day, few stony meteorites are reported each year that can be considered to be [...] "accidental" [...] finds. The reason there are now more than 30,000 meteorite finds in the world's collections started with the discovery by Harvey H. Nininger that meteorites are much more common {{on the surface of the}} Earth than was previously thought.|$|E
2500|$|Opportunity Rover found meteorites {{just sitting}} on the plains. [...] The first one {{analyzed}} with Opportunity's instruments was called [...] "Heatshield Rock," [...] as it was found near where Opportunity's heatshield landed. [...] Examination with the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES), Mossbauer spectrometer, and APXS lead researchers to, classify it as an IAB meteorite. [...] The APXS determined it was composed of 93% iron and 7% nickel. [...] The cobble named [...] "Fig Tree Barberton" [...] {{is thought to be}} a stony or <b>stony-iron</b> meteorite (mesosiderite silicate), while [...] "Allan Hills," [...] and [...] "Zhong Shan" [...] may be iron meteorites.|$|E

50|$|The cores {{of planets}} are inaccessible, studied {{indirectly}} by seismometry, gravimetry, {{and in some}} cases magnetometry.
