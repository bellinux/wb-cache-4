50|$|Rotational latency (sometimes called {{rotational}} delay or just latency) is the delay {{waiting for the}} rotation of the disk to bring the required disk sector under the read-write head. It depends on the rotational <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disk (or <b>spindle</b> motor), measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). For most magnetic media-based drives, the average rotational latency is typically based on the empirical relation that the average latency in milliseconds for such a drive is one-half the rotational period. Maximum rotational latency is {{the time it takes to}} do a full rotation excluding any spin-up time (as the relevant part of the disk may have just passed the head when the request arrived). Therefore, the rotational latency and resulting access time can be improved (decreased) by increasing the rotational <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the disks. This also has the benefit of improving (increasing) the throughput (discussed later in this article).|$|R
40|$|Summary. In the {{prevention}} of gastric diseases flexible optical fiber harness with camera and lighting after its extraction from the stomach is subjected to disassembly and continuous sterilization. Protection flexible optical fiber tourniquet, disposable and transparent sheath reduces {{the duration of the}} disassembly and sterilization. As the material for the shell of the recommended developed by the Voronezh branch of the FSUE "NIISK" high-styrene block copolymers Styrotep- 65. The aim of this work was the development of technologies for films, protective shells of TEC and estimation of their technical parameters. As a benchmark comparison was tested extruded film Styrotep- 65. The orientation of the macromolecules of the polymer along the sleeve during extraction provided the anisotropy of the properties of the film along and across the sleeves. In the study of properties of solutions of thermoplastic elastomer is established that the increase in solution viscosity provides greater film thickness in a single dunking them in forms. We investigated the effect of the concentration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solution Styrotep- 65 in toluene and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> rotation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Brookfield viscometer PV-E on their viscosity. With increasing concentration of the polymer solution with 19, 0 to 26. 8 % of the mass. the level of viscosity was increased from 104 to 330 MPa•S. In the interval of increasing the rotational <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the spindle from 2. 0 to 10. 0 rpm viscosity solutions is not dependent on the concentration increased due to manifestations <b>of</b> thixotropy. <b>A</b> further increase in the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> rotation of the spindle 10 to 100 rpm did not affect the viscosity of the solutions. This is true for ideal fluids. Film cast on <b>a</b> horizontal surface <b>of</b> the cellophane from a 10 % toluene solution, was characterized by lower strength than extruded, but with a large elongation at break. Determined the impact of the multiplicity of dipping forms in solution and polymer solution concentration, layer thickness and nature of the substrate on the elastic strength properties of the films. Determined the impact of the multiplicity of dipping forms in solution and polymer solution concentration, layer thickness and nature of the substrate on the elastic strength properties of the films. Maximum strength and the highest elongation at rupture of membranes achieved at three times the dunking form in solution Styrotep- 65 with <b>a</b> concentration <b>of</b> 19 % of the mass. The {{increase in the number of}} dives forms in the solution was reduced scatter of shell thickness. Under higher magnification, the diameter of the fixed forms of the manifestation of the anisotropy of the properties in the longitudinal and transverse cross section of the membranes due to the orientation of the macromolecules of the polymer along the transverse perimeter of the shell.

Noticed a decrease in light transmission when the thicknesses of the membranes more than 0. 15 mm. It is shown that with increase of the wavelength of light grew exponentially. The increase in the thickness of the shells Styrotep- 65 from 0. 14 to 0. 19 mm resulted in a slight decrease in light transmission in the visible and infrared wavelength range from 450 to 750 nm. In the method for casting membranes, determined their optimal thickness based on elastic-strength indicators, identified the effect of the anisotropy properties of the membranes in the longitudinal and transverse cross-section...|$|R

This entity accounts for less than 0. 5 % of all breast cancers and contains elements of epithelial (ductal), mesenchymal, and intermediate forms of differentiation. Of these metaplastic carcinomas, {{there have been reports}} of chondroid, squamous, osseous, and spindle differentiation. Case Report: We describe the clinical course <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 52 -year-old female patient with <b>an</b> unusual histopathology <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> cell carcinoma <b>of</b> the breast, discuss the literature, and recommend an approach to diagnosis and treatment.

40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint detects defects in spindle structure {{or in the}} alignment of the chromosomes on the metaphase plate and delays the onset of anaphase until defects are corrected. Thus far, the evidence regarding the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> checkpoint during meiosis in male Drosophila has been indirect and contradictory.
