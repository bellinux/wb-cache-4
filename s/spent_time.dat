METHODS—Data came from {{the first wave of}} the Child Development Supplement, a nationally representative sample of children aged 0 to 12 in 1997 (N = 1712). Twenty-four-hour time-use diaries from 1 randomly chosen weekday and 1 randomly chosen weekend day were used to assess children’s <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> watching television, <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> with parents, <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> with siblings, <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> reading (or being read to), <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> doing homework, <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> in creative play, and <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> in active play.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{document}} the prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cooking by adults in the 2005 UK Time-Use Survey. Respondents reported their main activities, in 10 minute slots, throughout one 24 hour period. Activities were coded into 30 pre-defined codes, including ‘cooking, washing up’. Four measures of <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cooking were calculated: any <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cooking, 30 continuous minutes <b>spent</b> cooking, total <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cooking, and longest continuous <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cooking. Socio-demographic correlates were: age, employment, social class, education, and number of adults {{and children in the}} household. Analyses were stratified by gender. Data from 4214 participants were included. 85 % of women and 60 % of men <b>spent</b> any <b>time</b> cooking; 60 % of women and 33 % of men spent 30 continuous minutes cooking. Amongst women, older age, not being in employment, lower social class, greater education, and living with other adults or children were positively associated with time cooking. Few differences in <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cooking were seen in men. Socio-economic differences in <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cooking may have been overstated as a determinant of socio-economic differences in diet, overweight and obesity. Gender was a stronger determinant of <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cooking than other socio-demographic variables...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To assess {{regional}} {{variations in}} rates of traffic injuries to pedal cyclists resulting in death or hospital inpatient treatment, {{in relation to}} <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cycling and <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> travelling in a car. Methods: Cycling injuries were identified from the Mortality Collection and the National Minimum Dataset. <b>Time</b> <b>spent</b> cycling and <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> travelling as a driver or passenger in a car/van/ute/SUV were computed from National Household Travel Surveys. There are 16 census regions in New Zealand, {{some of which were}} combined for this analysis to ensure an adequate sample size, resulting in eight regional groups. Analyses were undertaken for 1996 – 99 and 2003 – 07. Results: Injury rates, per million hours spent cycling, varied widely across regions (11 to 33 injuries during 1996 – 99 and 12 to 78 injuries during 2003 – 07). The injury rate increased with decreasing per capita <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cycling. The rate also increased with increasing per capita <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> travelling in a car. There was an inverse association between the injury rate and the ratio of <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cycling to <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> travelling in a car. The expected number of cycling injuries increased with increasing total <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> cycling but at a decreasing rate particularly after adjusting for total <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> travelling in a car. Conclusions: The findings indicate a 'risk in scarcity' effect for New Zealand cyclists such that risk profiles of cyclists are likely to deteriorate if fewer people use a bicycle and more use a car. Implications: Cooperative efforts to promote cycling and its safety and to restrict car use may reverse the risk in scarcity effect...|$|R

40|$|We extend cross-domain {{research}} by examining sleep, a domain {{within the larger}} nonwork domain that competes for time with work and family domains. We draw from scarcity theory and research on slack resources to contend that, because people cannot {{increase the amount of}} time they have, they borrow time from sleep in order to spend more time working and with family. Utilizing a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of 10, 741 participants, we find nonlinear and interactive effects of <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> working and <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> with family on sleep time, suggesting that the negative effects of work and family on sleep time are especially strong when demands for work and family are high. In an experience sampling field study of 122 working adults, we similarly find a nonlinear effect of work time on sleep time as well as an interaction between work time and family time in predicting <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> sleeping. Both studies indicate that as slack time resources become increasingly scarce, <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> working and <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> with family have increasingly powerful negative effects on <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> sleeping.
