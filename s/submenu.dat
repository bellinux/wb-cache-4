500|$|Final Fantasy Mystic Quest {{eliminates}} {{the system of}} random enemy encounters, a trademark of the main series. Instead, battles are represented in dungeons as stationary enemy sprites, and the player is given the option of approaching the enemy and engaging a battle. Once engaged in battle, the player is thrust into the battle screen, which presents a window-based menu with three commands to choose from: battle, run, or control. Running from battle transports the player back to the field screen, while choosing [...] "control" [...] toggles between the ally's battle mode, where the player can manually control the main character's ally or opt for a computer-controlled ally. If players choose to battle, they are presented with a <b>submenu</b> of four more options: physically attack the enemy, cast a spell, use a curative item (such as a Cure potion), or defend. The game's battle system relies on conditional turn-based combat, where the characters and enemies cycle through [...] "rounds" [...] in battling each other, with the most turns awarded to the fastest character. Character health is represented by an incremental life bar, although the player may choose to have it displayed in numerical fractions as in most role-playing games. If all character life bars reach zero, the game is over, but the player is given the option of continuing and restarting the battle. [...] If the player chooses this option, however, the main character's attack power may suffer temporarily as a penalty. [...] A character's performance in battle is determined by numerical figures (called statistics) for vitality, attacking power, defensive capabilities, speed, magical prowess, accuracy, and evasion. Character statistics are driven by experience points (EXP) gained from winning battles, which accumulate until players achieve milestones known as [...] "experience levels." [...] Besides awarding experience points, battling enemies also earns the player Gold Pieces (GP), {{which can be used}} to buy weapons, armor, and curative items. In the absence of random enemy encounters, battlefields are scattered across the world map. Players are immediately thrust into a battle when entering a battlefield, and must win ten enemy battles to [...] "clean out" [...] the battlefield. Once a battlefield is cleaned out, players are awarded either a large amount of experience, a large amount of GP, a piece of armor, or a magic spell.|$|E

2500|$|Windows Media Center in Windows Vista, {{available}} in the Home Premium and Ultimate editions, has been upgraded significantly, including a considerable overhaul of the user interface. Each button in the main menu, which contains sections such as [...] "Music", [...] "Videos", and [...] "TV", gets encased in a box when selected, and for each selection, a <b>submenu</b> comes up, extending horizontally. When any of the options is selected, the entries for each are presented in a grid-like structure, with each item being identified by album art, {{if it is a}}n audio file, or a thumbnail image if it is a picture, a video or a TV recording, and other related options, such as different views for the music collection if [...] "Music" [...] is selected, extend horizontally {{along the top of the}} grid. Similarly, other items are identified by suggestive artwork. The grid displaying the items is also extended horizontally, and the selected item is enlarged compared to the rest.|$|E

50|$|Pie menus show {{available}} options, {{in contrast}} to invisible mouse gestures. Pie menus, which delay appearance until the pointer is not moving, reduce intrusiveness to {{the same level as}} mouse gestures for experienced users. Pie menus take up more screen space than linear menus, and the number of slices in an individual menu must be kept low for effectiveness by using <b>submenus.</b> When using pie menus, <b>submenus</b> may overlap with the parent menu, but the parent menu may become translucent or hidden.|$|R

40|$|Exploration and {{navigation}} in multimedia data hierarchies (e. g., photos, music) are frequent tasks on mobile devices. However, visualization and interaction are impoverished {{due to the}} limited size of the screen {{and the lack of}} precise input devices. As a result, menus on mobile devices do not provide efficient navigation as compared to many innovative menu techniques proposed for Desktop platforms. In this paper, we present Wavelet, the adaptation of the Wave menu for the navigation in multimedia data on iPhone. Its layout, based on an inverted representation of the hierarchy, is particularly well adapted to mobile devices. Indeed, it guarantees that <b>submenus</b> are always displayed on the screen and it supports efficient navigation by providing previsualization of the <b>submenus...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1986, Mike Gallaher and Don Hopkins {{together}} independently {{arrived at}} {{the concept of a}} context menu based on the angle to the origin where the exact angle and radius could be passed as parameters to a command, or the radius could be used to trigger a <b>submenu.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} access any memory device {{for the first}} time the user has to mount the volume, that means, let the system know it is there. This is done with a {{right-click}} on the Desktop, then choosing volume from the Mount <b>submenu,</b> which is also found in Deskbar.|$|E

50|$|Quick Menu {{offered a}} solution: it is a {{graphical}} user {{environment in which}} the user could create his own menustructure. In each menu a <b>submenu</b> or some kind of shortcut could be created. In such shortcuts the user had to define the location of the main startup file. Of course, the user had to create the shortcut manually and had to link it with the main startup file once. As from then he easily could navigate through the menu and select the program he wanted to launch.|$|E
50|$|One of two key {{features}} in the Klingon Academy interface is the VOS or Verbal Orders System. A list of substations {{along the bottom of}} the HUD correspond to number keys on the numpad. Pressing each number brings up a <b>submenu</b> for the corresponding subsystem, with possible additional submenus available for many commands. For example, pressing the numbers 1, 4, 1, 1 might bring the ship to full power and run weapons and shields at eighty percent, with a corresponding verbal acknowledgement from the crew.|$|E
50|$|SmartDeck’s MFD {{contains}} {{a host of}} flight information available {{on a number of}} “pages” dedicated to different functions.

30|$|In {{the upper}} part of the screen there is a button in form of an icon with a microphone, which serves for turning off and on of voice recognition. The basic menu {{consists}} of six buttons (Visualization, “Statistics”, Voice commands, Settings, Help and Close) providing switching to other screens. Each of the <b>submenus</b> provides the user with the possibility to control functions of Smart Home Care or the G.H.O.S.T program itself.|$|R
50|$|System 7.5 {{added an}} Apple Menu Options control panel, which added <b>submenus</b> to folders and disks in the Apple Menu, showing the {{contents}} of the folder or disk.
