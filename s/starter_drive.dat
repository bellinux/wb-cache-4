5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard starter, a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the <b>starter</b> <b>drive,</b> and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the <b>starter</b> <b>drive</b> forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the <b>starter</b> <b>drive</b> out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|E

50|$|All modern {{starters}} {{rely on the}} solenoid {{to engage}} the <b>starter</b> <b>drive</b> with the ring gear of the flywheel. When the solenoid is energized, it operates a plunger or lever which forces the pinion into mesh with the ring gear. The pinion incorporates a one way clutch {{so that when the}} engine starts and runs it will not attempt to drive the starter motor at excessive RPM.|$|E
50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} <b>starter</b> <b>drive</b> pinion on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia {{of the drive}} pinion {{assembly}} causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of the}} spring to change and engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|E
50|$|Before Chrysler's 1949 {{innovation}} of the key-operated combination ignition-starter switch, {{the starter}} was often {{operated by the}} driver pressing a button mounted on the floor or dashboard. Some vehicles had a pedal in the floor that manually engaged the <b>starter</b> <b>drive</b> pinion with the flywheel ring gear, then completed the electrical circuit to the starter motor once the pedal {{reached the end of}} its travel. Ferguson tractors from the 1940s, including the Ferguson TE20, had an extra position on the gear lever that engaged the starter switch, ensuring safety by preventing the tractors from being started in gear.|$|E

50|$|A {{starter ring}} gear, {{sometimes}} called a starter ring or ring gear, is a {{medium carbon steel}} ring with teeth that is fitted {{on the periphery of}} a flexplate or flywheel of an internal combustion engine, mostly for automotive or aircraft applications. The teeth of the <b>starter</b> ring are <b>driven</b> by the smaller gear (the pinion) of the starter motor. The primary function of the starter ring is to transfer torque from the starter motor pinion to the flywheel or flexplate to rotate the engine to begin the cycle.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the engine and generator, engine-generators generally include a fuel supply, a constant engine speed regulator (governor) and a generator voltage regulator, cooling and exhaust systems, and lubrication system.

50|$|Because of a {{large number}} of {{different}} pipes and tubes to detach during maintenance, the repair procedure for some of the vehicle's mechanisms is hard (for example, replacement or repair of a <b>starter).</b> The electric <b>drive</b> of an air outlet hatch of a gas turbine engine (part of the vehicle's electric power supply system) has an inconvenient location (at the bottom of the hull) which causes overheating and sometimes, jamming of the electric drive. On the other hand, the construction of the electric power supply system is very reliable. Changing the main engine oil and coolant is easy, as is replacement of fuel and oil filters, and sections of the air filter.|$|R
40|$|Oaky Creek Coal Mine uses Jiffy Drive Conveyors {{to extend}} the {{production}} and development conveyor systems underground temporarily whilst waiting for permanent conveyor systems to be manufactured. The existing Jiffy <b>Drive</b> <b>starters</b> are enclosed in a flameproof enclosure that conformed to AS 3800 which was needed when located in ERZ (Explosive Risk Zone) designated areas. Additionally an Austdac control panel had to be mounted separately to the starting panel in a NERZ (Non Explosive Risk Zone) as it was not located in a flameproof enclosure. Due their age and changes in mining technology Oaky Creek Coal {{decided it was time}} to overhaul one of their Jiffy Drive Conveyor starting panels named JD 21 into an IP 56, 316 stainless steel enclosure that also incorporated the Austdac control system. Because of the high standard of work and vast industry experience Comlek was chosen to overhaul the design, manufacture and factory acceptance test (FAT) JD 21. With JD 21 in this configuration it will result a modern, reliable product that does not require constant maintenance to ensure that it conforms to the flameproof standard. The main objective for the project is to design a new enclosure for JD 21 that segregates the incoming mains circuit breaker and the control system out of 316 stainless steel. As a part of the new design JD 21 will make use of a PLC that will reduce the number of components required in the control circuit. It will be programmed to work with a Human Machine Interface (HMI) panel view, which will reduce the amount of indication and push button switches needed. There will be an extra cubicle added to the enclosure that will house and Austdac signal generator panel that will allow dupline signal transmission and receiving from field instruments located on the conveyor itself. Upon completion of the project Comlek will handover one fully operational, fully factory acceptance tested (FAT) Jiffy <b>Drive</b> <b>Starter</b> with designation and signage to suit JD 21. Oaky Creek Coal will receive a dossier that includes a user manual and all relevant drawings and schematics of JD 21...|$|R
40|$|Generally the {{harmonics}} are not presents in {{a supply}} which {{is given to}} the drives but the harmonics are generated by the load itself. Harmonic distortion is form of electrical noise that can cause a problem such as, motor may overheat or become noisy and torque oscillations in the rotor can lead to mechanical resonance and vibration, capacitors overheat. All power electronic converters used in different types of electronic systems can increase harmonic disturbances by injecting harmonic currents directly into the grid. Common non-linear loads include motor <b>starters,</b> variable speed <b>drives,</b> computers and other electronic device. After the identification of the harmonics, it can be reduced either by modifications to the drive system or by using external filtering. The current harmonics depend on the drive construction and load. Factors that increase current harmonics include large motor compared to the supply transformer higher motor load Factors that decrease current harmonics include Greater DC or AC inductance, Higher number of pulses in the rectifier. By using simulation with mat lab software we can reduce the harmonics for AC drives to overcome the above mentioned problems and to get smooth performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{looked at}} {{the design of a}} power saving {{conveyor}} system which involves sizing, selection and cost benefit analysis of its installation. This paper focuses on factors that cause high belt power consumption and costs which are high starting torque and more operating hours hence there is design of drive control system consisting of soft starters and variable speed drives to reduce starting torque and load detecting switching system to reduce number of operating hours. The average power savings considering all the factors of reducing the system operating hours to the average of 12 hours a day and drive control system that reduces the starting power were calculated to be 47 %. The annual costs of power consumption were reduced from $ 86212 to $ 40520 resulting in the payback period after investing to be 8 months. After doing cost benefit analysis it was ascertained that installation, operation and maintenance costs of the designed system are less than that occur on the initial system hence the design is worthy to install since it results in cost savings and increase in system life. The are some recommendations for the designed system which are clean ventilated environment to promote adequate cooling, belt protection against overload to avoid stops and also soft <b>starters,</b> variable speed <b>drives</b> and sensors protection against overvoltage and overcurrent so that the drive control system will not fail...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents fault-tolerant/ 2 ̆ 2 limp-home 2 ̆ 2 {{strategies of}} ac motor soft <b>starters</b> and adjustable-speed <b>drives</b> (ASDs) when experiencing a power switch open-circuit or short-circuit fault. The present low-cost fault mitigation solutions can be retrofitted into the existing off-the-shelf soft starters and ASDs {{to enhance their}} reliability and fault tolerant capability, with only minimum hardware modifications. The conceived fault-tolerant soft starters are capable of operating in a two-phase mode {{in the event of}} a thyristor/SCR open-circuit or short-circuit switch-fault in any one of the phases using a novel resilient closed-loop control scheme. The performance resulting from using the conceived soft starter fault-tolerant control has demonstrated reduced starting motor torque pulsations and reduced inrush current magnitudes. Small-signal model representation of the motor-soft starter controller system is also developed here in order to design the closed-loop regulators of the control system at a desired bandwidth to render a good dynamic and fast transient response. In addition, the transient motor performance under these types of faults is investigated using analytical closed-form solutions, the results of which are in good agreement with both the detailed simulation and experimental test results of the actual hardware. As for ASDs, a low-cost fault mitigation strategy, based on a quasi-cycloconverter-based topology and control, for low-speed applications such as 2 ̆ 2 self-healing/limp-home 2 ̆ 2 needs for vehicles and propulsion systems is developed. The present approach offers the potential of mitigating both transistor open-circuit and short-circuit switch faults, as well as other drive-related faults such as faults occurring in the rectifier bridge or dc-link capacitor. Furthermore, some of the drawbacks associated with previously known fault mitigation techniques such as the need for accessibility to a motor neutral, the need for larger size dc-link capacitors, or higher dc-bus voltage, are overcome here using the present approach. Due to its unique control algorithm, torque pulsations are introduced as a result of the non-sinusoidal current waveforms. Simulation and experimental work have been performed to demonstrate the efficacy and validity of the conceived fault-tolerant solutions for induction motor fault mitigation applications...|$|R
40|$|Today, the {{automobile}} industry {{is driven by the}} urge to reduce emissions and to achieve the low CO 2 emission targets that are set by the European Legislation to reduce the average CO 2 emissions of a manufacturer's eet below 95 g/km by 2021. This has led to the focus on Mild Hybrid technology. This involves the introduction of a higher system voltage i. e. 48 V. However, the initial generation of Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicles is expected to have both 48 V and 12 V systems. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the potential benets of shifting electrical loads to the 48 V supply in the future Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicles at Volvo Car Corporation (VC). A literature study has been carried out to identify the loads on the existing 12 V automotive electrical network that could be considered to be suitable for a 48 V operation. The whole system has been modelled in MatLab R Simulink R and simulations were carried out to evaluate their performance at three temperatures (20 C, + 20 C and + 40 C). The savings in fuel consumption due to moving of loads to the 48 V bus have been analysed. Also, new loads that could improve the user experience have been identied. The complete system has been evaluated for its electrical performance and fuel consumption. The weight reduction by shifting loads to the 48 V bus have also been looked into. The results suggest that the 48 V mild hybrid system eciency is high during high loading condition primarily due to the increased eciency of Belt <b>Driven</b> <b>Starter</b> Generator (BSG). The fuel savings at 20 C, + 20 C and + 40 C have been estimated to be 376 ml/ 100 km, 32 ml/ 100 km and 103 ml/ 100 km respectively for the WLTP cycle. The considerable benet on reduced fuel consumption is also due to the higher amount of energy that is recuperated at 48 V. Due to these abilities of the BSG, it is still advantageous to supply the present day 12 V electrical network from a 48 V BSG through a DC/DC converter. The PTC heaters, defrosters, blowers, EPS, cooling fan and fuel pump could be supplied from a 48 V network in the initial generation of MHEVs...|$|R
