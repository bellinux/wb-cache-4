Some Tenebrionidae use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection {{from a wide range}} of microbes. Some species <b>sequester</b> chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.|$|E
5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions {{provoked}} a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to <b>sequester</b> the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, the crews were reduced to one-third of normal size.|$|E

Selenium and zinc are commonly referred to as antioxidant nutrients, but these chemical elements have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} Lepidoptera <b>sequester</b> or {{manufacture}} toxins which {{are stored in}} their body tissue, rendering them poisonous to predators; examples include the monarch butterfly in the Americas and Atrophaneura species in Asia. Predators that eat poisonous lepidopterans may become sick and vomit violently, and so learn to avoid those species. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Toxic butterflies and larvae tend to develop bright colours and striking patterns as an indicator to predators about their toxicity. This phenomenon is known as aposematism.|$|E
5|$|Afforestation {{projects}} have been undertaken to prevent groundwater pollution, secure drinking water, <b>sequester</b> CO2, increase biodiversity, create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding effort in Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E
5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound themselves but instead <b>sequester</b> them from their diet.

Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as the skins and feathers rules out the possibility that the toxins are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|E

5|$|The type of RNA editing {{that is most}} {{prevalent}} in higher eukaryotes converts adenosine nucleotides into inosine in dsRNAs via the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADAR). It was originally proposed in 2000 that the RNAi and A→I RNA editing pathways might compete for a common dsRNA substrate. Some pre-miRNAs do undergo A→I RNA editing and this mechanism may regulate the processing and expression of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, at least one mammalian ADAR can <b>sequester</b> siRNAs from RNAi pathway components. Further support for this model comes from studies on ADAR-null C. elegans strains indicating that A→I RNA editing may counteract RNAi silencing of endogenous genes and transgenes.|$|E
5|$|Six to 12 larval stages occur. During {{the first}} two stages, the larvae live off {{surrounding}} fungal tissue, until they reach the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the heartwood. After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, they normally turn either up or down, but they turn back if they meet a foreign borehole, encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the fungal mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimeters under the bark. Before this, female larvae <b>sequester</b> a secretion containing fungal oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending on the weather, they remain in the hatch hole {{for up to three}} weeks before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.|$|E
5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by microbial communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 microbial cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. The microbial communities which inhabit soils {{are some of}} the most complex known to science, and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. Microbial consortia perform a wide variety of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth, including fixing atmospheric nitrogen, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and <b>sequester</b> iron and other metals. Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these microbial communities. By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E

40|$|When Pichia pastoris adapts from {{methanol}} to glucose growth, peroxisomes {{are rapidly}} sequestered and degraded within the vacuole by micropexophagy. During micropexophagy, <b>sequestering</b> membranes {{arise from the}} vacuole to engulf the peroxisomes. Fusion of the <b>sequestering</b> membranes and incorporation of the peroxisomes into the vacuole is mediated by the micropexophagy-specific membrane apparatus (MIPA). In this study, we show the P. pastoris ortholog of Atg 9, a novel membrane protein {{is essential for the}} formation of the <b>sequestering</b> membranes and assembly of MIPA. During methanol growth, GFP-PpAtg 9 localizes to multiple structures situated near the plasma membrane referred as the peripheral compartment (Atg 9 -PC). On glucose-induced micropexophagy, PpAtg 9 traffics from the Atg 9 -PC to unique perivacuolar structures (PVS) that contain PpAtg 11, but lack PpAtg 2 and PpAtg 8. Afterward, PpAtg 9 distributes to the vacuole surface and <b>sequestering</b> membranes. Movement of the PpAtg 9 from the Atg 9 -PC to the PVS requires PpAtg 11 and PpVps 15. PpAtg 2 and PpAtg 7 are essential for PpAtg 9 trafficking from the PVS to the vacuole and <b>sequestering</b> membranes, whereas trafficking of PpAtg 9 proceeds independent of PpAtg 1, PpAtg 18, and PpVac 8. In summary, our data suggest that PpAtg 9 transits from the Atg 9 -PC to the PVS and then to the <b>sequestering</b> membranes that engulf the peroxisomes for degradation...|$|R

5|$|To <b>sequester</b> Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted {{articles}} of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|On 29 July 2013, Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno {{warned that}} the Ground Combat Vehicle program might be delayed or {{possibly}} even cancelled because of the sequestration budget cuts. Although he specifically said it could be delayed, he did {{not rule out the}} possibility of cancellation. The GCV was high-priority for the Army to give better protection than the M2 Bradley, but because of the <b>sequester</b> cuts everything was being considered. On 1 August 2013, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlined two basic results if the effects of sequestration continued: modernization programs like the GCV would be cut to maintain troop levels, or high-end capability efforts like the GCV would be preserved to continue modernization and keep equipment technologically advanced with troop levels being cut. Odierno was committed to balancing soldiers, readiness, and modernization, and was intent on the need for the Ground Combat Vehicle. Suggested alternative options, such as further upgrading the Bradley and buying currently available infantry fighting vehicles like the German Puma, were recommended as cost-saving measures. Army leaders said the Puma's low troop-carrying capacity would require buying five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys, and that upgrading the Bradley would essentially be engineering a new vehicle. While these options would offer no improvement over the fleet's current capability, not pursuing the GCV would allow the money to be spent elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Dole and {{his allies}} in the {{legislature}} used the coin issuance {{as a means of}} attacking the government, accusing Gibson and others of disobeying the laws, and demanding information on Spreckels' profits, which the government stated was about three percent after costs such as transport and insurance were calculated. The political fallout of the coinage was the 1884 election-year shift towards the Kuokoa (independent) Party in the legislature. The Currency Act of 1884, passed after the election, restricted acceptance of silver coin as payment to debts under $10, and limited the exchange of silver for gold at the treasury to $150,000 a month. The new silver coins were expected to flow into the Treasury in exchange for gold under this arrangement, but the government refused to implement the law until forced to by the Supreme Court. To avoid a financial panic, major private banks and businesses agreed to exchange gold for the new silver coins, in which there was little public confidence. But in February 1885, faced with a government refusal to pay out gold (of which the Treasury was almost bare), the private businesses stopped this arrangement. Negotiations followed, and the government reluctantly agreed to <b>sequester</b> more than $550,000 of the coins in a special account to back the banknotes then in circulation. Although this left the government with little liquidity, the increased confidence in its finances allowed it to borrow on a short-term basis. By mid-1885, sugar prices were rising, and prosperity was returning to the islands. Greater amounts of gold flowed into the islands, balancing the silver that was already there, and stabilizing the monetary situation. The Kalākaua coins became more acceptable, and by 1888, most of the non-US foreign silver had been exchanged for them. They remained in circulation during the turbulent years of the 1890s in Hawaii, as the monarchy fell and the short-lived republic ended in 1898 with annexation to the United States. Despite the urging of local interests, it was not until 1903 that Congress acted, ordering that the Hawaii silver coins be exchanged by January 1, 1904, or lose status as legal tender. By 1907, coins worth about $814,000 of the $1,000,000 originally issued had been redeemed; they were exchanged for US silver and melted down at the San Francisco Mint.|$|E
