50|$|Approximately 60% of all {{insurance}} premiums are generated from car insurance. There are about 14 million vehicles in Iran and 90 {{percent of them}} are insured (2012). Of the 10 million motorcycles that operate on Iran's roads only 2 million are insured. Also, 95% of all premiums come from general insurance contracts and only 5% relate to life products (against world average of 58% for life insurance in 2011). One of the defining characteristics of the economy is entrenched high inflation (and expectations) thanks to persistent monetisation of fiscal deficits. This produces an environment in which no prudent person would enter into a long-term <b>savings</b> <b>contract.</b> According to Business Monitor International, unless and until economic policies in Iran change radically, the reality of the insurance sector will fall a long way short of its potential.|$|E

The employee can then choose either {{to exercise the}} option to buy the shares with the proceeds from the <b>savings</b> <b>contract,</b> or just to take the proceeds and the bonus. The bonuses are equivalent to fixed rate interest and are set by the Treasury. The savings and bonus are free from income tax. However, an employee {{may have to pay}} Capital Gains Tax (CGT) if they sell their shares and make a profit which takes them above the CGT exemption limit for that year. An employee can transfer shares from the exercise of the option into a stocks and shares ISA, within 90 days of exercising the option. Capital gains made on these shares are then free from tax. There is a limit on the value of shares that can be transferred, and the ISA manager must agree to take them.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{building}} energy retrofit {{is one of}} {{the keys}} of building energy efficiency in China. According to experience in developed countries, implementation of energy management contract (EMC) is crucial to promote existing building energy retrofit, which means that the reduction of energy expenditure is used to pay the retrofit cost. The EMC program has a short payback period, high interior return rate and remarkable energy savings. This paper present the specialties and difficulties of existing building energy conservation in China and the development, service items and commercial patterns of EMC. We discuss the main methods and ways that EMC is applied to existing building energy retrofit at the original stage of building energy efficiency by analyzing the difference of EMC and other traditional energy efficiency patterns. Based on the analysis of three commercial patterns of EMC including guaranteed <b>savings</b> <b>contract,</b> shared <b>savings</b> <b>contract</b> and chauffage contract, we propose that the guaranteed <b>savings</b> <b>contract</b> is the main development direction of building energy efficiency service in China. At the same time, new financing methods and energy-saving measurement and verification standards should be established to ensure that EMC {{plays an important role in}} the process of existing building energy retrofit in China...|$|E
40|$|We use a field {{experiment}} {{to test whether}} saving and borrowing satisfy demand for lump-sum accumulation from regular deposits. Inspired by ROSCAs, we offer different credit and <b>savings</b> <b>contracts</b> to subjects. We find that individuals often accept both credit and <b>saving</b> <b>contract</b> across experimental waves. This behaviour can be rationalised by assuming that individuals seek lump-sum payments and struggle to hold savings. Structural estimation of this model accounts for the behaviour of 75 % of participants. Of these, two-thirds have high demand for lump-sum accumulation but savings difficulties. These results imply that the distinction between microlending and microsaving is largely illusor...|$|R

In this paper, we present a methodology that duly accounts for underlying spatial effects and estimates the expected cost <b>savings</b> of innovative <b>contracting</b> policies for highway maintenance and rehabilitation relative to in-house execution of these activities. Spatial econometric modeling is used to analyze highway contract data from 49 countries.

40|$|Introduction: Integrated care {{solutions}} need supportive financial incentives. In {{this paper}} {{we describe the}} financial architecture and operative details of the integrated pilot Gesundes Kinzigtal. Description of integrated care case: Located in Southwest Germany, Gesundes Kinzigtal {{is one of the}} few population-based integrated care approaches in Germany, organising care across all health service sectors and indications. The system serving around half of the population of the region is run by a regional health management company (Gesundes Kinzigtal GmbH) in coope­ration with the physicians' network in the region (MQNK), a German health care management company with a background in medical sociology and health economics (OptiMedis AG) and with two statutory health insurers (among them is the biggest health insurer in Southwest Germany: AOK Baden-Württemberg). Discussion and (preliminary) conclusion: The shared <b>savings</b> <b>contract</b> between Gesundes Kinzigtal GmbH and the two health insurers, providing financial incentives for managers and health care providers to realize a sub­stantial efficiency gain, could be an appropriate contractual base of Gesundes Kinzigtal's population health gain approach. This approach is based on the assumption that a more effective trans-sector organisation of Germany's health care system and increased investments in well-designed preventive programmes will lead to a reduction in  morbidity, and in particular to a reduced incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases. This, in turn, is to lead to a comparative reduction in health care cost. Although the comparative cost in the Kinzigtal region has been reduced from the onset of Gesundes Kinzigtal Integrated Care, only future research will have to demonstrate whether - and to what extent - cost reduction may be attributed to a real population health gain...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{literature}} promotes commitment {{products as}} a new remedy for overcoming self-control problems and savings constraints. This thesis argues {{that the effects of}} commitment may be very heterogeneous, and highlights the mechanisms under which commitment may reduce welfare, rather than increase it. It also examines a new type of commitment contract: A formal commitment savings account with fixed regular instalments, introduced in a developing-country context. Chapter 1 proposes that the popularity of costly or inflexible savings mechanisms as well as of high-interest consumption loans may represent a demand for commitment to fixed instalments. Using a newly collected dataset from Bangladesh, it shows that the introduction of a regular-instalment commitment savings product was associated with a large increase in average savings contributions. The theoretical framework in Chapter 2 highlights the potential heterogeneity behind such positive average effects: Commitment improves welfare when agents have full knowledge of their preferences, including biases and inconsistencies. If agents are imperfectly informed about their preferences, they may choose ill-suited commitment contracts. I formally show that commitment contracts can reduce welfare if the commitment is not strong enough to discipline the agent, resulting in costly default. I further show that such insufficient commitment contracts are likely to be selected by time-inconsistent agents with ‘partially sophisticated’ preferences: Agents who are neither completely unaware nor fully aware of their time-inconsistency, but anywhere in between those two extremes. Chapter 3 describes a randomised experiment in the Philippines: I designed and introduced a regular-instalment commitment savings product, intended to improve on pure withdrawal-restriction products by mimicking the fixed-instalment nature of loan repayment contracts. Individuals from a general low-income pop ulation were randomly offered to take up the product, and were asked to choose the stakes of the contract (in the form of a default penalty) themselves. The result is that a majority appears to choose a harmful contract: While the intent-to-treat effect on bank savings for individuals assigned to the treatment group is four times that of a withdrawal-restriction product (offered as a control treatment), 55 percent of clients default on their <b>savings</b> <b>contract.</b> The explanation most strongly supported by the data is that the chosen stakes were too low (the commitment was too weak) to overcome clients’ self-control problems. Moreover, both take-up and default are negatively predicted by measures of sophisticated hyperbolic discounting, suggesting that those who are fully aware of their bias realise the commitment is too weak for them, and avoid the product. The study suggests that research on new commitment products should carefully consider the risk of adverse welfare effects, particularly for naïve and partially sophisticated hyperbolic discounters...|$|E

When temptation is myopic money burning will never be part of an optimal separating contract, though it can be when temptation is farsighted. Also, when temptation is myopic an individual will strictly prefer mandatory deposits to liquidity constraints. Finally, I find that the optimal borrowing plan when self-control is costly consists of regular payments and self imposed debt limit. ...|$|R
