Such a system is comprised of a parabolic <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> and a hyperboloidal subreflector (Cassegrain arrangement) or an ellipsoidal subreflector (Gregorian arrangement), either of which brings the feed closer to the <b>main</b> <b>reflector.</b> By shaping the subreflector and the <b>main</b> <b>reflector,</b> an improved scan capability might be achieved {{and the size of the}} required feed aperture-per-beam could be reduced. In such a shaped dual reflector system, the need for overlapping cluster feed arrangement and its concomitant beam forming network could be removed.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} calculating the surface shapes for subreflectors in a suboptic {{assembly}} of a tri-reflector spherical antenna system is introduced, modeled from a generalization of Galindo-Israel's method of solving partial differential equations to correct for spherical aberration and provide uniform feed to aperture mapping. In a first embodiment, the suboptic assembly moves {{as a single}} unit to achieve scan while the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> remains stationary. A feed horn is tilted during scan to maintain the illuminated area on the <b>main</b> spherical <b>reflector</b> fixed throughout the scan thereby eliminating the need to oversize the <b>main</b> spherical <b>reflector.</b> In an alternate embodiment, both the <b>main</b> spherical <b>reflector</b> and the suboptic assembly are fixed. A flat mirror is {{used to create a}} virtual image of the suboptic assembly.

40|$|By {{probing the}} field on a small {{subreflector}} at a minimal number of points, the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> surface errors can be obtained and subsequently used to design a phase-correction subreflector that can compensate for <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> errors. The compensating phase-error profile across the subreflector can be achieved either by a surface deformation or {{by the use of}} an array of elements such as patch antennas that can cause a phase shift between the incoming and outgoing fields. The second option is of primary interest here, but the methodology can be applied to either case. The patch array is most easily implemented on a planar surface. Therefore, the example of a flat subreflector and a parabolic <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> (a Newtonian dual reflector system) is considered in this work. The subreflector is assumed to be a reflector array covered with patch elements. The phase variation on a subreflector can be detected by a small number of receiving patch elements (probes). By probing the phase change at these few selected positions on the subreflector, the phase error over the entire surface can be recovered and used to change the phase of all the patch elements covering the subreflector plane to compensate for <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> errors. This is accomplished by using a version of sampling theorem on the circular aperture. The sampling is performed on the phase-error function on the circular aperture of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> by a method developed using Zernike polynomials. This method is based upon and extended from a theory previously proposed and applied to reflector aperture integration. This sampling method provides for an exact retrieval of the coefficients of up to certain orders in the expansion of the phase function, from values on a specifically calculated set of points in radial and azimuthal directions in the polar coordinate system, on the circular reflector aperture. The corresponding points on the subreflector are then obtained and, by probing the fields at these points, a set of phase values is determined that is then transferred back to the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> aperture for recovering the phase function. Once this function is recovered, the corresponding phase function on the subreflector is calculated and used to compensate for <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> surface errors. In going back and forth between sub and <b>main</b> <b>reflectors,</b> geometrical (ray) optics is employed, which even though it ignores edge diffraction and other effects, is shown to be accurate for phase recovery...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates a new {{approach}} {{for dealing with the}} adverse effects of large-scale deformations in the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> of large Cassegrain antennas. In this method, the incident aperture distribution is imaged onto a tertiary focal plane. This is accomplished by using an optical imaging system consisting of a lens mounted behind the Cassegrain focus of the antenna. The lens forms a real image of the product of the incident aperture distribution and the pupil function of the antenna. The pupil function describes the profile of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> of the antenna. If the incident aperture distribution is a plane wave, a real image of the pupil function of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> will be produced at the focal plane of the image lens. Any imperfections in the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> will be imaged onto the tertiary focal plane but over a smaller area as defined by the magnification of the system. In principle, an active correcting element placed into the tertiary focal plane could compensate for these errors, thus preserving the maximum efficiency of the antenna. Experimental verification of this principle was carried out in the lab using a dielectric lens 152. 4 mm in diameter. Phase perturbations were simulated by placing dielectric shims in the incident aperture plane. The phase of these shims in most cases was measured to within 10 degrees in the image plane. This degree of accuracy is found to be quite adequate for correcting large-scale errors in the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> of the antenna...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{dual-mode}} folded microstrip reflectarray antenna {{was developed}} and demonstrated in this paper. The proposed folded reflectarray antenna contains three parts: a planar <b>main</b> <b>reflector,</b> a planar subreflector, and printed feed antennas. The <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> is used to produce twisted reradiated fields and to provide phase compensation for focusing. The subreflector parallel with the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> is made of a substrate printed with high-density metal grid lines, which is transparent to perpendic-ularly polarized fields, but would reflect the parallel ones. Three fixed-position patch antennas with polarization parallel to the grid lines are created for the radar mode, so that the radiation beam is switchable. Another patch with perpendicular polarization is designed for communication. A simple approach was proposed for simulating and designing the folded reflectarray. Measured results show good agreement with the calculated ones. Index Terms—Beam switching, dual-mode, folded reflectarray, millimeter wave. I...|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} {{is presented}} of three techniques {{used for the}} efficient computation of fields diffracted by a subreflector that has been shaped by geometrical optics synthesis. It is found that these techniques, {{which are based on}} the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD), produce errors in the computed fields that are specific to shaped reflectors. These errors are examined for a reflector system shaped to produce maximum gain from a tapered feed illumination. The discrepancies are directly related to the caustic being located near an observation point of the GTD calculations. The errors found are localized, and they increase in magnitude as the caustic approaches the <b>main</b> <b>reflector.</b> In a general offset geometry, the location of the caustic may be located arbitrarily close to the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> given a prescribed output aperture distribution.

40|$|Abstract-Gain loss {{in large}} {{reflector}} antennas due to <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> surface distortion {{is a significant}} problem in both ground and spacecraft antennas. There are two aspects {{that need to be}} considered: 1) Since the shape of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> surface is generally not known it is necessary to determine the characteristics of the actual distortion in real time and 2) A method of compensating for the distortions is required. Three techniques for measuring the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> surface distortion are discussed. 1) A two-camera optical surface-measuring system using photogrammetry, 2) A small array feed placed in the focal plane of the reflector system and 3) Small probes placed on the subreflector.

The algorithm {{is based on a}} convenient splitting of the original problem into two phases, each one involving a sub-problem significantly simpler than the original one. A double reflector synthesis problem involving only Fourier Transform (FT) operators is of concern during the first phase.

Despite this accuracy, the second phase is still numerically effective since it involves a single reflector synthesis problem and exploits, as "good" starting point, the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> estimate obtained during the first phase. The effectiveness of the approach {{is due to the fact}} that the necessity of dealing simultaneously with two reflector surfaces, the key of the synthesis difficulties, is afforded only during the first phase where efficient computational tools are allowed.
