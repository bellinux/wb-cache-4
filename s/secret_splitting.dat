50|$|Double-spending is {{an error}} in a digital cash scheme in which the same single digital token is spent twice or more. This is {{possible}} because a digital token consists of a digital file that can be duplicated or falsified. As with counterfeit money, such double-spending leads to inflation by creating a new amount of fraudulent currency that did not previously exist. This devalues the currency relative to other monetary units, and diminishes user trust {{as well as the}} circulation and retention of the currency. Fundamental cryptographic techniques to prevent double-spending while preserving anonymity in a transaction are blind signatures and particularly in offline systems, <b>secret</b> <b>splitting.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Fourth {{generation}} systems (1990s) {{use more}} commercial packaging and electronic key distribution. Integrated circuit technology allowed backward compatibility with third generation systems. Security tokens, {{such as the}} KSD-64 crypto ignition key (CIK) were introduced. <b>Secret</b> <b>splitting</b> technology allows encryptors and CIKs {{to be treated as}} unclassified when they were separated. Later the Fortezza card, originally introduced as part of the controversial Clipper chip proposal, were employed as tokens. Cryptoperiods were much longer, {{at least as far as}} the user was concerned. Users of secure telephones like the STU-III only have to call a special phone number once a year to have their encryption updated. Public key methods (FIREFLY) were introduced for electronic key management (EKMS). Keys could now be generated by individual commands instead of coming from NSA by courier. A common handheld fill device (the AN/CYZ-10) was introduced to replace the plethora of devices used to load keys on the many third generation systems that were still widely used. Encryption support was provided for commercial standards such as Ethernet, IP (originally developed by DOD's ARPA), and optical fiber multiplexing. Classified networks, such as SIPRNet (Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System), were built using commercial Internet technology with secure communications links between [...] "enclaves" [...] where classified data was processed. Care had to be taken to ensure that there were no insecure connections between the classified networks and the public Internet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a secure scheme for generating a pseudo random numbers. The scheme {{is based on}} <b>secret</b> <b>splitting</b> {{of a piece of}} secure information which is used as a seed to the generator. In this scheme the procedure of splitting the secure information is performed according to a specified weight {{in such a way that}} each segment of the information piece takes a special weight depending on the priority of each part of the random number sequence. Another important concept used in this method is the agreement strategy applied to the secure information. By comparison of this scheme with other methods of generating pseudo random generation, it is found that there are a secure complex relationships among the elements of the random number sequences which are difficult to be discovered by most active attacks.

In {{recognition of his}} success in 1983, Charles Wang was given a [...] "Software CEO of the Year" [...] award. In May 1985, CA-Unicenter was introduced as an integrated collection of many of its recently acquired, mainframe systems products. Its sales (often [...] "wrap & roll" [...] financial deals) helped bring CA enough revenue and market share, especially from existing customers converting from DOS/VSE (z/VSE today) to OS/MVS (z/OS today), that CA was eventually able to acquire its archrival, UCCEL Corporation, in 1987. Ownership of those industry-standard, flagship products (UCC-1, UCC-7, UCC-11, plus ACF2) made CA the largest independent vendor of mainframe infrastructure software and dominant vendor of OS/MVS security software with CA-Top Secret (#2 market share) and CA-ACF2 (#1 market share). IBM's Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) product held the #3 market share position. On 24-May-2012, Jeffrey R. Yost, Ph.D. (conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/132470/oh404bs.pdf) interviewed Barry Schrager, one of ACF2's three original developers, who noted that: (a) When SKK was sold in 1986, ACF2 had a 60% market share while IBM’s RACF and CA’s Top <b>Secret</b> <b>split</b> the other 40%; and (b) Currently (2015), RACF has 75% market share while ACF2 and Top Secret from CA share the other 25 percent.
