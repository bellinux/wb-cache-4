5000|$|By land or sea: [...] "The most {{challenging}} aspect of fish transportation by sea or by road is {{the maintenance of}} the cold chain, for fresh, chilled and frozen products and the optimisation of the packing and <b>stowage</b> <b>density.</b> Maintaining the cold chain requires the use of insulated containers or transport vehicles and adequate quantities of coolants or mechanical refrigeration. Continuous temperature monitors are used to provide evidence that the cold chain has not been broken during transportation. Excellent development in food packaging and handling allow rapid and efficient loading, transport and unloading of fish and fishery products by road or by sea. Also, transport of fish by sea allows for the use of special containers that carry fish under vacuum, modified or controlled atmosphere, combined with refrigeration." ...|$|E

40|$|Value {{density is}} often {{considered}} {{when considering the}} choice whether to ship cargo by air or by water. However, although cargo value is directly linked to the overall cost of shipment, it is the deciding factor in mode choice only for those cargoes with either an extremely high or extremely low value per pound. For cargo in some middle range other criteria, such as <b>density</b> of <b>stowage,</b> perishability, reliability of service, or {{the need for more}} accurate demand forecasting must be considered. The characteristics of international cargoes shipped by both modes in 1992 are examined and a logistics cost for the distribution of representative goods is calculated. A schedule of premiums is developed, which shows the transportation premium arrange of cargo value <b>densities</b> and <b>stowage</b> <b>densities</b> could support if transit time were reduced from the longer times associated with water transport to the shorter times found in air travel. The volume of mode-converted cargo is projected for the year 2030 and the number of aircraft required to transport the cargo is estimated. Cover titleDecember 1994 Also issued as an M.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Future sea bases, {{such as the}} Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future), will serve as key distribution nodes and {{must be able to}} sustain forces ashore and selectively offload supplies from storerooms quickly and efficiently. Current MPF ships maximize the available cargo storage onboard and have little ability to selectively offload supplies. To make selective offload a reality, MPF(F) requires lower <b>stowage</b> <b>densities</b> and new technologies to efficiently move items, especially for those supplies needed in direct support of forces ashore. The difficult questions are how dense and in what configurations MPF(F) storerooms can be packed, and how items should be retrieved in order to selectively offload supplies and provide acceptable response time. We analyze the trade-off between storage density and mean retrieval time in a dynamic environment for different storage densities and configurations in notional storerooms aboard a future sea base. We examine two demand scenarios and two different retrieval rules to determine how each storage configuration responds to retrieval requests over time. Our results provide insight into the types of storeroom configurations that provide the best mean retrieval times and how a simple retrieval rule can significantly reduce mean retrieval time under certain demand conditions.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{alternative}} food sources {{is currently in}} evidence in the world and, therefore, the culture of animal species considered not conventional makes this theme relevant and appropriate. In the present study, the species Pomacea lineata and Pomacea bridgesii, each with three <b>stowage</b> <b>densities</b> (0. 5 [T 1], 1 [T 2], and 1. 5 [T 3] animal/L), were tested. They were analyzed regarding growth rate, weight gain, final biomass, feed conversion and percentage of survival. There was not any statistically {{significant difference between the}} different densities for both species. The final average weight in the three waterworks did not differ significantly in P. bridgesii. In P. lineata, T 1 (22. 3 &# 177; 1. 80 g) was significantly higher than T 2 and T 3. On the other hand, the absolute gain of weight in P. lineata and P. bridgesii was significantly higher in T 1 (21. 9 &# 177; 1. 80 g and 37. 2 &# 177; 6. 34 g) than in T 2 and T 3 respectively. In contrast, the gain of biomass of P. lineata and P. bridgesii was significantly higher in T 3 (276. 3 &# 177; 33. 16 g and 431. 4 &# 177; 37. 20 g) than in T 1 and T 2, respectively. Based on the results obtained, all species studied presented potential for aquaculture, mainly P. bridgesii, distinguished for showing a better development even in waterworks with higher densities. </p...|$|R
