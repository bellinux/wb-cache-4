40|$|Increased US {{export of}} cotton and global {{competition}} necessitates that plant breeders {{continue to improve}} fiber properties of upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.). Cotton cultivars having whiter fibers and more mature fibers are desirable due to decreased processing costs. TAM B 182 - 33 ELS (Extra Long Staple) germplasm line of upland cotton, and Tamcot CAMD-E, a short staple obsolete cultivar were crossed with 36 cultivars representing unique germplasm pools from China (12 cultivars), west and central Africa (7 cultivars), south Africa (10 cultivars), and the United States (7 cultivars) that represent distinct germplasm pools. Parents and F 1 s were grown in College Station, TX, in a Line x Tester design during the summers of 2010 and 2011. Seedcotton was harvested by hand (to avoid the presence of thrash particles in the lint that could bias the color measurements), deburred and allowed to dry in limited light. Cotton samples were ginned on a laboratory <b>saw</b> <b>gin,</b> separated into 2. 00 gram subsamples, and color measurements were taken using a Konica-Minolta CR- 310 reflectance colorimeter. Absolute color measurements were obtained in two color systems (tristimulus XYZ and CIE L*a*b*). At the Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute (FBRI) in Lubbock, TX, 50. 0 mg samples of the 38 parents and F 1 s {{were used to determine}} maturity ratio (MR), ribbon width (RbWth) and micronaire (Mic) on a Cottonscope. The fibers were cut into 2. 0 mm snippets and immersed in an aqueous solution containing a surfactant and NaCl. Approximately, 20, 000 snippets per entry were analyzed for MR, RbWth and Mic in the Cottonscope using polarized light. General and specific combining abilities for all the variables were calculated from the data collected. Despite the evident genetic variation from this study for the degree of fiber whiteness, the difficulties in the phenotypic screening of this trait and its importance relative to other fiber traits are problematic. At this time, it is not advisable to begin a cotton breeding program based upon degree of fiber whiteness. Genetic variation also existed for MR, RbWth and Mic among the distinct germplasm pools utilized in this study, but it is not advisable to begin a breeding program based on RbWth or Mic. However, a cotton breeding program to improve MR would be feasible, especially with fast and repeatable measurements from the Cottonscope...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of cottons with improved fiber quality {{has been a}} major objective in breeding programs around the world. Breeders have focused their attention on improving fiber strength and length, and have generally not used fiber elongation in the selection process. Although literature has reported a negative correlation between fiber elongation and tenacity, this correlation is weak and should not prevent breeders from simultaneously improving fiber tenacity and fiber elongation. Furthermore, the work of rupture property, important in the spinning process, could be best enhanced by improving both fiber tenacity and fiber elongation. Fifteen populations were developed in 2007 by crossing good quality breeding lines with high elongation measurements to ?FM 958 ?; a High Plains standard cultivar with good fiber quality but reduced elongation. Samples in every generation were ginned on a laboratory <b>saw</b> <b>gin,</b> and the lint was tested on HVI (High Volume Instrument). The F 2 and F 3 generations showed a wide range of variation for elongation (6. 9 % - 12. 8 % for the F 2 and 4 % - 9. 20 % for the F 3) allowing divergent selection for low and high fiber elongation. A correlation (r) of - 0. 32 between strength and elongation was observed in the F 2 individual plant selections. In the F 3, the correlation (r) between strength and elongation was - 0. 36, and in the F 4 the correlation (r) was - 0. 08. Nine lines were selected from the original 15 populations for spinning tests. The correlation between fiber elongation and strength for these lines was positive (r= 0. 424), indicating that with targeted selection, fiber elongation and strength can be simultaneously improved. Fiber elongation was positively correlated with yarn tensile properties tenacity (r= 0. 11), work-to-break (r= 0. 68) and breaking elongation (r= 0. 87); and was negatively correlated with yarn evenness properties, number of thin places (r=- 0. 16), number of thick places (r=- 0. 9), nep count (r=- 0. 24), hairiness (r=- 0. 38) and total number of imperfections (r=- 0. 38). All selections for high elongation were superior for all tensile properties compared to the low selections and the check in the analysis over locations and in each location. Furthermore, selections for high elongation were significantly different from the selections for low elongation and the check. In addition to developing lines for fiber spinning tests with improved, or differentiated, fiber elongation, this project was amended to evaluate and determine the heritability of fiber elongation. Three different methodologies were used to obtain estimates of heritability; variance components, parent off-spring regression, and realized heritability using F 3, F 4, and F 5 generation. No inbreeding was assumed because there was no family structure in the generations within this study. Estimates of heritability by the variance component methods in the F 3, F 4 and F 5 were 69. 5 %, 56. 75 % and 47. 9 % respectively; indicating that 40 - 50 % of the variation was due to non-genetic effects. Parent off-spring regression estimates of heritability were 66. 1 % for the F 3 - 4 and 62. 8 % for the F 4 - 5; indicating a high resemblance from parents to off-spring. Estimates of realized heritability were obtained to determine the progress realized from selection for the low and high selection for fiber elongation. Estimates were intermediate (0. 44 ? 0. 55), indicating moderately good progress from selection. The results from this project demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} improve fiber elongation and to break the negative correlation between elongation and strength. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that improving fiber elongation results in the increase of length uniformity index and decreased short fiber content. Additionally, directed divergent selection was a successful methodology for the improvement of fiber elongation, and was useful to demonstrate that higher fiber elongation has a positive effect on yarn tensile properties, yarn evenness and processing. The {{development of}} new cultivars with improved fiber elongation will improve the quality and reputation of U. S. -grown cotton. The ultimate result will be better yarn quality and improved weaving efficiency, and particularly address current weaknesses in U. S. ?grown cotton cultivars, especially from the High Plains of Texas, of more short fiber content, lower uniformity ratios, and weaker yarn strength...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} was into {{the processing of}} long, fine Australian cotton in high-mass throughput <b>saw</b> <b>gins.</b> The research was conducted at the Auscott Narrabri gin in New South Wales, Australia using Australian cotton with a UHML of 30. 9 mm and 31. 8 mm, with a micronaire value of 3. 85. Mass production rates trials ranged between 3200 and 3800 kg/h of lint. In particular, the feed and discharge of seed was investigated, and the results demonstrate that the gin stand motor load frequently fluctuates due to the varying mass input of seed cotton. Furthermore, the distribution of seed cotton presented to the gin stand is laterally non-uniform. It is thought that a non-uniform vertical feed results in elevated nep and seed-coat nep due to the changing seed-roll density. The source of the uneven lateral distribution of seed cotton to the gin stand lies within the design of distributor conveyor, which feeds seed cotton to the gin stand. Because of the high speed required to transport seed cotton in the conveyor distributor, the drop zone of seed cotton to each feed hopper is overshot. The trailing edge of the hopper is further seed cotton deficient. The auger blade together with the auger housing create a nip point allowing for the seed cotton to be {{pulled out of the}} feed hopper. Methods to overcome the problem were trialled,, including redirecting the seed cotton on the gin stand apron, modifying the conveyor distributor, and increasing the seed cotton mass in the affected areas to improve the uniformity of the seed roll density. The uneven input of seed cotton creates an uneven output of fuzzy seed. The region of the gin stand most affected was the corresponding delivery side. This output region expelled up to four times more fuzzy seed than other expulsion areas of the gin stand. The uneven fuzzy seed expulsion is attributed to the seed roll density, as the roll box is unevenly loaded with incoming seed cotton. Uneven loading of seed cotton creates areas within the roll box that experience a reduction in density, and this creates a movement of fuzzy seed from high-density areas to the neighbouring lower-density areas. Therefore, high levels of fuzzy seed expulsion occur in areas of lesser density. The output distribution curve of fuzzy seed equates approximately to the inverse curve of the seed cotton input. Elongation of the leading and trailing edge angle on the hopper of the gin stand was not finalised because of time constraints. This method is believed to enable the elimination of the uneven seed roll. The elongation length may be required up to 60 cm. Overcoming the uneven vertical flow can be achieved through electrical settings of the feed hopper motor. Eliminating the uneven lateral feed has the potential to increase production by approximately 12 per cent. It is envisaged that tight seed roll occurrence will reduce with an evenly loaded seed roll, further increasing productivity. Saw blade wear should also reduce, together with the event of fires as a result of tight seed rolls. Roll box geometry was also investigated, and this highlighted frictional properties, mechanical interaction of the saw teeth, and seed roll densities. Decreasing the time that the seed cotton is present in the roll box would reduce mechanical interaction. Further, the lint mass production rate was investigated, and results indicated that reducing mass production rates decreased nep and seed-coat nep because of a decrease in the seed roll density. Research was conducted on Continental Eagle 161 gin stands. ...|$|R
40|$|Impact of the ginning method on fiber {{quality and}} textile {{processing}} performance of Long Staple Upland cotton Marinus HJ van der Sluijs 1, 2 With the {{increased demand for}} quality {{and the production of}} finer, longer and stronger Upland cottons, an increasing proportion of these cottons are ginned on roller gins to preserve and improve fiber quality. However, although the benefits of roller ginning on lint turn out and fiber quality are fairly well understood, it is still unclear whether these improvements translate into improved yarn quality and processing performance. The aim of this research was to com-pare the impact of <b>saw</b> and roller <b>ginning</b> on Long Staple Upland cotton in a high-production and commercial environ-ment and to evaluate quality and textile processing performance in a commercial textile mill. One field located within the central cotton growing area of Australia was planted with a Long Staple Upland variety, with a number of round modules selected at random from the field and processed by a saw and a rotary knife roller gin. There was {{a significant difference between the}} two ginning methods in some of the average fiber results, with the roller ginned fiber longer and more uniform with fewer short fibers and fibrous neps, as well as stronger with higher elongation. These improved fiber properties resulted in significant differences in the fine count combed hosiery ring spun yarn produced. On average the yarn spun from roller ginned cotton was significantly more even with fewer total imperfections, although there was no significant difference in yarn count, strength, elongation and hairiness. There were also no significant differences in terms of processing performance, fabric handle, appearance and strength...|$|R
40|$|R. Douglas Hurt {{deals with}} the {{invention}} and development of American farm implements and machinery with a special emphasis on the nineteenth century. The material is organized around the functions of various agricultural machines used in the major grain-growing states. Ten chapters focus on the improvements made in plows, grain drills, corn planters, cultivators, reapers, binders, headers, corn binders, corn shellers, threshing machines, combined harvesters, mowing machines, hay stackers, feed mills, and steam traction engines. The author decided to describe certain lines of farm equipment without trying to catalogue all agricultural tools, implements, and machines. Therefore the reader will not find descriptions of such items as cotton <b>gins,</b> <b>saw</b> mills, blacksmith tools, windmills, irrigation pumps, wagons, buggies, washing machines, and hardware materials. Also, during the period 1892 to 1914, no mention is made of the manufacture of {{the internal combustion engine}} and its uses in stationary gas engines, the early tractors, automobiles, trucks, and electric light plants. The judicious use of 219 photographs and illustrations gives a visual presentation of the evolution of rural technology. The verbal descriptions of mechanical and technical matters can be readily understood by the general reader. The book includes a good bibliography and a helpful appendix to aid the reader in understanding the importance of metallurgy as an important factor in the manufacture of farm machinery. Better farm machinery had to wait until the making of steel had been perfected. Some readers would welcome more analysis and interpretation of rural technology. For example, virtually all historians mention that our colonial forefathers used the wooden plow, the sickle, and the flail to grow crops, the same tools used thousands of years earlier in Biblical times. Why was this progress so slow? Why were no new machines invented in colonial America in the 170 years prior to the Revolutionary War? Why did it take two hundred years of experimentation before the first successful track-type Caterpillar engines were built in 1904 ? Combines were widely used in the Pacific Coast states in the 1880 s, yet they were not adopted in the Midwest until the late 1920 s, a lag of forty years. Perhaps historians should give more attention to the factors that deter progress and to the obstacles that prevent the adoption of new ideas, to try to explain the inability of people to adopt new methods. Nevertheless, the narrative is informative and well written. American Farm Tools is a fine addition to the historical record...|$|R
