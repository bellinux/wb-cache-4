40|$|Shell mold casting or <b>shell</b> <b>molding</b> is a {{metal casting}} process in {{manufacturing}} industry {{in which the}} mold is a thin hardened shell of sand and thermosetting resin binder backed up by some other material.

Shell mold casting enables the manufacture of complex parts with thin sections and smaller projections than green sand mold casting. Manufacturing with the shell mold process also imparts high dimensional accuracy. Tolerances of. 010 inches (. 25 mm) are possible.

40|$|Intro/overview: This {{presentation}} {{will describe}} {{a research project}} developed at Falmouth University, UK, which has established a new method of creating glass casting molds directly from 3 D computer drawings. Such an approach opens up new creative opportunities as well as {{eliminating the need for}} physical mold patterns. It also presents a number of distinctive advantages compared with conventional molding methods. The method developed is based on Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) technology, a process commonly known as “Rapid Prototyping” or “ 3 D printing”. The process is based on a concept where the inner part of the mold is printed on a 3 D printer and through a particular post-processing method achieves increased strength and refractory capabilities, The method is the result of collaborative research by Gayle Matthias and Tavs Jorgensen, and the project combines knowledge and skills established in studio glass practice with emerging digital fabrication technologies. Context: Over the last 5 years the creative use of digital fabrication technologies have developed dramatically. Although some of these processes (such as CNC water jet cutting) have been adopted by a number of glass artists, the field of creative glass in general has seen a relatively modest impact of these new technologies. In other creative sectors the use of 3 D printing has seen a rapid growth with open source initiatives such as the RepRap project having a dramatic impact. Some methods for 3 D printing in glass have been developed but these have so far had significant limitations in terms of the geometries, sizes and materials that can be used - and a commercial service for 3 D printing in glass (which was available via the Shapeways Company) has recently been withdrawn. Research at University of Washington has also explored 3 D printing with glass, both in terms of directly printed glass artifacts and also the production of printed refractory molds. However, all of the above mentioned projects differ from the method that we have developed. Project description and research approach: We initiated the project in early 2010 as part of our work at the Autonomatic research group, Falmouth University, UK. Matthias’ background for undertaking this work is her long career as a glass artist and university tutor in contemporary craft practice. During this career she has utilized a wide variety of kiln-formed glass techniques. In particular she has explored the ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>molding</b> technique in terms of glass casting - work that informed much of the early experiments of this project. Jorgensen initially trained as a craft potter before becoming a designer in the ceramic industry. Latterly Jorgensen has focused his practice on academic research into new digital design and fabrication tools and has become a specialist in this field, although he also maintains a very active creative practice. The project started as a series of open-ended creative explorations of the use of various 3 D printing technologies in glass practice. Gradually the direction and focus of the project emerged from these initial experiments. The project was given added impetus when we received sponsorship from the leading 3 D printing company ZCorporation (now part of 3 D Systems), and also the glass supplier, Gaffer Glass (NZ) – following the publication of some of our early results. We view our position as creative practitioners undertaking research and innovation in an field that could previously have been seen as the preserve of specialist engineers, as one of the key element of the success of this project. We argue that this position enables us to contribute with different perspectives, knowledge bases and approaches in the innovation scenario. We consider that another key element in the development of this molding method is the combination of our specialist knowledge of studio glass and digital fabrication technology. Description of method and potential applications: The method that we have developed is based on the widely available ZCorporation 3 D printing technology, using the standard build medium (the ZP 150 powder) to build thin ‘inner mold skins’ which is then strengthened by the application of additional refractory materials. This enables the resulting molds to gain structural integrity to withstand the temperatures needed for glass investment casting. The molds produced via this method are thin (6 - 12 mm in total wall thickness) but very strong. Apart from eliminating the need for a physical mold pattern, the process has a number of other potential advantages compared with conventional molding approaches. In particular the much-reduced mold wall thickness means that lower firing temperatures and shorter firing cycles can be used. The potential for using lower kiln casting temperatures opens up the possibility that a wider range of glass types can be used, and we are currently undertaking a series of promising tests with recycled lime-soda based glass. Initially our main target sector for the method was the creative studio glass practitioners, but we have also received strong interest in the process from large-scale industrial glass producers. Equally, we are also currently exploring the potential of developing the technique for a particular medical application concerning the creation of glass moulds for growing human tissue for reconstructive surgery. This work is due to be undertaken in collaboration with one the UK’s leading research hospitals. We see this development as evidence that the knowledge developed creative glass practice can be highly valuable in a wider innovation scenario, and a strong argument for exploring increased collaboration with practitioners {{from a wide range of}} fields. Initial results from this project were been presented at the ‘Time Compression Technologies’ Conference and Expo in the Ricoh Arena, Coventry, UK in October 2010 and at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, UK in January 2012...|$|E

40|$|The {{investment}} casting process allows {{the production of}} complex-shape parts and close dimensional tolerances. One {{of the most important}} phases in the {{investment casting}} process is the design of the pattern die. Pattern dies are used to create wax patterns by injecting wax into dies. The first part of the project involved preparation of reports {{on the state of the}} art at that time for all the areas under consideration (die-wax, wax-shell, and shell-alloy). The primary R&D focus during Phase I was on the wax material since the least was known about it. The main R&D accomplishments during this phase were determination of procedures for obtaining the thermal conductivity and viscoelastic properties of an unfilled wax and validating those procedures. Phase II focused on die-wax and shell-alloy systems. A wax material model was developed based on results obtained during the previous R&D phase, and a die-wax model was successfully incorporated into and used in commercial computer programs. Current computer simulation programs have complementary features. A viscoelastic module was available in ABAQUS but unavailable in ProCAST, while the mold-filling module was available in ProCAST but unavailable in ABAQUS. Thus, the numerical simulation results were only in good qualitative agreement with experimental results, the predicted shrinkage factors being approximately 2. 5 times larger than those measured. Significant progress was made, and results showed that the testing and modeling of wax material had great potential for industrial applications. Additional R&D focus was placed on one shell-alloy system. The fused-silica <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> and A 356 aluminum alloy were considered. The experimental part of the program was conducted at ORNL and commercial foundries, where wax patterns were injected, molds were invested, and alloys were poured. It was very important to obtain accurate temperature data from actual castings, and significant effort was made to obtain temperature profiles in the <b>shell</b> <b>mold.</b> A model for thermal radiation within the <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> was developed, and the thermal model was successfully validated using ProCAST. Since the fused silica shells had the lowest thermal expansion properties in the industry, the dewaxing phase, including the coupling between wax-shell systems, was neglected. The prefiring of the empty <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> was considered in the model, and the <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> was limited to a pure elastic material. The alloy dimensions were obtained from numerical simulations only with coupled shell-alloy systems.

40|$|A {{primary concern}} in modern fluid {{dynamics}} {{research is the}} experimental verification of computational aerothermodynamic codes. This research requires high precision and detail in the test model employed. Ceramic materials are used for these models because of their low heat conductivity and their survivability at high temperatures. To fabricate such models, slip casting techniques were developed to provide net-form, precision casting capability for high-purity ceramic materials in aqueous solutions. In previous slip casting techniques, block, or flask molds made of plaster-of-paris were used to draw liquid from the slip material. Upon setting, parts {{were removed from the}} flask mold and cured in a kiln at high temperatures. Casting detail was usually limited with this technique [...] detailed parts were frequently damaged upon separation from the flask mold, as the molded parts are extremely delicate in the uncured state, and the flask mold is inflexible. Ceramic surfaces were also marred by 'parting lines' caused by mold separation. This adversely affected the aerodynamic surface quality of the model as well. (Parting lines are invariably necessary on or near the leading edges of wings, nosetips, and fins for mold separation. These areas are also critical for flow boundary layer control.) Parting agents used in the casting process also affected surface quality. These agents eventually soaked into the mold, the model, or flaked off when releasing the case model. Different materials were tried, such as oils, paraffin, and even an algae. The algae released best, but some of it remained on the model and imparted an uneven texture and discoloration on the model surface when cured. According to the present invention, a wax pattern for a <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> is provided, and an aqueous mixture of a calcium sulfate-bonded investment material is applied as a coating to the wax pattern. The coated wax pattern is then dried, followed by curing to vaporize the wax pattern and leave a <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> of the calcium sulfate-bonded investment material.

40|$|Abstract. A Nb-Si system in-situ {{composite}} Nb- 16 Si- 24 Ti- 6 Cr- 6 Al- 2 Hf(at%) was fabricated using vacuum {{arc melting}} method, {{and then was}} metallurgically reacted with four kinds of ceramics ZrO 2, Y 2 O 3 stabilized ZrO 2, Y 2 O 3, SiC+Si 3 N 4 at elevated temperature. The microstructures in the interface reaction zones were investigated by SEM and EDS. The results showed that different extent chemical reactions between the composite and these four kinds of ceramics took place. It {{has been found that}} HfO 2 riched layer formed near the interfaces between the Nb-Si in-situ composite and three ceramics of ZrO 2, Y 2 O 3 stabilized ZrO 2 and Y 2 O 3, and thickness of the reaction zones were about 100 μm, 10 μm, 1 μm respectively. C and N elements in SiC+Si 3 N 4 ceramic diffused to the composite at elevated temperature, and a new phase that rich of Ti, C and N elements appeared nearby the interface and accumulated inhomogenously. It may be concluded that the interface reactions of both ZrO 2 and SiC+Si 3 N 4 with Nb-Si composite were very violent, therefore they are not suitable as face-coat materials of <b>shell</b> <b>molds</b> for investment casting; the interface reaction of Y 2 O 3 stabilized ZrO 2 and Nb-Si composite was slighter than ZrO 2 and SiC+Si 3 N 4, and it can be used as face-coat material of <b>shell</b> <b>molds,</b> the interface reaction of Y 2 O 3 and Nb-Si composite was very slight, and is recommended as an ideal face-coat materials of <b>shell</b> <b>molds...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{experimentally}} reconstruct the 3 D temperature map of a ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> and to investigate its time-dependent thermal behavior during the final part of the investment casting process. The investment casting process is the most used technique to produce very reliable components. Nowadays, there are still too much failing processes that are unacceptable {{in terms of both}} plant downtime and material waste. These failing processes are mainly caused by a non-uniform cooling that can promote thermal gradients in the components leading to a generation of residual thermal stresses.

In the present case, {{the central part of the}} investigated ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> shows strong temperature gradient. This central part is of extreme importance because of the presence of the blades housings.

The complex internal hollow cavities of the airfoil are designed to conduct cooling air through one or more passageways. These complex internal passageways have been fabricated by a lost wax process requiring several processing steps; core preparation, injection molding for wax pattern, and dipping process for ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>molds.</b> Several steps generate problems such as high cost and decreased accuracy of the ceramic mold. For example, costly tooling and production delay are required to produce mold dies for complex cores and wax patterns used in injection molding, resulting in a big obstacle for prototypes and smaller production runs. Rather than using separate cores, patterns, and <b>shell</b> <b>molds,</b> it would be advantageous to directly produce a mold that has the casting cavity and the ceramic core by one process. Ceramic stereolithography (CerSLA) {{can be used to}} directly fabricate the integrally cored ceramic casting mold (ICCM).
