5|$|Males {{and females}} {{have been seen}} {{sleeping}} and foraging together as monogamous pairs, although polygamy and solitary behavior has also been observed. At Kirindy Forest, pairs were observed staying together for multiple seasons, though they were only seen foraging alone, with most interactions resulting from conflicts over feeding sites. Nest sharing among pairs occurs {{one out of every}} three days. During social grooming (allogrooming), the male allomarks females using a <b>scent</b> <b>gland</b> on the throat, and grooming sessions can last several minutes. While feeding, females appear to be dominant, gaining first access to food. Females are also dominant over non-resident males, indicating true female dominance, comparable to that seen in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta).|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are about}} three times larger than mouse lemurs, {{weighing}} approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within Cheirogaleidae, a family of small, nocturnal lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests {{during the day and}} forage alone at night for fruit, tree gum, insects, and small vertebrates. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of torpor during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form pair bonds. The northern species also has the largest testicle size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of seasonally. Home ranges often overlap, with related females living closely together while males disperse. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital <b>scent</b> <b>gland.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tumors, both {{benign and}} malignant, are fairly common in pet gerbils, and are {{most common in}} females {{over the age of}} two. Usually, the tumors involve the ovaries, causing an {{extended}} abdomen, or the skin, with tumors most often developing around the ears, feet, midabdomen, and base of the tail, appearing as a lump or abscess. The <b>scent</b> <b>gland</b> (positioned on the abdomen) should be checked regularly; a veterinarian can operate on the lump where possible.|$|E
40|$|The <b>scented</b> <b>gland,</b> a musk-secreting {{organ of}} male muskrats, shows clear {{seasonal}} changes. When entering the secreting season in March, <b>scented</b> <b>glands</b> gradually increase {{in size and}} active secretion starts. In September, <b>scented</b> <b>glands</b> become gradually smaller and secretion decreases. By November, <b>scented</b> <b>glands</b> are gradually replaced by adipose tissue. In this study, six healthy adult male muskrats were analysed: three from the secreting season (March) and three from the non-secreting season (November). Using RNA-Seq analysis, gene expression profiles of <b>scented</b> <b>glands</b> from both seasons were determined. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, we found that genes involved in calcium and TGF-beta signalling pathways were significantly more expressed in the non-secreting than in the secreting season. These changes in gene expression correlated with alterations in <b>scented</b> <b>gland</b> size. Both calcium and TGF-beta signalling pathways are important regulators of cell apoptosis, which may thus be involved in muskrat <b>scented</b> <b>gland</b> degeneration...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the relationship between}} androgens and {{the function of the}} muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) <b>scented</b> <b>glands</b> during the breeding season, we investigated immunolocalization of steroidogenic enzymes P 450 scc, 3 βHSD and P 450 c 17 in the muskrat testes and <b>scented</b> <b>glands.</b> Nine adult muskrats were obtained in March (n= 3), May (n= 3) and July (n= 3) 2010. Steroidogenic enzymes were immunolocalized using polyclonal antisera raised against bovine adrenal P 450 scc, human placental 3 βHSD and porcine testicular P 450 c 17. Histologically, all types of spermatogenic cells including mature-phase spermatozoa in seminiferous tubules were observed in all testes. Glandular cells, interstitial cells, epithelial cells and excretory tubules were identified in <b>scented</b> <b>glands</b> during the breeding season. P 450 scc, 3 βHSD and P 450 c 17 were only identified in Leydig cells during the breeding season; P 450 scc and P 450 c 17 were observed in glandular cells of <b>scented</b> <b>glands,</b> however, 3 βHSD was not found in <b>scented</b> <b>glands</b> during the breeding season. These novel findings provide the first evidence showing that <b>scented</b> <b>glands</b> of the muskrats are capable of locally synthesizing androgens and androgens acting via an endocrine, autocrine or paracrine manner may {{play an important role in}} <b>scented</b> <b>gland</b> function during the breeding season...|$|R
2500|$|The stoat has large anal <b>scent</b> <b>glands</b> {{measuring}} [...] {{in males}} and smaller in females. [...] <b>Scent</b> <b>glands</b> are also {{present on the}} cheeks, belly and flanks. Epidermal secretions, which are deposited during body rubbing, are chemically distinct from {{the products of the}} anal <b>scent</b> <b>glands,</b> which contain a higher proportion of volatile chemicals. When attacked or being aggressive, the stoat secretes the contents of its anal glands, giving rise to a strong, musky odour produced by several sulphuric compounds. The odour is distinct from that of least weasels.|$|R
25|$|The preorbital gland serves {{different}} roles in different species. Pheromone-containing secretions from the preorbital gland {{may serve to}} establish an animal's dominance (especially in preparation for breeding), mark its territory, or simply to produce a pleasurable sensation to the animal. Because of its critical role in scent marking, the preorbital gland is usually considered {{as a type of}} <b>scent</b> <b>gland.</b> A further function of these glands may be to produce antimicrobial compounds to fight against skin pathogens. Antimicrobial compounds found in these glands may be biosynthesized by the animal itself, or by microorganisms that live in these glands.|$|E
25|$|Like many ant-eating animals, the numbat has {{an unusually}} long, narrow tongue, coated with sticky saliva {{produced}} by large submandibular glands. A further {{adaptation to the}} diet {{is the presence of}} numerous ridges along the soft palate, which apparently help to scrape termites off the tongue so they can be swallowed. The digestive system is relatively simple, and lacks many of the adaptations found in other entomophagous animals, presumably because termites are easier to digest than ants, having a softer exoskeleton. Numbats are apparently able to gain a considerable amount of water from their diets, since their kidneys lack the usual specialisations for retaining water found in other animals living in their arid environment. Numbats also possess a sternal <b>scent</b> <b>gland,</b> which may be used for marking their territories.|$|E
500|$|The ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, [...] {{and brown}} lemurs were once grouped {{together}} in the genus Lemur due {{to a host of}} morphological similarities. [...] For instance, the skeletons of the ring-tailed lemur and the brown lemurs are nearly indistinguishable. However, ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the genus Varecia in 1962, and due to similarities between the ring-tailed lemur and the bamboo lemurs, particularly in regards to molecular evidence and <b>scent</b> <b>gland</b> similarities, the brown lemurs were moved to the genus Eulemur in 1988. The genus Lemur is now monotypic, containing only the ring-tailed lemur.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scent</b> <b>glands</b> are exocrine glands {{found in}} most mammals. They produce semi-viscous {{secretions}} which contain pheromones and other semiochemical compounds. These odor-messengers indicate information such as status, territorial marking, mood, and [...] The odor may be subliminal—not consciously detectable. Though it is not their primary function, the salivary glands may also function as <b>scent</b> <b>glands</b> in some animals.|$|R

50|$|Rüppell's foxes have anal <b>scent</b> <b>glands,</b> {{which are}} used in {{greeting}} one another, and to spray predators. Females also use their <b>scent</b> <b>glands</b> to mark the cubbing den. They make a series of short barks during mating and, at other times, can also produce hisses, trills, and sharp whistles. They {{have been reported to}} wag their tails, like domestic dogs.|$|R
500|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} {{is thought to}} share closer affinities to the bamboo lemurs of the genera Hapalemur and Prolemur than {{to the other two}} genera in its family. This has been {{supported}} by comparisons in communication, chromosomes, genetics, and several morphological traits, such as <b>scent</b> <b>gland</b> similarities. [...] However, other data concerning immunology and other morphological traits fail to support this close relationship. [...] For example, Hapalemur and Prolemur have short snouts, while the ring-tailed lemur and the rest of Lemuridae have long snouts. However, differences in the relationship between the orbit (eye socket) and the muzzle suggest that the ring-tailed lemur and the true lemurs evolved their elongated faces independently.|$|E
500|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs and {{are some of the}} largest members of the family Cheirogaleidae, {{weighing}} around [...] or more. They are the most phylogenetically distinct of the cheirogaleids, and considered a sister group {{to the rest of the}} family. Aside from their dorsal forked stripe, they have dark rings around their eyes, and large membranous ears. Males have a <b>scent</b> <b>gland</b> on their throat, but only use it during social grooming, not for marking territory. Instead, they are very vocal, making repeated calls at the beginning and end of the night. Like the other members of their family, they are nocturnal, and sleep in tree holes and nests during the day. Monogamous pairing is typical for fork-marked lemurs, and females are dominant. Females are thought to have only one offspring every two years or more.|$|E
500|$|Fork-marked lemurs' dorsal (back) fur {{is either}} light brown or light grayish-brown, while their ventral (underside) fur can be yellow, cream, white, or pale brown. A black stripe {{extends from the}} tail, along the dorsal midline to the head, where it forks {{at the top of}} the head in a {{distinguishing}} Y-shape leading to the dark rings around both eyes, and sometimes extends down the snout. The dorsal stripe varies in width and darkness. The base of the tail is the same color as the dorsal fur and is usually tipped in black; the tail is bushy. The lemurs' ears are relatively large and membranous. Males have a <b>scent</b> <b>gland</b> on the middle of their throat, which is approximately [...] wide and pink in color. Females have a narrow, bare patch of white skin in the same location, but theirs does not appear to produce secretions.|$|E
50|$|Mephitis mephitis, {{the striped}} skunk species, {{is the most}} social skunk and the one most {{commonly}} domesticated. When a skunk is kept as a pet, its <b>scent</b> <b>glands</b> are often surgically removed.Skunks can legally be kept as pets in the UK, but the Animal Welfare Act 2006 has made it illegal to remove their <b>scent</b> <b>glands.</b> The keeping of skunks as pets is illegal in most US states.|$|R
25|$|Deer {{have seven}} major {{external}} <b>scent</b> <b>glands,</b> distributed throughout their bodies. These glands are the forehead glands (located on the forehead), the preorbital glands (located below the eyes), the nasal glands (located inside the nostrils), the interdigital glands (located between the toes), the preputial gland (located inside the foreskin of the deer's penis), the metatarsal glands (located {{outside of the}} hind legs), and the tarsal glands (located inside of the hind legs). Though it is not their primary function, the salivary glands also function as <b>scent</b> <b>glands.</b> Deer rely heavily on these <b>scent</b> <b>glands</b> to communicate {{with other members of}} their species, and possibly even with members of other species. A deer may rub its preorbital gland (e.g., on a branch) purely for pleasure.|$|R

500|$|The impala is an {{important}} prey species for several carnivores, such as cheetahs, leopards and lions. The antelope displays two characteristic leapsit can jump up to , over vegetation and even other impala, covering distances of up to the other type of leap involves a series of jumps in which the animal lands on its forelegs, moves its hindlegs mid-air in a kicking fashion, lands on all fours and then rebounds. It leaps in either manner in different directions, probably to confuse predators. At times, the impala may also conceal itself in vegetation to escape {{the eye of the}} predator. The most prominent vocalisation is the loud roar, delivered through one to three loud snorts with the mouth closed, followed by two to ten deep grunts with the mouth open and the chin and tail raised; a typical roar can be heard up to [...] away. <b>Scent</b> <b>gland</b> secretions identify a territorial male. Impalas are sedentary; adult and middle-aged males, in particular, can hold their territories for years.|$|E
500|$|The Bengal slow loris (Nycticebus bengalensis) or {{northern}} slow loris is a strepsirrhine primate and {{a species}} of slow loris native to the Indian subcontinent and Indochina. [...] Its geographic range is larger than {{that of any other}} slow loris species. [...] Considered a subspecies of the Sunda slow loris (N.coucang) until 2001, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Bengal slow loris is most closely related to the Sunda slow loris. [...] However, some individuals in both species have mitochondrial DNA sequences that resemble those of the other species, due to introgressive hybridization. [...] It is the largest species of slow loris, measuring [...] from head to tail and weighing between [...] [...] Like other slow lorises, it has a wet nose (rhinarium), a round head, flat face, large eyes, small ears, a vestigial tail, and dense, woolly fur. [...] The toxin it secretes from its brachial gland (a <b>scent</b> <b>gland</b> in its arm) differs chemically from that of other slow loris species and may be used to communicate information about sex, age, health, and social status.|$|E
500|$|Slow lorises {{produce a}} {{secretion}} from their brachial gland (a <b>scent</b> <b>gland</b> {{on the upper}} arm near the axilla) that is licked and mixed with their saliva. In tests, three predators—binturongs, clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), and sun bears—retreated or showed other signs of displeasure when presented with cotton swabs anointed {{with a mixture of}} the toxic secretion and the saliva, whereas the toxic secretion alone generated mild interest. Before stashing their offspring in a secure location, female slow lorises will lick their brachial glands, and then groom their young with their toothcomb, depositing the toxin on their fur. When threatened, slow lorises may also lick their brachial glands and bite their aggressors, delivering the toxin into the wounds. Slow lorises can be reluctant to release their bite, which is likely to maximize the transfer of toxins. [...] This toxic bite is a rare trait among mammals and unique to lorisid primates. It may also be used for defense against other slow lorises and parasites. According to Nekaris, this adaptation—along with vocalizations, movement, and coloration patterns similar to those of true cobras—may have evolved through Müllerian mimicry to protect slow lorises when they need to move across the ground due to breaks in the canopy.|$|E

500|$|To {{communicate}} with smell, which is useful at night, lemurs will scent mark with urine {{as well as}} <b>scent</b> <b>glands</b> located on the wrists, inside elbow, genital regions, or the neck. The scrotal skin of most male lemurs has <b>scent</b> <b>glands.</b> Ruffed lemurs (genus Varecia) and male sifakas have a gland {{at the base of}} their neck, while the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) and the ring-tailed lemur have glands inside the upper arms near the axilla. Male ring-tailed lemurs also have <b>scent</b> <b>glands</b> on the inside of their forearms, adjacent to a thorn-like spur, which they use to gouge, and simultaneously, scent-mark tree branches. They will also wipe their tails between their forearms and then engage in [...] "stink fights" [...] by waving their tail at their opponents.|$|R
500|$|Females {{have two}} pairs of mammary glands (four nipples), but only one pair is functional. [...] The {{anterior}} pair (closest to the head) {{are very close to}} the axillae (armpit). [...] Furless scent glands are present on both males and females. [...] Both sexes have small, dark antebrachial (forearm) glands measuring 1cm long and located on the inner surface of the forearm nearly [...] above the wrist joint. [...] (This trait is shared between the Lemur and Hapalemur genera.) The gland is soft and compressible, bears fine dermal ridges (like fingerprints), and is connected to the palm by a fine, 2mm–high, hairless strip. [...] However, only the male has a horny spur that overlays this <b>scent</b> <b>gland.</b> [...] The spur develops with age through the accumulation of secretions from an underlying gland that may connect through the skin through as many as a thousand minuscule [...] ducts. The males also have brachial (arm) glands on the axillary surface of their shoulders (near the armpit). The brachial gland is larger than the antebrachial gland, covered in short hair around the periphery, and has a naked crescent-shaped orifice near the center. [...] The gland secretes a foul-smelling, brown, sticky substance. The brachial gland is barely developed if present at all in females. [...] Both genders also have apocrine and sebaceous glands in their genital or perianal regions, which are covered in fur.|$|E
500|$|Giant mouse lemurs use {{at least}} eight vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are contact calls, which sound like [...] "hum" [...] or a [...] "hein" [...] and are used when moving and when meeting {{familiar}} individuals. A [...] "mother-infant meeting call" [...] used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short, modulated whistles. Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior; the female call sounds like [...] "pfiou" [...] and the male call is a short, loud whistle. Both sexes use an alarm call, which sounds like a [...] "croak", and an agonistic call, which consists of repeated [...] "tisk-tisk-tisk" [...] sounds. Females exhibit a [...] "waking call sequence", sometimes referred to as [...] "loud calls", which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter [...] "hon" [...] calls possibly to indicate their position to their neighbors. A long [...] "sexual call sequence" [...] consisting of soft whistle and several modulated, hoarse [...] "brroak" [...] calls is used by both sexes during estrus. Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations, but their purpose has not been determined. The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species. Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication, they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital <b>scent</b> <b>gland</b> on small branches and other objects.|$|E
2500|$|The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) {{was nearly}} hunted to {{extinction}} in Europe, both for fur and for castoreum, a secretion from its <b>scent</b> <b>gland</b> {{believed to have}} medicinal properties. However, the beaver is now being re-introduced throughout Europe. Several thousand live on the Elbe and the Rhône and in parts of Scandinavia. A thriving community lives in northeast Poland, and the Eurasian beaver also returned to the Morava River banks in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. They have been reintroduced in Scotland (Knapdale), Bavaria, Austria, Netherlands, Serbia (Zasavica bog), Denmark (West Jutland) and Bulgaria and are spreading to new locations. The beaver became extinct in Great Britain in the sixteenth century: Giraldus Cambrensis reported in 1188 (Itinerarium ii.iii) that {{it was to be}} found only in the Teifi in Wales and in one river in Scotland, though his observations are clearly second hand. In 2001, Kent Wildlife Trust successfully introduced a family of beavers at Ham Fen, the last remaining ancient fenland in the county close to the town of Sandwich; these are now established and are breeding. In October 2005, six Eurasian beavers were reintroduced to Britain in Lower Mill Estate in Gloucestershire; in July 2007 a colony of four Eurasian beavers was established at Martin Mere in Lancashire, and a small population of probably Eurasian beavers is being monitored in Devon. [...] A trial re-introduction occurred in Scotland in May 2009. Feasibility studies for a reintroduction to Wales are at an advanced stage and a preliminary study for a reintroduction of beavers to the wild in England has recently been published.|$|E
