The document permits a state with urgent need to immediately utilize a watercourse, providing that it notifies <b>sharing</b> <b>states</b> both of the use and the urgency.

50|$|They are {{typically}} used as helper functions or as recursive functions inside another function (as in the quicksort example above). This has the structural benefit of organizing the code, avoids polluting the scope, and also allows functions to <b>share</b> <b>state</b> easily. As nested function can access local variables of the enclosing function, <b>sharing</b> of <b>state</b> is possible without passing parameters to the nested function {{or use a}} global variable, simplifying code.|$|R

50|$|Race {{conditions}} {{arise in}} software when an application {{depends on the}} sequence or timing of processes or threads for it to operate properly. As with electronics, there are critical race conditions that result in invalid execution and bugs. Critical race conditions often happen when the processes or threads depend on some <b>shared</b> <b>state.</b> Operations upon shared states are critical sections that must be mutually exclusive. Failure to obey this rule opens up the possibility of corrupting the <b>shared</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
50|$|While in {{operating}} systems layers are a convenience - {{a way to}} achieve modularity - in networks layers are a necessity, since in networks there is distributed <b>shared</b> <b>state</b> of different scopes. Layers are the tool for isolating distributed <b>shared</b> <b>state</b> of different scopes, nothing else is required. The current Internet architecture uses a layered architecture with a ﬁxed number of layers, every layer having the responsibility of a different function, as depicted in Figure 4 (functional layering).|$|E

5000|$|The idea {{of social}} mood as a [...] "collectively <b>shared</b> <b>state</b> of mind" [...] (Nofsinger 2005; Olson 2006) is {{attributed}} to Robert Prechter and his socionomics. The notion is used primarily {{in the field of}} economics (investments).|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, many {{functional}} languages, such as ML, bind variables directly to values. In this case, {{since there is}} no way to change the value of the variable once it is bound, there is no need to <b>share</b> the <b>state</b> between closures—they just use the same values. This is often called capturing the variable [...] "by value". Java's local and anonymous classes also fall into this category—they require captured local variables to be , which also means there is no need to <b>share</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R
25|$|As with {{directly}} recursive functions, a wrapper function may be useful, {{with the}} mutually recursive functions defined as nested functions within its scope {{if this is}} supported. This is particularly useful for <b>sharing</b> <b>state</b> across a set of functions without having to pass parameters between them.|$|R
50|$|Another {{alternative}} is to <b>share</b> <b>state</b> between the functions through function parameters, most often passing references as arguments to avoid the cost of copying. In C this is generally implemented by a pointer to a structure containing the context. This significantly increases {{the complexity of the}} function calls.|$|R
50|$|This method {{requires}} guessing {{more of the}} <b>shared</b> <b>state</b> to {{be successful}} in impersonation than just the key. While most of the additional state is public, private information could safely be added to the inputs to the hash function, like the server private key.|$|E
50|$|A write {{may only}} be {{performed}} if the cache line is in the Modified or Exclusive state. If {{it is in the}} <b>Shared</b> <b>state,</b> all other cached copies must be invalidated first. This is typically done by a broadcast operation known as Request For Ownership (RFO).|$|E
50|$|It may {{not always}} be {{possible}} to provide a dedicated state deferral option for each service as this clearly requires additional investment.
