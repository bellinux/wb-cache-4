40|$|Abstract: Deoxynivalenol (DON, vomitoxin) is a natural-occuring {{mycotoxin}} mainly {{produced by}} Fusarium graminearum, a food-borne fungi widely distributed in crops {{and it is}} one of the most important mycotoxins in wheat and wheat-based foods and feeds. DON affects animal and human health causing diarrhea, vomiting, gastro-intestinal inflammation, and immunomodulation. Since the rate of the occurrence of DON in wheat is high, effective procedures to remove or eliminate DON from food products is essential to minimize exposures in those who consume large amounts of wheat. Cleaning prior to milling reduced to some extent the concentration of DON in final products. Since DON is distributed throughout the kernels, with higher content in the outer <b>skin,</b> <b>milling</b> is also effective in reducing the DON levels of wheat-based foods if bran and shorts are removed before thermal cooking. DON is water-soluble and cooking with larger amounts of water lowers DON content in products such as spaghetti and noodles. During baking or heating, DON is partially degraded to DON-related chemicals, whose toxicological effects are not studied well. This paper reviews the researches on the effects of milling and cooking on the DON level and discusses the perspectives of further studies...|$|R

30|$|Zinc oxide, {{which has}} {{photocatalytic}} activity, {{is used as}} a white pigment for cosmetics, resulting in a certain amount of sebum on the skin to be decomposed by the ultraviolet radiation in the sunlight. In this work, zinc phosphates as novel white pigments for use in cosmetics were prepared from zinc nitrate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and then ball-milled under various conditions. The chemical composition, powder properties, photocatalytic activity, color phase, moisture retention, and smoothness of the zinc phosphates were studied. The zinc phosphate particle size was decreased by mechanical treatment. In particular, the sample treated with sodium lactate solution had much smaller particles. The milled zinc phosphates exhibited less photocatalytic activity than zinc oxide, and thus should not decompose sebum on the <b>skin.</b> The <b>milled</b> zinc phosphates showed sufficiently high reflectance within the range of visible light to act as novel white pigments. The sample treated with sodium lactate solution had higher water retention than the sample treated with water. Further, the slip resistance and roughness of the powder particles decreased as a result of treatment with sodium lactate solution.|$|R

The solution is achieved by minimizing the internal strain energy, and the results compared with experimental tests. A single loading, consisting of a nose-up couple, is applied to each tip rib. The loading is transferred from the tip rib to an idealized structure by means of simple torsion theory. The idealized structure represents the inboard one-half of each semi-span. Results indicate that an accurate solution of the stress distribution in the actual wing can be achieved provided that the root boundary conditions are preserved. An extension of the analysis is suggested in order to more closely define the maximum accuracy inherent in the particular matrix-force method of solution.

The F-102 engine was a new design, based on the T55 turboshaft that powered the CH-47 helicopter, which was selected {{in order to minimize}} costs. The aircraft had a large cruciform stabilizer in order to improve directional stability for low-level flight. Split ailerons were fitted that could be used as airbrakes. When these airbrakes were operated asymmetrically in conjunction with the aircraft's rudder, sideways control forces could be applied (and the aircraft moved sideways) without yawing or banking, easing weapon aiming.|$|R
40|$|A {{stack of}} a {{flexible}} {{open cell foam}} with a glass fibre mat on top and bottom is used as precursor for a sandwich panel. Due to the flexible state of this stack, the sandwich panels can be produced in complex 3 D shapes, e. g. interior side of a car door. A solid panel is obtained by joining the different components through spray application of a rigid foam reaction mixture. Since the core and skin of the sandwich panel under consideration are formed in situ, they cannot be characterized in advance. Therefore different sample preparation methods and measuring techniques were developped and applied. Computed Tomography scanning and an image processing algorithm were {{used to measure the}} skin thickness. Images of multiple sandwich skins could be made in a single scan by applying an efficient sample preparation method, which considerably decreases the needed amount of time. Tensile experiments on <b>milled</b> <b>skins</b> were performed to determine the stiffness and strength properties. The compressive properties of the skins were measured through four-point bending tests. The results of these experiments demonstrated the stability of the production process.

40|$|The {{presence}} of heavy metals in wastewater {{is known to}} cause severe damage to aquatic life, beside {{the fact that these}} metals kill microorganism during biological treatment of wastewater with a consequent time delay of the treatment process. Chromium {{is one of the major}} heavy metals present in wastewater which has toxic effect and is a strong oxidizing agent capable of being absorbed through the <b>skin.</b> Palm oil <b>mills</b> in Malaysia produce about 4. 3 million tones of shell and the significant problems in the palm fruit processing is managing the wastes generated during the process. The palm shell can be converted into useful products such as activated carbon. So, this method will reduce industrial wastewater problem and will bring benefits to society. Hence, this research aims to use activated carbon produced from palm shell to remove Chromium from industrial wastewater. Pyrolysis was applied for the preparation of activated carbon from palm shell using furnace at 600 ºC. The treatment of activated carbon was carried out by oxidizing it with sulphuric acid and coating with chitosan. Two adsorbents namely Palm Shell Activated Carbon (PSAC) and Palm Shell Activated Carbon coated with Chitosan (PSACC) were used to remove chromium from aqueous solution. The effects of pH of the solution, adsorbent dosage, agitation speed, and contact time on adsorption of chromium were studied. The experimental results proved that the chromium removal efficiency of PSACC was better compared PSAC. Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms were used to analyze the adsorption of chromium from aqueous solution. The results concluded that Freundlich isotherm captured the adsorption of Chromium better compared to Langmuir isotherm as the former have higher correlation regression coefficient...|$|R

40|$|The {{indirect}} rnatrix converter {{has been}} the subject to investigation for some time. One of the favorable features of this con verter is the absence of a de-link capacitar, which allows for the construction of compact converters capable of operating at adverse atmospheric conditions such as extreme temperatures and pressures. These features have been explored extensively and are the main reasons why the matrix converters family has been investigated for decades. The indirect matrix converter features an easy to implement and secure commutation technique, the de-link zero current commutation. Moreover, the conventional indirect matrix converter has bidirectional power flow capabilities and it can be designed to have small sized reactive elements in its input filter. These characteristics make the matrix converter a suitable technology for high efficiency converters for specific applications such as military, aerospace, wind turbine generator system, external elevators for building construction and <b>skin</b> pass <b>mill,</b> where these advantages make up for the additional cost of an indirect matrix converter compared to conventional converters. This converter uses complex pulse width modulation and space vector modulation schemes to achieve the goal of unity displacement power factor and sinusoidal output current. Thanks to technological advances, fast and powerful microprocessors are used for the control and modulation of power converters. To deal with the high processing power needed for these microprocessors, some research has shown the positive potential of model-based predictive control techniques in many power electronics applications. While there are a few challenges to the predictive control method, it has been demonstrated as an appealing alternative to power converters control because its concepts are very intuitive and easy to understand, and it can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} systems. In addition, it may involve multiple variable systems and non-linear constraints, making it an easy controller to implement, especially since it is open to modifications and extensions for specific applications. Predictive current control can be described as a particular case of model-based predictive control which takes into account the inherent discrete nature of the switching states of the power converter and the digital implementation. JVIost of predictive current control methods applied in matrix converters take into consideration the output current regulation and the reactive power minimization on the input side, obtaining input currents in phase with their respective phase voltages. However, this cannot ensure that they present a sinusoidal waveform, especially when harmonic distortion in the source voltage or strong resonances on the input filter are present. To enhance the quality of the source current, in this document is illustrate how the predictive current control can be applied to an indirect matrix converter and how both source and load currents waveforms can be controlled...|$|R
