It allows engineers to design foundations that will be stable in these conditions. There are three different types of pressuremeters. The borehole pressuremeter {{is the most common}} and has a probe that is inserted into a preformed hole (borehole). The second type of pressuremeter is called a self-boring pressuremeter. The self-boring pressuremeter has a probe that is self-bored into the ground to prevent disturbance. The third pressuremeter is called a cone pressuremeter. The cone pressuremeter has a cone <b>shaped</b> <b>probe</b> that is inserted into the base of the borehole, it then displaces the soil into the cone of the probe which causes less disturbance to the soil to get a more accurate reading. Different soil types sometimes require different types of pressuremeter tests.|$|E

In this study, we investigated effects of shape and colour of abstract visual shapes (primes) on the identification of subsequently presented target <b>shapes</b> (<b>probes).</b> Two independent groups of observers were tested. One group was explicitly told that the primes preceding the probes could be relevant for identification, the other group was merely instructed to identify the <b>shape</b> of the <b>probes.</b> We find significant interactions between primes and probes {{in the group of}} observers who received the explicit instructions. These interactions reveal that probes with the same shape and colour as the prime are processed faster than probes with only the same <b>shape.</b> <b>Probes</b> with the same colour as a prime but different shape yield longer response latencies than probes preceded by primes with the same shape and colour, by non-congruent primes, or by no prime at all.

40|$|Background: Transcranial {{electric}} stimulation as {{used during}} intraoperative neurostimulation {{is dependent on}} electrode and skull impedances. Objective: Threshold currents, voltages and electrode impedances were evaluated with electrical stimulation at 8 successive layers between the skin and the cerebral cortex. Patients and Methods: Data of 10 patients (6 f, 53 +/- 11 years) were analyzed. Motor evoked potentials were elicited by constant current stimulation with corkscrew type electrodes (CS) at C 3 and C 4 in line with standard transcranial electric stimulation. A monopolar anodal ball tip <b>shaped</b> <b>probe</b> was used for all other measurements being performed {{at the level of}} the skin, dura and cortex, as well as within the skull by stepwise performed burr holes close to C 3 resp.

40|$|Efficient {{segmentation}} of globally optimal {{surfaces in}} volumetric images {{is a central}} problem in many medical image analysis applications. Intra-class variance has been successfully utilized, for instance, in the Chan-Vese model especially for images without prominent edges. In this paper, we study the optimization problem of detecting a region (volume) between two coupled smooth surfaces by minimizing the intra-class variance using an efficient polynomial-time algorithm. Our algorithm {{is based on the}} <b>shape</b> <b>probing</b> technique in computational geometry and computes a sequence of minimum-cost closed sets in a derived parametric graph. The method has been validated on computer-synthetic volumetric images and in X-ray CTscanned datasets of plexiglas tubes of known sizes. Its applicability to clinical data sets was demonstrated in human CT image data. The achieved results were highly accurate with mean signed surface positioning errors of the inner and outer walls of the tubes of + 0. 013 mm and 0. 012 mm, respectively, given a voxel size of 0. 39 × 0. 39 × 0. 6 mm 3.
