40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{what the}} drivers of contestation of <b>secondary</b> <b>powers</b> vis-à- vis the regional power are, differentiating therein between structural, historical, behavioural and domestic such drivers. We {{argue that in}} regions characterized by relative stability where major interstate violent conflicts are unlikely, {{as is the case}} in South America, <b>secondary</b> <b>powers</b> rely mainly on soft-balancing mechanisms vis-à-vis the regional power. Whereas Brazil’s foreign policy behaviour is key to South American <b>secondary</b> <b>powers</b> being induced to contest the country’s powerhood, the choices that the foreign policy elites of those <b>secondary</b> <b>powers</b> make regarding what the specific expression of soft balancing is to be are influenced by certain domestic groups. Empirical examples are given of how Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela as <b>secondary</b> <b>powers</b> unfold these domestic drivers, which shape their different ways of soft balancing Brazil. The article thus explains why some <b>secondary</b> <b>powers</b> rely more on institutional binding, others on economic statecraft, or buffering, while others contest by offering and building alternative leadership proposals...|$|R

40|$|Rising {{powers have}} {{attracted}} tremendous interest in international politics and theory.

This article seeks to fill this gap by presenting a systematic comparative analysis of the different types of and causes of contestation strategies undertaken by <b>secondary</b> <b>powers.</b> Empirically, it focuses on two contentious regional dyads in East and South Asia, exploring how structural, behavioral, and historical factors shape the way in which Japan and Pakistan respond, respectively, to China's and India's regional power politics. The paper concludes that the explanatory power of these factors depends on the particular context: in the case of Japan, China's militarily assertive regional role has invoked the most significant strategic shifts, while in the case of Pakistani contestation, shifts in polarity have had the largest impact on the strategic approach...|$|R

For example, the first Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly power to amend primary legislation relating to the merger of certain public bodies. However, most <b>secondary</b> <b>powers</b> were conferred on the executive by primary legislation to give the executive (i.e. Ministers) more powers, and the Assembly has had wider legislative powers than appearances might suggest.

60|$|I {{state the}} extreme case, of course; {{but what is}} true of the great man who incarnates the philosophic {{consciousness}} of Life and the woman who incarnates its fecundity, is true in some degree of all geniuses and all women. Hence it is that the world's books get written, its pictures painted, its statues modelled, its symphonies composed, by people who are free of the otherwise universal dominion of the tyranny of sex. Which leads us to the conclusion, astonishing to the vulgar, that art, instead of being before all things the expression of the normal sexual situation, is really the only department in which sex is a superseded and <b>secondary</b> <b>power,</b> with its consciousness so confused and its purpose so perverted, that its ideas are mere fantasy to common men. Whether the artist becomes poet or philosopher, moralist or founder of a religion, his sexual doctrine is nothing but a barren special pleading for pleasure, excitement, and knowledge when he is young, and for contemplative tranquillity when he is old and satiated. Romance and Asceticism, Amorism and Puritanism are equally unreal in the great Philistine world. The world shown us in books, whether the books be confessed epics or professed gospels, or in codes, or in political orations, or in philosophic systems, is not the main world at all: it is only the self-consciousness of certain abnormal people who have the specific artistic talent and temperament. A serious matter this for you and me, because the man whose consciousness does not correspond to that of the majority is a madman; and the old habit of worshipping madmen is giving way to the new habit of locking them up. And since what we call education and culture is for the most part nothing but the substitution of reading for experience, of literature for life, of the obsolete fictitious for the contemporary real, education, as you no doubt observed at Oxford, destroys, by supplantation, every mind that is not strong enough to see through the imposture and to use the great Masters of Arts as what they really are and no more: that is, patentees of highly questionable methods of thinking, and manufacturers of highly questionable, and for the majority but half valid representations of life. The schoolboy who uses his Homer to throw at his fellow's head makes perhaps the safest and most rational use of him; and I observe with reassurance that you occasionally do the same, in your prime, with your Aristotle.|$|E

The optimization is performed over two parameters: the peak <b>secondary</b> transmit <b>power</b> and the difference selection weight δ∈ [0, 1].

40|$|In this paper, a {{cognitive}} radio (CR) network with multiple spectrum bands available for secondary users (SUs) is considered. For the SU's active spectrum-band selection, two criteria are developed. One is {{to select the}} band with the highest <b>secondary</b> channel <b>power</b> gain, {{and the other is}} to select the band with the lowest interference channel power gain to primary users (PUs). With the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement concerning delay, the effective capacity (EC) behaviors over secondary links are investigated for both criteria under two spectrum-sharing constraints. To begin by presenting full benefits in these criteria, the constraint imposed on the secondary transmitter (ST) is the average interference limitation to PUs only. Furthermore, taking into account the ST's battery/energy budget, the ST is imposed by joint constraints on its average interference to PUs, as well as on its own average transmit power. For either constraint, we formulate the ST's optimal transmit power allocation to maximize the SU's EC with both band-selection criteria and, correspondingly, obtain the <b>secondary's</b> <b>power</b> allocation and maximum EC in closed forms. Numerical results demonstrated subsequently substantiate the validity of our derivations and provide a powerful tool for the spectrum-band selection in CR networks with multiple bands available. © 1967 - 2012 IEEE...|$|R
