50|$|A {{capacitor}} with {{a relatively}} low capacitance, and relatively high voltage rating, is connected in series with the start winding and remains in the circuit during the entire run cycle. Like other split-phase motors, the main winding is used with a smaller start winding, and rotation is changed by reversing {{the connection between the}} main winding and the start circuit. There are significant differences, however; the use of a <b>speed</b> <b>sensitive</b> centrifugal <b>switch</b> requires that other split-phase motors must operate at, or very close to, full speed. PSC motors may operate within a wide range of speeds, much lower than the motor's electrical speed. Also, for applications like automatic door openers that require the motor to reverse rotation often, the use of a mechanism requires that a motor must slow to a near stop before contact with the start winding is re-established. The 'permanent' connection to the capacitor in a PSC motor means that changing rotation is instantaneous.|$|R

40|$|Engine {{components}} can {{generally be}} grouped into "speed sensitive" and "load sensitive" categories. Therefore, the maintenance interval {{for each item}} listed in the "Maintenance Management Schedule" is primarily based on the item {{and its relationship to}} either engine speed or load. <b>Speed</b> <b>sensitive</b> items such as water pumps, air compressors, etc., are not primarily affected by the load on your engine during operation. The load on an engine will not significantly accelerate the repair or replacement cycle for <b>speed</b> <b>sensitive</b> items. Therefore, the maintenance intervals established for <b>speed</b> <b>sensitive</b> items are based on miles (kilometers) or service hours, whichever occurs first. Load sensitive items such as piston rings, cylinder liners, etc., are affected by the load on your engine during operation. Generally speaking, the lower the load, the longer the engine life and conversely, the higher the load, the shorter the engine life. A heavy load on an engine will accelerate the repair or replacement cycle for load sensitive items. Therefore, the maintenance interval for load sensitive items also includes quantity of fuel used, since the amount of fuel consumed {{is directly related to the}} load on your engine. Load sensitive items are normally internal engine components. The amount of fuel consumed is directly related to the load on your engine. Since the amount of fuel consumed is a better indicator of performing an overhaul than miles (kilometers) or service hours, Caterpillar recommends performing an overhaul on these items at the specified maintenance interval based on the quantity of fuel consumed...|$|R

Originally, sedans and wagons had S80-series chassis numbers, while the two- and four-door hardtops received the S90-series chassis numbers.

50|$|The {{difference}} between the two equations is the effect of conrod tilting angle that lowers the smallend position whenever it is not at TDC or BDC. This means the imbalance is proportional to the ratio of conrod length to stroke, i.e. the longer the conrod in relation to stroke, the less this imbalance becomes. Also, inertia force is created not by a steady speed, but by acceleration and deceleration of mass movement, so the strength is proportional to the square of crankshaft rotational speed, making the imbalance particularly <b>speed</b> <b>sensitive.</b>|$|R
