25|$|The Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation is the Library of Congress's newest building, {{opened in}} 2007 and located in Culpeper, Virginia.

The campus is designed {{to act as a}} single site to store all of the library's movie, television, and sound collections. It is named to honor David Woodley Packard, whose Packard Humanities Institute oversaw design and construction of the facility. The centerpiece of the complex is a reproduction Art Deco movie theater that presents free movie screenings to the public on a semi-weekly basis.|$|E

40|$|Fabrication of {{high density}} (similar to 155 Gbit in(- 2)) ZnO nanopatterns through in situ {{decomposition}} of Zn precursors inside diblock copolymer templates and their application as charge <b>storage</b> <b>centers</b> in nonvolatile memory devices is described. The fabrication is {{performed in a}} highly controlled fashion with the resulting ZnO nanopatterned arrays exhibiting diameters of 38 nm and heights of 14 nm offering sub- 50 nm feature resolutions. The ZnO nanopatterns are naturally n-type due {{to the presence of}} zinc interstitials and oxygen vacancies that act as defect levels in trapping charge carriers. Test capacitors (metal-oxide-semiconductor, MOS) constructed using nanopatterns formed on p-Si exhibited a large flatband voltage shift of about similar to 2. 2 V for a low operating voltage of 10 V. A high charge trap density of 3. 47 x 10 (18) cm(- 3) combined with a good retention capacity is observed with low tunneling oxide (thermally grown) thickness of 3 nm. This demonstrates the significant promise of the ZnO nanopatterned arrays to act as charge <b>storage</b> <b>centers</b> for potential application in nonvolatile flash memory devices. The charge trapping characteristics, the capacitance-voltage measurements, and the potential of ZnO nanopatterns as charge <b>storage</b> <b>centers</b> in fabricating nonvolatile memory devices are discussed...|$|R
25|$|A Habitat Resource Center {{was built}} in phase one for {{technical}} planning, coordination {{and management of the}} entire project. It also served as the manufacturing and <b>storage</b> <b>center</b> for construction materials. A total of 480 houses were built {{at the end of a}} 3 phase construction process. Each house was provided with proper sanitation using contributions from UNICEF Bangladesh and HFH Great Britain. These transitional shelters were designed to be built by volunteers and unskilled workers in about eight hours on an area that had been prepared by families. This shelter provides a strong and cyclone-resistant core structure to protect residents from severe weather. Extensions to the home when the family has the financial means can be done by adding walling to the existing structure.|$|E
