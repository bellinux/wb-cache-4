5|$|It {{soon came}} time to name the new highway, and an {{upcoming}} visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth {{proved to be the}} focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along the highway (which now connected to Niagara Falls) and passed through a light beam near the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two Union Jacks to <b>swing</b> <b>out,</b> revealing a sign which read The Queen Elizabeth Way.|$|E

25|$|French {{doors are}} derived from an {{original}} French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels {{would be in a}} casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel {{at the bottom of the}} door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may <b>swing</b> <b>out</b> (typically) as well as in.|$|E
25|$|The {{most modern}} method of loading and {{unloading}} a revolver is {{by means of the}} <b>swing</b> <b>out</b> cylinder. The cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is parallel to the chambers, and the cylinder swings out and down (to the left in most cases). An extractor is fitted, operated by a rod projecting {{from the front of the}} cylinder assembly. When pressed, it will push all fired rounds free simultaneously (as in top break models, the travel is designed to not completely extract longer, unfired rounds). The cylinder may then be loaded, singly or again with a speedloader, closed, and latched in place.|$|E
25|$|The {{shock of}} firing can exert {{a great deal}} of stress on the crane, as in most designs the {{cylinder}} is only held closed at one point, the rear of the cylinder. Stronger designs, such as the Ruger Super Redhawk, use a lock in the crane as well as the lock {{at the rear of the}} cylinder. This latch provides a more secure bond between cylinder and frame, and allows the use of larger, more powerful cartridges. <b>Swing</b> <b>out</b> cylinders are rather strong, but not as strong as fixed cylinders, and great care must be taken with the cylinder when loading, so as not to damage the crane.|$|E

25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, <b>swing</b> <b>out</b> over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a {{cushioned}} area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|E
500|$|On his hiring, Baker explained, [...] "I did the Dino De Laurentiis {{version of}} King Kong in 1976 {{and was always}} {{disappointed}} because I wasn't {{able to do it}} as realistically as I wanted. I thought Apes would {{be a good way to}} make up for that." [...] In addition to King Kong, Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on , , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's like going to the dentist at two in the morning and having people poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, <b>swing</b> <b>out</b> of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} round of the show, the six teams {{attempted}} to cross a narrow swimming pool known as [...] "the moat" [...] in a prescribed manner. For example, in one episode, teams were required to <b>swing</b> <b>out</b> to a rope net in the middle of the moat, climb it, and then swim to the other side. All six teams attempted to get both members across according to the rules and push a button on a pedestal to ring a gong. The first four teams to cross the moat and ring their gongs advanced to the second round.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1937, the Middle Road {{was open}} between Toronto and Burlington, where it {{connected}} with what was first known as the Hamilton [...] Niagara Falls Highway.

2500|$|Helpmann {{retained}} {{much of his}} dancer's agility {{for years}} after he had stopped dancing, as shown by a story from Dick Van Dyke about filming Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [...] Whilst filming one of the scenes where the Child Catcher (Helpmann) rides his horse and carriage out of the village, the Cage/Carriage uptilted with Helpmann on board. Van Dyke recalls Helpmann being able to <b>swing</b> <b>out</b> of the carriage and literally skip across the crashing vehicle, and claims that Helpmann did this with incredible grace and agility. Adrian Hall and Heather Ripley, who played Jeremy and Jemimah, described Helpmann as a very generous and kind man. Both would later attend Helpmann's funeral in Australia in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|Ferry favours {{the opinion}} that Voyager misjudged the {{manoeuvring}} room she had. He claims that the destroyer knew where she was in relation to Melbourne and that the turn to starboard then reversal to port {{was intended to be}} a [...] "fishtail" [...] manoeuvre. Voyager was to <b>swing</b> <b>out</b> wide of the carrier, then turn back towards her, cross the stern and assume her position without having to do a loop. However, insufficient time was allowed for Voyager to get clear of Melbourne before turning back to port, so instead of passing behind Melbourne, the destroyer passed in front. Ferry's theory eliminates the need for a double error in the communications signals, and the need for all on the destroyer's bridge to have such a vastly incorrect assumption of where Voyager was in relation to the carrier.|$|E
2500|$|The XF-84H was destabilized by the {{powerful}} torque from the propeller, as well as inherent problems with supersonic propeller blades. A number of exotic blade configurations were tested before settling on a final design. Various design features were intended to counteract the massive torque, including mounting the left leading edge intake [...] further forward than the right, and providing left and right flaps with differential operation. The two prototypes were equally plagued with engine-related problems affecting other aircraft fitted with T40 engines, such as the Douglas XA2D Skyshark and North American A2J Super Savage attack aircraft. A notable feature of the design was that the XF-84H was the first aircraft to carry a retractable/extendable ram air turbine. In the event of engine failure, it would automatically <b>swing</b> <b>out</b> into the airstream to provide hydraulic and electrical power. Due to frequent engine problems, as a precaution, the unit was often deployed in flight.|$|E
2500|$|In 1889, Colt {{introduced}} the Model 1889, the first truly modern double action revolver, which differed from earlier double action revolvers {{by having a}} [...] "swing-out" [...] cylinder, {{as opposed to a}} [...] "top-break" [...] or [...] "side-loading" [...] cylinder. <b>Swing</b> <b>out</b> cylinders quickly caught on, because they combined the best features of earlier designs. Top-break actions gave the ability to eject all empty shells simultaneously, and exposed all chambers for easy reloading, but having the frame hinged into two halves weakened the gun and negatively affected accuracy, due to lack of rigidity. [...] "Side-loaders", like the earlier Colt Model 1871 and 1873, gave a rigid frame, but required the user to eject and load one cylinder at a time, as they rotated the cylinder to line each chamber up with the side-mounted loading gate. Smith & Wesson followed 7 years later with the Hand Ejector, Model 1896 in [...]32 S Long caliber, followed by the very similar, yet improved, Model 1899 (later known as the Model 10), which {{introduced the}} new [...]38 Special cartridge. The Model 10 {{went on to become the}} best selling handgun of the 20th century, at 6,000,000 units, and the [...]38 Special is still the most popular chambering for revolvers in the world. These new guns were an improvement over the Colt 1889 design since they incorporated a combined center-pin and ejector rod to lock the cylinder in position. [...] The 1889 did not use a center pin and the cylinder was prone to move out of alignment.|$|E
50|$|In {{the older}} dunes {{north of the}} {{coastguard}} station, between {{the sea and the}} West Lancashire Golf Club, there are still some remains of the old wartime defences. The navigable shipping channel in Liverpool Bay, connecting the River Mersey to the Irish Sea, runs parallel to the beach to around the coastguard station where it <b>swings</b> <b>out</b> to sea.|$|R
