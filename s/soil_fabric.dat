40|$|In {{the process}} of soil dehydration, the <b>soil</b> <b>fabric,</b> water content, and void ratio vary with soil suction. They all can be {{regarded}} as variables depending on soil suction and soil history. At a particular state, the <b>soil</b> <b>fabric,</b> which can be characterized by a pore size distribution, inherently determines the water content and the void ratio. In this study, the monotonic drying process of soil was analyzed under an integrated framework of <b>soil</b> <b>fabric,</b> suction, void ratio, and water content. Under this framework, the drying process of slurry samples and overconsolidated samples were distinguished and investigated separately, including their drying mechanisms and the variations of <b>soil</b> <b>fabric,</b> soil shrinkage curve, and soil water characteristic curve. From the theoretical analysis, in a monotonic drying process, the envelope of the cumulative pore volume curves was found to be the soil-water characteristic curve and the shrinkage curve was found to be located in a narrow range that can be determined using the cumulative pore volume curve. These findings were further verified by the laboratory test data on a clay with sand...|$|E

And this method have projected many interesting problems to the physical chemistry of detergency, and have broken the common and fixed idea about laundery and washing. This laundering method was constructed from the following chief process; <b>soiled</b> <b>fabrics</b> were coated with a solution of high-polymer or the mixture of high-polymer and surfactant, then dried, and laundered in merely water. There were also many variations, for instance, laundering in a solution of detergent and the omission of the drying.

Then the effect of this laundering method for hydrophobic fibers was compared with hydrophilic cell ulosic fibers. The obtained results of this method have driven off the fixed idea that <b>soiled</b> <b>fabrics</b> and garments must be laundered by the immersion of it in a solution of detergent or organic solvents, and it seems that there might be more variations of laundering method when high-polymers were effectively used...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{influence}} of bonding and <b>soil</b> <b>fabric,</b> the behavior of a natural soil differs significantly from that of a remolded soil. It has been found that a soil with bonding may exhibit enhanced soil strength, stiffness as well as brittleness, and the <b>soil</b> <b>fabric</b> may lead to anisotropic soil behavior. A general failure criterion and constitutive framework considering both aspects of natural soils is of significant importance for practical analysis and design of geo-structures. In this paper, we first employ an anisotropic failure criterion to characterize the peak strength of cemented sands and natural clays. By replacing the constant frictional parameter with a hardening parameter, the anisotropic failure criterion is then modified to be a yield function, based on which a constitutive model is proposed to describe the effect of bonding and fabric anisotropy on the behavior of naturally bonded soil. Simulations of the behavior of cemented sands by the model agree favorably with test results...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to density and stress, fabric {{is also a}} key state variable strongly affecting soil behavior. While fabric influence on mechanical behavior of soils has been investigated experimentally, the available database is limited in terms of boundary conditions and soil types tested. Offshore carbonate sediments are of special interest for offshore geotechnical analyses due to their prevalence in tropical waters and unique mechanical behavior that stems from their mostly biogenic origin. A key gap in the availability of experimental data on <b>soil</b> <b>fabric</b> relates to the anisotropy of offshore carbonate sediments. In practice, anisotropy studies (whether rigorously correlated to fabric or not) are typically carried out experimentally for simple boundary conditions such as idealized plane strain and axisymmetric states. In real geotechnical applications, stress paths subjected to soil elements {{in the field are}} far more complex, often involving the combined variations of both the orientation and magnitude of all three principal stresses. This paper presents a new multi- scale approach to assess <b>soil</b> <b>fabric</b> at the micro-scale level and relate it to the macro- mechanical response observed for generalized loading conditions. A new sampling method is illustrated that enables preservation and evaluation of the fabric of offshore sediments specimens following generalized stress disturbances imparted by a hollow cylinder apparatus. The link between fabric evolution and the observed stress-strain behavior of sand is discussed along with preliminary results. The approach is part of a broad framework that will be used to systematically study the evolution of <b>soil</b> <b>fabric</b> and anisotropy and their relationship to multi-directional loading scenarios...|$|E

The plain woven <b>soil</b> release <b>fabric</b> {{was found to have}} a significantly longer time to second degree burn (4.5  ±  2.1  s) than the twill woven <b>soil</b> release <b>fabric</b> (2.9  ±  1.1  s) (F 3, 95  =  13.27, p ≤  0.001), which was the inverse of the overall effect of fabric type on time to second degree burn. The plain woven <b>soil</b> release <b>fabric</b> also had a significantly lower total absorbed energy for all layers (228.3  ±  15.9  kJ m− 2) than the twill woven <b>soil</b> release <b>fabric</b> (278.2  ±  17.8  kJ m− 2) at the upper sensor (F 3, 96  =  21.94, p ≤  0.001). This significant interaction between fabric type and finish was due to the presence of the soil release finish. Typically the heavier-weight twill-weave fabrics offered better protection against predicted burn injury than plain weave <b>fabrics.</b> The <b>soil</b> release finish <b>fabric</b> was the exception to this trend. Soil release finishes applied to the fabric diffuses water under the soil to help remove this soil during laundering (Kissa 1981). The higher absorbed energy found for the twill weave fabrics {{may be due to the}} nature of the finish as the soil-release finish has the ability to reabsorb and remove <b>soil</b> from the <b>fabric</b> (Kissa 1981). This process of drawing in moisture may be the reason for absorbing more energy. As the twill woven fabrics are heavier and thicker than the plain woven fabrics it is possible that this added effect of absorbing more hot liquid made the twill fabrics store more energy than the plain fabrics.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Fabric {{anisotropy}} affects {{importantly the}} overall behaviour of sand including its strength and deformation characteristics. While both experimental and numerical {{evidence indicates that}} <b>soil</b> <b>fabric</b> evolves steadily with the applied stress/strain, how evolving fabric influences the initiation and development of shear band in sand remains an intriguing question to be fully addressed.

In particular, a critical state sand plasticity model accounting for the effect of fabric and its evolution {{is used in the}} finite element analysis of plane strain compression tests. It is found that the initiation of shear band is controlled by the initial fabric, while the development of shear band is governed by two competing physical mechanisms, namely, the structural constraint and the evolution of fabric.

40|$|The {{retention}} {{capability of}} granular filters {{is controlled by}} the narrow constrictions connecting the voids within the filter.

This paper reports the results of direct, particle-scale measurement of the constriction size distribution (CSD) within virtual samples of granular filters created using the discrete-element method (DEM). A previously proposed analytical method that predicts the full CSD using inscribed circles to estimate constriction sizes is found to poorly predict the CSD for widely graded filters due to an over-idealisation of the <b>soil</b> <b>fabric.</b> The DEM data generated are used to explore quantitatively the influence of the coefficient of uniformity, particle size distribution and relative density of the filter on the CSD.

The experimental study focussed {{on the evolution of}} the compacted <b>soil</b> <b>fabric,</b> including the macropores, mesopores, and micropores under various hydromechanical conditions. The variation of void ratio of both samples was initially studied during a single wetting and drying cycle. The experimental results confirm the existence of a suction limit between the meso- and macropores (sm/M) as well as the soil "shrinkage limit" suction (sSL). The suction increase between (sm/M) and (sSL) completely eliminated the macropores and produced mesostructural rearrangement. The higher suctions modified the meso- and micropores. The measured soil water retention curves (SWRC) of these two soils compared with the MIP calculations showed a more reasonable agreement for the dense soil with a fewer macropores. Moreover, several wetting and drying cycles were applied to the remoulded samples. The suction cycles produced a cumulative swelling strain for the dense soil while a shrinkage accumulation was observed for the loose samples. The wetting/drying cycles induced an equilibrium stage in which the samples behaved in an elastic way.

In order to extend the analysis to <b>soil</b> <b>fabrics,</b> four ideal coarse gained packings were subdivided into their smallest repeating units. These repeating units, along with the measured dependence of the contact angles and surface tension on salt types, allowed an estimation of the equilibrium behavior of the capillary rise and tensile strength within a uniform coarse-grained fabric.

A loading/unloading cycle was applied to samples with different initial dry densities (1. 27, 1. 48, and 1. 55 Mg m− 3) at different constant suctions (0, 2, and 8 MPa). We noted that the initial state of the soils after compaction significantly influenced the values of the apparent preconsolidation stress p 0 (s), the virgin compression index λ(s), and the elastic compression index κ. These experimental results provided a sufficient database to interpret the mechanical behaviour of the swelling soil and define three yielding surfaces: - the suction limit between micro- and macrostructure (sm/M) and the suction limit between nano- and microstructure (sn/m), which depend completely on the <b>soil</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the diameter separating the nano-, micro-, and macrostructure, - the Loading Collapse (LC) curve, representing the preconsolidation stress variation as a function of suction, - the Saturation Curve (SC), representing the variation of the saturation stress (Psat) as a function of suction. In general, we can state that the increase of compaction pressure unified the LC and SC surfaces and decreased the (sm/M) value without modifying the (sn/m) valu...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} in this paper to study the effect of specimen preparation method on the stress-strain behavior of sand in plane-strain compression tests. The data obtained from K 0 consolidation, drained, undrained and strain path tests conducted on medium loose specimens prepared by the moist-tamping (MT) and the water sedimentation (WS) methods are compared. The test data show that the plane-strain compression behavior of medium loose sand under K 0, drained and strain-path controlled (including undrained) conditions is affected by the speci- men preparation method. Under K 0 conditions, the K 0 values obtained from the MT specimens are generally lower than those obtained from the WS specimens. Under drained conditions, more contractive behavior was observed for the MT sand. However, the failure stress ratio (or the failure friction angle) was not affected by the specimen preparation method. The data {{presented in this paper}} also illustrate that the compression behavior of medium loose sand in strain-path testing can be affected by the specimen preparation method. However, the differences in the stress-strain behavior will also depend on the strain increment ratio (d v/d 1) imposed on the specimens. In general, different behaviors of the moist-tamped and water- deposited specimens reflect the influence of <b>soil</b> <b>fabrics</b> on the stress-strain behavior of sand...|$|R
