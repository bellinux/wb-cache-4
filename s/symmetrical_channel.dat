Whereas modularity within one-domain <b>symmetrical</b> <b>channels</b> is established, {{little is known about}} the roles of individual regions within more complex asymmetrical channels where the domains have undergone substantial divergence. Here we isolated and characterised both of the divergent pore regions from human TPC 2, a two-domain channel that holds a key intermediate position in the evolution of voltage-gated ion channels. In HeLa cells, each pore localised to the ER and caused Ca 2 + depletion, whereas an ER-targeted pore mutated at a residue that inactivates full-length TPC 2 did not. Additionally, one of the pores expressed at high levels in E. coli. When purified, it formed a stable, folded tetramer. Liposomes reconstituted with the pore supported Ca 2 + and Na+ uptake that was inhibited by known blockers of full-length channels. Computational modelling of the pore corroborated cationic permeability and drug interaction. Therefore, despite divergence, both pores are constitutively active in the absence of their partners and retain several properties of the wild-type pore. Such symmetrical ‘pore-only’ proteins derived from divergent channel domains may therefore provide tractable tools for probing the functional architecture of complex ion channels...|$|R

The one-dimensional method allows us to connect in a self-consistent way ion dynamics in the bulk solution and inside the channel by taking into account access resistance to the channel. In order to glue the PNP solution in the bulk to that inside the channel, a continuity condition is used for the concentration and the current near the channel mouth at the surface of the hemisphere. The resulting one dimensional (1 D) current-voltage characteristics are compared with the Kurnikova(16) results which are in good agreement with experimental measurement on the channel, by using a filling factor as the only fitting parameter.

The paper {{provides}} a physical description of ionic transport through the rigid <b>symmetrical</b> <b>channel.</b> A three-dimensional mathematical model, {{in which the}} ionic transport is treated as the electrodiffusion of ions, is presented. The model bases on {{the solution of the}} 3 D Nernst-Planck-Poisson system for cylindrical geometry. The total flux includes drift (convection) and diffusion terms.

The numerical solutions of the coupled differential diffusion equation system are obtained by finite element method. Examples are presented in which the flow characteristics at the stationary state and during time evolution are compared. It is shown that the stationary state is achieved after about 2 × 10 - 8 s since the process beginning. Various initial conditions (channel charging and dimensions) are considered as the key parameters controlling the selectivity of the channel. The model allows determining the flow characteristic, calculating the local concentration and potential across the channel.

Secretins are essential components of Gram-negative Type 2 / 3 secretion systems, spanning the outer membrane and interacting with the inner membrane components of transport machinery.

40|$|Interactive {{encoding}} and decoding {{based on}} binary low-density parity-check codes with syndrome accumulation (SA-LDPC-IED) is proposed and investigated. Assume {{that the source}} alphabet is GF(2), and the side information alphabet is finite. It is first demonstrated how to convert any classical universal lossless code C_n (with block length n and side information available to both the encoder and decoder) into a universal SA-LDPC-IED scheme. It is then shown that with the word error probability approaching 0 sub-exponentially with n, the compression rate (including both the forward and backward rates) of the resulting SA-LDPC-IED scheme is upper bounded by a functional of that of C_n, which in turn approaches the compression rate of C_n for each and every individual sequence pair (x^n,y^n) and the conditional entropy rate H(X |Y) for any stationary, ergodic source and side information (X, Y) as the average variable node degree l̅ of the underlying LDPC code increases without bound. When applied to the class of binary source and side information (X, Y) correlated through a binary <b>symmetrical</b> <b>channel</b> with cross-over probability unknown to both the encoder and decoder, the resulting SA-LDPC-IED scheme can be further simplified, yielding even improved rate performance versus the bit error probability when l̅ is not large.

As a by-product, probability bounds involving LDPC established in the course are also interesting on their own and expected to have implications on the performance of LDPC for channel coding as well.

The plates are maintained at a constant uniform temperature and the lower plate is covered by thin liquid water film. The liquid film {{is assumed to be}} extremely thin and its temperature is equal to the wall temperature. A 2 D fully elliptical model, associated with the Boussinesq assumption, is used to take into account axial diffusion. The solution of this mathematical model is based on the finite volume method and the velocity-pressure coupling is handled by the SIMPLER algorithm. Combined buoyancy forces effects on laminar mixed in <b>symmetrical</b> isothermal <b>channel</b> were investigated. Results show that buoyancy forces have an important effect on the hydrodynamic field {{as well as on the}} heat and mass transfer characteristics. Thus, for cold plates and an upward hot air flow, these forces induce a flow reversal near the plates for high air temperatures and mass fractions. Additionally, heat transfer associated with phase change (i. e. latent heat transfer) is more important compared with sensible heat transfer. Flow reversal was investigated in <b>symmetrical</b> isothermal vertical <b>channel</b> and asymmetrical isothermal inclined channel. For the inclined channel, only the lower plate is wetted by a thin liquid water film while the other one is impermeable. We discuss the effect of the buoyancy forces on the hydrodynamic, heat and mass fields. Thus, these forces induce a flow reversal when there intensities are important. It is established that heat transfer associated with phase change is, sometimes, more significant than sensible heat transfer. Furthermore, this importance depends on the mass fraction gradient. The conditions for the existence of flow reversal are presented in charts and analytical expressions. These charts specify the critical thermal Grashof number as a function of the Reynolds number for different values of the solutal Grashof number and different channel inclinations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the influences of floodplain impermeable groynes on flow structure, velocity, and water depth around the groyne(s). A wooden <b>symmetrical</b> compound <b>channel</b> was used. Groyne models with three different groyne relative lengths, 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. 0, were used on one floodplain with single and series arrangements. Analysis of the experimental results using the measured flow velocity and water depth values showed that flow structure, velocity, and water depth mainly depend on groyne relative length and the relative distance between series groynes. The flow velocity at the main channel centerline increased by about 40 %, 60 %, and 85 %, and in other parts on the horizontal plane at the floodplain mid-water depth by about 75 %, 125 %, and 175 % of its original value in cases of one-side floodplain groyne(s) with relative lengths of 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. 0, respectively. The effective distance between two groynes in series arrangement ranges from 3 to 4 times the groyne length. Using an impermeable groyne with a large relative length in river floodplains increases the generation of eddy and roller zones downstream of the groyne, leading to more scouring and deposition.
