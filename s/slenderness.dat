After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the <b>slenderness</b> of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, the volume of the esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth. Like other aquatic amniotes, Dinocephalosaurus would have swallowed and digested its prey head-first, as evinced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.|$|E

40|$|New design methodologies {{are being}} {{developed}} to allow stocky steel members to attain and exceed the full plastic condition. For theoretical validation, such methods require a characterisation of the uniaxial stress-strain behaviour of structural steel beyond an idealised elastic-plastic representation. However, the strain hardening properties of carbon steels are not currently guaranteed by the standards or by any steel manufacturer. Assumptions must thus be made on what values of these properties are appropriate, often based on limited information {{in the form of}} individual stress-strain curves. There is very little consistency in the choices made. This paper first illustrates, using an example elastic-plastic finite element calculation, that a stocky tubular structure can attain the full plastic condition at <b>slendernesses</b> comparable with those defined in current standards and supported by experiment when using only a very modest level of strain hardening, initiated at first yield. It is then hypothesised that the yield plateau in the stress-strain curve for structural carbon steels, classically treated as flat and with zero tangent modulus, actually has a small but statistically significant positive finite gradient. Finally, a robust set of linear regression analyses of yield plateau gradients extracted from 225 tensile tests appears to support this hypothesis, finding that the plateau gradient is of the order of 0. 3 % of the initial elastic modulus, consistent with what the finite element example suggests is sufficient to reproduce the full plastic condition at experimentally-supported <b>slendernesses...</b>|$|R

The Pratt truss design remained popular as bridge designers switched from wood to iron, and from iron to steel. [...] This continued popularity of the Pratt truss is {{probably due to the}} fact that the configuration of the members means that longer diagonal members are only in tension for gravity load effects. [...] This allows these members to be used more efficiently, as <b>slenderness</b> effects related to buckling under compression loads [...] (which are compounded by the length of the member) will typically not control the design.

There are several theoretical and numerical approaches available concerning the pile bearing capacity in cohessionless soil, however, {{there is a}} need for the development of an accurate and more robust predictive model. In this technical note, the details of experimental work to investigate the pile bearing capacity penetrated in dense sub rounded sand as confirmed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) tests with a Dr of 85 % is discussed.

A series of numerical parametric studies is presented, using the validated finite element (FE) models from the companion paper, with the aim of generating further structural performance data over a wider range of stainless steel grades, cross-section <b>slendernesses</b> and combinations of loading. The considered parameters include the outer cross-section diameter, the ratio of outer cross-section diameter to thickness and the initial loading eccentricity. Both the experimentally and numerically derived section capacities were compared with the strength predictions determined from the current European code, the American specification and the Australian/New Zealand standard, allowing the applicability of each codified method to be assessed. The comparisons revealed that the current design standards generally result in unduly conservative and scattered strength predictions for stainless steel circular hollow sections under combined loading, which can be primarily attributed to the neglect of strain hardening in the determination of cross-section resistances and to the use of linear interaction formulae. To overcome these shortcomings, improved design rules are proposed through extension of the deformation-based continuous strength method (CSM) to the case of circular hollow sections subjected to combined loading. Comparisons between the proposals and the test and FE results indicate a high level of accuracy and consistency in the predictions.

Its entirely Doric entablature is indicated by painted clay plaques, probably early example of metopes, and clay triglyphs.

The earliest stone columns did not display the simple squatness of the high and late Archaic specimens, but rather mirror the <b>slenderness</b> of their wooden predecessors. Already around 600 BC, the demand of viewability from all sides was applied to the Doric temple, leading to the mirroring of the frontal pronaos by an opisthodomos at the back. This early demand continued to affect Doric temples especially in the Greek motherland. Neither the Ionic temples, nor the Doric specimens in Magna Graecia followed this principle.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{and design}} of prestressed steel structures, {{with an emphasis on}} trussed arches, are examined in this thesis. For long-span structural systems, where self-weight becomes an increasingly dominant component of the design loading, significant material savings can be achieved through the use of high tensile strength steel cables in conjunction with conventional steelwork. Further benefits can be achieved by prestressing the cables. In the system currently being investigated, the prestressed cables, which are housed within the bottom chord of tubular arched trusses, apply a compressive force to the chord members, which is opposite in nature to the resultant forces arising from the externally applied gravity loads. The stability of the trussed elements under prestress and the load [...] deformation response of the prestressed elements to the subsequent application of tensile loading are examined analytically, numerically and experimentally, with good correlation achieved between the three approaches. The benefits of prestressing, in terms of increased member strength and stiffness, are demonstrated, and optimal prestress levels are investigated. In instances of load reversal (e. g. due to wind uplift) in trusses without horizontal end anchorage that would allow catenary forces to develop, the presence of prestress can become detrimental. To examine this, a total of eight pin-ended cable-in-tube systems, featuring both non-grouted and grouted members, were tested in compression. Increasing initial prestress levels was found to reduce the capacity of the system in compression, but initial prestress was shown to be less detrimental than externally applied compressive loading of the same magnitude, due to the absence of second order bending moments. Finite element models were developed and, following accurate replication of test results, were used to generate parametric results for a range of member <b>slendernesses</b> and prestress levels. The test and FE results were compared against capacity predictions based on a proposed modified Perry-Robertson design method. Consistent, accurate and generally safe-side predictions were achieved. Following the examination of behaviour of individual prestressed elements within the truss, a series of analytical and numerical models of the full arched truss system were developed to investigate its global structural behaviour. Parametric studies revealed that the horizontal end boundary conditions, prestress level, truss depth and diagonal member arrangements were the key parameters influencing the stiffness, load bearing capacity and failure mode of the structure.

40|$|Compression members, {{made from}} slender {{metallic}} plate elements, {{are prone to}} a wide range of different elastic instability phenomena. A thin-walled I-section strut, made from a linear elastic material, can suffer from the nonlinear interaction between a global (Euler) buckling mode, and a local flange plate buckling mode. The interactive buckling behaviour is usually much more unstable than when the modes are triggered individually and hence significantly reduces the load-carrying capacity of real struts. The current work focuses on such a problem using an analytical approach, the methodology of which has been well established in previous works on sandwich struts and I-section beams. An analytical model that describes the interactive buckling of a thin-walled I-section strut under pure compression based on variational principles is presented. Analytical formulations combining the Rayleigh–Ritz method and continuous displacement functions are presented to derive a series of systems that comprise differential and integral equilibrium equations for the structural component. Solving the systems of equations with numerical continuation reveals progressive cellular buckling (or snaking) arising from the nonlinear interaction between the weakly stable global buckling mode and the strongly stable local buckling mode. The resulting behaviour is highly unstable and when the model is extended to include geometric imperfections it compares excellently with some recently published experiments. Imperfection sensitivity studies reveal high sensitivity to both global and local imperfection types. The worst forms of local imperfection are identified in terms of the initial wavelength, amplitude and degree of localization. The effect of the varying rigidity of the joint of the section web and flanges is also studied and a rapid erosion of the cellular buckling response is revealed with increasing rigidity of the flange–web joint. A shell-based nonlinear finite element model is presented, primarily for validation purposes. The results from the analytical and finite element models show a good comparison, particularly for higher rigidities of the flange–web joint. A parametric study is conducted for two limiting cases, where the flange–web joint is assumed to be fully pinned or fully rigid. For a chosen set of geometries, the most undesirable interactive region is identified for both global and local <b>slendernesses,</b> in terms of the strut length and the flange width respectively. Practical implications are discussed in terms of the idealized buckling design curve. An analytical framework for the structural analysis of the thin-walled I-section struts that exhibit the nonlinear interaction of a global and a local buckling mode, including cellular buckling, has therefore been established.

40|$|Stainless steel {{has been}} gaining {{increasing}} use {{in a variety of}} engineering applications due to its unique combination of mechanical properties, durability and aesthetics. Significant progress in the development of structural design guidance has been made in recent years. However, an area that has remained relatively unexplored is that of combined loading. Testing and analysis of structural stainless steel elements subjected to combined axial load and bending is therefore the subject of this thesis. A comprehensive experimental programme was firstly carried out. At the cross-sectional level, a total of 15 stub column tests, 10 four-point bending beam tests, and 58 combined loading tests were conducted on different cross-section profiles (square, rectangular and circular hollow sections) from different material grades (austenitic, duplex and ferritic stainless steels). At the member level, 48 beam-columns were tested under both equal and unequal end moments to investigate the buckling behaviour of beam-column members subjected to constant bending and various moment gradients, respectively. The test results were then employed in a parallel finite element (FE) study. The FE models were first validated against the test results and then used to conduct a series of parametric studies to extend the available results over a wider range of cross-section sizes, member <b>slendernesses,</b> loading eccentricities, and moment gradients. The experimentally and numerically derived data were used to study the structural performance of stainless steel elements subjected to combined axial load and bending moment, to assess the accuracy of current codified design provisions, and to establish new, more accurate, design rules. Following the comparisons between the test and FE results and the existing design provisions, it was found that all existing design codes lead to unduly conservative strength predictions for stainless steel cross-sections under combined loading, mainly due to the neglect of strain hardening. For stainless steel beam column members, there was a high degree of scatter in the strength predictions, with both conservative and unsafe results. This was attributed mainly to inaccurate predictions of the column buckling and bending end points of the design interaction curves and inaccurate interaction factors. Improved design expressions were sought through extension of the deformation-based continuous strength method (CSM) to the case of combined loading at both cross-section and member levels. Comparisons of the predicted capacities with over 6000 test and FE results indicated that the CSM proposals yield accurate and consistent strength predictions for both stainless steel cross-sections and members under combined loading. The reliability of the proposals has been confirmed by means of statistical analyses, demonstrating their suitability for incorporation into future revisions of international design codes for stainless steel structures.
