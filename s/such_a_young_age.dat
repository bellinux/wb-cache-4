During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute.

40|$|Re-ionization of the intergalactic medium {{occurred}} in the early Universe at redshift z~ 6 - 11, following {{the formation of the}} first generation of stars. Those young galaxies (where the bulk of stars formed) at a cosmic age of less than about 500 million years (z<~ 10) remain largely unexplored because they are at or beyond the sensitivity limits of existing large telescopes. Understanding the properties of these galaxies is critical to identifying the source of the radiation that re-ionized the intergalactic medium. Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters allows the detection of high-redshift galaxies fainter than what otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. Here we report multiband observations of the cluster MACS J 1149 + 2223 that have revealed (with high probability) a gravitationally magnified galaxy from the early Universe, at a redshift of z = 9. 6 +/- 0. 2 (that is, a cosmic age of 490 +/- 15 million years, or 3. 6 per cent of the age of the Universe). We estimate that it formed less than 200 million years after the Big Bang (at the 95 per cent confidence level), implying a formation redshift of <~ 14. Given the small sky area that our observations cover, faint galaxies seem to be abundant at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> cosmic <b>age,</b> suggesting that they may be the dominant source for the early re-ionization of the intergalactic medium...|$|R

He was born around the year 1705 and it is most likely that he learned his trade and served his apprenticeship near the naval shipyards of Deptford, for by the 1720s he had a yard and workshop in Greenwich. His name first appeared as that of a carver when he worked on St. George's Church, Bloomsbury in London. In 1725 his first domestic work is recorded when he made carvings for 4 St James's Square, London. He was at the same time one of the craftsmen employed to work on the Fifty New Churches designed by Sir Christopher Wren. He did not neglect the secular and domestic market and he is recorded as a worker at East India House, Leadenhall Street in 1730; this time with a partner named John How. He is well known for his carved chimney-pieces and there are good examples in the 'Great Room' at Baylies, Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire and another example at Sir Michael Newton's seat of Culverthorpe, Lincolnshire. The 1730s were the years of Boson's greatest success and it was during this time that he regularly carried out work for Frederick, Prince of Wales at his houses at Leicester Fields, Kew Palace, and Cliveden, Buckinghamshire.|$|R
40|$|Perturbations to the {{colonization}} {{process of the}} human gastrointestinal tract have been suggested to result in adverse health effects later in life. Although much research has been performed on bacterial colonization and succession, much less {{is known about the}} other two domains of life, archaea, and eukaryotes. Here we describe colonization and succession by bacteria, archaea and microeukaryotes {{during the first year of}} life (samples collected around days 1, 3, 5, 28, 150, and 365) within the gastrointestinal tract of infants delivered either vaginally or by cesarean section and using a combination of quantitative real-time PCR as well as 16 S and 18 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Sequences from organisms belonging to all three domains of life were detectable in all of the collected meconium samples. The microeukaryotic community composition fluctuated strongly over time and early diversification was delayed in infants receiving formula milk. Cesarean section-delivered (CSD) infants experienced a delay in colonization and succession, which was observed for all three domains of life. Shifts in prokaryotic succession in CSD infants compared to vaginally delivered (VD) infants were apparent as early as days 3 and 5, which were characterized by increased relative abundances of the genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, and a decrease in relative abundance for the genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides. Generally, a depletion in Bacteroidetes was detected as early as day 5 postpartum in CSD infants, causing a significantly increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio between days 5 and 150 when compared to VD infants. Although the delivery mode appeared to have the strongest influence on differences between the infants, other factors <b>such</b> as <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> gestational <b>age</b> or maternal antibiotics intake likely contributed to the observed patterns as well. Our findings complement previous observations of a delay in colonization and succession of CSD infants, which affects not only bacteria but also archaea and microeukaryotes. This further highlights the need for resolving bacterial, archaeal, and microeukaryotic dynamics in future longitudinal studies of microbial colonization and succession within the neonatal gastrointestinal tract...|$|R

25|$|The pentatonic scale plays a {{significant}} role in music education, particularly in Orff-based, Kodály-based, and Waldorf methodologies at the primary or elementary level. The Orff system places a heavy emphasis on developing creativity through improvisation in children, largely through use of the pentatonic scale. Orff instruments, such as xylophones, bells and other metallophones, use wooden bars, metal bars or bells, which can be removed by the teacher, leaving only those corresponding to the pentatonic scale, which Carl Orff himself believed to be children's native tonality. Children begin improvising using only these bars, and over time, more bars are added at the teacher's discretion until the complete diatonic scale is being used. Orff believed that the use of the pentatonic scale at <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>age</b> was appropriate to the development of each child, since the nature of the scale meant that it was impossible for the child to make any real harmonic mistakes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background East Africa has {{experienced}} a rapid expansion in access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-infected patients. Regionally representative socio-demographic, laboratory and clinical characteristics of patients accessing ART over time and across sites have not been well described. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of characteristics of HIV-infected adults initiating ART between 2002 and 2009 in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania and in the International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS Consortium. Characteristics associated with advanced disease (defined as either a CD 4 cell count level of less than 50 cells/mm 3 or a WHO Stage 4 condition) {{at the time of}} ART initiation and use of stavudine (D 4 T) or nevirapine (NVP) were identified using a log-link Poisson model with robust standard errors. Results Among 48, 658 patients (69 % from Kenya, 22 % from Uganda and 9 % from Tanzania) accessing ART at 30 clinic sites, the median age at the time of ART initiation was 37 years (IQR: 31 - 43) and 65 % were women. Pre-therapy CD 4 counts rose from 87 cells/mm 3 (IQR: 26 - 161) in 2002 - 03 to 154 cells/mm 3 (IQR: 71 - 233) in 2008 - 09 (p < 0. 001). Accessing ART at advanced disease peaked at 35 % in 2005 - 06 and fell to 27 % in 2008 - 09. D 4 T use in the initial regimen fell from a peak of 88 % in 2004 - 05 to 59 % in 2008 - 09, and a greater extent of decline was observed in Uganda than in Kenya and Tanzania. Self-pay for ART peaked at 18 % in 2003, but fell to less than 1 % by 2005. In multivariable analyses, accessing ART at advanced immunosuppression was associated with male sex, women without a history of treatment for prevention of mother to child transmission (both as compared with women with <b>such</b> <b>a</b> history) and <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> after adjusting for year of ART initiation and country of residence. Receipt of D 4 T in the initial regimen was associated with female sex, earlier year of ART initiation, higher WHO stage, and lower CD 4 levels at ART initiation and the absence of co-prevalent tuberculosis. Conclusions Public health ART services in east Africa have improved over time, but the fraction of patients accessing ART with advanced immunosuppression is still high, men consistently access ART with more advanced disease, and D 4 T continues to be common in most settings. Strategies to facilitate access to ART, overcome barriers among men and reduce D 4 T use are needed...|$|R
