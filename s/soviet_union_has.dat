5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E

Bond suspects that the Resident Director of the KGB in London will attend the auction and underbid for the item, in order to drive the price up to the value needed to pay Maria for her services. Bond attends the auction, spots the man, and leaves to make arrangements for his expulsion from London as persona non grata.|$|E
5|$|Later, fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells Black {{that he has}} {{uncovered}} computer files from the Group, indicating that a virus discovered by bio-weapons scientists in the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> been living dormant in bird species {{since the end of}} the Cold War, and may now be making a resurgence in the United States. Watts reveals that a vaccine has been developed by the Group, but only in sufficient quantities for its members; Watts and Black have already been inoculated without having realized at the time. Black tells Watts to locate Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), another Group member, as he hopes to keep them safe in the cabin until the crisis resolves.|$|E
50|$|The theory {{continues}} that Japanese-Soviet relations, and Japanese-Russian relations {{before and}} after the existence of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>have</b> been in some ways secretive and mysterious. For instance, as early as 1925 Japan and the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>had</b> secret bilateral fishing rights agreements, with the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> giving up much of its fishing rights to Japan with no obvious motive or explanation.|$|R

5|$|Shostakovich's musical {{influence}} on later composers outside the former <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> been relatively slight, although Alfred Schnittke {{took up his}} eclecticism and his contrasts between the dynamic and the static, and some of André Previn's music shows clear links to Shostakovich's style of orchestration. His influence {{can also be seen}} in some Nordic composers, such as Lars-Erik Larsson. Many of his Russian contemporaries, and his pupils at the Leningrad Conservatory were strongly influenced by his style (including German Okunev, Boris Tishchenko, whose 5th Symphony of 1978 is dedicated to Shostakovich's memory, Sergei Slonimsky, and others). Shostakovich's conservative idiom has grown increasingly popular with audiences both within and beyond Russia, as the avant-garde has declined in influence and debate about his political views has developed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the USSR claimed a higher life {{expectancy}} than the United States, but the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> lagged behind Western countries {{in terms of}} mortality and life expectancy since the late 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Leninists remain {{divided in}} {{their views on}} Stalin. Some view him as the {{authentic}} successor to Lenin, who continued and developed his legacy, while others believe that Stalin betrayed Lenin's ideas by deviating from them.

25|$|The German {{invasion}} of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> died down into an endless guerilla war in the Ural Mountains and Siberia.

25|$|The current ethnic {{background}} {{of the people of}} Trabzon is mostly Turkish. There are also descendants of Circassian muhajiris in the city, as well as smaller number of Laz people, Muslim Greeks (Romeyka-speakers) and Armenians (Hemshin). Local Turks are mostly of Chepni Turkmen origin. The main language of these ethnic groups is Turkish. Modern migration since the dissolution of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> brought a significant number of Russians, Ukrainians and people from the Caucasus (mostly Georgia) into the city.

25|$|An Estonian oil {{syndicate}} {{became a}} joint Estonian-Soviet enterprise in 1928 and Päts {{was hired by}} it as a legal consultant in 1930. His annual salary was $4,000, which was {{twice as much as}} the State Elder earned and more than eight times as muchs as Päts earned {{as a member of the}} Riigikogu. The purpose of the joint enterprise for the Soviets was not supposed to be business-related, but only to attract Päts. This official salary by the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> thus been seen as the salary for his long-term cooperation with the Soviets. After Päts's coup d'état, the Soviet Union increased economic cooperation with Estonian enterprises.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Islamic terrorists from Soviet Azerbaijan destroy an {{important}} Soviet oil-production facility at Nizhnevartovsk, RSFSR, crippling the Soviet Union's oil production {{and threatening to}} wreck the nation's economy due to oil shortages. Energy Minister Mikhail Sergetov, a non-voting candidate member of the Politburo, suggests making concessions with the West to survive the crisis. He is overruled by the Defense Minister, KGB Chairman Boris Georgiyevich Kosov and the Foreign Minister, who, fearing that the west would {{take advantage of the}} Soviet Union's weakened state to permanently cripple it, instead approve a plan to seize the oil fields in the Persian Gulf by military force. Sergetov reluctantly agrees, claiming that the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> sufficient oil reserves for the war in order to gain political favor.

25|$|Recent {{historical}} {{scholarship has}} shed {{new light on}} the topic of Second World War casualties. Research in Russia since the collapse of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> caused a revision of estimates of Soviet WW2 fatalities. According to Russian government figures, USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million. including 8.5 million due to war related famine and disease In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million. Historian Rüdiger Overmans of the Military History Research Office (Germany) published a study in 2000 that estimated the German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe. The People's Republic of China puts its war dead at 20 million, while the Japanese government puts its casualties due to the war at 3.1 million.|$|E
25|$|The First Main Directorate (or First Chief Directorate, Russian: Первое главное управление, Pervoye glavnoye upravleniye) of the Committee for State Security of the USSR (PGU KGB) was the {{organization}} responsible for foreign operations and intelligence activities by {{providing for the}} training and management of covert agents, intelligence collection administration, and the acquisition of foreign and domestic political, scientific and technical intelligence in the Soviet Union. The First Chief Directorate was formed within the KGB directorate in 1954, and {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union was renamed as the Central Intelligence Service and finally the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR RF). Although the agency SVR restyle in 1991 implies a generic overseas surveillance activity, the primary foreign intelligence service in Russia and the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>has</b> been the GRU, a military intelligence organization and special operations force shrouded in secrecy, most famed for stealing the blueprints of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project and barring entry into its headquarters to anyone, even the leader of the Soviet Union proper, without a formal authentication.|$|E

500|$|These [...] "twin shocks"—the atomic {{bombing of}} Hiroshima and the Soviet entry—had {{immediate}} profound effects on Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki and Foreign Minister Tōgō Shigenori, who concurred {{that the government}} must end the war at once.

Khrushchev's visit was clouded by an atmosphere of mistrust, which culminated in a hurried departure two days earlier than scheduled." [...] According to Hoxha, Khrushchev displayed contempt for Albanian archaeology in Butrint and said to Rodion Malinovsky, the Soviet Defense Minister who was visiting the country with him, [...] "Look, how marvelous this is! An ideal base for our submarines could be built here. These old things [...] should be dug up and thrown into the sea... We shall have the most ideal and most secure base in the Mediterranean. From here we can paralyze and attack everything." [...] He was also said to have remarked to Hoxha to turn his country [...] "into a flourishing garden," [...] suggested he make it an attractive holiday spot for Soviet tourists, and that rather than produce grain, Albania should focus on growing oranges for export.
