5|$|To {{properly}} {{tell the}} international {{aspects of the}} story, filming for Sense8 took place almost entirely on location around the globe. In the first season they filmed in nine cities located in eight countries: Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, Mumbai, Nairobi, Reykjavík, San Francisco, and Seoul. Production on the first season began on June 18, 2014 in San Francisco. The filmmakers successfully negotiated with {{the organizers of the}} Clarion Alley Mural Project and select artists to feature their artwork in the show. Shooting in Chicago began on July 9 and wrapped up on August 8, with filming taking place both on location and at the Cinespace Film Studios. They shot some scenes in the Superdawg drive-through restaurant, while customers were being asked not to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> filming. Lana and Lilly Wachowski are frequent customers of the place. During location scouting, the producers found the City Methodist Church in Gary, Indiana which is nearby Chicago, and changed one site's description in the scripts to a church accordingly in order to fit that particular site into the filming. They filmed in the church from July 25 to 28. Filming proceeded to London for a short shoot and then to Iceland, where between August 26 and September 6 they shot in Reykjavik and nearby places such as Akranes. Filming then started in Nairobi, where a sequence required a crowd of 700 extras, 200 cars and a helicopter. In Seoul they filmed from September 18 to 30. Next they moved to Mexico City and later to Germany, where they filmed in Berlin and inside Babelsberg Studio. Last place they visited was Mumbai where they also shot a Bollywood dance number that was choreographed by Slumdog Millionaires Longinus Fernandes. The writers wanted to feature an event in each city. They were able to schedule the Pride scenes with its Dykes on Bikes on the Dyke March in San Francisco, the Fourth of July fireworks celebration in Chicago, and the Ganesha Chaturthi Hindu festival in Mumbai. Additionally they recorded footage from the Fresh Meat Festival of transgender and queer performance in San Francisco, a club event taking place at the KOKO in London, and a real lucha libre (Mexican professional wrestling) event with the fighters wearing wrestling masks in Arena Naucalpan, in Mexico City. Lastly the scenes where characters are flying on an airplane were recorded during the real flights the cast and crew had to do to get from London to Iceland. On November 17, 2014 Straczynski wrote that the main unit shooting had wrapped, with only a few winter shots in Iceland remaining to be captured the next month. These scenes were further delayed to mid-January 2015, until Iceland had the necessary amount of snow, with the wrap party taking place in Reykjavík's Harpa Music and Concert hall on January 21. By the end of the shooting, the filmmakers had completed 100,000 miles of flight time, or four times around the globe.|$|E
25|$|Jenseits (The Hereafter). As the snow-like {{dust of the}} {{pulverized}} crystal disperses, calm humming chords resonate {{from the}} opening in the bunker. Inside, a glass world bathed in white light becomes visible, {{in the midst of}} which a glass conveyor belt slowly carries toy silver and glass soldiers, aeroplanes, tanks, and battleships, marked into groups by coloured dots or stripes. On the left are seated bluish glass beings with high male voices; opposite them at the right are similar creatures with dark voices. They all <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> war toys gliding past and, at intervals, pull toward them one or several of the toys using glass croupier rakes, knocking them down onto a lower conveyor belt moving in the opposite direction. All the while, stock-exchange clocks tally up the wins and losses, as the humming turns into singing.|$|E

According to Grewal, [...] "Cho appeared to never go to class or read a book during his senior year," [...] adding that Cho just typed on his laptop, went to the dining hall and clipped his hair in the toilet, cleaning up the hair afterwards. Grewal also reported that he witnessed Cho riding his bicycle in circles {{in the parking lot}} of the dormitory.|$|E

500|$|At the end, as {{the family}} <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head, the Simpsons debate on what the moral of this whole story is. It cannot be 'A good deed is its own reward' as Bart got a reward he likes, {{but at the same}} time it is not 'No good deed goes unrewarded' as they never would have {{received}} anything if Homer had not written the angry letter. Lisa suggests that perhaps there is not a lesson to be learned from this, to which Homer agrees as it's [...] "just a bunch of stuff that happened", though everyone agrees it has been a memorable few days.|$|E
500|$|Fitzpatrick further {{discussed}} the [...] "downright eerie parallel to current events" [...] the Watchdogs {{brought to the}} series, saying that [...] "if you <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> news long enough it starts to mirror fiction, and boy if Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't terrifyingly benefit from that ....Sometimes, anyone in need of someone to blame for their troubles can fall in with radicals." [...] Fitzpatrick noted other MCU tie-ins in the same episode [...] "never felt particularly labored, but rather lived-in with a world that stretches back to Agent Carter-era Stark tech, drops the odd Daredevil Easter Egg, and helps contextualize a world where heroes create country-dropping robots....A topical bent like tonight's [...] "Watchdogs" [...] made for a great angle to build up that world mentality without feeling particularly subservient to the movies." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the siege}} of the Stonewall, Craig Rodwell called The New York Times, the New York Post, and the Daily News to inform them what was happening. All three papers covered the riots; the Daily News placed {{coverage}} on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors {{that it had been}} organized by the Students for a Democratic Society, the Black Panthers, or triggered by [...] "a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes". All day Saturday, June 28, people came to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> burned and blackened Stonewall Inn. Graffiti appeared {{on the walls of the}} bar, declaring [...] "Drag power", [...] "They invaded our rights", [...] "Support gay power", and [...] "Legalize gay bars", along with accusations of police looting, and—regarding the status of the bar—"We are open." ...|$|E

500|$|Vikings coach Dennis Green {{has been}} criticized for his {{decision}} to kneel on 3rd down and play for overtime instead of attempting to score before the end of regulation. Radio host Bob Sansevere, author of The Best Minnesota Sports Arguments, called it [...] "one of the all-time boneheaded decisions a coach has ever made in any sport." [...] Of Green's play call, Peter King of Sports Illustrated wrote, [...] "Minnesota coach Dennis Green did a great job this year, but if he doesn't wake up and <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling {{in the next few days}} and say out loud: 'Boy, I screwed that one up,' then he's not being honest with himself." [...] Nonetheless, local Minneapolis newspaper Star Tribune has contended that taking a knee was the correct decision due to the performance of the Vikings' offense, whose struggles that day were also noted by Carter.|$|E
500|$|On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush made {{a speech}} during his {{re-election}} campaign that reignited the feud between The Simpsons and the Bushes. At that point, family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, to which effect he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington, D.C.: [...] "We {{are going to keep}} on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons". The next broadcast of The Simpsons was a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] on January 30, 1992. It included a new opening, which was a response to Bush's speech. The scene begins in the Simpsons' living room. Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Patty and Selma all <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> television and watch Bush's speech. After Bush's statement, Bart replies [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying {{for an end to the}} Depression too." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E

500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene of the}} episode, Bart is seen writing [...] "I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty" [...] on the {{blackboard}} as a punishment for exposing the ignorance of the teachers by removing the Teachers' Editions. In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene {{as one of the}} [...] "key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators." [...] Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are [...] "particularly interested" [...] in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program." [...] One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, and she thinks the thought that [...] "an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children's time" [...] is [...] "frightening".|$|E

To {{overcome}} these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not seem to help. Taylor, in reflecting on Johnson's states, said that Johnson [...] "at one time strongly entertained thoughts of Suicide".|$|E

[...] The Escapist also gave it two stars out of five and said, [...] "If you want to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of Harry's head while he shouts [...] "Stupefy!" [...] forty times a minute, this is the game for you. If not, then you'd better look elsewhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{fennec fox}} is an omnivore. Food sources include plants, rodents, insects, birds, eggs, and rabbits. An {{individual}} can jump up to [...] high and [...] forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators. When hunting, large eared foxes {{such as the}} fennec, or the bat-eared fox, can seem to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground while they rotate their heads {{from side to side}} to pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground. There are reports that fennec foxes climb date palms while foraging for fruit; however, some experts consider these reports unlikely unless low branches are available for support.|$|E
2500|$|The Larsen boys wake {{their parents}} after finding a video in the mail.

2500|$|In December 2009, an {{ophthalmologist}} from University Hospital Galway {{issued a}} warning {{that there had been}} a significant spike in the number of cases of solar retinopathy [...] "all of them linked to events at Knock", with the observed patients having had [...] "a significant reduction in their vision". The reports of people having observed the sun [...] "dancing in the sky" [...] were characterised as merely [...] "sort of a cheap trick" [...] caused by the extremely bright sunlight: [...] "If you <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun for long enough you're going to get some visual disturbances." [...] The warning about the dangers of staring directly at the sun continued: [...] "Not only will you get reduced vision but also a condition called metamorphopsia".|$|E

His diary entry for 1 September 1945 (in Yokohama) reads in part: [...] "What a kick to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> arrogant, ugly, moon-faced, buck-toothed, bowlegged bastards, and realize where this puts them. Many newly demobilized soldiers around. Most police salute. People generally just apathetic. We gloated over the destruction & came in at 3:00 feeling fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Others, such as {{professor}} of physics Auguste Meessen, suggest that optical effects created by the human eye can account for the reported phenomenon. Meessen presented his analysis of apparitions and [...] "miracles of the sun" [...] at the International Symposium [...] "Science, Religion and Conscience" [...] in 2003. While Meessen felt those who claim to have experienced miracles were [...] "honestly experiencing what they report", he stated sun miracles cannot be taken at face value and that the reported observations were optical effects caused by prolonged staring at the sun. Meessen contends that retinal after-images produced after brief periods of sun gazing are a likely cause of the observed dancing effects. Similarly, Meessen concluded that the color changes witnessed were most likely caused by the bleaching of photosensitive retinal cells. Meessen observes that Sun Miracles have been witnessed in many places where religiously charged pilgrims have been encouraged to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun. He cites the apparitions at Heroldsbach, Germany (1949) as an example, where many people within a crowd of over 10,000 testified to witnessing similar observations as at Fátima. Meessen also cites a British Journal of Ophthalmology article that discusses some modern examples of Sun Miracles. Prof. Dr. Stöckl, a meteorologist from Regensburg, also proposed a similar theory and made similar observations.|$|E
2500|$|The album's booklet is twenty-four pages long, {{consisting}} of song lyrics and comics drawn by Zombie. Gene Colan and Dan Brereton, of Marvel Comics, contributed numerous drawings for the booklet. The booklet contains numerous images of ghosts, goblins, monsters, and other creatures. Numerous references to Lucifer and Satan are made throughout the pages, along {{with images of}} Sheri Moon and other near-nude women. Zombie had {{a replica of the}} robot from the film The Phantom Creeps (1939) created for the booklet. The replica was created by Wayne Toth, and stood ten feet tall. The creation is featured {{on the back of the}} album, as well as the single cover for [...] "Dragula". Zombie would continue to use it for numerous live performances and appearances, including the music video for his single [...] "Dead City Radio and the New Gods of Supertown" [...] (2013). Zombie said of the booklet, [...] "It’s a welcome relief from the less-is-more school of thought [...] I grew up in the heyday of cool record packaging. I would <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> record for hours. Now, you open a record and you get nothing. I always feel cheated." [...] The disc itself is either white or yellow depending on the version, and features images of various monsters and ghouls also designed by Zombie.|$|E
