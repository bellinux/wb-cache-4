This older church, located on {{what became the}} cathedral grounds, had {{been built in the}} Romanesque style. Today, there remains the square tower, 33 metres (108 feet) high, and the quire, of very diminutive proportions. On a plan of the town from about 1531, a chancel appears, and <b>seals</b> <b>affixed</b> to the city and college charters bear representations of other buildings attached. To the east is an even older religious site, the Church of St Mary on the Rock, the Culdee house that became a Collegiate Church.|$|E
50|$|But {{about a year}} later, Chodko {{supported}} Sigismund Kęstutaitis in his coup d'état against Švitrigaila. On 8 December 1432, Chodka {{fought in}} the Battle of Ashmyany alongside Švitrigaila and was taken prisoner. Most likely that was a different Chodka, who remained loyal to Švitrigaila until 1446. In February 1434, Chodko Jurewicz witnessed the renewal of the Union of Grodno by Sigismund Kęstutaitis and Jogaila. Of 41 <b>seals</b> <b>affixed</b> to the treaty, Chodko's Kościesza coat of arms was 9th. It is unclear how he obtained the Polish arms. According to the Union of Horodło, 47 Lithuanian nobles adopted Polish coats of arms. However, Eastern Orthodox nobles from Ruthenia were excluded. Chodko remained influential in domestic politics and along with voivodes of Trakai and Vilnius distributed veldamai (a class of dependent peasants) to other nobles. His name disappeared from written sources in 1447.|$|E

Pedicini sent a letter at once to Cardinal Carlo Odescalchi informing him of her death. Her remains were exposed until 11 June in the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata and was buried at Campo Verano where - on the orders of Gregory XVI - her remains were enclosed in a leaden sepulcher with <b>seals</b> <b>affixed</b> to it. Monsignor Natali asked for a death mask to be made before her burial and Cardinal Odescalchi ordered Natali to compile all documents so that Monsignor Luquet published a biographical account of her life. Cardonal Pedicini often visited her tomb while the Capuchin Cardinal Ludovico Micara always kept an image of her on his person. The Minim priest Venerable Bernardo Clausi said of her: [...] "If she is not in Heaven, there is no room there for anybody". Saint Vincenzo Pallotti praised her after she died for her saintliness and life of holiness.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{member of}} the Crovan dynasty known to have utilised a seal is Haraldr's paternal grandfather, who attached such a device to a confirmation charter granted in about 1154. Although none of the original seals borne by the Crovan dynasty have survived, several were documented by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century antiquarians. In regards to Haraldr himself, one such antiquarian named Christopher Hatton (died 1670) not only transcribed two of Haraldr's charters, but made drawings of the seals which were attached to them. The devices themselves were in poor condition by Hatton's time, as his illustrations show portions of them broken away. It is clear, however, that the seals bore a lion on one side, and a clinker-built galley with sails furled on the other side. About a century later, the charters and seals, along with other priceless documents of the Cottonian Library, were destroyed by fire at Ashburnham House in 1731. Waxen <b>seals</b> <b>affixed</b> to acta not only served to authenticate the written documents, but also physically symbolise the authority and significance of them. For example, when Hákon formally confirmed the kingship of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles (died 1265), Haraldr's younger brother and eventual royal successor, the Norwegian king is said by the Chronicle of Mann to have done so [...] "by the protection of his seal". To the kings of the Crovan dynasty, whose military strength laid {{in the power of}} armed galley-fleets, the symbol of such a vessel upon their seals represented the strength and authority they held in the Isles.|$|E
5000|$|This century, {{which opened}} {{with the return}} of the Jews to France proper (then reduced almost to the Isle of France), closed with their {{complete}} exile from the country in a larger sense. In July 1198, Philip Augustus, [...] "contrary to the general expectation and despite his own edict, recalled the Jews to Paris and made the churches of God suffer great persecutions" [...] (Rigord). The king adopted this measure from no good will toward the Jews, for he had shown his true sentiments a short time before in the Bray affair. But since then he had learned that the Jews could be an excellent source of income from a fiscal point of view, especially as money-lenders. Not only did he recall them to his estates, but he gave state sanction by his ordinances to their operations in banking and pawnbroking. He placed their business under control, determined the legal rate of interest, and obliged them to have <b>seals</b> <b>affixed</b> to all their deeds. Naturally this trade was taxed, and the affixing of the royal seal was paid for by the Jews. Henceforward there was in the treasury a special account called [...] "Produit des Juifs", and the receipts from this source increased continually. At the same time it was to the interest of the treasury to secure possession of the Jews, considered as a fiscal resource. The Jews were therefore made serfs of the king in the royal domain, just {{at a time when the}} charters, becoming wider and wider, tended to bring about the disappearance of serfdom. In certain respects their position became even harder than that of serfs, for the latter could in certain cases appeal to custom and were often protected by the Church; but there was no custom to which the Jews might appeal, and the Church laid them under its ban. The kings and the lords said [...] "my Jews" [...] just as they said [...] "my lands", and they disposed in like manner of the one and of the other. The lords imitated the king: [...] "they endeavored to have the Jews considered an inalienable dependence of their fiefs, and to establish the usage that if a Jew domiciled in one barony passed into another, the lord of his former domicil should have the right to seize his possessions." [...] This agreement was made in 1198 between the king and the Count of Champagne in a treaty, the terms of which provided that neither should retain in his domains the Jews of the other without the latter's consent, and furthermore that the Jews should not make loans or receive pledges without the express permission of the king and the count. Other lords made similar conventions with the king. Thenceforth they too had a revenue known as the Produit des Juifs, comprising the taille, or annual quit-rent, the legal fees for the writs necessitated by the Jews' law trials, and the seal duty. A thoroughly characteristic feature of this fiscal policy is that the bishops (according to the agreement of 1204 regulating the spheres of ecclesiastical and seigniorial jurisdiction) continued to prohibit the clergy from excommunicating those who sold goods to the Jews or who bought from them.|$|E

The legal term seal arises from the wax seal used throughout history for authentication (among other purposes). [...] Originally, only a wax seal was accepted as a seal by the courts, but by the 19th century many jurisdictions had relaxed the definition to include an impression in the paper on which the instrument was printed, an embossed paper wafer affixed to an instrument, a scroll made with a pen, or the printed words [...] "Seal" [...] or [...] "L.S."
