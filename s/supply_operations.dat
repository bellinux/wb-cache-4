Thus in 1941 into early 1942, the meager availability of trained officers and NCOs had to be metered out to crews for new capital ships, <b>supply</b> <b>operations,</b> medical operations, repair and maintenance operations, air wings, etc. Patrol craft and Destroyers assignments were some of the most challenging non-flight assignments given the reliance on junior officers.|$|E
25|$|The {{aid from}} New Orleans began in 1776, when general Charles Lee sent two {{officers}} of the Continental Army to request supplies from the New Orleans governor Luis de Unzaga. Unzaga concerned about overtly antagonizing the British before the Spanish were prepared for war, and they agreed to assist the rebels covertly. Unzaga authorized the shipment of desperately needed gunpowder in a transaction brokered by Oliver Pollock. Then Bernardo de Gálvez became governor of New Orleans in January 1777 while he continued and expanded <b>supply</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

By the end of November, the drillships would be escorted back for winter lay-up and Robert LeMeur would carry out final supply runs to the drilling islands. Although the vessel would typically be laid up for winter in mid-December, she was capable of continuing <b>supply</b> <b>operations</b> through the winter. In some years, Robert LeMeur was involved {{in research and development}} projects during the winter months or drydocked on Canmar's floating dock for inspection and repairs.|$|E

500|$|As had {{occurred}} {{at the end of}} the 1968 Tet Offensive, the North Vietnamese logistical network was improved and expanded in the wake of the incursion. Due to the loss of its Cambodian port access, Hanoi established the 470th Transportation Group to control and coordinate its Cambodian <b>supply</b> <b>operations.</b> PAVN had already begun this expansion in 1968 by the building of a new [...] "Liberation Route" [...] from Laos into Cambodia.|$|E
500|$|Political {{complications}} {{were not}} the only factors seriously hampering aerial operations. The seasonal monsoons that hindered communist <b>supply</b> <b>operations</b> in Laos also hampered the interdiction effort. These efforts were complicated by morning fog and overcast, and by the smoke and haze produced by the slash-and-burn agriculture practiced by the indigenous population. During 1968 the U.S. Air Force undertook two experimental operations that it hoped would exacerbate the worst parts of the above-mentioned weather patterns. [...] "Project Popeye" [...] was an attempt to indefinitely extend the rainy monsoon weather over southeastern Laos by cloud seeding. Testing on the project began in September above the Kong River watershed that ran through the Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound areas. Clouds were seeded by air with silver iodide smoke and then activated by launching a fuse fired from a flare pistol. 56 tests were conducted by October; 85% were judged to be successful. President Johnson then gave authorization for the program, which lasted until July 1972.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to neglect}} the {{importance}} of understanding the current <b>supply</b> chain <b>operations</b> model, the enterprises face many problems from <b>supply</b> chain <b>operations.</b> This research proposes a systematic methodology to help companies to analysis and design their <b>supply</b> chain <b>operations</b> model efficiently. The developed methodology not only based on the <b>Supply</b> Chain <b>Operations</b> Referenced (SCOR) Model which addressed by the Supply Chain Council (SCC) in 1996 but strengthened on the SCOR-based study in the literatures. There are three phases included in the methodology. First, SCOR-based Supply chain Typology Analysis, this phase purposed some steps to help companies to understand the supply chain structure and <b>supply</b> chain <b>operations</b> model. Secondly, SCOR-based Supply Chain Performance Analysis, this phase purposed some steps to observe the owned supply chain performance and figure out the root problems. The postponement application solution is discussed to solve the root problems. Thirdly, SCOR-based <b>Supply</b> Chain <b>Operations</b> Model Design, this phase purposed some steps to redesign the owned supply chain structure and <b>supply</b> chain <b>operations</b> models. The proposed methodology systematically integrated some independent technology and concept on the academic research. Finally, the case of TFT-LCD manufacturer has been applied by this supply chain analysis and design methodology. Based on this methodology, not only build up the current (as-is) <b>supply</b> chain <b>operations</b> model which helps {{the internal and external}} partner communication to each other, but also found out the exited problems at the <b>supply</b> chain <b>operations.</b> Then, the postponement application has been purposed to build up the future (to-be) solution and through to evaluate the designed <b>supply</b> chain <b>operations</b> model the e-SCOR simulator...|$|R

2500|$|ATC's North African Wing {{had already}} {{provided}} stopgap support by transporting 250 spare B-29 engines to the CBI in April and May 1944, using 25 C-54s over a [...] shuttle route {{from the port}} of Casablanca to Calcutta {{that came to be}} called the [...] "Crescent Blend" [...] until three special mission C-46 squadrons—created in early 1944 under the code name [...] "Moby Dick"—were ready to carry out <b>supply</b> <b>operations</b> for XX Bomber Command. Designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Air Transport Squadrons (Mobile), each was intended to be a self-contained unit of twenty C-46s, flight crews, maintenance and engineering specialists, and a full complement of station operation personnel, although when first committed the service elements had not yet been integrated. They arrived in the CBI in June 1944, with the 1st and 2nd MATS based at Kalaikunda, West Bengal, taking over the [...] "Crescent Blend" [...] shuttle and bringing in over 100 spare engines per month, while the 3rd MATS was sent forward to the ICD base at Kunming to augment the India-China airlift.|$|E
2500|$|In the event, Hitler {{chose to}} {{continue}} with the airlift, perhaps influenced by the Luftwaffes success in the Demyansk Pocket. Luftflotte 4 failed to alter the situation. The best air lift operation took place on 7 December 1942, when 363.6 tons were flown in. However, the concentration of Soviet aviation disrupted the intended <b>supply</b> <b>operations</b> and German transport losses were heavy. Some 266 Junkers Ju 52s were destroyed, three quarters of the fleet's strength on the Eastern Front. The He 111 gruppen lost 165 aircraft in transport operations. Other losses included 42 Junkers Ju 86s, nine Fw 200 Condors, five Heinkel He 177 bombers and a Junkers Ju 290. The Luftwaffe also lost close to 1,000 highly experienced bomber crew personnel. So heavy were the Luftwaffes losses that four of Luftflotte 4's transport units (KGrzbV 700, KGrzbV 900, I./KGrzbV 1 and II./KGzbV 1) were [...] "formally dissolved". In the air, the Luftwaffe had sustained its heaviest defeat since the Battle of Britain. The remnants of the German Sixth Army surrendered on 2 February 1943.|$|E

2500|$|Following the refit, TheSullivans {{stopped at}} Buckner Bay, Okinawa and then {{proceeded}} to rejoin Task Force 77. Upon her arrival on 16 November 1952 she resumed screening activities and plane guard duty. She supported the carriers as they made the northern-most stab at North Korean supply lines, approaching within [...] of the Soviet base at Vladivostok, Russia. MiG-15 fighters approached the task force, but combat air patrol Grumman F9F Panthers downed two of the attackers and damaged a third in history's first engagement between jet fighters over water. The destroyer arrived back at Sasebo, Japan on 5 December 1952. From Sasebo she joined United Nations forces on 14 December 1952 in blockading the Korean coasts. Her mission was to interdict seaborne traffic and bombard shore targets to support United Nations ground troops and interdict enemy <b>supply</b> <b>operations.</b> Arriving in Area"G" [...] the following day, TheSullivans made contact with the enemy on the 16th off Songjin, North Korea which was an important rail terminus and supply center.

2500|$|LST-975 {{was still}} in service there when at 04:00 on 25 June 1950, the North Korean People's Army struck south across the 38th Parallel. On 27 June, President Harry S. Truman ordered American naval and air support of the Republic of Korea. That {{afternoon}} the Security Council called upon {{all members of the}} United Nations to assist in repelling the North Korean attack. With the need for shipping for an immediate large-scale lift of troops and supplies, LST-975 was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) on 1 July, to be manned by a Japanese civilian crew. On 28 August, she recommissioned at Yokosuka, Japan, with Lieutenant Arnold W. Harer in command. After training out of Kobe, Japan, LST-975 joined the Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet, and arrived off Inchon, Korea, on 15 September, for supply duty through the landings on 15 to 17 September, and into the middle of October. That first day she was repeatedly harassed by sniper fire as she beached on [...] "Red Beach"; a mortar shell wounded one man. While she unloaded during the next few days, Marine casualties were brought on board for care by Surgical Team 3. Completing unloading by 17 September, she spent the next month on ship-to-shore <b>supply</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} the {{financial}} reform, since the recession, Hoover {{had been trying to}} repair the economy. He founded government agencies to encourage labor harmony and support local public works aid which promoted cooperation of government and business, stabilize prices, and strive to balance the budget. His work focused on indirect relief from individual countries and the private sector, which was reflected in the letter emphasizing [...] "more effective supporting for each national committee" [...] and volunteer service -" [...] appealing for funding" [...] from outside the government. The commitment to maintain the gold standard system prevented the Federal Reserve expanded its money <b>supply</b> <b>operations</b> in 1930 and 1931, and it promoted Hoover's destructive balancing budgetary action to avoid the gold standard system overwhelming the dollar. As the Great Depression became worse, the call raised for increasing in federal intervention and spending. But Hoover refused to allow the federal government to force fixed prices, control the value of the business or manipulate the currency, in contrast, he started to control the dollar price. For official dollar prices, he expanded the credit base through free market operations in federal reserve system to ensure the domestic value of the dollar. He also tended to provide indirect aid to banks or local public works projects, refused to use federal funds to give aid to citizens directly, which will reduce public morale. Instead, he focused on volunteering to raise money. Even though Hoover was a philanthropist before becoming president, his opponents regarded him as not responsible for the citizens. During the administration of Hoover, the US economic policies had moved to activism and interventionism. In his re-election campaign, Hoover tried to persuade the Americans to claim that the measures they requested seemed to be helpful in the short term, but it would be devastating in the long run. Eventually, he was defeated by Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.|$|E

40|$|Data mining {{technology}} {{is applied to}} extract the water <b>supply</b> <b>operation</b> rules in this study. Five characteristic attributes—reservoir storage water, operation period number, water demand, runoff, and hydrological year—are chosen as the dataset, and these characteristic attributes are applied to build a mapping relation with the optimal operation mode calculated by dynamic programming (DP). A Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) neural network and a {{classification and regression tree}} (CART) are chosen as data mining algorithms to build the LM neural network classifier and CART decision tree classifier, respectively. In order to verify the classification effect of the LM and CART, the two classifiers are applied to the operation mode recognition for the Heiquan reservoir, which is located in the Qinghai Province of China. The accuracies of the two classifiers are 73. 6 % and 86. 9 % for the training sample, and their accuracies are 65. 8 % and 83. 3 %, respectively, for the test sample, which indicates that the classification result of the CART classifier is better than that of the LM neural network classifier. Thus, the CART classifier is chosen to guide the long-series water <b>supply</b> <b>operation.</b> Compared to the operation result with the other operation scheme, the result shows that the water deficit index of the CART is mostly closest to the DP scheme, which indicates that the CART classifier can guide reservoir water <b>supply</b> <b>operation</b> effectively...|$|R
