The authors have presented the dynamics of the amount and rate of the financing of construction projects. Depending on the segment of construction, the authors have suggested a classification map of project financing instruments, depending on their timing, membership and possibility of implementation in the form of a public and private partnership. The benchmarking of instruments for the financing of innovation and investment projects has revealed their advantages and disadvantages, recommendations have been drawn up for choosing the optimal instrument for the financing of construction projects...|$|E

40|$|Three large {{banks control}} {{over half of}} the U. S. {{commercial}} loan market by volume through the syndication process. Using attributes of a borrower’s location to instrument for lender– borrower matching, I show that the borrower stock price response to a loan announcement is more favorable if one of these dominant banks is the lender, especially if the borrower is “opaque. ” I then show that these banks charge lower interest rates {{and are more likely to}} lend without the protection of a borrowing base. The results suggest that the domi-nant banks have a particularly high reputation for screening and monitoring borrowers. (JEL G 21, L 14) In financial economics, it has long been recognized that commercial banks play a special certification role through inside lending (Fama 1985) and delegated monitoring (Diamond 1984). It therefore follows that bank loan announce-ments should convey a positive signal or certification to the market that the borrower is “good. ” 1 In that regard, Mikkelson and Partch (1986) and James (1987) document that bank loan announcements elicit positive abnormal re-turns in borrower stocks, whereas announcements of public <b>securities</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|E

The methods used are qualitative literature studies of policy documents on water from the UN. The focus is to analyze the ideas about water and to apply my theory on the concept of security, which is Barry Buzan’s framework on security, to these ideas. The main results showed that the UN strongly constructs the water issue as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for environments and species and in relatively strong terms also constructs it as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for civilisations. In rare cases the organisation constructs it as a societal <b>security</b> <b>issue,</b> but the UN doesn’t construct the water issue as a military, political or economic <b>security</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|R
