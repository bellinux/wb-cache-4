5|$|Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori {{defined the}} new genus Neophema in 1891, placing the {{turquoise}} parrot within it {{and giving it}} its current scientific name. There is little geographical variation, with some minor local differences {{in the amount of}} orange on the belly. In 1915, Gregory Mathews described a subspecies dombrainii from Victoria on the basis of more prominent red on the scapulars; however, this distinction was not confirmed on review with New South Wales specimens, and hence no subspecies are recognised. One of six species of grass parrot in the genus Neophema, it is most closely related to the <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrot.</b> The two are an allopatric species pair, and are the only two species in the genus to exhibit marked sexual dimorphism—where the male and female are different in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{is found}} {{in the foothills of the}} Great Dividing Range and surrounding areas. The northern limit of its range is 26° south in southeastern Queensland, around Cooloola, Blackbutt and Chinchilla, extending westwards to the vicinity of St George. Before 1945, it had been recorded as far north as the Suttor River and Mackay. In New South Wales, it {{is found in}} a broad band across the central and eastern parts of the state, with its western limits delineated by Moree, Quambone, Hillston, Narrandera and Deniliquin. There have been unconfirmed sightings in the far west of the state. In Victoria it {{is found in the}} vicinity of Wangaratta as well as East Gippsland and around Mallacoota. Sightings in South Australia are likely to have been the <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrot,</b> the similar appearance of the females leading to confusion and misidentification.|$|E
25|$|Common names include <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrot,</b> orange-throated parrot, splendid parrot, scarlet-breasted parrot, and scarlet-chested parakeet in aviculture.|$|E
50|$|Nearly 200 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} at Gluepot Reserve. These include the nationally threatened malleefowl, regent parrot, red-lored whistler and black-eared miner. A further 33 species {{are considered to be}} regionally threatened. <b>Scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrots</b> are known to have bred on Gluepot Reserve in the past, and still visit the reserve.|$|R
50|$|The arid {{landscape}} is characterised by red sand dunes. The wildlife {{is adapted to}} the dry climate. Typical species are <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrots,</b> Major Mitchell's cockatoos, thorny devils, sandhill dunnarts and malleefowls. The reserve is {{on the outside of}} the dingo fence, which borders it in the east. Therefore, it is situated in the area where dingoes are tolerated.|$|R
5000|$|The Scotia Endangered Mammal Recovery Project is {{a program}} of {{reintroduction}} of mammals that have become extinct regionally, {{in order to establish}} viable, self-sustaining populations. Species reintroduced so far include: numbat, greater bilby, burrowing bettong, brush-tailed bettong, bridled nailtail wallaby and greater stick-nest rat. Threatened bird species present on Scotia include malleefowl, regent and <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrots,</b> striated grasswren and black-eared miner. [...] The reserve forms part of the 12,200 km2 Riverland Mallee Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International for its importance in the conservation of mallee birds and their habitats.|$|R

25|$|The <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrot</b> is {{becoming}} more common in captivity, {{and is one of}} the more popular species of the genus Neophema in captivity both in Australia and overseas. Their quiet temperament and small size increase their appeal as aviary birds. Many mutations are seen, including the red-fronted, par blue, sea green (Sydney Blue), white fronted blue (Recessive), cinnamon (sex-linked), and more rarely lutino and fallow. Opaline (sex-link) and Edged (dominant) mutations are also now available in most countries. Although the species has more mutations than any other member of the genus, they tend to be frail healthwise and short-lived. Scarlet-chested parrots are also vulnerable to Candida infections in aviculture.|$|E
25|$|The <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrot</b> (Neophema splendida), known {{alternately}} as scarlet-breasted parrot, orange-throated parrot or splendid parrot, is {{a parrot}} endemic to central South Australia and inland southern Western Australia. The species is sexually dimorphic; the male has a bright blue face and scarlet chest and yellow underparts, amid overall green plumage, while the female is similar but lacks the red chest. These nomadic parakeets move readily from the Great Victoria Desert region into neighbouring areas. These interruptions are {{triggered by a}} search for more favourable conditions. They can survive quite well without access to drinking water, however, as succulent plants help meet much of their fluid requirement. They feed mainly on grass seeds and are most commonly sighted in spinifex.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrots.</b> A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis represents complete {{summary of}} most of avian sex ratio studies. A very important moment was discovering of PCR analysis in 90 's. This method enables to determine sex at molecular level. Older works which lacked PCR could not determine sex reliably and therefore their results can be misleading. PCR can determine sex ratio at primary, secondary and tertiary level. Sex ratio manipulation in birds is probable evolutionary mechanism {{and there are several}} hypothesis regarding to that. Many experimental studies have shown possible ultimate and proximate causes which are responsible for sex ratio manipulation. However, low data sample was one of the causes why they have been considered to be doubtful. I have summarized several most important points of this field within my literal review. The main goal {{of this study is to}} confirm or disprove some of the hypothesis in my breeding of <b>Scarlet-chested</b> <b>Parrots</b> (Neophema splendida). The research took three years and despite considerable domestication the sex ratio manipulation was proved in this species. Results show that the main factor affecting sex ratio was photoperiod during the breeding season and order of nesting...|$|R
25|$|The <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrot</b> is sparsely {{scattered}} across the dryer southern parts of the Australian continent, from Pingelly, Corrigin and Laverton in Western Australia east across South Australia and into the southern Northern Territory and into far western New South Wales. It has been classified as vulnerable in New South Wales, the dangers highlighted include the harvesting of trees that are potential and actual nesting sites, as larger trees are necessary for suitable hollows, possible trapping for the pet trade, and grazing by stock and feral animals. They inhabit dry Eucalyptus and Acacia scrubland and grassland, including Atriplex and Triodia. True estimates of rarity or abundance are difficult to determine; although the bird is brightly-coloured, it is secretive and easily overlooked.|$|E

50|$|The <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrot,</b> {{turquoise}} parrot {{and elegant}} parrot are all commonly raised and bred in captivity {{with a number}} of unusual colour forms arising. The members of this genus are not altogether easy to keep, being tender birds that may die without apparent cause, succumbing to mobbing by more robust aviary mates or diseases. This has hampered captive propagation efforts, e.g. {{in the case of the}} critically endangered orange-bellied parrot.|$|E

Scarlet-chested parrots are also vulnerable to Candida infections in aviculture.Since they are prone to candida infections this is best addressed in their diet. Remove everything from their diet that encourage fungal growth, like refined flour (most commercial egg foods are flour based) and sugar (most ripe fruits). Add as many natural antifungals to their diet as you can. Fresh crushed garlic is an excellent antifungal. Also herbs like oregano, thyme and rosemary. With proper husbandry and a more natural approuch to their diet Scarlet-chested parakeets prove to be hardy and long lived.|$|E
40|$|The {{largest and}} healthiest tracts of {{temperate}} woodlands remaining on Earth {{are found in}} the region known as the Great Western Woodlands. Extending {{from the edge of the}} Western Australian Wheatbelt to the mulga country on the northern boundary and the treeless Nullarbor Plain to the east, the region covers almost 16 million hectares. Nearly three times as large as Tasmania, this region is dominated by eucalypt woodlands (or ‘open forest’) intermixed with mallee, low shrublands, and salt lakes. The region is now recognised as having biodiversity of global conservation significance. For example, more than 20 % of all Australia’s native plant species and 30 % of Australia’s Eucalyptus species (‘gum trees’) are found here. In addition, hundreds of species of native birds, mammals and reptiles {{are found in the}} area, and it is thought that near extinct native species like the numbat, woylie and <b>scarlet-chested</b> <b>parrot</b> still survive in this landscape. It also has significant cultural values, including being the homeland of many Indigenous language groups including the Ngadju, Wongi, Gubrun and Noongar.
