The AlN films were deposited on the prepared <b>SAW</b> <b>devices</b> by mid-frequency magnetron sputtering.

The AlN coating layer can protect and improve the performance of the <b>SAW</b> <b>devices</b> at high temperature. The SAW velocity increases with increasing AlN coating layer thickness. The temperature coefficients of frequency (TCF) of the prepared <b>SAW</b> <b>devices</b> decrease with increasing thickness of AlN coating layers, while the electromechanical coupling coefficient (K 2) of the <b>SAW</b> <b>devices</b> increases with increasing AlN film thickness.

Piezoelectric {{materials are}} used in different types of transducers such as microphones, accelerometers, speakers, hydrophones, pressure sensors etc. Compared to traditional bulk piezoelectric crystals, thin film piezoelectric materials are promising to realize integrated devices with CMOS technology. Among thin film materials, zinc oxide (ZnO) is attractive due to the giant piezoelectric effect when doped with vanadium. In this study, we investigate the deposition of thin film ZnO and V-doped ZnO films. Materials characterization of ZnO thin films is performed.

5000|$|Microwave {{chemistry}} sensor or Surface {{acoustic wave}} (SAW) sensors consist of an input transducer, a chemically adsorbent polymer film, and an output transducer on a piezoelectric substrate, which is typically quartz. The input transducer launches an acoustic wave that travels through the chemical film and is detected by the output transducer. The Sandia-made device runs {{at a very}} high frequency (approximately 525 MHz), and the velocity and attenuation of the signal are sensitive to the viscoelasticity and mass of the thin film [...] SAWS have been able to distinguish organophosphates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, saturated hydrocarbons, and water [...] The SAW used in these tests have four channels—each channel consists of a transmitter and a receiver, separated by a small distance. Three of the four channels have a polymer deposited on the substrate between the transmitter and receiver. The purpose of the polymers is to adsorb chemicals of interest, with different polymers having different affinities to various chemicals. When a chemical is adsorbed, the mass of the polymer increases, causing a slight change in phase of the acoustic signal relative to the reference (fourth) channel, which does not contain a polymer. The <b>SAW</b> <b>device</b> also contains three Application Specific Integrated Circuit chips (ASICs), which contain the electronics to analyze the signals and provide a DC voltage signal proportional to the phase shift. The <b>SAW</b> <b>device,</b> containing the transducers and ASICs, is bonded to a piece of quartz glass, which is placed in a leadless chip carrier (LCC). Wire bonds connect the terminals of the leadless chip carrier to the SAW circuits.|$|E
