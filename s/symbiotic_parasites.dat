5000|$|In 2015, the {{biologist}} Roberto Cazzolla Gatti {{provided evidence}} for a variant theory, endogenosymbiosis, in which not only are organelles endosymbiotic, but that pieces of genetic material from <b>symbiotic</b> <b>parasites</b> ("gene carriers" [...] such as viruses, retroviruses and bacteriophages), {{are included in the}} host's nuclear DNA, changing the host's gene expression and contributing to the process of speciation.|$|E
5000|$|Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, Ph.D., {{associate}} professor at Tomsk State University (Russia), argued in his hypothesis that [...] "the main likely cause {{of the evolution of}} sexual reproduction, the parasitism, also represents the origin of biodiversity". In other terms, this theory suggests that sexual reproduction acts as a conservative system against the inclusion of new genetic variations into cells' DNA (supported by the DNA repair systems) and, instead, the evolution of species can take place only when this preservative system fails to contrast the inclusion, within the host genome, of hexogen parts of DNA (and RNA) coming from obliged [...] "parasitic" [...] elements (viruses and phages) that establish a symbiosis with their hosts. [...] "As two parallel evolutionary lines - Cazzolla Gatti wrote in his original paper - sexual reproduction seems to preserve what the endogenosymbiosis moves to diversify. Following the former process, the species can adapt slowly and indefinitely to the external factors, adjusting themselves, but not 'creating' novelty. The latter process, instead, leads to the speciation due to sudden changes in genes sequences. Not only organelles can be symbiotic with other cells, as suggested Lynn Margulis, but entire pieces of genetic material coming from <b>symbiotic</b> <b>parasites,</b> can be included in the host DNA, changing the gene expression and addressing the speciation process".|$|E
50|$|Parasitic Form - Also {{known as}} the First Form. This form is made when a {{creature}} allows a shadow to take shape in its shadow. In this form, the shadow is like a <b>symbiotic</b> <b>parasite,</b> only coming out when the host gives it permission. When a shadow takes shape, it must store its energy into the host. There is a time limitation on the shadow's power.|$|R

40|$|If {{you were}} {{to pick up and}} dissect any living {{organism}} from anywhere around the globe, you would undoubtedly find at least one other species inside of it—a symbiont, often a parasite. This ubiquity makes it clear that the way these passengers interact with their living habitats is key to understanding many aspects of life, primarily, the health and the well-being of free-living host species [1]. Like most animals, humans are replete with a large variety of <b>symbiotic</b> species, including <b>parasites,</b> which have plagued them since their origins and across their evolutionary history. No less than 179 species o...|$|R
25|$|The hygiene {{hypothesis}} {{was developed to}} explain the observation that hay fever and eczema, both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were, it is presumed, exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child. The hygiene hypothesis has been extensively investigated by immunologists and epidemiologists and has become an important theoretical framework {{for the study of}} allergic disorders. It is used to explain the increase in allergic diseases that have been seen since industrialization, and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries. The hygiene hypothesis has now expanded to include exposure to <b>symbiotic</b> bacteria and <b>parasites</b> as important modulators of immune system development, along with infectious agents.|$|R
40|$|Are parasites always {{harmful to}} their hosts? By definition, indeed, {{but in a}} few cases and {{particular}} environments, hosts experience higher fitness in the presence than in the absence of their <b>parasites.</b> <b>Symbiotic</b> associations form a continuum of interactions, from deleterious to beneficial effects on hosts. In this paper, we investigate the outcome of parasite infection of Arabidopsis thaliana by its natural pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsis. This system exhibits a wide range of parasite impact on host fitness with, surprisingly, deleterious effects on high fecundity hosts and, at the opposite extreme, seemingly beneficial effects on the least fecund one. This phenomenon might result from varying levels of tolerance among host lines and even overcompensation for parasite damage analogous to what can be observed in plant–herbivore systems...|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation is}} that the developing immune system must receive stimuli (from infectious agents, <b>symbiotic</b> bacteria, or <b>parasites)</b> to adequately develop regulatory T cells. Without that stimuli it becomes more susceptible to autoimmune diseases and allergic diseases, because of insufficiently repressed TH1 and TH2 responses, respectively. For example, all chronic inflammatory disorders show evidence of failed immunoregulation. Secondly, helminths, non-pathogenic ambient pseudocommensal bacteria or certain gut commensals and probiotics, drive immunoregulation. They block or treat models of all chronic inflammatory conditions. Thirdly, some such organisms (or molecules that they secrete), specifically expand populations of regulatory T cells (Treg), or cause dendritic cells to switch to regulatory forms that preferentially drive immunoregulation. Finally, when multiple sclerosis patients become infected with helminths, the disease stops progressing and circulating myelin-recognising regulatory T cells appear in the peripheral blood. This indicates that helminths act as adjuvants for regulatory T cells. This observation led to clinical trials.|$|R
