[...] Feldman {{and nine}} {{other of the}} team's top young pitchers were brought to Arlington in November for a week-long conditioning camp. [...] "It's different", Feldman said. [...] "In the past, {{it was a little}} more of 'this is what you need to do, now go out and do it.' Most guys would do it, but this is their way of overseeing it and making <b>sure</b> <b>everybody</b> is ready." ...|$|E
500|$|Game Show Network (GSN) {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} air Press Your Luck in September 2001, and high viewership ratings prompted the network to order {{a revival of the}} series. Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original Press Your Luck host Peter Tomarken and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, [...] "It was terribly hurtful and I think I was doomed before I did [...] I remember being told, 'No, no. Be nice. Be <b>sure</b> <b>everybody</b> likes you.' I took that advice with the pilot. I made the same mistake." [...] Tomarken also acknowledged that GSN wanted to employ a younger host in an effort to attract a younger audience.|$|E
500|$|Affeldt is {{a devout}} Christian {{and a strong}} {{advocate}} for ending child poverty. [...] He writes a weekly blog about his Christian faith and his desire to stir a movement {{in the cause of}} helping the suffering and marginalized. In October 2010, during a visit to a Bay Area elementary school alongside former Giants pitcher Juan Marichal, Affeldt told the students, [...] "I try to make <b>sure</b> <b>everybody,</b> all the young people in the world, also have a chance to dream really big." [...] In 2009, Affeldt donated five thousand dollars to the Not For Sale campaign for opening a medical clinic in Thailand for former child slaves. He also became a prominent member of Not For Sale's Free2Play campaign, pledging a $100 donation for every strikeout and recruiting other professional athletes, including his teammate Matt Cain and the St. Louis Cardinals' Matt Holliday. In addition, Affeldt has lent his support as a spokesperson for Larkin Street Youth Services, a San Francisco non-profit that provides services to young people experiencing homelessness.|$|E

Wilson returned {{to his home in}} Portland, Oregon to work on his side project, the Special Goodness, and Bell worked on his band Space Twins. Sharp left Weezer to complete the follow-up album for his group the Rentals. He said of his departure from Weezer: [...] "I don't really know how to speak on this because I don't know what should be kept private and what should be shared. I certainly have my view of it, as I'm <b>sure</b> <b>everybody</b> else has their sort of foggy things.

2500|$|Whitman {{appeared}} {{twice in}} New York City after the September 11 attacks to inform New Yorkers that the toxins {{released by the}} attacks posed no threat to their health. On September 18, the EPA released a report in which Whitman said, [...] "Given {{the scope of the}} tragedy from last week, I am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington, D.C. that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink." [...] She also said, [...] "The concentrations are such that they don't pose a health hazard...We're going to make <b>sure</b> <b>everybody</b> is safe." [...] A 2003 report by the EPA's Inspector General determined that the assurance was misleading, because the EPA [...] "did not have sufficient data and analyses" [...] to justify it.|$|E

[...] The following November, Carter revealed that the project was in the negotiation stage, explaining, [...] "Because it's a sequel, there are peculiar and specific kinds of negotiations that are holding us up." [...] Duchovny spoke of the premise for the yet-produced film in 2005, [...] "Mulder and Scully investigate one particular case that has nothing to do with alien life. It has to do with supernatural stuff." [...] He also explained, [...] "I think we're going back to the 'monster of the week' type feel, where if you're not an avid fan and don't understand the mythology, you can still come to it and get the movie." [...] Duchovny and Carter planned to begin production in the winter of 2005 to be released in the summer of 2006. The following April, Duchovny admitted to a lack of a script, adding that Carter would have it ready by early next year.|$|E

He sees (defenses) as well as any center I've been around." [...] He was also a preseason candidate for the Rimington Trophy as the nation's top center. Before the 2012 season, Walter Football called him a [...] "sleeper center prospect who deserves more attention." [...] He was quoted in the New York Times as saying [...] "I come from a high school where we ran the spread offense and it was just deep ball, deep ball, deep ball — that’s boring to me....

2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>everybody</b> on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1954, Orwig {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} as the athletic director at the University of Nebraska for $12,600 a year.

[...] Orwig was responsible during his seven years at Nebraska for creating the Touchdown Club, the Extra Point Club and the Husker Athletic Achievement Awards. [...] However, the football team did not fare well during Orwig's time there, as the football program went through three coaches (Bill Glassford, Pete Elliott, and Bill Jennings), and had a 27–44 record. [...] Orwig was the athletic director who hired Pete Elliott as the football coach at Nebraska in 1956. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I thought the world of him. I {{thought he was a}} great guy." [...] In 1961, Orwig quit his position at Nebraska to accept the athletic director job at Indiana; news reports indicated that Orwig had been offered $20,000 a year by Indiana, $5,000 more than he was making at Nebraska. [...] At the time, Orwig said: [...] "The decision to accept the Indiana University position as Director of Athletics was a most difficult one[...] [...] [...] The people of Nebraska and the University have been most kind to me over the past 7 years.

Well, there is always one thing; it will serve as a touchstone.
