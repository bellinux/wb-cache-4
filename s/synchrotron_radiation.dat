40|$|Relativistic {{electron}} beams {{with high}} six-dimensional phase space densities, i. e., high-brightness beams, {{are the basis}} for efficient generation of intense and coherent radiation beams for advanced scientific and industrial applications. The remarkable progress in <b>synchrotrons</b> <b>radiation</b> facilities from the first generation to the current, third-generation capability illustrates this point. With the recent development of the high-brightness electron gun based on laser-driven rf photocathodes, linacs have become another important option for high-brightness electron beams. With linacs of about 100 MeV, megawatt-class infrared free-electron lasers can be designed for industrial applications such as power beaming. With linacs of about 10 GeV, 1 -{angstrom} x-ray beams with brightness and time resolution exceeding by several orders of magnitude the current <b>synchrotrons</b> <b>radiation</b> sources can be generated based on self-amplified spontaneous emission.

5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only {{do so in a}} finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see <b>synchrotron</b> <b>radiation)</b> and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiation}} {{amplified by}} hydroxyl masers is the radio continuum of its host. This continuum is primarily composed of <b>synchrotron</b> <b>radiation</b> produced by Type II supernovae. Amplification of this background is low, with amplification factors, or gains, {{ranging from a}} few percent to a few hundred percent, and sources with larger hyperfine ratios typically exhibiting larger gains. Sources with higher gains typically have narrower emission lines. This is expected if the pre-gain linewidths are all roughly the same, as line centers are amplified more than the wings, leading to line narrowing.|$|E
40|$|The Advanced Photon Source (APS), a {{national}} user facility for <b>synchrotrons</b> <b>radiation</b> research, {{is located at}} Argonne National Laboratory, approximately 25 miles southwest of Chicago, Illinois. The APS is considered a third-generation <b>synchrotrons</b> <b>radiation</b> facility (specifically designed to accommodate insertion devices to serve as radiation sources) {{and is one of}} three such facilities in the world. Currently, it is the most brilliant source in the United States for research in such diverse fields as biology, medicine, materials science, chemistry, geology, agriculture and soil science, physics, and manufacturing technology.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to utilize dual energy, {{monochromatic}} X-rays produced from <b>synchrotrons</b> <b>radiation</b> {{in order to obtain}} noninvasive medical imaging. The application of <b>synchrotrons</b> <b>radiation</b> to medical imaging is based on the principle of iodine dichromography, first described by Bertil Jacobson of the Karolinska Institute in 1953. Medical imaging using <b>synchrotrons</b> <b>radiation</b> and K-edge dichromography was pioneered at Stanford University under the leadership of Dr. Ed Rubenstein, and the late Nobel Laureate in Physics, Dr. Robert Hofstadter. With progressive refinements in hardware, clinical-quality images were obtained of human coronary arteries utilizing peripheral injections of iodinated contrast agent. These images even now are far superior to those being presented by investigators using MRI as an imaging tool for coronary arteries. However, new supplies and instruments in the cardiac catheterization laboratory have served to transform coronary angiography into an outpatient procedure, with relatively little morbidity. We extended the principles learned with coronary angiography to noninvasive imaging of the human bronchial tree. For these images, we utilized xenon as the contrast agent, as it has a K-edge very similar to that of iodine. In this case, there is no true competing diagnostic test, and pulmonary neoplasm is an enormous public health concern. In early experiments, we demonstrated remarkably clear images of the human bronchial tree. These images have been shown internationally; however, funding difficulties primarily with the Department of Energy have not allowed for progression of this promising avenue of research. One potential criticism of the project is that in order to obtain these images, we utilized national laboratories. Some have questioned whether this would lead to a practical imaging modality. However, we have shown that the technology exists to allow for construction of a miniature storage ring, with a superconducting wiggler magnet, which would occupy minimal space, and would be of a cost comparable with that of a clinical cardiac catheterization laboratory. Much of the focus of this research is now shifting to Europe, where individual whom we have trained or with whom we have worked are now heading up extensive efforts in medical imaging and K-edge dichromography. This work is occurring mostly at DESY in Hamburg, and at the European Synchrotrons Research Laboratory (ESRF) in Grenoble. (B 204...|$|R

5|$|When an {{electron}} is moving through a magnetic field, it {{is subject to}} the Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity. This centripetal force causes the electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of <b>synchrotron</b> <b>radiation.</b> The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron, known as the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac Force, which creates a friction that slows the electron. This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron's own field upon itself.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the particle accelerator {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles. The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst. His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300MeV. In 1947, <b>synchrotron</b> <b>radiation</b> was discovered with a 70MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric. This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of <b>synchrotron</b> <b>radiation.</b> Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E

5|$|Examination of M87 at far {{infrared}} wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25μm. Normally such emission {{may be an}} indication of thermal emission by warm dust. However, {{in the case of}} M87, the emission appears to be fully explained by <b>synchrotron</b> <b>radiation</b> from the jet. Within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to survive for no more than 46million years because of the X-ray emission from the core. This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy. The combined mass of dust in this galaxy is no more than 70,000 times the mass of the Sun. By comparison, the Milky Way contains about a hundred million (108) solar masses worth of dust.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to relatively long-wavelength radiation, Jupiter also emits <b>synchrotron</b> <b>radiation</b> (also {{known as the}} Jovian decimetric radiation or DIM radiation) with frequencies {{in the range of}} 0.1–15GHz (wavelength from 3m to 2cm), which is the bremsstrahlung radiation of the relativistic electrons trapped in the inner radiation belts of the planet. The energy of the electrons that contribute to the DIM emissions is from 0.1 to 100MeV, while the leading contribution comes from the electrons with energy in the range 1–20MeV. This radiation is well understood and was used {{since the beginning of the}} 1960s to study the structure of the planet's magnetic field and radiation belts. The particles in the radiation belts originate in the outer magnetosphere and are adiabatically accelerated, when they are transported to the inner magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Close to Jupiter, the planet's {{rings and}} small moons absorb high-energy {{particles}} (energy above 10keV) from the radiation belts. This creates noticeable {{gaps in the}} belts' spatial distribution and affects the decimetric <b>synchrotron</b> <b>radiation.</b> In fact, the existence of Jupiter's rings was first hypothesized {{on the basis of}} data from the Pioneer 11 spacecraft, which detected a sharp drop in the number of high-energy ions close to the planet. The planetary magnetic field strongly influences the motion of sub-micrometer ring particles as well, which acquire an electrical charge under the influence of solar ultraviolet radiation. Their behavior {{is similar to that of}} co-rotating ions. The resonant interaction between the co-rotation and the orbital motion is thought to be responsible for the creation of Jupiter's innermost halo ring (located between 1.4 and 1.71RJ), which consists of sub-micrometer particles on highly inclined and eccentric orbits. The particles originate in the main ring; however, when they drift toward Jupiter, their orbits are modified by the strong 3:2 Lorentz resonance located at 1.71RJ, which increases their inclinations and eccentricities. Another 2:1 Lorentz resonance at 1.4Rj defines the inner boundary of the halo ring.|$|E
