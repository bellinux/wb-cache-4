5|$|As with Seasons, the Triforce {{calls out}} to Link. Link is transported to a forest {{in the land of}} Labrynna, where he hears <b>screaming.</b> <b>In</b> a clearing, Link finds a woman encircled by monsters. When the monsters see Link, they scatter in all directions. The woman is Princess Zelda's nurse, Impa, who asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. Continuing through the forest, the two find Nayru, a young woman with blue hair singing on a tree stump, {{surrounded}} by forest creatures. A shadow emerges from Impa and reveals itself as Veran, Sorceress of Shadows. Veran soars into Nayru's body and possesses her. Nayru was the Oracle of Ages; her abduction causes a disruption in the time flow of Labrynna.|$|E

The vet goes to the back and is {{attacked}} by the Dhole but he locks the room before it can cause any harm. The dog catchers arrive and open fire on the wrong dog. While the vet tries to operate on the hurt dog Scully enters the building and begins to hear <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> the back room. She discovers that the vet has been attacked. After Scully leaves, the hurt animal transforms into the dhole, revealing that the dog can mimic any shape.|$|E
5|$|The group {{travelled}} north, passing present-day Chillicothe, Ohio, {{on the way}} to a Mingo {{village on}} the north side of the Mad River, somewhere near present-day Logan County, Ohio. During the trip the Indians killed and scalped Martin's child, which they found burdensome. Martin responded by <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> grief; when the Indians' threats to scalp her did not quiet her screams, they whipped her until she was silent. Alder's life was spared due to his appearance. His captors thought his black hair would allow him to pass as an Indian.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} is Troy's {{memorial}} {{service and the}} wedding of Mayor Michael Ebbs (Ralph Fiennes) to Charlie Bratley's mother Terri (Rita Wilson). Lou finally realizes that his son actually has been kidnapped and heads out to look for him. Now at Lee's house, Crystal asks Lee to help stop the kidnapping scheme, {{but he does not}} comply. Crystal goes to Dean's house for help, where she finds him hallucinating about Troy's death and finally expressing his grief. Meanwhile, a paranoid Lee, encouraged by Billy, tries to kill Charlie Bratley to avoid being caught, but Charlie fights back and slices the knife through Billy's eye. Billy runs out into the street, <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> pain, and is hit by Lou's police car.|$|E
5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be a}} fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E
5|$|Quagmire {{returns home}} from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some {{fireworks}} into Quahog by hiding them in his anus. Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and could have just brought them in normally, but Quagmire doesn't see any fun in doing that. Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start {{to play with the}} fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire, but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away <b>screaming.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him.|$|E

5|$|While rain {{starts to}} fall, and {{people start to}} clear the streets, Carey remains walking on the pathway. The girl now reaches her destination, and is welcomed into the home of her lover. They soon board a bus, and travel to a new home where they will live together. As {{they are about to}} enter the bus, the girl's mother is seen <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> tears for her {{daughter}} to return to her. She hesitates, and then continues with her lover onto the transport. The scene once again focuses on Carey, who is standing {{in the midst of a}} torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in a long black gown, is shown singing at the altar of a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She stares at an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album from the beginning of the video.|$|E
25|$|Bob Burnquist managed {{an almost}} perfect Skateboard Vert {{run with a}} score of 98.00. This run is {{consider}} {{by many to be}} the best run ever in the history of skateboard vert, as Burnquist landed several tricks that had never been done before. Tony Hawk, who was commentating, nearly lost his voice while <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> disbelief.|$|E
25|$|Soulsteel : is {{made from}} human souls and the {{substance}} of the Labyrinth of the Underworld. It is jet black, and agonized faces of the souls it contains can be seen moving and <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> the metal. Unsurprisingly, this material is used almost exclusively by the Abyssal Exalted. Soulsteel weapons inflict heavy damage on living beings and frequently drain small quantities of Essence as well.|$|E

25|$|While {{inspecting}} the rabbits' old burrowing areas, Cole and the Bennets find a large, unusual animal track. Meanwhile, Cole's son Jackie (Chris Morrell) and Amanda go to {{a gold mine}} to visit Jackie's friend Billy but find him missing. Jackie finds more of the animal tracks in Billy's shed, while Amanda goes into the mine and runs into an enormous rabbit with blood on its face. <b>Screaming</b> <b>in</b> terror, she runs from the mine.|$|E
25|$|The film also deals {{briefly with}} the prisoners' conditions, and shows {{disturbing}} footage of prisoners and dead {{victims in the}} camps. While Night and Fog states that the Nazis made soap from the corpses, giving the possible impression that this was done regularly, this claim is nowadays considered untrue, {{with the exception of}} possible isolated cases. Researching the film was difficult for Resnais, who suffered nightmares from filming and found himself waking up <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> the night. These nightmares passed as Resnais began actual filming in Auschwitz.|$|E
25|$|Al-Maqrizi notes, that Khufu {{was named}} Saurid, Salhuk and/or Sarjak by the biblical Amalekites. Then he writes, that Khufu built the pyramids after repeating {{nightmare}}s, {{in which the}} earth turned upside-down, the stars fell down and people were <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> terror. Another nightmare showed the stars falling down from heaven and kidnapping humans, then putting these beneath two large mountains. King Khufu then received a warning from his prophets about a devastating deluge, that would come and destroy Egypt. To protect his treasures and books of wisdom, Khufu built the three pyramids of Giza.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the recurring motif of screaming mouths in many Bacons of the late 1940s and early 1950s was drawn {{from a number of}} sources, including medical text books, the works of Matthias Grünewald and photographic stills of the nurse in the Odessa Steps scene in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent The Battleship Potemkin. Bacon saw the film in 1935, and viewed it frequently thereafter. He kept in his studio a photographic still of the scene, showing a close-up of the nurse's head <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> panic and terror and with broken pince-nez spectacles hanging from her blood-stained face. He referred to the image throughout his career, using it as a source of inspiration.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{music videos}} for the song. One {{features}} visual footage {{shot at the}} Albany James H. Gray, Sr. Civic Center in Albany GA on 7 May 1987 of Adams and his band performing the song live, with the audience <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> the background. The other shows Adams walking out of a stadium and through a field, interspersed with shots of him with his guitar, {{as well as a}} woman (played by Lysette Anthony) who appears to be having relationship problems with her boyfriend; the video culminates with Adams walking out onto the field of a packed football stadium while a video of him playing the song plays on the big screen.|$|E
25|$|Hanging {{from the}} cross, Jesus prays to God asking {{forgiveness}} {{for the people}} who did this to him, and redeems a criminal as a saint who is crucified beside him. Succumbing to impending death, Jesus gives up his spirit and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering a sudden earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the cloth covering the Holy of Holies in two, to the horror of Caiaphas and the other priests. Satan is shown <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> agonized defeat. Jesus' lifeless body is taken down from the cross, and entombed. In the end, the healed body of Jesus rises from the dead and exits the tomb resurrected.|$|E

50|$|After {{working with}} Ken Scott, Hellion entered Baby O {{recording}} studios with engineer, Mikey Davis, whose credits include W.A.S.P., Kiss, The Plimsouls, and more, {{to record their}} <b>Screams</b> <b>In</b> The Night album. <b>Screams</b> <b>In</b> The Night was released in England on Music For Nations Records, {{as well as on}} Roadrunner Records in Europe. Unable to land a record deal in America, Ann Boleyn began her own record company, New Renaissance Records. A video for the song, Bad Attitude, from the <b>Screams</b> <b>In</b> The Night album gained Hellion substantial radio airplay in the United States as well as a video on MTV, VH1, and Sky Channel. With the exception of The Plasmatics, Hellion's video marked the first time a female-fronted metal band was featured on MTV.|$|R
25|$|The {{explosion}} {{blew out}} all {{the windows in the}} vicinity, sending shards of glass into people's faces and bodies as they were hit by falling masonry and timber; severed limbs were hurled into the road and into the mangled front of an office building. The ground floor of the News Letter offices and all buildings in the area suffered heavy damage. The News Letter library in particular sustained considerable damage with many priceless photographs and old documents destroyed. Around the blast's epicentre, the street resembled a battlefield. About one hundred schoolgirls lay wounded on the rubble-strewn, bloody pavement covered in glass and debris, and <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> pain and fright. A total of 148 people were injured in the explosion, 19 of them seriously, including people who had lost eyes and were badly maimed. Among the injured were many News Letter staff.|$|E
25|$|Other {{images of}} despair and madness fill the scene: a lunatic cavorts {{in the street}} beating himself {{over the head with}} a pair of bellows while holding a baby impaled on a spike—the dead child's frantic mother rushes from the house <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> horror; a barber has taken his own life in the {{dilapidated}} attic of his barber-shop, ruined because nobody can afford a haircut or shave; on the steps, below the woman who has let her baby fall, a skeletal pamphlet-seller rests, perhaps dead of starvation, as the unsold moralising pamphlet on the evils of gin-drinking, The Downfall of Mrs Gin, slips from his basket. An ex-soldier, he has pawned most of his clothes to buy the gin in his basket, next to the pamphlet that denounces it. Next to him sits a black dog, a symbol of despair and depression. Outside the distiller a fight has broken out, and a crazed cripple raises his crutch to strike his blind compatriot.|$|E
25|$|Friedkin went to some {{extraordinary}} lengths, {{reminiscent of}} some directors {{from the old}} Hollywood directing style, manipulating the actors, to get the genuine reactions he wanted. Yanked violently around in harnesses, both Blair and Burstyn suffered back injuries and their painful screams went right into the film. Burstyn injured her back after landing on her coccyx when a stuntman jerked her around using a special effects cable during the scene when Regan slaps her mother. According to the documentary Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist, however, the injury did not cause permanent damage, although Burstyn was upset the shot of her <b>screaming</b> <b>in</b> pain {{was used in the}} film. After asking Father William O'Malley if he trusted him and being told yes, Friedkin slapped him hard across the face before a take to generate a deeply solemn reaction that was used in the film as a very emotional Father Dyer read last rites to Father Karras; this offended the many Catholic crew members on the set. He also fired blanks without warning on the set to elicit shock from Jason Miller for one of the takes, and only told Miller that pea soup would hit him in the chest rather than the face concerning the projectile-vomiting scene, resulting in his disgusted reaction. Lastly, he had Regan's bedroom set built inside a freezer so that the actors' breath could be visible on camera, which required the crew to wear parkas and other cold-weather gear.|$|E
