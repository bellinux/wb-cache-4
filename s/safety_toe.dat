5000|$|At {{one point}} the Australian Occupational Health & Safety Department (Note: Nice story but {{there has never been}} such a Department!) {{realised}} that there were thousands of factory workers wearing these shoes without steel <b>safety</b> <b>toe</b> caps. Although uncommon for such a light shoe to feature a steel cap, Dunlop Footwear was quick to solve the problem by creating a [...] "safety" [...] version with a steel toe cap.|$|E
50|$|By the 1970s, western boots {{had become}} the {{majority}} of boots produced. The Richland plant {{was the first in}} the United States to manufacture western boots with a <b>safety</b> <b>toe,</b> the first boots to pass the now standard Class 75 ANSI tests for safety footwear. When computerized fancy stitch machines hit the shoe market, the line expanded into the dress western boot business.In 1981, it was necessary to expand again. A facility was located in Womelsdorf, Pennsylvania, that was large enough for manufacturing and warehouse space. In 1993 the name was changed to Double-H Boots to reflect the company heritage of H.H. Brown.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} comply with ASTM F 2413-11 and M I/75 C/75 {{standards}} for impact and compression, Red Wing Shoes manufactures many of their styles with steel, non-metallic, and aluminum <b>safety</b> <b>toes</b> and offers puncture-resistant options that meet the ASTM F 2413-11 standard. Red Wing Shoes also produces footwear that is static-dissipative {{in order to control}} the amount of electrical discharge from the body and electrical hazard in order to provide extra protection from accidental contact with electrically energized objects. In 2014, in its first ever recall, Red Wing Shoes was forced to recall over 114,000 pairs of steel toe boots due to defective toe caps that could fail to protect wearers' feet.|$|R
50|$|The first {{component}} of firefighting equipment is the uniform that a firefighter will wear around the station. Its {{purpose is to}} provide a comfortable clothing that they wear around the station, but will not become an obstruction when a firefighter is required to put on his/her turnout gear. Naturally, turnout gear is to be worn over the station garments during any call that a firefighter is called upon. Another aspect of the station uniform is the station safety shoes, commonly referred to as work boots. These shoes are required to be fitted with <b>safety</b> <b>toes</b> and puncture-resistant soles in most countries in case the firefighter goes out on a call that does not require his/her turnout gear.|$|R

5000|$|Firefighter turnout {{boots are}} usually sized {{as a regular}} shoe, but are made of rubber or leather with a Boron Steel toe insert. The boots are slipped inside {{the legs of the}} {{trousers}} to maintain a barrier from the heat given off by the fire. When the trousers and boots are not being actively used, the trousers will fold down and out around the shins of the boots, ready for quick access for the firefighter. Due to the enormous amounts of potential hazards at a fire scene to the feet, turnout boots are required {{to be able to handle}} a variety of different burns and blows. All boots are required to be outfitted with <b>safety</b> <b>toes</b> and a puncture-resistant midsole plate to prevent puncture from sharp objects that may be stepped on. Such emphasis on the midsole plate is made that IFSTA has deemed that “if there is doubt about midsole protection, should go as far as to x-ray the boot.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Material {{requirements}} of uniforms are varied, though most require no denim. Some districts' restrictions include no leggings or [...] "stretchy" [...] material (unless used as undergarments).

40|$|NoPURPOSE: The risk {{of falling}} {{increases}} dramatically with age, and visual impairment {{is known to}} be an important risk factor. Therefore, it is highly pertinent to assess the effects of age and vision on the performance of everyday tasks linked to falling, such as stepping from one level to another. METHODS: Nine young (age, 26 +/- 4 years) and ten elderly (age, 72 +/- 5 years) subjects performed a stepping-up task of three different heights. Their stepping strategies with blurred and optimally corrected vision were compared. Center of mass (CM), center of pressure (CP) dynamics (in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions), and foot clearance parameters were determined, and statistical regression modeling was applied. RESULTS: Elderly subjects spent 20 % more time (P = 0. 03) than young subjects during double support and they had reduced anteroposterior CM-CP divergence (P < 0. 001) during double support and slower anteroposterior (P < 0. 001) and mediolateral (P = 0. 002) CM velocities during initiation of movement and single limb support. Blur caused similar adaptations, such as increased toe clearance, across both age groups, though mediolateral (ML) CM-CP divergence in elderly subjects was significantly more reduced than in young subjects (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate, in general, that older subjects used a more cautious and controlled stepping strategy. However, the lack of significant age differences in toe clearance suggests this strategy was mainly aimed at reducing ML instability rather than increasing margins of <b>safety</b> regarding <b>toe</b> clearance...|$|R
40|$|The World Health Organisation (WHO) {{launched}} the Surgical Safety Checklist in 2008. The introduction of this checklist {{resulted in a}} significant reduction in the incidence of complications and death in patients undergoing surgery. Consequently, the WHO Surgical Safety checklist is recommended for use by the National Patient Safety Agency for all patients undergoing surgery. However, many invasive or interventional procedures occur outside the theatre setting and there are increasing requirements for a safety checklist to be used prior to such procedures. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is an invasive procedure and although generally considered to be safe, it carries the risk of serious and potentially life-threatening complications. Strict adherence to a safety checklist may reduce the rate of significant complications during TOE. However, the standard WHO Surgical Safety Checklist is not designed for procedures outside the theatre environment and therefore this document is designed to be a procedure-specific <b>safety</b> checklist for <b>TOE.</b> It has been endorsed for use by the British Society of Echocardiography and the Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthetists...|$|R
40|$|High-velocity {{plunging}} water jets, {{appearing at}} {{the downstream end}} of dam weirs and spillways, can create scour of the rock. The prediction of this scour is necessary to ensure the <b>safety</b> of the <b>toe</b> of the dam {{as well as the}} stability of its abutments. A physically based engineering model has been developed at the Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions for evaluation of the ultimate scour depth. This model is based on experimental measurements of water pressures at plunge pool bottoms and inside underlying rock joints. The pressures inside the joints revealed to be of highly transient nature and governed by the presence of free air. Hence, a numerical modelling of these pressures was performed, in collaboration with the Laboratory of Applied Hydrodynamics and Hydraulic Constructions (HACH), based on the one-dimensional transient flow equations applied to a pseudo-fluid. The amount of free air {{is a function of the}} instantaneous pressure inside the joint and has been accounted for by means of appropriate celerity-pressure relationships. These relationships are defined by the ideal gas law and Henry’s law and were optimised by means of a genetic algorithm optimisation technique. Very good agreement has been obtained between the measured and computed pressures at the end location of one-dimensional closed-end rock joints. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|All armour {{standards}} are codified, with slight variations {{between the different}} regional groups within the SCA. All vital points are covered by some hard rigid protection. Generally, armour covers the fighter from head to <b>toe.</b> <b>Safety</b> {{standards are}} high and generally well enforced, with few serious injuries in comparison to other sports. Steel is generally used for armour (though aluminum, leather and even plastic or carpet may be used if they are covered over). There {{are a number of}} armourers that supply the SCA and other living history groups, but many make their own armour, while some participants may import armour from overseas. Armour is generally encouraged to look like its historical counterpart, though differences are often necessary to comply with safety requirements, and sometimes modern sport armour may be used [...] One of the most common examples is the face of a helmet: While many types of historical helm had no face protection, safety rules require full coverage of the head. As a result, there are many variations of helm used in the SCA that are otherwise historically accurate but have a steel grill added to cover the face.Armour costs can vary greatly from DIY, donation, and buying used armour up to $10,000 USD for museum quality armour, and may weigh as much as 70 pounds.|$|R
40|$|NoPURPOSE. Epidemiologic {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that elderly people who wear multifocal spectacles have an increased risk of tripping, particularly on stairs. Yet no studies have experimentally examined how wearing multifocal spectacles affects stair and step negotiation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of wearing multifocal compared with single-distance vision spectacles on minimum toe clearance and risk of tripping during step negotiation in the elderly. METHODS. Nineteen healthy subjects (mean age, 71. 4 years) performed a single step up to a new level (heights, 7. 5, 15, and 22 cm) while wearing multifocal (bifocals and progressive addition lenses) or single-distance vision spectacles. Minimum horizontal and vertical toe clearance were assessed by analyzing data collected with a five-camera, three-dimensional motion-analysis system. RESULTS. There was no difference in mean minimum toe clearance in subjects when wearing multifocal compared with single-distance vision spectacles. However, there was greater within-subject variability in vertical toe clearance when wearing multifocal spectacles (variance ratio, 1. 53; P = 0. 0004). Subjects were also significantly more likely to trip when wearing multifocal compared with single-vision spectacles (one-sided Fisher's exact test P = 0. 025). CONCLUSIONS. Because of increased within-subject variability in vertical toe clearance when wearing multifocal spectacles, elderly individuals may be at greater risk of falling when negotiating steps and stairs if they do not also consistently increase margins of <b>safety</b> (mean vertical <b>toe</b> clearance). This suggests that some elderly who are at high risk of falling may benefit from wearing single-distance vision rather than multifocal spectacles when walking...|$|R
