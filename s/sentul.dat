25|$|Since corporatisation of KTMB, a {{programme}} of modernisation {{has been}} underway. In 1989, it embarked on the double-tracking and electrification of trunk line between Rawang and Seremban and the branch lines between Batu Junction and <b>Sentul,</b> and between Kuala Lumpur and Port Klang which allowed the KTM Komuter service to start running in 1995. The next major project was the Rawang-Ipoh double tracking and electrification project, {{which started in}} 2000, but the project has been repeatedly delayed by contractual disputes and {{is not expected to}} be ready before 2007. When complete, KTM expects to introduce frequent intercity service (16 trains/day) running at speeds of up to 160km/hour. In 2002, the Malaysian government proposed the ambitious project of electrifying and double-tracking the entire western line and awarded contracts in 2003. The project was however put on hold by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi until March 2007 when Deputy Prime Minister Mohd Najib Abdul Razak announced the project's revival. In April 2007, the government announced that contracts for certain portions of the project had been awarded. In 2007, work also started to electrify and double-track the stretch of track between <b>Sentul</b> and Batu Caves.|$|E
