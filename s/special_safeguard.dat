40|$|The {{record of}} {{traditional}} safeguard {{provisions of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization provides useful information about how a <b>special</b> agricultural <b>safeguard</b> might be made effective. The success of existing safeguard or flexibility provisions to sustain long-run liberalization programs stems from their requiring objective, transparent, and participatory decisions on {{the application of the}} import restrictions they allow. The proposed <b>special</b> agricultural <b>safeguard</b> expands by arithmetic formula the bounds within which a Member may impose a new import restriction. Analysis reported here suggests that the formulas provide a poor guide for policy, indicating that they would frequently prescribe action that is not needed and fail to prescribe action when it would be appropriate. Analysis of the existing agricultural safeguard, to which the <b>special</b> agricultural <b>safeguard</b> is similar, indicates that it has functioned not as an allowance for occasional response to unusual situations but as an expansion of the limits Members have accepted through tariff bindings. To be useful, the <b>special</b> agricultural <b>safeguard</b> should do more than provide formulas for import restrictions. It should provide for objective and participatory processes that would bring forward relevant information and guide an objective and balanced accounting of the interests at play.

In many countries large populations living in rural areas, with limited access to infrastructure, farming resources and few employment alternatives.

Debates have arisen around this question, some negotiating parties claiming that SSM could be repeatedly and excessively invoked, distorting trade. In turn, the G33 bloc of developing countries, a major SSM proponent, has argued that breaches of bound tariffs should not be ruled out if the SSM is to be an effective remedy. A 2010 study by the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development simulated the consequences of SSM on global trade for both developed and developing countries.|$|E

Moreover, the extent to which low-income countries should be allowed to exceed pre-Doha bound rates depends heavily on the product under consideration, the ambition of the tariff cutting exercise, and the gap between members’ bound and applied tariffs. agriculture, Doha Development Agenda, July Package, <b>Special</b> <b>Safeguard</b> Mechanism, World Trade Organization, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|Trade liberalization, {{particularly}} QR elimination, enhances border-to-domestic price transmission. A political {{obstacle to}} further liberalization (and to exposure to greater price transmission) {{in developing countries}} is fear of extended low price periods in import-competing sectors. World commodity prices show shock persistence and asymmetry, with short-duration spikes and longer-duration troughs. Developing countries are unlikely to adopt fiscally burdensome domestic programs to compensate for persistent low-price episodes, making border measures attractive. WTO Special Safeguards could address low price problems, but present rules exclude their use by most developing countries. A possible modification of the <b>Special</b> <b>Safeguard</b> Clause could encourage reduction of overall protection. World price characteristics {{and the implications of}} low price periods for import-competing farmers are reviewed. To manage low-price risk under WTO commitments a restricted price floor policy could be implemented through a <b>Special</b> <b>Safeguard</b> Mechanism.
