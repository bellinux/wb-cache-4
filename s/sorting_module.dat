40|$|In this thesis, I have {{developed}} a piezoelectric-actuated micro-fluorescence-activated cell sorter ([Mu]FACS) and demonstrate its performances using various biological samples including mammalian cell and bacteria. Three major developments in this work included a high-sensitivity detection system, fast-response on-chip piezoelectric cell <b>sorting</b> <b>module,</b> and system integration. In my early work, optical arrayed waveguides combined with cross-correlation signal processing algorithm are implemented to achieve high-sensitivity scattering detection. The insight gained from the algorithm further allowed me to design and implement a spatial-filter based (space-time coding) fluorescent detection system. The system enables not only signal amplification (228 } 018 dB SNR enhancement) but also sorting even verification, allowing real-time optimization of sorting parameters. The first generation on-chip cell- <b>sorting</b> <b>module</b> involves flow-redirection using the principle of nozzle-diffuser, but due to the periodic flow and high fluid disturbance resulted from high-voltage piezoelectric actuation, the <b>sorting</b> <b>module</b> was redesigned, resulting in piezoelectric-actuated cell <b>sorting</b> <b>module.</b> The inexpensive module was able to manipulate single cells at high rate (> 1000 cells/s) under low powered actuation (80 %. Sample enriching experiments were done using beads and human mammalian cells, showing an enrichment factor > 200 fold (comparable to commercial FACS), which is the highest among [Mu]FACS systems. The developed integrated [Mu]FACS was also applied to address the challenges (detection sensitivity and cell-free DNA contamination) commonly encountered in single-cell genome sequencing. Flow cytometry-modified Tyramide Signal Amplification Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (TSA-FISH) and two-step optofluidic light confinement were implemented to enhance sensitivity. Also, dual-round cell-free DNA purification was performed and compared to commercial FACS, showing comparable results. Sorting of rare bacteria was achieved, showing 223 -fold enrichment. I hope the work sets the benchmark for the future development of [Mu]FACS systems. I believe the realization of a truly hand-held [Mu]FACS that can be afforded by every research labs and clinics is not far of...|$|E

Innovative imaging techniques coupled with fast linear motor-based motion systems and a flexible end-effector system allow the operator to remove items from the waste stream by {{a touch of the}} finger. When all desired items are removed from the waste stream, the remaining objects are automatically moved to a repackaging port for removal from the glovebox/cell. The Transuranic Waste <b>Sorting</b> <b>Module</b> consists of 1) a high accuracy XYZ Stereo Measurement and Imaging system, 2) a vibrating/tilting sorting table, 3) an XY Deployment System, 4) a ZR Deployment System, 5) several user-selectable end-effectors, 6) a waste bag opening system, 7) control and instrumentation, 8) a noncompliant waste load-out area, and 9) a Human/Machine Interface (HMI). The system is modular in design to accommodate database management tools, additional load-out ports, and other enhancements. Manually sorting the contents of a 55 -gallon drum takes about one day per drum. The HANDSS- 55 Waste <b>Sorting</b> <b>Module</b> {{is designed}} to significantly increase the throughput of this sorting process by automating those functions that are strenuous and tiresome for an operator to perform. The Waste <b>Sorting</b> <b>Module</b> uses the inherent ability of an operator to identify the items that need to be segregated from the waste stream and then, under computer control, picks that item out of the waste and deposits it in the appropriate location. The operator identifies the object by locating the visual image on a large color display and touches the image on the display with his finger. The computer then determines the location of the object, and performing a highspeed image analysis determines its size and orientation, so that a robotic gripper can be deployed to pick it up. Following operator verification by voice or function key, the object is deposited into a specified location...|$|E

For the Macro Flow Planktometer (MFP) developed during MAROPT I/II a <b>sorting</b> <b>module</b> should be developed to faciliate analysis-triggered sorting of organisms. For the subproject in Kiel an empty-image rejection device should be developed to filter useful images out of an analog video signal. A setup of the MFP with an electromechanical <b>sorting</b> <b>module</b> was constructed and build. The additional electronic circuitry for the <b>sorting</b> <b>module</b> was developed on an Eurocard board. For adjusting purposes a microscope with an LED flags illumination was added. Using eggs and larvae of artemia salina as test particles, a purity of the sorted fraction of more than 90 % could be achieved. In Hamburg different fluorochromes have been tested. Propidium iodide has proved its suitability. A staining technique using this fluorochrome has been developed. For the fast sedimenting particles a new sample inlet was developed. An average of 86 % of the organisms was separated from the sediment. For the realtime detection of empty video images the 'Primaspeed' Image processing board by Leutron Vision is employed. Empty-image detection is done by evaluating a histogram. If the number of white pixels exceeds a certain limit, the image is routed to the output, otherwise the output is blanked. (orig.)

This is why there is a necessity for tools that can automate the processes.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} method whereby sperm with {{phosphatidylserine}} externalization can {{be separated from}} those without this feature. Because annexin V binds phosphatidylserine, this study is using this feature to select functional spermatozoa. In addition, the relationship between annexin V binding in human spermatozoa and normal sperm morphology according to strict criteria was to be assessed. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Stellenbosch University at Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Tygerberg, South Africa. Patient(s) : Semen from 14 healthy sperm donors. Exclusion criterion was the presence of less than 20 × 106 /mL total motile spermatozoa in the original sample. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Annexin V-negative sperm, annexin V-positive sperm, normal sperm morphology. Intervention(s) : An aliquot of a semen sample after double density gradient centrifugation was incubated with annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (FITC). Cell fluorescence signals were determined using a FACScalibur flow cytometer equipped with a FACSSort fluidic <b>sorting</b> <b>module.</b> The sorting procedure delivered two sperm subpopulations: annexin V-negative and annexin V-positive. Morphology slides were made and the sperm morphology was assessed according to strict criteria. Result(s) : There was a significant enrichment of annexin V-negative sperm as well as morphologically normal sperm in the annexin V-negative subgroup after separation with flow cytometry. The percentage of morphologically normal sperm increased from 8. 3 % in the control to 11. 9 % in the annexin V-negative fraction, whereas the percentage of annexin V-positive sperm decreased to 5. 7 %. Conclusion(s) : The annexin V-negative sperm subpopulation had morphologically superior quality sperm compared to annexin V-positive sperm. It is important to select morphologically normal sperm during intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as it may contribute to increased implantation and pregnancy rates (PR). © 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

40|$|In this thesis, a new {{microfluidic}} device is presented for sorting of deformable particles {{based on the}} hydrodynamic resistance induced in a microchannel. Hydrodynamic resistance {{can be related to}} physical properties, including size and deformability of the particle, and can also be influenced by particle-wall interactions, hence allowing sorting based on any of these characteristics. This device could find application in cell sorting and bioseparation for therapeutics, research, and point-of-care diagnostics, as well as in sorting of droplets and emulsions for research and industrial applications (e. g., pharmaceutics, food industry, etc.). The device design is carried out using an equivalent resistance model, and numerical simulations are used to validate the design. The device is fabricated in PDMS, flow velocities are characterized using particle streak velocimetry, and sorting experiments are conducted to sort deformable gelatin particles according to size, and droplets of water and glycerol according to deformability. A sorting resolution of approximately 1 pm was obtained when sorting based on size, and droplets of water and glycerol were sorted into separate streams when sorting based on deformability. The main strength of the device over existing technology lies in its simplicity: sorting is carried out passively in the microfluidic circuit, eliminating the need for additional detection or <b>sorting</b> <b>modules.</b> Moreover, the device could be easily customized to change the sorting parameter or the sorting threshold, and multiple devices can be combined in parallel (to increase throughput) or in series (to increase resolution). by Mohamed Salem Raafat.

40|$|This paper aims {{to take a}} {{first step}} towards a CSP-based module systems for {{constraint}} programming languages and modeling tools. The call for such a system is two-fold. First, most existing constraint programming languages have some <b>sort</b> of <b>module</b> systems, but these systems are designed for the underlying languages. Thus these module systems facilitate the construction of large constraint programs in a particular language, but not of CSP models. Second, a module system designed for CSP models with clear and clean semantics should allow us to reason the properties of CSP models declaratively without actually solving the CSPs. As a first attempt, we introduce six operators for manipulating and transforming CSP models: namely intersection, union, channeling, induction, negation, and complementation. For each operator, we give its syntactic construction rule, define its set-theoretic meaning, and also examine its algebraic properties, all illustrated with examples where appropriate.

Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to propose a system that helps facilitate and improve the quality of decision making, reduces the level of substandard goods, and facilitates data capturing and manipulation, to help a warehouses improve quality assurance in the inventory-receiving process with the support of technology. Design/methodology/approach - This system consists of three modules, which integrate the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, case-based reasoning (CBR), and fuzzy reasoning (FR) technique to help monitor food quality assurance activities. In the first module, the data collection module, raw warehouse and work station information are collected. In the second module, the data <b>sorting</b> <b>module,</b> the collected data are stored in a database. In this module, data are decoded, and the coding stored in the RFID tags are transformed into meaningful information.

Findings - To validate the feasibility of the proposed system, a case study was conducted in food manufacturing companies. A pilot run of the system revealed that the performance of the receiving operation assignment and food quality assurance activities improved significantly. Originality/value - In summary, the major contribution of this paper is to develop an effective infrastructure for managing food-receiving process and facilitating decision making in quality assurance.

Algebraic Petri nets, a kind of high level nets, are a great improvement over the Petri nets, i.e. Petri nets tokens are replaced with data structures which are described by means of algebraic abstract data types.

Evolutionary psychologists have argued that separate mental modules are solutions to separate evolutionary problems. I argue that the structure of developmental modules in an organism helps determine what counts as a separate evolutionary problem for that organism. I suggest that homology as an organizing principle for research in evolutionary psychology, has been severely neglected in favor of analogy (adaptive function). I consider some arguments suggesting that determining homology is less epistemically demanding than determining adaptive function and argue that psychological categories defined by homology are, in fact, more suitable objects of psychological - and particularly neuropsychological - investigation than categories defined by analogy.

40|$|Endocytosed {{proteins}} {{are either}} {{returned to the}} cell surface via a recycling pathway or are delivered to the lysosome/vacuole to be degraded. Endosomal sorting of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae high-affinity iron transporter, composed of the Fet 3 and Ftr 1 proteins, is regulated by available iron. The molecular mechanisms underlying the differential trafficking of the transporter based on this environmental cue have until now remained undefined. ^ In iron-starved cells, Fet 3 p-Ftr 1 p is maintained on the plasma membrane via an endocytic recycling pathway. Endocytic recycling of Fet 3 p-Ftr 1 p requires the sorting nexin Grd 19 /Snx 3 p, the pentameric retromer complex, and the Ypt 6 p Golgi Rab GTPase <b>module.</b> <b>Sorting</b> into the recycling pathway is mediated by direct binding of Grd 19 /Snx 3 p to a recycling signal within the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of Ftr 1 p. Retromer and Grd 19 /Snx 3 p co-localize in part to endosomal membranes where they are physically associated. Grd 19 /Snx 3 p thus functions as a cargo-specific adapter for retromer, conferring additional cargo selectivity on the complex. In contrast, when iron is provided to iron-starved cells, Fet 3 p-Ftr 1 p is internalized from the plasma membrane and is delivered to the lumen of the vacuole to be degraded. Iron-regulated degradation is mediated by the multivesicular body (MVB) sorting pathway. In mutant cells lacking the Rsp 5 p ubiquitin ligase or components of the MVB machinery, Fet 3 p-Ftrlp is constitutively sorted into the recycling pathway regardless of iron status. A mutant form of Fet 3 p-Ftrlp, in which all 22 cytosolic lysine residues {{have been replaced by}} arginines, is also constitutively recycled, and it accumulates transiently in an endosome to which a subunit of the MVB sorting receptor (Vps 27 p), Grd 19 /Snx 3 p, and retromer proteins all co-localize. This endosome is where regulated sorting of the iron transporter occurs, and the recycling and degradative pathways diverge from this point. Therefore, the MVB pathway and the retromer-dependent recycling pathway have functionally antagonistic roles at the same intracellular compartment in mediating iron-regulated trafficking of the Fet 3 p-Ftr 1 p transporter. ...|$|R
