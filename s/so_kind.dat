Tonga would face South Africa in their first match of the tournament {{where they would be}} comfortable victors in a 66–18 drubbing, however the rest of the tournament would not be <b>so</b> <b>kind</b> to the Tongan side with losses to both France and Papua New Guinea meaning the Tongans would again fail to make it past the first stage of the tournament.|$|E

The next decade would not be <b>so</b> <b>kind,</b> however, as the Central Wholesale organization began a long term decline owing in large measure to the growth of supermarkets in the United States. This loss of size and strength moved the CCW to seek formal consolidation with other like-minded enterprises in the region.|$|E
25|$|After he died, Graupner's works {{fell into}} obscurity {{for a number}} of reasons. His manuscripts became the object of a long legal battle between his heirs and the rulers of Hesse-Darmstadt. A final court {{decision}} denied the Graupner estate ownership of the music manuscripts. The heirs were unable to obtain permission to sell or publish his works and they remained inaccessible to the public. Dramatic changes in music styles had reduced the interest in Graupner's music. On the positive side however, the Landgrave's seizure of Graupner's musical estate ensured its survival in toto. Fate was not <b>so</b> <b>kind</b> to J. S. Bach's musical legacy, for example. Another factor that contributed to Graupner's posthumous obscurity was that, unlike Bach, Graupner had very few pupils other than Johann Friedrich Fasch to carry on his musical legacy.|$|E

500|$|Two {{months after}} the end of the war, the King's {{youngest}} son, John, died at the age of 13 after a lifetime of ill health.

500|$|Bosley Crowther was not <b>so</b> <b>kind</b> to Dangerous to Know (1938), {{which he}} called a [...] "second-rate melodrama, hardly worthy of the talents of its {{generally}} capable cast". In King of Chinatown Wong played a surgeon who sacrifices a high-paying promotion in order to devote her energies to helping the Chinese fight the Japanese invasion. The New York Times Frank Nugent gave the film a negative review. Though he commented positively on its advocacy of the Chinese in their fight against Japan, he wrote, [...] "...Paramount should have spared us and its cast... the necessity of being bothered with such folderol".|$|E

For people like me who were exploring those sounds, the wonder of if it's going to work or not just went away at that point." [...] English musician Steven Wilson said, [...] "People think the 80s were a shallow, superficial era", but he cited So as an album that was [...] "really smart".|$|E
500|$|Of {{literary}} figures {{after the}} Lake Poets among those most {{closely associated with}} Keswick was the novelist Hugh Walpole. In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange {{at the opposite end}} of Derwentwater. Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, [...] "That I love Cumberland with all my heart and soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books. That I wasn't born a Cumbrian isn't my fault: that Cumbrians, in spite of my 'foreignness', have been <b>so</b> <b>kind</b> to me, is my good fortune." ...|$|E

The parties did not undertake a formal engagement, but assumed that the match would take place in due time.|$|E
500|$|Ferb was devised as a {{character}} devoid of ill will. Marsh explained, [...] "It was important to us that [...] never did anything with any animosity. They never tried to get their sister in trouble or outsmart their mother {{and get away with}} it." [...] Instead, he and his brother create things for the sheer enjoyment of it or to help out others ("and for the ladies"); for example, Ferb and Phineas carve Candace's face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday, set up a roller derby for a rematch race with his Grandmother Betty Jo's old rival, create a haunted house for their friend Isabella to cure her hiccups and make a super-computer to find out what to do for their mom after being <b>so</b> <b>kind</b> to them.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{mentioned}} Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century {{art historian}} Albert Boime described them as [...] "powerful, vulturine... grasping his thighs in a gesture... projecting... enormous strength controlled". Some contemporary critics were not <b>so</b> <b>kind.</b> The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged {{what he saw}} as a [...] "fantastical bundle of flesh... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!" [...] Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: [...] "A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality... the energetic and mighty nature".|$|E

500|$|Two {{months after}} the end of the war, Queen Mary's {{youngest}} son, John, died at the age of thirteen.

The first break in the family circle is hard to bear but people have been <b>so</b> <b>kind</b> & sympathetic & this has helped us [...] much." [...] Her staunch support of her husband continued during the latter half of his reign. She advised him on speeches and used her extensive knowledge of history and royalty to advise him on matters affecting his position. He appreciated her discretion, intelligence, and judgement. She maintained an air of self-assured calm throughout all her public engagements in the years after the war, a period marked by civil unrest over social conditions, Irish independence, and Indian nationalism.|$|E
500|$|Alice's {{death was}} felt in both Britain and Hesse. The Times wrote: [...] "The humblest of people {{felt that they}} had the kinship of nature with a Princess who was the model of family virtue as a daughter, a sister, a wife and a mother...Her {{abundant}} sympathies sought for objects of help in the great unknown waste of human distress". The Illustrated London News wrote that the [...] "lesson of the late Princess's life is as noble as it is obvious. Moral worth is far more important than high position". The death was also heavily felt by the royal family, especially by Alice's brother and sister-in-law, the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Princess of Wales, upon meeting the Queen after Alice's death, exclaimed [...] "I wish I had died instead of her". The Prince, meanwhile, wrote to the Earl of Granville that Alice [...] "was my favourite sister. So good, <b>so</b> <b>kind,</b> so clever! We had gone through so much together..." ...|$|E

Initially Tapping went through {{what she called}} [...] "chroma key green headaches" [...] because she had to stare at nothing but bright green walls {{for the first few}} days.

They also wanted Magnus to feel more angry and vulnerable throughout the season, especially in the first three episodes. After playing Magnus in the series' third season, Tapping admitted that she still does not get Magnus because [...] "there's so many things about the decisions that she makes that I still can't wrap my head around, and to me that's fascinating as an actor, to try to get inside somebody so complex and <b>so</b> <b>kind</b> of confusing." [...] In the episode [...] "Normandy", Tapping wore a red-haired wig for Magnus during her time in the Second World War, as an homage to her late grandmother. For the fourth season, Tapping requested that Magnus would be given a new love interest. The request was granted {{in the form of a}} female virologist appearing early in the season (thus establishing Magnus's bisexuality).|$|E
