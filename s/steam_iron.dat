60|$|Time {{with its}} {{relentless}} scythe at last swept all the actors in our tale away: Generations after them came and went. The world grew {{older and more}} learned; whether more wise is still an open question! Knowledge increased, science and art advanced apace. Electricity, <b>steam,</b> <b>iron,</b> gold, muscle, and brain, all but wrought miracles, and almost everything underwent change more or less; but, amid all the turmoil of the world's progress and all the storms of elemental strife, one object remained unaltered, and apparently unalterable--the Eddystone Lighthouse! True, indeed, its lantern underwent vast improvements, the Argand lamp and lens replacing the old candle, and causing its crown to shine with a whiter light and an intensified glory as it grew older, but as regards its sturdy frame, there it has stood on the rugged rocks amid the tormented surges, presenting its bold and battered, but undamaged, front to the utmost fury of blast and billow for upwards of a hundred years.|$|E
50|$|In {{the industrialized}} world, these designs have been {{superseded}} by the electric iron, which uses resistive heating from an electric current. The hot plate, called the sole plate, {{is made of}} aluminium or stainless steel polished to be as smooth as possible; it is sometimes coated with a low-friction heat-resistant plastic to reduce friction below that of the metal plate. The heating element is controlled by a thermostat that switches the current on and off to maintain the selected temperature. The invention of the resistively heated electric iron is credited to Henry W. Seeley of New York City in 1882. In the same year an iron heated by a carbon arc was introduced in France, but was too dangerous to be successful. The early electric irons had {{no easy way to}} control their temperature, and the first thermostatically controlled electric iron appeared in the 1920s. Later, steam was used to iron clothing. Credit for the invention of the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> goes to Thomas Sears. The first commercially available electric <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> was introduced in 1926 by a New York drying and cleaning company, Eldec, but was not a commercial success. The patent for an electric <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> and dampener was issued to Max Skolnik of Chicago in 1934. In 1938 Skolnik granted the Steam-O-Matic Corporation of New York the exclusive right to manufacture steam-electric irons. This was the first <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> to achieve any degree of popularity, and led the way to more widespread use of the electric <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> during the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
50|$|A steam {{generator}} iron is {{a modified version}} of a standard <b>steam</b> <b>iron.</b> Like traditional steam irons, {{steam generator}} irons use a combination of heat and steam power to remove wrinkles while ironing, they usually have a water reservoir either fully attached or detachable and a boiler that converts the water into steam. A high volume of pressurised steam can be released either continuously or in burst mode. The main difference between a steam generator iron and a regular <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> is the amount of steam they produce.|$|E
40|$|This study e valuates the {{dimensional}} {{changes of}} steam-ironed plain knitted wool fabrics after conditioning in air and then washing with an IWS 7 A wash cycle. During <b>steam</b> <b>ironing,</b> different extensions {{are given to}} the fabrics by using larger sized ironing boards. Part of {{the expansion of the}} fabrics is recovered during conditioning in air and residual expansion depends mainly on the extensions given to the fabrics during <b>steam</b> <b>ironing.</b> After undergoing the IWS 7 A wash cycle, the dimensional changes of the steam-ironed fabrics are identified as depending on yarn linear density, fabric tightness, anti-felting treatment of wool yarn, and the degree of extension imparted to the fabrics during <b>steam</b> <b>ironing.</b> Further analysis also shows that whether or not the fabrics are treated with <b>steam</b> <b>ironing</b> and regardless of the extensions imparted during <b>steam</b> <b>ironing,</b> all fabrics with the same yam and knitting parameters approach similar dimensions and shapes after IWS 7 A washing.

50|$|Blocking {{can be done}} {{in several}} {{different}} ways. Depending on the method, the crafter may use rustproof pins, blocking wires, a steamer, or a <b>steam</b> <b>iron.</b> A stable flat surface and towels are standard. Fibres that tolerate water well may be wet blocked, shaping moist fabric into the desired shape and then allowing it to air dry. Cold blocking uses no heat and less water to achieve the same result by spraying water upon the material instead of immersing the fabric. Steam blocking uses a steamer or <b>steam</b> <b>iron,</b> but without applying direct pressure to the item.|$|E
50|$|Pressing and ironing are an {{essential}} part of many sewing projects, and require additional tools. A <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> is used to press seams and garments, and a variety of pressing aids such as a seam roll or tailor's ham are used to aid in shaping a garment. A pressing cloth may be used to protect the fabric from damage.|$|E
50|$|The hot mop (or steam mop) {{follows a}} similar concept to a <b>steam</b> <b>iron.</b> After adding water, {{the water is}} heated to make it exude {{on top of a}} floor, which can then be cleaned without using a {{cleaning}} solvent. These can work best on surfaces where a regular mop would also be used, such as bare floors, hearths, and laminate.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>steam</b> {{generator}} <b>irons,</b> pressurised and non-pressurised. A non-pressurised <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron</b> will produce a lot of steam but the steam is released at a lower speed, typically around 80-100 grams per minute. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron,</b> on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the steam penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron</b> will typically have a steam output of 100-120 grams per minute. The amount of pressure a <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron</b> has is measured in bars, with a higher bar number meaning the steam has more pressure. <b>Steam</b> generator <b>irons</b> typically have 3-6 bars of pressure.|$|R

50|$|Steam {{blocking}} {{is done by}} hovering a hot, <b>steaming</b> <b>iron</b> {{over the}} fabric.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to control if the <b>steam</b> <b>ironing</b> effect applied on cotton {{clothing}} can persist in different climatic conditions. For this purpose, the effect of <b>steam</b> <b>ironing</b> process on the sorption isotherms of plain weave fabrics made of cotton was investigated. An experimental device conceived around a magnetic suspension balance was used to regulate temperature at two levels (25 degrees C and 35 degrees C). Using the same proportions of mixed air, relative humidities can reach fixed values between 3 % and 97 %. Two successive cycles of continuous adsorption/desorption water vapor were used. The sorption isotherms of the ironed and non-ironed fabrics are compared. They define three sorption zones depending on the nature of links between structure and water vapor. The results show that the adsorption isotherm of the ironed fabrics is lower than the non-ironed one during the initial two zones of the sigmoid. Then, they are superposed in the last sector of the adsorption isotherm and during the entire desorption phase. Therefore, the ironing can reduce the sorption capacity of cotton at low and moderate relative humidities. A second adsorption/desorption cycle is performed on the same samples to prove that the ironing effect is completely cancelled...|$|R

5000|$|The film {{begins with}} the text [...] "Meanwhile [...] - [...] {{in another part of}} the galaxy [...] - [...] later that same day". A {{household}} <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> flies through space, fleeing a toaster, which fires toast at it. Two robots named 4-Q-2 (who looks like the Tin Man from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz) and Arty-Deco (a canister vacuum cleaner), escape from the evil Empire. After launching from the ship (a cassette player) in an escape pod (a cassette tape), they land on a desert planet (a watermelon). They are found by young Fluke Starbucker (played by future multi-platinum award-winning music producer Scott Mathews) who finds a video message saved on Arty-Deco. It is a loop of Princess Anne-Droid saying [...] "Help me, Augie Ben Doggie, you're my only hope." [...] Upon meeting Augie [...] "Ben" [...] Doggie (of the venerable Red-Eye Knights), Fluke receives his father's lightsaber (a flashlight). After tricking the Imperial Steam Trooper guards (steam cabinets) to let them into the city, they reach a cantina, which Fluke describes as [...] "too weird". The cantina is a country-and-western bar, where they meet space renegade Ham Salad and Chewchilla the Wookiee Monster (a puppet that resembles Cookie Monster from Sesame Street).

The second study {{is focused on the}} <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> process over promoted Fe-oxide based catalyst using four different reductants; H 2, H 2 /CO mixture, CH 4 and CH 4 /C 02 mixture. A kinetic study of methane steam reforming over a Ni/MgO catalyst at high pressure was carried out. The kinetic orders of methane and steam at 40 bars and 600 QC were found to be 0. 82 and 0. 62 respectively. 1 ~he estimation of energy of activation of the process was found to be 106 KJ/mol. T 11 e reaction rate data was explained by a Langmuir - Hinshelwood - Hougen - Wastson model. Four differe 11 t reductants (H 2, H 2 /CO mixture, CI- 4 and CH 4 /C 02 mixture), were applied {{for the study of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> process. A study of the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> process using H 2 as reductant focused on the first reduction of 4 %Cr 203 - 96 % Fe 203 with H 2. The first reduction was found to be composed of a two step reduction up to 550 QC. The estimation of energy of activation for the process was found to be 92. 4 KJ/mol and 68. 2 KJ/mol respectively. The study of the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> process using H 2 ICO mixture as reductant over 4 %Cr 203 - 96 % Fe 2 O 3 found that FeO was an intermediate for the reduction of Fe 203 with H 2 ICO mixture to Fe metal. The application of methane as reductant for the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> process gave the worst results. As a result, NiO was added to Cr 203 -Fe 203 to increase the activity. Carbon formation on NiO also was found to be a serious problem. In order to minimize carbon formation on NiO, CO 2 was introduced in a mix with CI- 4 for the oxidation of deposited carbon during the reduction step. Although the introduction of CO 2 can suppress carbon formation, the strong oxidation of reduced iron oxide by water formed during the reduction process coupled to the l 1 igher favorable reaction of the water gas shift reaction adversely affects the complete reduction of iron oxide to iron metal...|$|E
