25|$|The next match saw El Hijo del Perro Aguayo {{challenge}} El Mesías for the AAA Mega Championship. The champion {{was accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by Cibernético, while the challenger was accompanied by his stablemates Héctor Garza and Taya Valkyrie. Towards {{the end of the}} bloody brawl, Aguayo went for the illegal Martinete, which would lead to an automatic disqualification, but was stopped by Garza, leading to an argument between the two stablemates. Garza then attempted to hit El Mesías with a steel chair, but accidentally hit Aguayo instead. As Aguayo began bleeding heavily, the match was <b>stopped</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> as a doctor entered the ring to check on the cut on his head; Aguayo, however, kept avoiding the doctor, not wanting the match to be ended. El Mesías then speared his challenger through a table for the win and to retain the AAA Mega Championship. Afterwards, Cibernético immediately climbed to the ring and jumped on top of the bloody Aguayo, mocking him, while El Mesías received his title belt. Cibernético then went out of the ring and pushed Hall of Famer Perro Aguayo, who was seated in the front row, before being pulled away by an irate El Mesías as Los Perros del Mal members Halloween, Psicosis and Teddy Hart came ringside to check on the condition of the challenger. Garza attempted to do the same, but was pulled away from Aguayo by Halloween, Psicosis and Hart, who blamed him for the loss. Eventually Los Perros del Mal helped their leader backstage, with Garza following behind.|$|E
