5|$|Most of {{the acute}} <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> {{associated}} with brachytherapy {{can be treated}} with medication or through dietary changes, and usually disappear over time (typically a matter of weeks), once the treatment is completed. The acute <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> of HDR brachytherapy are broadly similar to EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Pyridostigmine {{decreases}} {{the degradation of}} acetylcholine after release into the synaptic cleft, and thereby improves muscle contraction. An older agent, guanidine, causes many <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> and is not recommended. 4-Aminopyridine (dalfampridine), an agent related to 3,4-aminopyridine, causes more <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> than 3,4-DAP and is also not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> of Adderall {{are many}} and varied, {{but the amount}} of {{substance}} consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. Recreational use of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly more dangerous, involving a much greater risk of serious <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
30|$|No {{hair loss}} - total hair loss; {{completely}} unsatisfied - completely satisfied; no <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> – strongest possible <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> of {{amphetamine}} are varied, and {{the amount}} of amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.|$|E
5|$|Acute <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> {{associated}} with brachytherapy include localised bruising, swelling, bleeding, discharge or discomfort within the implanted region. These usually resolve {{within a few}} days following completion of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Aloin, a {{compound}} {{found in the}} exudate of some Aloe species, was the common ingredient in over-the-counter (OTC) laxative products in the United States until 2002 when the Food and Drug Administration banned it because the companies manufacturing it failed to provide the necessary safety data. Aloe vera has potential toxicity, with <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> occurring at some dose levels both when ingested or applied topically. Although toxicity may be less when aloin is removed by processing, Aloe vera that contains aloin in excess amounts may induce <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
40|$|Docetaxel is an {{important}} chemotherapeutic agent used {{in the management of}} many solid tumors. The most important <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of this drug is myelosupression. We report a case of carcinoma breast that developed severe hand-foot syndrome at 75 mg/m 2 doses of docetaxel. The exact mechanism of this <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> in not known. All the physicians using this drug must be aware of this <b>side</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|R
30|$|To assess {{lifetime}} {{experience of}} a serious problem or <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> from treatment, parents were asked: “Has your child ever experienced {{a serious problem}} or <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> from a prescription medication?” Response options were yes/no.|$|R
50|$|Radiotherapists {{are well}} aware of {{possible}} pulmonary toxicity, and take a number of precautions to minimise the incidence of this <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b> There are research efforts to possibly eliminate this <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> in the future.|$|R
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|Cingulotomy {{involves}} cutting nerve fibers in the brain. It {{reduces the}} unpleasantness of pain (without affecting its intensity), but may have cognitive <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
5|$|Common <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> {{include an}} upset stomach. More {{significant}} <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater {{among those who}} are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.|$|E
40|$|Bioinformatics applies {{computers}} to problems in molecular biology. Previous research has not addressed edit metric decoders. Decoders for quaternary edit metric codes are finding use in bioinformatics problems with applications to DNA. By using <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> machines {{we hope to}} be able to provide efficient decoding algorithms for this open problem. Two ideas for decoding algorithms are presented and examined. Both decoders use <b>Side</b> <b>Effect</b> Machines(SEMs) which are generalizations of finite state automata. Single Classifier Machines(SCMs) use a single <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> machine to classify all words within a code. Locking <b>Side</b> <b>Effect</b> Machines(LSEMs) use multiple <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> machines to create a tree structure of subclassification. The goal is to examine these techniques and provide new decoders for existing codes. Presented are ideas for best practices for the creation of these two types of new edit metric decoders...|$|R
50|$|Bone marrow {{suppression}} (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) is {{the most}} commonly occurring <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of chlorambucil. Withdrawn from the drug, this <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> is typically reversible. Like many alkylating agents, chlorambucil {{has been associated with}} the development of other forms of cancer.|$|R
5000|$|One common {{demonstration}} of <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> behavior {{is that of}} the assignment operator in C++.

5|$|Common <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> include hair loss, {{bone marrow}} suppression, vomiting, rash, and {{inflammation}} of the mouth. Other serious <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage {{at the site of}} injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> appear even at {{a minimal}} clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|In a {{small number}} of people, {{brachytherapy}} may cause long-term <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> due to damage or disruption of adjacent tissues or organs. Long-term <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> are usually mild or moderate in nature. For example, urinary and digestive problems may persist as a result of brachytherapy for cervical or prostate cancer, and may require ongoing management.|$|E
50|$|Drowsiness is a usual <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} 5 -year-old {{boy who had}} the {{complaint}} of swelling and pain on the right vaccine shot and right axillary areas. The right axillary area was diagnosed as reactive lymphadenitis, which we believe is a rare local <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of the swine flu vaccine. The key message {{to take away from}} this case is that the patient had lymphadenitis as a local <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of the swine flu vaccine. Lymphadenitis should be reported as a possible local <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of the swine flu vaccine...|$|R
25|$|A rare <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> is {{respiratory}} depression.|$|R
5|$|In {{adolescent}} and adults, common <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> reported include weight loss, constipation, dyslipidemia and, in women, dysmenorrhea.|$|E
5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR. However, {{in contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR {{in such a way}} that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> than the expected <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
50|$|More rarely, {{allopurinol}} {{can also}} {{result in the}} depression of bone marrow elements, leading to cytopenias, as well as aplastic anemia. Moreover, allopurinol can also cause peripheral neuritis in some patients, although this is a rare <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b> Another <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of allopurinol is interstitial nephritis.|$|R

50|$|Nintedanib {{inhibits}} {{the growth}} and reshaping of blood vessels which is also an essential process in normal wound healing and tissue repair. Therefore, a theoretical <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> of nintedanib is reduced wound healing however, unlike other anti-angiogenic agents, this <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> has not been observed in patients receiving nintedanib.|$|R
5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E
5|$|Providing {{emergency}} contraceptive pills {{to women in}} advance does not affect rates of sexually transmitted infections, condom use, pregnancy rates, or sexual risk-taking behavior. All methods have minimal <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Side</b> <b>effects</b> include {{increased}} skin photosensitivity, dryness, redness {{and occasional}} peeling. Sunscreen use is often advised during treatment, to prevent sunburn. Lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide {{are just as}} effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> Unlike antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide {{does not appear to}} generate bacterial antibiotic resistance.|$|E
30|$|In older studies, {{with data}} {{collected}} {{during a time}} when more (but certainly not all) patients were seemingly treated with lithium monotherapy, the majority of lithium-treated patients report at least one <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> with estimates ranging between 67 and 90 % (Johnston et al. 1979; Bone et al. 1980; Vestergaard et al. 1980; Gitlin et al. 1989). Thus, only a relative small fraction of lithium-treated patients are <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> free. Most patients have more than one <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> attributed by the patient to lithium (Vestergaard et al. 1980; Gitlin et al. 1989).|$|R
40|$|Asthma, in general, is a {{respiratory}} disorder that affects millions of Americans each year.
