40|$|A signal <b>turnover</b> <b>system</b> is an {{essential}} component of many genetic regulatory mechanisms. The best-known example is the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation system that exists in many organisms. We found that Agrobacterium tumefaciens adopts a unique signal <b>turnover</b> <b>system</b> to control exiting from a quorum-sensing mode. A. tumefaciens regulates Ti plasmid conjugal transfer by a quorum-sensing signal, N- 3 -oxo-octanoyl homoserine lactone (3 OC 8 HSL), also known as Agrobacterium autoinducer. By using Tn 5 mutagenesis and a functional cloning approach, we identified two genes that are involved in switching from a conjugal quorum-sensing mode to a nonconjugal mode at the onset of stationary phase. First, we located attJ, which codes for an IclR-type suppressor that regulates the second gene attM. The latter encodes a homologue of N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) -lactonase. Mass spectrometry analysis shows that the enzyme encoded by attM is an AHL-lactonase that hydrolyzes the lactone ring of 3 OC 8 HSL. In wild-type A. tumefaciens, attM expression is initially suppressed by AttJ but significantly elevated at the stationary phase accompanied a sharp decline in 3 OC 8 HSL. DNA gel retardation analysis shows that AttJ specifically binds to the promoter that controls AHL-lactonase expression. Mutation of attJ resulted in constitutive production of AHL-lactonase that abolishes 3 OC 8 HSL accumulation and Ti plasmid transfer. These data suggest that A. tumefaciens has a sophisticated multicomponent quorum-sensing signal <b>turnover</b> <b>system,</b> allowing the cell to sense a change in growth and adjust cellular activities accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) {{has been shown}} to progress through a number of changes that lead to the emergence of pathogenic viral variants in macaques initially infected with a mildly cytopathic variant, SIVMneCL 8. One of these late-stage isolates, SIVMne 170, replicates to high levels in vivo and causes a rapid disease course when reintroduced into naïve macaques, resulting in a viral set point up to 3, 000 -fold higher than the set point of the parental virus, SIVMneCL 8. However, in cell culture both viruses replicate with similar kinetics. One major difference between in vivo and in vitro cultures is the life span of the infected cells. Here, we manipulated the life span of infected cells in vitro, and we show that the fitness of SIVMne 170 in cultures with a limited cell life span dramatically increased compared to its fitness in cultures with a nonlimited life span of cells. The increase in fitness was at least partially {{due to the fact that}} the rapid <b>turnover</b> <b>system</b> eliminates the negative influence of the cytopathic effects associated with replication of SIVMne 170. Because the relative fitness of SIVMneCL 8 and SIVMne 170 observed in the rapid <b>turnover</b> <b>system</b> more accurately reflects their fitness in vivo, the system represents an improved approach to comparing relative fitness of viruses...|$|R

Substantial discrepancies were detected between relative in vitro transcription rates and steady-state RNA levels in light- and dark-grown seedling leaves, indicating that rbcS RNA may be degraded more rapidly in light than in darkness.

Trypsin was used at activities commonly used in cell disaggregation techniques. This accumulation appears to result from the decrease in acyltransferase activity in the plasmalemma produced by enzyme treatment. Plasmalemmal CoA ligase activity is not affected by trypsin treatment. Trypsiniza-tion has little effect on plasmalemmal phospholipase As activity. These results are discussed in relation to (a) the effects of trypsinization on cell adhesion, and (b) the theory that cells cannot adhere to lecithins because of their fluidity or surface-free-energy values. We propose {{that the effects of}} trypsinization on adhesion may in large part be due to the effects of the enzyme on plasmalemmal enzymes of the lipid <b>turnover</b> <b>system</b> rather than to effects on other plasma-lemmal proteins. Similarly the inability of cells to adhere to lecithin substrates is simply explained as being due to the lysolecithin that contacting cells release from these substrates...|$|R

Degradation of p 27 kip 1 {{is known to be}} a central component of this process as it allows controlled activation of cdk 2 -associated kinase activity. Turnover of p 27 at the G 1 /S transition is regulated through phosphorylation at T 187 and subsequent SCFskp 2 -dependent ubiquitylation. However, detailed analysis of this process revealed the existence of additional pathways that regulate the abundance of the protein in early G 1 and as cells exit quiescence. Here, we report on a molecular mechanism that regulates p 27 stability by phosphorylation at T 198. Phosphorylation of p 27 at T 198 prevents ubiquitin-dependent degradation of free p 27. T 198 phosphorylation also controls progression through the G 1 phase of the cell cycle by regulating the association of p 27 with cyclin–cdk complexes. Our results unveil the molecular composition of a pathway, which regulates the abundance and activity of p 27 kip 1 during early G 1.

Skeletal muscle protein and organelle turnover {{is dependent on}} two major cellular pathways: FOXO transcription factors that regulate two main proteolytic systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome systems, including mitochondrial autophagy, and the MTORC 1 signaling associated with protein translation and autophagy inhibition.

Five mutants of human glutathione (GSH; γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) transferase A 1 - 1 were designed {{in the search for}} a catalyst and to provide a set of proteins from which the reaction mechanism could be elucidated. The single mutant A 216 H catalyzed the hydrolysis of the S-benzoyl ester of GSH under turnover conditions with a kcat/KM of 156 M– 1 ·min– 1, and a catalytic proficiency of > 107 M– 1 when compared with the first-order rate constant of the uncatalyzed reaction. The wild-type enzyme did not hydrolyze the substrate, and thus, the introduction of a single histidine residue transformed the wild-type enzyme into a <b>turnover</b> <b>system</b> for thiol-ester hydrolysis. By kinetic analysis of single, double, and triple mutants, as well as from studies of reaction products, it was established that the enzyme A 216 H catalyzes the hydrolysis of the thiol-ester substrate by a mechanism that includes an acyl intermediate at the side chain of Y 9. Kinetic measurements and the crystal structure of the A 216 H GSH complex provided compelling evidence that H 216 acts as a general-base catalyst. The introduction of a single His residue into human GSH transferase A 1 - 1 created an unprecedented enzymatic function, suggesting a strategy that may be of broad applicability in the design of new enzymes.

Some of mutations associated with ARCA are identified in the STUB 1 gene which encodes CHIP (C-terminus of Heat shock protein 70 -Interacting Protein) as a dimeric co-chaperone and E 3 ubiquitin ligase protein. Currently, there is limited information available regarding the role of these mutations in the pathogenesis of ARCA. This study aims to characterize the effects of six selected mutations on the structure and function of CHIP, mainly by the use of in vitro methods. Mutant CHIP constructs were created by site-directed mutagenesis, and recombinant proteins were subjected to different assays including ubiquitination activity assay, limited proteolysis, oligomerization analysis, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Results indicated that mutations N 65 S and T 246 M were associated with more severe consequences compared to the rest (E 28 K, K 145 Q, M 211 I, and S 236 T). Impaired Hsc 70 -ubiquitination activity was observed for both N 65 S and T 246 M. The N 65 S mutation resulted in more stabilized and compact protein structure, while the T 246 M mutant presented more flexible and loose structures with a high tendency for aggregation.

The red king crab {{is one of the}} world’s largest decapods and was introduced into the Barents Sea in the 1960 s. It has since become a valuable fishery resource in Russian and Norwegian waters. In the early 2000 s, red king crabs entered Porsangerfjord, which now holds one of the largest densities of king crabs along the northern Norwegian coast. This thesis provides new knowledge on how predation by the red king crab may effect benthic community, productivity and the food web in Porsangerfjorden. The major objectives of this thesis were to assess macrobenthic communities and their secondary production in Porsangerfjord, and, together with information on the trophic niche, asses the role of the red king crab in the food web and its predation and competitive impacts through Ecopath with Ecosim mass balance models (EwE). Benthic communities in Porsangerfjord followed environmental and predation gradients, which affected community traits, such as composition and size structure, resulting in different production and P/B patterns. The red king crab is a generalist, opportunistic predator, feeding on multiple trophic levels. Small and large crabs are likely to affect different habitats and prey species, but took a similar trophic position in the food web. The red king crab {{played an important role in}} the Porsangerfjord food web through top-down effects on large, long-lived benthic invertebrate groups by medium and large sized crabs, but had little significance as prey for higher trophic levels and affected mostly the benthic compartment of the food web. Niche overlap and competitive effects with fish species were comparably low, but those may be of significance for birds feeding on benthic invertebrates and for large predatory invertebrates, the latter also being prey for red king crabs. In the future, king crabs may partly replace these invertebrates as major predator in the benthos. Predation pressure by the red king crab may be buffered by high production in some prey, such as polychaetes, but may lead benthic communities to an overall lower biomass and higher <b>turnover</b> <b>system,</b> with unknown consequences for ecosystem stability and resilience.

Previous modelling has assumed a homogeneously-mixed population or a <b>static</b> network lacking <b>turnover</b> in the population and injecting partnerships. We developed a transmission-dynamic model on a dynamic network of injecting partnerships using data from survey of injecting behaviour carried out in London, UK. We studied transmission on a novel exponential-clustered network, {{as well as on}} two simpler networks for comparison, an exponential unclustered and a random network, and found that TasP’s effectiveness differs markedly. With respect to an exponential-clustered network, the random network (and homogeneously-mixed population) overestimate TasP’s effectiveness, whereas the exponential-unclustered network underestimates it. For all network types TasP’s effectiveness depends on whether treated patients change risk behaviour, and on treatment coverage: higher coverage requires fewer total treatments for the same health gain. Whilst TasP can greatly reduce HCV prevalence, incidence of infection, and incidence of reinfection in PWID, assessment of TasP’s effectiveness needs to take account of the injecting-partnership network structure and post-treatment behaviour change, and further empirical study is required...|$|R
