40|$|The {{final product}} {{functionality}} of parts produced by Additive Manufacturing (AM) can, in part, {{be improved by}} the inclusion of multi-material capabilities. The “Multi 3 D system” that is under development at The University of Texas at El Paso uses material extrusion printing (or fused deposition modeling), solid conductor wire embedding, direct-write, component placement, and micromaching to enable multi-material fabrication. The Multi 3 D was designed to transport a workpiece between manufacturing stations via a six-axis robot, portable build platform (PBP), and a controlled temperature environment or chamber that travels to each manufacturing station. The heated travel envelope (HTE) was included to mitigate thermal shrinkage (and eventually warping) that occurs when a thermoplastic is subjected to a decrease in temperature {{within a short time}} frame. An end-effector was also designed to allow the six-axis robot to interact and handle the PBP and HTE. Discussed in this work is the design and construction of the HTE as well as its performance in terms of maintaining a stable temperature while considering the imposed weight and dimensional constraints. The HTE design includes a compressible high temperature bellow “door” which allows it slide over builds and increases the height of builds (~ 22 cm) which can be produced in the Multi 3 D system. The HTE is capable of maintaining a 150 ± 8 °C environment with its convective heating system, which is the baseline set for building parts with polycarbonate, specifically 145 °C. The temperature change (drop) of parts is reduced by 71 % with the inclusion of HTE in the transportation process. The quantified temperature drop without the HTE during transportation was approximately 21 °C in comparison to 6 °C with the HTE. The construction and performance (e. g., locating accuracy) of the PBP are also discussed. The PBP was designed around the “Platen” build platform to replicate its abilities but in a form that allows it to be portable. The PBP is able to receive vacuum (- 42. 3 ± 8. 5 KPa) supply for restraining sacrificial build sheets in two forms, from the station of the Multi 3 D system it is placed in and from the end-effector. The PBP locates accurately into the FDM system, in a form that maintains the FDM’s achievable accuracy of ± 38 ?m, via the use of three locating pins and its vacuum fitting. The locating accuracy of the PBP was determined by printing “stair step” parts which were analyzed for layer shifting. These results were compared to <b>stair</b> <b>steps</b> <b>printed</b> in an unmodified FDM system as a control. The layer shifting was measured to be + 50. 8 to - 38. 1 ?m for non-paused builds and + 63. 5 to - 50. 8 ?m for paused builds on both machines (modified and control). This gave indication that the modifications done to the FDM machine and the portable build platform had no direct effect on the achievable accuracy in parts with this specific geometry and these processing conditions. Ultimately, the Multi 3 D system will be utilized for Aerospace applications to manufacture components for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and satellites, but other applications where disparate materials are required can be envisioned. This can be accomplished with these components or subsystems which were developed for material handling within the system. ...|$|R

This single center randomized controlled trial was undertaken. A 140 -patients who met all of the inclusion criteria were divided into two main groups and induction of ovulation for both protocols was performed. Follow up of follicular maturation is done by transvaginal ultrasound. The time to ovulation with the <b>stair</b> <b>step</b> protocol was 21 - 28 days as compared with the traditional protocol which was 42 - 70 days. The dose dependent ovulation rate was 43 % at 100 mg with the <b>stair</b> <b>step</b> protocol compared with 25. 3 % with the traditional regimen and the ovulation rate at 150 mg was 21. 6 % with the <b>stair</b> <b>step</b> protocol compared with 14. 7 % with the traditional protocol while the clomiphene citrate resistance rate was higher with the traditional protocol 38. 7 % as compared to the <b>stair</b> <b>step</b> method which was 20 % which are statistically significant.

The purpose of this study was to examine the hypotheses (a) that subject activity characteristics are correlated with knee flexion range of motion (ROM) and (b) that there is a significant difference between the subject’s flexion/extension excursion throughout the day and the ISO specified input for knee wear testing. In order to characterize activity, the number of walking and <b>stair</b> <b>stepping</b> cycles, the time spent with dynamic and stationary activities, the number of activity sequences, and the knee flexion/extension excursion of 32 TKR subjects were collected during daily activity. Flexion/extension profiles were compared with the ISO 14243 simulator input profile using a level crossing classification algorithm. Subjects took an average of 3102 (range: 343 – 5857) walking cycles including 65 (range: 0 – 319) <b>stair</b> <b>stepping</b> cycles. Active and passive ROMs were positively correlated with stair walking time, <b>stair</b> <b>step</b> counts, and <b>stair</b> walking sequences. Simulated knee motion according to ISO showed significantly fewer level crossings at the flexion angles 20 – 40 ° and beyond 50 ° than those measured with the monitor. This suggests that implant wear testing protocols should contain more cycles and a variety of activities requiring higher knee flexion angles with incorporated resting/transition periods to account for the many activity sequences...|$|R
