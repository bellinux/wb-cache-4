60|$|Tiberius in the {{beginning}} of his reign made Valerius Gratus President of Judea; and after 11 years, substituted Pontius Pilate, who governed 10 years. Then Vitellius, newly made President of Syria, deprived him of his honour, substituting Marcellus, and at length sent him to Rome: but, by reason of delays, Tiberius died before Pilate got thither. In the mean time Vitellius, after he had deposed Pilate, came to Jerusalem in the time of the Passover, to visit that Province as well as others in {{the beginning}} of his office; and in the place of Caiaphas, then High Priest, created Jonathas the son of Ananus, or Annas as he is called in scripture. Afterwards, when Vitellius was returned to Antioch, he received letters from Tiberius, to make peace with Artabanus king of the Parthians. At the same time the Alans, by the <b>sollicitation</b> of Tiberius, invaded the kingdom of Artabanus; and his subjects also, by the procurement of Vitellius, soon after rebelled: for Tiberius thought that Artabanus, thus pressed with difficulties, would more readily accept the conditions of peace. Artabanus therefore straightway gathering a greater army, opprest the rebels; and then meeting Vitellius at Euphrates, made a league with the Romans. After this Tiberius commanded Vitellius to make war upon Aretas King of Arabia. He therefore leading his army against Aretas, went together with Herod to Jerusalem, to sacrifice at the publick feast which was then to be celebrated. Where being received honourably, he stayed three days, and in the mean while translated the high Priesthood from Jonathas to his brother Theophilus: and the fourth day, receiving letters of the death of Tiberius, made the people swear allegiance to Caius the new Emperor; and recalling his army, sent them into quarters. All this is related by Josephus Antiq. lib. 18. c. 6, 7. Now Tiberius reigned 22 years and 7 months, and died March 16, {{in the beginning}} of the year of Christ 37; and the feast of the Passover fell on April 20 following, that is, 35 days after the death of Tiberius: so that there were about 36 or 38 days, for the news of his death to come from Rome to Vitellius at Jerusalem; which being a convenient time for that message, confirms that the feast which Vitellius and Herod now went up to was the Passover. For had it been the Pentecost, as is usually supposed, Vitellius would have continued three months ignorant of the Emperor's death: which is not to be supposed. However, the things done between this feast and the Passover which Vitellius was at before, namely, the stirring up a sedition in Parthia, the quieting that sedition, the making a league after that with the Parthians, the sending news of that league to Rome, the receiving new orders from thence to go against the Arabians, and the putting those orders in execution; required much more time than the fifty days between the Passover and Pentecost of the same year: and therefore the Passover which Vitellius first went up to, was in the year before. Therefore Pilate was deposed before the Passover A.C. 36, and by consequence the passion of Christ was before that Passover: for he suffered not under Vitellius, nor under Vitellius and Pilate together, but under Pilate alone.|$|E
60|$|Behold, saith [1] he, there shall {{stand up}} yet three kings in Persia, [Cyrus, Cambyses, and Darius Hystaspes] {{and the fourth}} [Xerxes] shall be far richer than they all: and by his {{strength}} thro' his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia. And a mighty king [Alexander the great] shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided towards the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity [but after their death,] nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be pluckt up, even for others besides those. Alexander the great having conquered all the Persian Empire, and some part of India, died at Babylon {{a month before the}} summer Solstice, in the year of Nabonassar 425: and his captains gave the monarchy to his bastard brother Philip Aridæus, a man disturbed in his understanding; and made Perdiccas administrator of the kingdom. Perdiccas with their consent made Meleager commander of the army, Seleucus master of the horse, Craterus treasurer of the kingdom, Antipater governor of Macedon and Greece, Ptolemy governor of Egypt; Antigonus governor of Pamphylia, Lycia, Lycaonia, and Phrygia major; Lysimachus governor of Thrace, and other captains governors of other Provinces; as many as had been so before in the days of Alexander the great. The Babylonians began now to count by a new Æra, which they called the Æra of Philip, using the years of Nabonassar, and reckoning the 425th year of Nabonassar to be the first year of Philip. Roxana the wife of Alexander being left big with child, and about three or four months after brought to bed of a son, they called him Alexander, saluted him King, and joined him with Philip, whom they had before placed in the throne. Philip reigned three years under the administratorship of Perdiccas, two years more under the administratorship of Antipater, and above a year more under that of Polyperchon; in all six years and four months; and then was slain with his Queen Eurydice in September by the command of Olympias the mother of Alexander the great. The Greeks being disgusted at the cruelties of Olympias, revolted to Cassander the son and successor of Antipater. Cassander affecting the dominion of Greece, slew Olympias; and soon after shut up the young king Alexander, with his mother Roxana, in the castle of Amphipolis, under the charge of Glaucias, An. Nabonass. 432. The next year Ptolemy, Cassander and Lysimachus, by means of Seleucus, form'd a league against Antigonus; and after certain wars made peace with him, An. Nabonass. 438, upon these conditions: that Cassander should command the forces of Europe till Alexander the son of Roxana came to age; and that Lysimachus should govern Thrace, Ptolemy Egypt and Lybia, and Antigonus all Asia. Seleucus had possest himself of Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Sustana and Media, the year before. About three years after Alexander's death he was made governor of Babylon by Antipater; then was expelled by Antigonus; but now he recovered and enlarged his government over a great part of the East: which gave occasion to a new Æra, called Æra Seleucidarum. Not long after the peace made with Antigonus, Diodorus saith the same Olympic year; Cassander, seeing that Alexander the son of Roxana grew up, and that it was discoursed thro'out Macedonia that it was fit he should be set at liberty, and take upon him the government of his father's kingdom, commanded Glaucias the governor of the castle to kill Roxana and the young king Alexander her son, and conceal their deaths. Then Polyperchon set up Hercules, the son of Alexander the great by Barsinè, to be king; and soon after, at the <b>sollicitation</b> of Cassander, caused him to be slain. Soon after that, upon a great victory at sea got by Demetrius the son of Antigonus over Ptolemy, Antigonus took upon himself the title of king, and gave the same title to his son. This was An. Nabonass. 441. After his example, Seleucus, Cassander, Lysimachus and Ptolemy, took upon themselves the title and dignity of kings, having abstained from this honour while there remained any of Alexander's race to inherit the crown. Thus the monarchy of the Greeks for want of an heir was broken into several kingdoms; four of which, seated to the four winds of heaven, were very eminent. For Ptolemy reigned over Egypt, Lybia and Ethiopia; Antigonus over Syria and the lesser Asia; Lysimachus over Thrace; and Cassander over Macedon, Greece and Epirus, as above.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{plans were}} made by the Dutch {{government}} to extend the port of Rotterdam by means of the construction of a land reclamation in the North Sea, the Maasvlakte 2. Because no safety standards exist for the Maasvlakte 2, it is useful to determine an optimal design from an economic point of view by cost-benefit analysis. The economic optimal design of the Maasvlakte 2 is assumed to be the design for which the net present value (NPV) of the total costs (including loss of benefits) is minimal. An accompanying optimal level of safety for the Maasvlakte 2 is also found. In this analysis, the Maasvlakte 2 is assumed to be a system composed of three elements, a breakwater, a sea defence and a terrain area. For each element, decision variables are selected which have influence on the resistance (strength) and {{the costs and benefits of}} the Maasvlakte 2, and also represent relations between elements. For the breakwater, the crest height and the diameter of the concrete blocks in the armour layer are considered as decision variables. For the terrain area, the height of the terrain area is the only decision variable considered. For the sea defence, the crest height, the diameter of the quarry stones in the protection layer of the outer slope and the angle of the outer slope are considered as decision variables. A selection of failure modes is also made for each element. Each failure mode is written in the form of a reliability function Z = R-S in which R is the resistance and S is the <b>sollicitation.</b> For the failure modes, hydraulic conditions (waves, water levels) represent the <b>sollicitation.</b> The geometry and strength of the elements, also determined by the decision variables, represent the resistance. In the calculation of the economic optimal design of the Maasvlakte 2, a bottom-up approach is used: 1. at first, calculations are executed for each failure mode 2. then, these results are used in the optimisation per element 3. finally, optimal element results are used in the optimisation of the system. This way the optimal design for Maasvlakte 2 is derived. With this optimisation method, a probabilistic design is determined and compared with a deterministic design it proves to be much more cost effective.

We are interested {{in a set of}} automated machines’ behaviour subjected to many disturbances. Nevertheless, a robust and a reactive control system is required in order to obtain a high performance operation. We propose a control system from which the decision-making centres and the associated communication are decentralised and integrated on each machine. This allows the possibility of taking into account their own real capacity at the decision-making time. We will describe the two levels of generation, which allow the self-cooperation between the machines. The goal is to increase automated syste’s dynamic faced with a variation of request. We reach this goal with preserving a strong robustness of operation and without using decisional entities of higher hierarchical level. We will illustrate these various concepts by detailing their application to a control system of a Hub that is an automated rail transfer yard. The adaptation to disturbances is fundamental in this type of system...|$|E

Abstract. – To analyse a {{polycrystalline}} material which has undergone mechanical <b>sollicitations,</b> we quantify the deformation of grain boundaries. We investigate a pattern which records past deformations: a deep ice core, in Dome Concordia, Antarctica. Its ice microstructure (grain boundaries) {{is a key}} feature useful to study ice evolution and to investigate climatic changes. Our method extracts quantitative physical information, such as the anisotropy and the local heterogeneity of the deformation. This leads to a re-examination of current models used in datation. The method also applies to extract quantitative geometrical information from other cellular patterns, ranging from metal processing and biological tissues to foams and granular matter. Motivations. – A picture contains {{a large amount of}} data, from which it is sometimes difficult to extract quantitative, physically relevant information. In this letter, we present a method to characterise a cellular pattern by measuring a geometrical quantity, the “texture tensor ” [1], using local spatial averages. We apply this analysis to the grain boundaries (th...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the aspects of the {{concrete}} behaviour under dynamic loading such as impacts or explosions. For these kinds of <b>sollicitations</b> concrete experiences compaction (a decrease of porosity), plastic strains in compression and also cracking in tension. It is relevant {{to be able to}} represent, at the same time, the phenomena of compaction of material, as well as the rupture by extension. Recently, new dynamic experiments performed on conned concrete (to obtain compaction), made it possible to highlight a signicant effect of the strain rate on the spherical behaviour of concrete. Following these experimental observations, a viscoplastic and visco-damage model was developed. This model is based on Perzyna viscoplasticity associates with a modied Gurson yield function and on a visco-damage model. This constitutive model for concrete is able to represent the rate effect experimentally observed. The model presented was implemented in the nite element code LS-DYNA 3 D. Simulations of tests carried out on structures allowed to validate the numerical implementation, as well as the model for fast dynamic loading...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} until rupture of composite structures made of glass-fibre / epoxy-resin woven fabrics submitted to dynamic loadings. The model is built at the mesoscale of the elementary ply. It {{takes into account the}} slightly nonlinear brittle behaviour of the fibres under tensile <b>sollicitations,</b> their nonlinear behaviour in compression as well as the strongly non linear and irreversible behaviour of the ply in shear. Strain rate effects are also introduced and special attention is paid to the objectivity of the model in the context of finite element calculation. Therefore the choice of a delayed damage mesomodel coupled with viscoplasticity is made. In order to identify the values of the parameters of the model, an optimization procedure based on a gradient-free direct search method has been developed. As a logical proceeding to this study, the model ability to avoid strain localization and mesh dependence is then checked on simple uniaxial examples. The last part of this paper is devoted to structural calculation. The results of the simulations of both the impact on composite plate and the crushing of thin-walled tube demonstrate the capability of the model to reproduce observed physical phenomena...|$|R
