5000|$|A quite {{different}} implementation using a tapped coil in an LC tank feedback arrangement [...] is {{to employ a}} common-grid (or common-gate or common-base) amplifier stage, which is still non-inverting but provides voltage gain instead of current gain; the coil tapping is still connected to the cathode (or source or emitter), but this is now the (low impedance) input to the amplifier; the <b>split</b> <b>tank</b> circuit is now dropping the impedance from the relatively high output impedance of the plate (or drain or collector).|$|E
40|$|The biphasic {{production}} of the energy gases hydrogen and methane was possible in a fed batch culture resulting in a volumetric mix of approximately 20 % H 2 and 80 % CH 4 and an energy conversion efficiency of 95 %, {{based on the measured}} Chemical Oxygen Demand and theoretical calculations assuming that the substrate (a dairy waste permeate) was lactose. Gas production showed a rapid initial phase over 0 – 20 h in which the composition was up to 50 % hydrogen with the balance mainly carbon dioxide. This was accompanied by the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) in which butyric was predominant. A slower second phase of gas production produced a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide with a reduction in the accumulated acids. The duration of this second phase depended on the initial load applied to the reactor, and in the experiments carried out lasted between 6 and 12 days. Where the applied initial load led to an acid accumulation such that the pH fell below 5. 5, the second phase of gas production was inhibited. Where pH control was exerted to prevent the pH dropping below 6. 5, ethanol accumulated alongside VFA as a first phase product, with the gas comprised entirely of carbon dioxide. Despite the excellent energy conversion and the {{production of}} biogas fuel elements matching those for hythane (a mixture of hydrogen and methane, with improved combustion characteristics), the overall process loading was considered too low for efficient volumetric conversion of the feedstock to energy. The concept could be further developed based on high rate reactor systems with granular or immobilised biomass either as a single tank biphasic system or in a <b>split</b> <b>tank</b> two phase production process. <br/...|$|E

50|$|A team of {{researchers}} ultimately discovered that a dime-sized flaw on the 45-year-old tank contributed to the rupture. The flaw, which consisted of a small, rusting cavity about 0.125 in. deep {{was caused by a}} torch and was in the steel before reassembly. A combinations of factors aggravated the flaw and cause the <b>tank</b> to <b>split.</b> The <b>tank</b> was assembled in Cleveland in 1940 and rebuilt in 1985. The original welds and those used during the reassembly made the tank’s steel walls more brittle. Other contributing factors were the relative weakness of the World War II steel, pressure from the diesel fuel, and cold weather.|$|R
50|$|The British Army were {{pioneers in}} tank combat but by 1939 {{it could be}} argued they were behind the times in terms of {{strategy}} and tactics, their methods based on the trench warfare of World War One. The British Army entered the Second World War with an array of poor designs and hobbled by poor doctrine. According to the theories of Captain BH Liddell Hart and Major-General Sir Percy Hobart, they <b>split</b> their <b>tank</b> force into two groups; Infantry tanks and Cruiser tanks. British tank use focused on cavalry-type missions and infantry support without the focus on the combined-arms tactics that dominated German and Soviet thinking.|$|R
40|$|The {{separation}} of binary and ternary mixtures is studied in one column chromatographs with recycle analogous to different SMB configurations (Analog). The very flexible basic {{design of the}} Analog consists of one column {{and a number of}} mixed tanks equal to the number of columns in the corresponding SMB. This design gives lower purities than the corresponding SMBs because of mixing in the tanks. For example, in {{separation of}} fructose-dextranT 6, the Analog to a one column per zone SMB at D/F = 4. 15, gave a purity index of 88. 4 opposed to the SMB 2 ̆ 7 s 97. 1. Mixing can be reduced and purities of the SMB approached by <b>splitting</b> the <b>tanks</b> into smaller tanks. For the dextran-fructose separation, the SMB purities were reached when each tank was divided into 7 smaller tanks. Analogs are designed for many SMB configurations. In some cases, tanks have to be split in order to retain the improvement produced by the more complicated operating procedures. For example, the tanks in the Analog to the 2 -feed SMB had to be split into 3 smaller tanks for it to perform better than the Analog to VARICOL. Analogs are also designed for a 5 -zone SMB and SMB cascades performing ternary separations. The purities are lower in the Analogs because of mixing, and <b>splitting</b> the <b>tanks</b> increases the purities. Analogs with mixed tanks are also designed for thermally assisted SMBs. ^ An unmixed tank is proposed as an alternative to <b>splitting</b> the mixed <b>tanks</b> similar to the system proposed by Mota and Araujo [9], except a constant volume tank is designed. These unmixed reservoirs increase the purity indices in the Analogs (for the separation of the binaphthol enantiomers at c F = 2. 9 g/l, PI increased from 89. 2 to 95. 1) with no increase in equipment or desorbent; however; the purities still do not match the SMB purities because of dispersion in the reservoir. Scaling rules are applied to first increase the purities by reducing the productivity, and are then applied to increase the productivity by allowing the system to operate at the maximum allowable pressure drop while keeping purities constant. ...|$|R
