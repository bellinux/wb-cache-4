5000|$|A <b>swim</b> <b>ring</b> (also {{known as}} a swim tube, rubber ring, water donut, or, in the United States, a lifesaver) is a toroid-shaped (hence the name [...] "ring" [...] or [...] "doughnut") {{inflatable}} water toy. The <b>swim</b> <b>ring</b> {{was derived from the}} inner tube, the inner, enclosed, inflatable part of older vehicle tires. The inner tube, when inflated, was used as a water toy, and as a floating object to lounge on.|$|E
50|$|In America, <b>swim</b> <b>rings</b> are {{typically}} {{viewed as the}} toys of children and are generally only found in smaller sizes in childish designs.

5000|$|A similar {{design of}} {{inflatable}} armbands for swimmers {{was invented by}} Bernhard Markwitz in Hamburg, Germany. In 1956, Markwitz's three-year-old daughter fell into a goldfish pond and nearly drowned. As a result, Markwitz invented and developed a swimming aid that would be safer for children than <b>swimming</b> <b>rings,</b> which at the time, were made of cork. A lottery win of 253,000 Deutsche Marks gave him a suitable start capital. In 1964, Markwitz developed the armbands in their final form and marketed them under the name [...] "BEMA". Their modern name in German, Schwimmflügel, literally translates as [...] "swimming wings".|$|R
50|$|At about 8:30 pm, a large {{deflagration}} {{occurred when}} {{a cloud of}} colored powder ignited after being discharged from the stage onto a crowd of 1,000 people during a concert. Some of the crowd breathed in the powder, causing respiratory problems. As recorded in an amateur video by an audience member, a massive fireball suddenly engulfed the stage. The powder caught fire along the ground, resulting in burns mainly to victims' limbs and torsos. According to the authorities, the fire was quickly extinguished. Some victims were carried out on <b>swim</b> <b>rings.</b> The rescue included help from army vehicles and soldiers, along with medical services.|$|R
50|$|A <b>swim</b> <b>ring</b> {{consists}} of two identically-sized layers of flat plastic, one of which contains a valve. The shape of each layer is like a large circle with a smaller, concentric circle removed. The two layers are joined at their inner and outer edges, sealing an air chamber inside.|$|E
50|$|Large inner tubes, {{which are}} large {{inflatable}} toruses, can be re-used for other purposes, such as swimming and rafting (see <b>swim</b> <b>ring),</b> tubing (recreation), sledding, and skitching. Purpose-built inflatable toruses are also manufactured for these uses, offering choice of colors, fabric covering, handles, decks, and other accessories, and eliminating the protruding valve stem.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Eva {{has been}} {{stuck on a}} small yacht on a mudbank {{in the middle of}} a lake with Sally and Hugh, where Hugh finally tells her that Sally {{arranged}} the whole farce with the doll, intending to get Eva to split from her husband so that she would go on the trip and give Sally the opportunity to pursue her interest in her. Eva, realizing how she has been duped, immediately leaves the boat using a small inflatable <b>swimming</b> <b>ring</b> and finds her way to a vicarage where she calls Wilt to get him to pick her up. She meets the vicar, who has apparently only recently moved to this location from Swaffham and happens to have a knotted stocking in his top pocket.|$|R

The [...] "Space Bowl" [...] sends riders down an enclosed body slide before entering an enclosed circular bowl and dropping out into a pool of water. A similar attraction, [...] "Revolution," [...] uses four-person swim rings instead. Also notable is a pitch black <b>swim</b> <b>ring</b> slide, [...] "Storm," [...] which includes lighting and sound effects. [...] "Turbo Racer" [...] opened in 2007 and is a racing slide attraction which features eight side by side lanes and a timed open air finish.|$|E
40|$|Operant {{conditioning}} with Betta splendens (Bettas) {{has been}} investigated extensively using males of the species. Ethological studies of female Bettas have revealed aggressive interactions that qualitatively parallel those between male Bettas. Given these similarities, four experiments were conducted with female Bettas to examine the generality of a widely reported finding with males: mirror-image reinforcement. <b>Swimming</b> through a <b>ring</b> was reinforced by a 10 –s mirror presentation. As with males, <b>ring</b> <b>swimming</b> was acquired and maintained when mirror presentations were immediate (Experiments 1, 2, and 3) and delayed (Experiment 4). The failure of conventional extinction (Experiments 1 and 2) and response-independent mirror presentations (Experiment 3) to maintain responding confirmed the reinforcing properties of mirror presentation. These results extend previous findings of mirror images as reinforcers in males {{of the same species}} and illustrate a complementarity between behavioral ecology and the experimental analysis of behavior.

40|$|Male Siamese {{fighting}} fish, Betta splendens, <b>swam</b> {{through a}} <b>ring</b> in an aquarium, breaking a photocell beam and initiating an unsignaled, resetting delay interval. Following delays of 0 s, 10 s, or 25 s, a 15 -s mirror presentation released an aggressive display by the fish. <b>Swimming</b> through the <b>ring</b> {{increased in the}} absence of either a period of acclimatization to the reinforcer (analogous to magazine training when appetitive reinforcers are used) or explicit training of the response by the experimenters. Response rates were a decreasing function of delay duration. Other fish exposed to a schedule of response-independent mirror presentations failed to acquire and maintain the response. The results demonstrate the robustness and generality of the phenomenon of response acquisition with delayed reinforcement. They further qualify earlier observations about behavioral mechanisms involved in the phenomenon...|$|R

50|$|In this game, {{a younger}} version of Ecco goes {{to see the}} Big Blue, {{completing}} tasks such as herding seahorses, <b>swimming</b> through <b>rings,</b> and finding lost balls for sea lions along the way. The gameplay is similarly controlled to the other Ecco the Dolphin games, but mainly revolves around using these abilities for solution of simple puzzles and problems. One key {{difference is that the}} player character cannot drown by staying underwater too long. Likewise, there are no enemies to attack the player character. Two other playable characters were introduced: Tara the baby orca (there is also a bottlenose dolphin character named Tara in Ecco: The Tides of Time) and Kitnee the young Atlantic dolphin, who is darker gray than Ecco. The player can switch characters at any time.|$|R
50|$|The 1920s saw {{an influx}} of black {{immigrants}} from the south moving into the surrounding communities of Black Bottom and Paradise Valley. The Detroit Parks Department {{began to realize that}} this community lacked any real recreation center. This forced their hand to begin a $500,000 renovation of the old library into a community center. A brand new two-story wing added designed by George W. Graves, added classrooms, a <b>swimming</b> pool, boxing <b>ring,</b> and basketball courts. The existing library was then converted to an auditorium.|$|R
50|$|Being a {{marsupial}} and at {{the same}} time an aquatic animal, the water opossum has evolved a way to protect its young while <b>swimming.</b> A strong <b>ring</b> of muscle makes the pouch (which opens to the rear) watertight, so the young remain dry, even when the mother is totally immersed in water. The male also has a pouch (although not as watertight as the female's), where he places his genitalia before swimming. This is thought to prevent it from becoming tangled in aquatic vegetation and is probably helpful in streamlining the animal as well.|$|R
50|$|After 24 hours, a fertilized egg {{gives rise}} to a trochophore larva. At 48 hours, the trochophore larva becomes a metatrochophore larva. Both trochophore and metatrochophore <b>swim</b> with a <b>ring</b> of cilia in the water and are {{positively}} phototactic. The metatrochophore has, beside the larval eyes, already the anlagen for the more complex adult eyes of the adult worm. A day later, at 72 hours after fertilization, the metatrochophore larva becomes a nectochaete larva. The nectochaete larva already has three segments, each with a pair of parapodia bearing chaetae, which serve for locomotion. The nectochaete larva can switch from positive to negative phototaxis. After five to seven days, the larvae start feeding and develop on their own speed, depending on food supply. After three to four weeks, when six segments have formed, the head is formed.|$|R
50|$|Vice-president of {{the first}} {{generation}} Adventure Club. He serves as the main antagonist of the story, believes might makes right, and will threaten, use brute force, and sacrifice others to get what he wants. The first generation of Adventure club was almost disbanded when he used a female member as sacrifice {{in order to get a}} Nanana Collection, causing her to become physically crippled, and left the club with the collection. He came into conflict with the present Adventure club when he threatens Saki as she knows the clue about the treasure; the club fought him inside the treasure room. While he held off the group and fled, he was later intercepted by Matsuri members, under Jūgo's command. His Nanana Collections are a bell that can summon cloud and rain, a pair of shoes that allows the user to dive into shadows as if <b>swimming,</b> and a <b>ring</b> that allows the user to give strong mental suggestions to others. He is also the previous resident of Nanana's room, but was kicked out as he rarely stayed, did not pay the rent, and often left Nanana alone.|$|R
40|$|Sperm {{motility}} is {{an important}} concept in fertility research. To this end, single spot laser tweezers {{have been used to}} quantitatively analyze the motility of individual sperm. However, this method is limited with throughput (single sperm per spot), lacks the ability of in-situ sorting based on motility and chemotaxis, requires high laser power (hundreds of milliWatts) and {{can not be used to}} dynamically monitor changes in sperm swimming behavior under the influence of a laser beam. Here, we report a continuous 3 -D ring-shaped laser trap which could be used for multi-level and high-throughput (tens to hundred sperm per ring) sperm sorting based on their motility and chemotaxis. Under a laser power of only tens of milliWatts, human sperm with low to medium velocity are slowed down, stopped, or forced to change their trajectories to <b>swim</b> along the <b>ring</b> due to the optical gradient force in the radial direction. This is the first demonstration of parallel sperm sorting based on motility with optical trapping technology. In addition, by making the sperm swimming along the circumference of the ring, the effect of laser radiation, optical force and external obstacles on sperm energetics are investigated in a more gentle and quantitative way. The application of this method could be extended to motility and bio-tropism studies of other self-propelled cells, such as algae and bacteria. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} two or three years schools of killer whales have often been {{reported}} in fjords and even harbours in Norway. The fishermen and their organizations fear that an increasing number of killer whales may decimate the growing population of Atlantic- Scandian herring. In order to obtain more information about the whales a marking cruise was made by the Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, to Kristiansund on the coast of Møre in January 1978. On the cruise about 30 killer whales were observed. Two whales were marked and possibly one more. Before marking the killers were not afraid of the vessel. After a hit of a mark, the whales ran away, and it was impossible to approach the school again. The whales also could identify the marking vessel amongst other ships. When the school ran away, the females with calves went first, and then, side by side, the rest of the animals in the school. During the flight, the whales dived and surfaced synchronously. Whalers have observed that when scattered killer whales are frightened, they always gather in a school before they run away. Fishermen have observed killer whales gathering herring by swimming in circles around the fish. When a compact school has been collected, two or three whales at time <b>swim</b> inside the <b>ring</b> and eat the herring while the rest of the killers hold the circle. Previous unpublished data from examination of stomach contents show that killer whales eat herring, squid and seals. (The skin of the seal was found inverted in the stomack.) Small brown-reddish calves in the schools of killer whales found near Kristiansund in January, confirm earlier statements that birth occurs in November -December...|$|R
40|$|Trade-offs between {{filtration}} rate and swimming performance among several salp species with distinct morphologies and swimming styles were compared. Small-scale particle encounter at the salp filtering apparatus was also explored. Observations and experiments were {{conducted at the}} Liquid Jungle Lab, off the pacific coast of Panama in January 2006 through 2009. First, time-varying body volume was calculated by digitizing salp outlines from in situ video sequences. The resulting volume flow rates were higher than previous measurements, setting an upper limit on filtration capacity. Though each species possessed a unique combination of body kinematics, normalized {{filtration rate}}s were comparable across species, {{with the exception of}} significantly higher rates in Weelia cylindrica aggregates, suggesting a tendency towards a flow optimum. Secondly, a combination of in situ dye visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were used to describe properties of the jet wake and swimming performance variables including thrust, drag and propulsive efficiency. All species investigated <b>swam</b> via vortex <b>ring</b> propulsion. Though Weelia cylindrica was the fastest swimmer, Pegea confoederata was the most efficient, producing the highest weight-specific thrust and wholecycle propulsive efficiency. Weak swimming performance parameters in Cyclosalpa afinis, including low weight-specific thrust and low propulsive efficiency, may be compensated by comparatively low energetic requirements. (cont.) Finally, a low Reynolds number mathematical model using accurately measured parameters and realistic oceanic particle size concentrations showed that submicron particles are encountered at higher rates than larger particles. Results from feeding experiments with 0. 5, 1 and 3 [mu]m po- lystyrene microspheres corroborated model predictions. Though 1 to 10 pm-sized particles (e. g. flagellates, small diatoms) are predicted to provide four times as much carbon as 0. 1 to 1 pm- sized particles (e. g. bacteria, Prochlorococcus), particles smaller than the mesh size (1. 4 [mu]m) can still fully satisfy salp energetic needs. by Kelly Rakow Sutherland.
