50|$|Soybean oil {{is one of}} the {{vegetable}} oils that contain a <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> of the essential omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n−3, ALA). Other plant oils containing <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> of ALA include chia, flax, hemp, canola and walnut. Soybean oil has an omega-6:omega-3 ratio of 7:1.|$|R

5|$|Primary {{food sources}} of lithium are grains and vegetables, and, in some areas, {{drinking}} water also contains <b>significant</b> <b>amounts.</b> Human intake {{varies depending on}} location and diet.|$|E
5|$|Certain solids are {{selenium}}-rich, and selenium can be bioconcentrated by some plants. In soils, selenium {{most often}} occurs in soluble forms such as selenate (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff. Ocean water contains <b>significant</b> <b>amounts</b> of selenium.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is a {{relatively}} rare neoplasm that is classified as an adenocarcinoma (a cancer that forms glands or secretes <b>significant</b> <b>amounts</b> of mucins). It has an annual incidence rate of 1–2 cases per 100,000 in the Western world, but rates of cholangiocarcinoma have been rising worldwide {{over the past few}} decades.|$|E

5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra are very similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of <b>significant</b> <b>amounts</b> of regolith impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.|$|E
5|$|Disulfiram (Antabuse) {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself {{is the cause of}} many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in <b>significant</b> <b>amounts</b> while they take the medicine.|$|E
5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} <b>significant</b> <b>amounts,</b> mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in <b>significant</b> <b>amounts,</b> so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E

5|$|Nineteen {{isotopes}} of fermium {{are known}} with mass numbers of 242–260. 254Fm, 255Fm and 256Fm are α-emitters {{with a short}} half-life (hours), which can be isolated in <b>significant</b> <b>amounts.</b> 257Fm (t1/2 = 100 days) can accumulate upon prolonged and strong irradiation. All these isotopes are characterized by high rates of spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} cultivar {{lacks the}} usual orange pigment due to carotene, owing its white colour to a recessive gene for tocopherol (vitamin E), but this cultivar and wild carrots {{do not provide}} nutritionally <b>significant</b> <b>amounts</b> of vitamin E.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the long}} term, {{residents}} lost <b>significant</b> <b>amounts</b> of {{income in the}} storm-affected areas, particularly farms in {{the year after the}} storm. Higher food prices also resulted in less income for other residents. The area's economy largely recovered to pre-flood levels by 2010.|$|E

Some only appear in certain seasons, while others appear (sporadically or constantly) throughout the entire series. All characters were created by David Chase, unless otherwise noted.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of the main ring {{can be explained by}} the hypothesis that it contains <b>significant</b> <b>amounts</b> of dust with 0.1–10μm particle sizes. This explains the stronger forward-scattering of light as compared to back-scattering. However, larger bodies are required to explain the strong back-scattering and fine structure in the bright outer part of the main ring.|$|E
