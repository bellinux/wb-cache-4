50|$|Today {{there are}} many {{manufacturers}} of the automatic horizontal flask molding lines.

5000|$|There are two {{firestone}} varieties. One {{is highly}} unstable, prone to release potentially explosive gas on contact with {{even the slightest}} bit of moisture, which makes it extremely dangerous to mine, <b>store,</b> <b>transport,</b> and consume. (Evidently it does not explode in a dragon's mouth, however.) The second variety is relatively stable, and must be [...] "digested" [...] in a dragon's second stomach to produce phosphine. The stable variety was discovered on the beaches of the Southern Continent soon after Landing, by observation of the native fire lizards (in Dragonsdawn). About 500 years later it was rediscovered by Kindan the harper and successfully mined (in Dragon's Fire), and thereafter used exclusively by dragonriders.|$|E
50|$|The {{instability}} of NI3 and NI3 · NH3 {{can be attributed}} to the large steric strain caused by the three large iodine atoms being held in proximity to each other around the relatively tiny nitrogen atom. This results in a very low activation energy for its decomposition, a reaction made even more favorable due to the great stability of N2. Nitrogen triiodide has no practical commercial value due to its extreme shock sensitivity, making it impossible to <b>store,</b> <b>transport,</b> and utilize for controlled explosions. Whereas pure nitroglycerin is also greatly shock-sensitive (although not nearly as much so as nitrogen triiodide, which can be set off with the touch of a feather) and powerful, it was only due to phlegmatizers that its shock sensitivity was reduced and it became safer to handle and transport in the form of dynamite.|$|E

50|$|Air {{guns that}} meet the Criminal Code {{definition}} of a firearm, but that are deemed not to be firearms for certain purposes of the Firearms Act and Criminal Code are those that have a muzzle velocity of less than 152.4 meters per second (500 feet per second) and/or a maximum muzzle energy of 5.7 joules (4.2 foot pounds). Such air guns are exempt from licensing, registration, and other requirements under the Firearms Act, and from penalties {{set out in the}} Criminal Code for possessing a firearm without a valid licence or registration certificate. However, they are considered to be firearms under the Criminal Code if they are used to commit a crime. The simple possession, acquisition and use of these air guns for lawful purposes is regulated by provincial and municipal laws and by-laws. For example, some provinces may have set a minimum age for acquiring such an air gun. These air guns are exempt from the specific safe storage, transportation and handling requirements set out in the regulations supporting the Firearms Act. However, the Criminal Code requires that reasonable precautions be taken to use, carry, handle, <b>store,</b> <b>transport,</b> and ship them in a safe and secure manner.|$|E
