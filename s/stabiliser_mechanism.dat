30|$|In a deflationary environment, a {{protracted}} period of low or negative growth {{will cause the}} decline of both human and fixed capital, which will in turn undermine growth potential. There is evidence that unemployment caused by the cyclical downturn is becoming structural in the euro area (European Commission 2015). Given the very limited chances of overcoming such imbalances through increased labour mobility in the EU (Draghi 2014), a rule-based <b>stabiliser</b> <b>mechanism</b> becomes an appropriate solution.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to develop an improved form of passive free-surface anti- roll tank, as commonly fitted to many fishing boats. By adding a flow control system to the tank fluid it was intended that the stabiliser would be able to adapt to changes in the ship roll period and loading conditions, in addition to compensating for deficiencies in the tank length or filling depth. The initial control strategy involved a bi-flow scheme, whereby the fluid would flow intermittently at long roll periods and flow continuously but with damped motion at short roll periods. Sea trials of the prototype <b>stabiliser</b> <b>mechanism</b> identified problems with both control methods, which were subsequently combined into an amalgamated form. The final control algorithm used dynamic models of both the ship roll and fluid distribution to evaluate the work done against the roll by variously damped fluid flow. A simulation of the stabilised ship in irregular waves verified the theoretical basis of the method. Although the adaptive stabiliser was primarily developed for free-surface tanks it could be equally well applied to U-tube designs by using air valves to modify the fluid damping.

40|$|We were {{interested}} in investigating the stabilisation behaviour of 6 -aminouracils, {{a new class of}} heavy metal free thermo-stabiliser for PVC. We have therefore investigated the performance and mechanism of stabilisation for 1, 3 -dibutyl- 6 -aminouracil, both alone, and in combination with a sodium perchlorate co-stabiliser. For the performance assessment of this stabiliser, we have utitlised a combination of dehydrochlorination rate data, UV-spectra data, and weight average molecular weight data. For mechanistic investigations, we have measured the average polyene sequence lengths and average number of sequences at different levels of dehydrochlorination. Further, we have investigated the stabilisation behaviour of the stabiliser with pre-formed polyene sequences (pre-degraded PVC), as well the extent of reaction of stabiliser with both virgin and pre-degraded samples during stabilisation. Thus, the stabilisation of PVC with 1. 0 mol% 1, 3 -dibutyl- 6 -aminouracil has been shown to proceed primarily via a labile chlorine substitution reaction in growing sequences. Unfortunately, a random HCl elimination reaction, catalysed by the basic amine in the enaminone segment of the 6 -aminouracil, results in the rapid formation of new labile sites. The stabiliser alone therefore offers excellent short term colour stability, but no long term stability. Addition of the sodium perchlorate co-stabiliser has been shown to markedly reduce the rate of random HCl elimination, therefore significantly lowering the number of new labile sites formed. A second, but less pronounced, inhibiting effect of co-stabiliser is the rate of labile chlorine substitution. However, the random reaction of stabiliser with double bonds in polyene sequences, known as 'colour improvement', which is only a minor stabilising reaction in the uracil only system, is dramatically accelerated by the addition of the sodium perchlorate co-stabiliser. A mechanism for 'colour improvement' involving the reaction of an iminium perchlorate salt intermediate is proposed. We were also concerned with the preparation of polymer-bound stabilisers, where the stabiliser, {{as part of a larger}} co-monomer, is introduced during the polymerisation stage. Depending upon the <b>stabilisers</b> <b>mechanism</b> of action during PVC processing, we would like a non-chain-grafting stabiliser to be permanently bound, and a chain-grafting stabiliser to become unbound during the processing-stage. We have therefore investigated thermal intrasequence lactonisation in several vinyl chloride-alkyl/aryl methacrylate copolymers. Here, a five membered lactone ring is formed in the polymer backbone and the ester substituent is split off. We found that the rate of lactonisation was controlled by the nature of the methacrylate substituent, being most rapid for tertiary and secondary substrates, and most hindered for primary substrates di-substituted at the C 2 position. Lactonisation was not observed for phenyl methacrylate. Thus, 1, 1 -dimethylalkylmethacrylate was chosen as the structure most suitable regarding the polymerisable 'head' of a chain-grafting additive co-monomer, and phenyl methacrylate was chosen as the structure most suitable regarding the polymerisable 'head' of a non-chain-grafting additive co-monomer. A mechanism for lactonisation is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthetic}} actin network demands {{great interest}} as bio-material {{due to its}} soft and wet nature that mimic many biological scaffolding structures. The study of these structures can contribute {{to a better understanding}} of this new micro/nano technology and the cytoskeleton like structural building blocks. Inside the cell the actin network is regulated by tens of actin-binding proteins (ABP's), which makes for a highly complex system with several emergent behavior. In particular Calponin is an ABP that was identified as an actin <b>stabiliser,</b> but its <b>mechanism</b> is poorly understood. Recent experiments using an in vitro model system of cross-linked actin with Calponin and large deformation bulk rheology, found that networks with basic calponin exhibited a delayed onset and were able to withstand a higher maximal strain before softening. In this work we propose a mathematical model into the framework of nonlinear continuum mechanics to explain the observation of Jansen, where we introduce the hypothesis by which the difference between the two networks, with and without Calponin, is interpreted as a alterations in the pre-strain developed by the network entanglement and the regulation of the crosslinks adhesion energy. The mechanics of the F-actin is modelled using the wormlike chain model for semi-flexible filaments and the gelation process is described as mesoscale dynamics for the crosslinks. The model has been validated with reported experimental results from literature, showing a good agreement between theory and experiments...|$|R
