Wise who was aboard and inspected Monitor after the battle responded in a letter of 30 April 1862: [...] "With reference to the Monitor, the moment I jumped on board of her after the fight I saw that a steam tug with twenty men could have taken {{the upper part of}} her in as many seconds...

The [...] "float cream method" [...] includes scalding a floating layer of double cream in milk (skimmed or whole) in shallow trays. To <b>scald,</b> the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for {{up to an hour}} it is slowly cooled for 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged. The [...] "scald cream method" [...] is similar, but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used. This cream is then heated in a similar manner, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged. In the United Kingdom the resultant cream is deemed to be equivalent to pasteurised for legal purposes. Unlike pasteurisation, however, there is no requirement for the temperatures to be recorded on thermograph charts. As the temperatures are lower than used in standard pasteurisation, much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene.|$|E

40|$|In two turkey {{processing}} {{plants in the}} northwest of Germany, skin samples were taken at 4 different positions (prior to <b>scalding,</b> after plucking, before and during chilling), which {{was repeated three times}} per sampling day (two days). The <b>scalding</b> technique was different (steam respectively water <b>scalding).</b> Samples were examined for total aerobic plate count as a hygiene parameter and the zoonotic agents Salmonella and Campylobacter. The examinations followed § 35 LMBG, DIN 10113 - 1 and DIN-ISO DIS 10272. After identification, Salmonella and a selection of Campylobacter isolates were characterized using molecularbiological pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). It was the aim of this study to reflect the influence of steam <b>scalding</b> on the microbiological status of the turkey skin compared to water <b>scalding</b> and the distribution of zoonotic agents under different <b>scalding</b> techniques. <b>Scalding</b> is generally recognised a a weak point in poultry processing. <b>Scalding</b> by steam {{is considered to be a}} potential alternative to water <b>scalding.</b> In abattoir one (water <b>scalding),</b> an average total aerobic plate count was obtained lg 4 and 5. No significant reduction of the total aerobic plate count during <b>scalding</b> and plucking was observed. In the end, the microbial count at the chilling position was lower than in the beginning. In abattoir two (steam <b>scalding),</b> the total aerobic plate count was between lg 3, 63 and lg 7, 13. The microbial count was lower after plucking than prior to <b>scalding.</b> A reduction of the total aerobic plate count was sometimes significant. However, during the following procedures the microbial count increased. So in the end, steam <b>scalding</b> had no impact on the microbial count underlining the importance of the complete processing line. In abattoir one (water <b>scalding),</b> 58 % of the samples were Salmonella positive. 6 Salmonella serovars (S. Typhimurium, S. Indiana, S. Agona, S. Heidelberg, S. of Group B and S. Saintpaul) were recovered. No Salmonella was identified at the first position of sampling. 42 % of the samples were Campylobacter positive (C. jejuni und C. coli). In abattoir two (steam <b>scalding),</b> 22 % of the samples were Salmonella positive which were recovered at each of the 4 sampling sites. Salmonella serovars were S. Typhimurium, S. Heidelberg und S. Saintpaul. Altogether 89 % of the samples were Campylobacter positive at each sampling site: C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari were identified. The results of PFGE demonstrate, that both, Salmonella and Campylobacter strains are being transferred through the whole processing line demonstrating the lack of critical points with respect to both zoonotic agents. With respect to restrictive legislation on zoonotic agents in the near future, the poultry processing lines must become more safe with respect to bacterial transfer...|$|R

One batch of cheeses {{was made in}} the traditional manner and one batch was made from ultrafiltered (UF) milk.

40|$|Background Most {{intentional}} burns are <b>scalds,</b> and distinguishing these from unintentional causes is challenging. Aim To {{conduct a}} systematic review to identify distinguishing features of intentional and unintentional <b>scalds.</b> Methods We performed an all language literature search of 12 databases 1950 – 2006. Studies were reviewed by two paediatric/burns specialists, using standardised methodology. Included: Primary studies of validated intentional or accidental <b>scalds</b> in children 0 – 18 years and ranked by confirmation of intentional or unintentional origin. Excluded: neglectful scalds; management or complications; studies of mixed burn type or mixed adult and child data. Results 258 studies were reviewed, and 26 included. Five comparative studies ranked highly for confirmation of intentional/unintentional cause of injury. The distinguishing characteristics were defined based on best evidence. Intentional <b>scalds</b> were commonly immersion injuries, caused by hot tap water, affecting the extremities, buttocks or perineum or both. The <b>scalds</b> were symmetrical with clear upper margins, and associated with old fractures and unrelated injuries. Unintentional <b>scalds</b> were more commonly due to spill injuries of other hot liquids, affecting {{the upper body}} with irregular margins and depth.

The investigated acid sulphate <b>scalds</b> are characterized by an extremely acidified topsoil layer (0 - 0. 6 m) although they derive from the sediments of varying salinity and the metal sulphides contained in the soils have experienced different degrees of oxidation. Almost all of the investigated <b>scalds</b> occur in the areas that have a lower surface elevation than the surrounding areas. These hollows may act as sinks for acid sulphate materials and salts that are transported from the surrounding areas and the shallower watertables in such locations may enhance upward transport of acid and salt materials from the underlying oxidized sulphidic sediments.

2500|$|According to the ethnohistorical record, the yaupon {{leaves and}} {{branches}} {{used for the}} black drink were traditionally picked {{as close to the}} time of its planned consumption as possible. After picking, historically they were lightly parched in a ceramic container over fire. The roasting increases the solubility in water of the caffeine, which is the same reason coffee beans are roasted. After browning, they were boiled in large containers of water until the liquid reached a dark brown or black color, giving it its name. The liquid was then strained into containers to cool, until it was cool enough to not <b>scald</b> the skin, and drunk while still hot. Because caffeine is 30 times more soluble in boiling water than room temperature water, this heightened its effect. It was then consumed in a ritual manner. Its physiological effects are believed to be mainly those of massive doses of caffeine. Three to six cups of strong coffee is equal to 0.5 to 1.0 grams of caffeine; the black drink could have delivered at least this much and possibly up to 3.0 to 6.0 grams of caffeine.
