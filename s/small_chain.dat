5|$|Hodad's is a <b>small</b> <b>chain</b> of {{hamburger}} {{restaurants in}} San Diego, United States, established in 1973 by {{husband and wife}} Byron and Virginia Hardin, who operated from a single burger stand until 1979. Following the death of co-founder Byron Hardin, their son Mike Hardin assumed operating responsibilities and ultimately took over the management following his mother's death in 1989. Hardin moved the restaurant to its current location on Newport Avenue in Ocean Beach, later opening additional restaurants in Petco Park and {{on the corner of}} 10th Avenue and Broadway. Mike Hardin died in 2015, leaving the business to his children Shane and Lexi.|$|E
5|$|Slackers CDs and Games, often {{shortened}} to Slackers, is a <b>small</b> <b>chain</b> {{of entertainment}} retailers {{located in the}} Midwestern United States. The store specializes in both new and used video games and music. It was founded in 1993 in Columbia, Missouri by Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias, originally as a music store. The store is known for selling local independent music, its collection of classic games, and for giving {{a lot of credit}} for trade-ins. In 2007, the store raised some controversy for stockpiling Nintendo Wiis. As of 2009, there are 10 locations in Missouri and Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{entomologist}} C.H. Curran's 1945 book, Insects of the Pacific World, noted {{women from}} India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles {{of the species}} Chrysochroa ocellata as pets. These living jewels were worn on festive occasions, probably with a <b>small</b> <b>chain</b> attached to one leg anchored to the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jewelled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.|$|E

5|$|In Iron Age Britain around 700 BC, a {{settlement}} on the Head was established; also around this time, the headland {{was cut off}} from the mainland by the construction of two banks and ditches called the Double Dykes, similar to those found at Maiden Castle. The earthworks consisted of an inner bank three metres high, with a ditch three and a half metres deep. An outer ditch six metres wide and two metres in depth is now obscured due to wind-blown deposits of sand and a gradual silting process. These defences turned Hengistbury Head into a fortified settlement area which seems to have grown over succeeding centuries until it became an important port. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final site in a <b>small</b> <b>chain</b> of fortified earthworks, starting from Hambledon Hill, and also including Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{company that}} would become FBO began as the U.S.-based movie {{subsidiary}} of the British importer, exporter, and film distributor Robertson-Cole. This organization was similar in structure to the French Pathé Exchange company, {{a subsidiary of the}} French Pathé Frères company. From its U.S. headquarters in New York City, R-C Pictures, as it was sometimes known, first entered the American film distribution market. In 1919, the company forged an alliance with Exhibitors Mutual Distributing, a corporate descendant of the Mutual Film studio. The first of R-C's own feature productions to be released was The Wonder Man, directed by John G. Adolfi and starring Georges Carpentier, which debuted May 29, 1920. With its move into production, Robertson-Cole established a 13.5-acre (5.5-hectare) studio in Los Angeles's fortuitously named Colegrove district, then adjacent to but soon to be subsumed by Hollywood. In January 1921, Robertson-Cole absorbed Hallmark Pictures, which had acquired the Exhibitors Mutual interests the previous year. The first official Robertson-Cole production shot at the new studio was a February 1921 release, The Mistress of Shenstone, directed by Henry King and starring beautiful Pauline Frederick, a former Paramount and Goldwyn star. That year, the British owners of the studio entered into a working relationship with Joseph P. Kennedy, father of future U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was then a broker at the New York banking firm of Hayden, Stone, as well as the owner of Maine–New Hampshire Theatres, a <b>small</b> <b>chain</b> of movie houses. Though he failed to arrange the sale R-C's general partners were looking for, Kennedy's involvement with the studio was far from over.|$|E

25|$|On chain timpani, {{the tension}} rods are {{connected}} by a roller chain {{much like the one}} found on a bicycle, though some manufacturers have used other materials, including steel cable. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a timpanist is forced to place a drum behind other items, so he cannot reach it with his foot. Professionals may also use exceptionally large or <b>small</b> <b>chain</b> and cable drums for special low or high notes.|$|E
25|$|In plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and phototrophic and chemoautotrophic proteobacteria, {{the enzyme}} usually {{consists}} of two types of protein subunit, called the large chain (L, about 55,000 Da) and the <b>small</b> <b>chain</b> (S, about 13,000 Da). The large-chain gene (rbcL) is encoded by the chloroplast DNA in plants. There are typically several related small-chain genes in the nucleus of plant cells, and the small chains are imported to the stromal compartment of chloroplasts from the cytosol by crossing the outer chloroplast membrane. The enzymatically active substrate (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate) binding sites {{are located in the}} large chains that form dimers as shown in Figure 1 (above, right) in which amino acids from each large chain contribute to the binding sites. A total of eight large-chains (= 4 dimers) and eight small chains assemble into a larger complex of about 540,000 Da. In some proteobacteria and dinoflagellates, enzymes consisting of only large subunits have been found.|$|E

25|$|Most of its {{mountains}} {{belong to}} the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The first is locally called the Sierra Norte del Puebla, entering the state from the northwest and then breaks up into the smaller chains of Sierra de Zacapoaxtla, Sierra de Huauchinango, Sierra de Teziutlán, Sierra de Tetela de Ocampo, Sierra de Chignahuapan and Sierra de Zacatlán, although these names may vary among localities. Some of the highest elevations include Apulco, Chichat, Chignahuapan, Soltepec and Tlatlaquitepec. The highest elevations are the volcanoes Pico de Orizaba or Citlaltepetl (5,747masl), Popocatépetl (5,452masl), Iztaccíhuatl (5,286masl) and Malinche (4,461masl) which are found on the state’s borders with Veracruz, Mexico State and Tlaxcala respectively.

500|$|Cloud's {{character}} {{was made to}} contrast the cast of the previous game, Final Fantasy VI, which had no main character. As result Yoshinori Kitase commented Cloud {{was designed to be}} the game's protagonist during early development of the game. Conceptualized as one of only three playable characters in early planning stages for the game, Cloud {{was one of the first}} two characters designed for Final Fantasy VII by Tetsuya Nomura. Nomura worked to strike an orthodox balance of varied designs for the game. Because he only started receiving character profiles prior to composing their appearances during later game productions, Nomura thought of the characters' stories first before tackling their designs. Nomura's first draft of Cloud featured slicked-back, black hair. The depiction served both as a contrast to the long silver hair of the game's chief antagonist, Sephiroth, and to minimize the model's polygon count. However, to make Cloud stand out more and emphasize his role as the game's lead protagonist, Nomura altered Cloud's design to give him spiky, bright blond hair. and in particular influenced the look of their swords. Early renditions of Cloud's weapon, the Buster Sword, depicted a smaller blade. Its size grew over the course of several revisions, and Nomura called it [...] "the Giant Kitchen Knife", envisioning it as unrefined steel. The sword at one point featured a <b>small</b> <b>chain</b> connected to the pommel, while magnets would secure the blade to Cloud's back. More deeply involved with Cloud's creation than with other characters' from previous Final Fantasy projects, Nomura also provided supervision over Cloud's personality traits.|$|E

500|$|Escapement, hydraulic-powered (use in clockworks): Although the {{escapement}} mechanism was first invented by the Greek Philon of Byzantium for a mechanical washstand, an {{escapement mechanism}} for clockworks was first {{developed by the}} Buddhist monk, court astronomer, mathematician and engineer Yi Xing (683–727) of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) for his water-powered celestial globe {{in the tradition of}} the Han dynasty polymath and inventor Zhang Heng (78–139), and could be found in later Chinese clockworks such as the clock towers developed by the military engineer Zhang Sixun (fl. late 10th century) and polymath inventor Su Song (1020–1101). Yi Xing's escapement allowed for a bell to be rung automatically every hour, and a drum beaten automatically every quarter-hour, essentially a striking clock. Unlike the modern escapement which employs a suspended oscillating pendulum resting and releasing its hooks on a small rotating gear wheel, the early Chinese escapement employed the use of gravity and hydraulics. In Su Song's clock tower, scoop containers fixed to the spokes of a vertical waterwheel (which acted like a gear wheel) would be filled one by one with siphoned water from a clepsydra tank. When the weight of the water in the scoop filled to an excess, it overcame a counterweight that in turn tripped a lever allowing the scoop to rotate on a pivot and drain its water. However, as the scoop fell, it tripped a coupling tongue that temporarily pulled down on a long vertical chain, the latter yanking down on a balancing lever which would pull upward on a <b>small</b> <b>chain</b> connected to a locking arm, the latter lifting momentarily to release the top arrested spoke before coming back down to repeat the entire process over again. It should be pointed out that the Chinese intermittently working liquid-driven escapement had [...] "only the name in common" [...] with the true mechanical escapement of medieval European mechanical clocks of the 14th century onwards, which worked instead with weights, producing continuous but discrete beats and that derived from the Greek and Roman verge mechanism (alarum) [...] device of earlier mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|Objectives of the Study: The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to find out}} why do {{retailers}} adopt some mobile marketing innovations and why do they not adopt other mobile marketing innovations. A second objective is to identify differences in the factors affecting adoption between retail corporations and <b>smaller</b> <b>chain</b> stores. Academic background and methodology: A literature review of organizational innovation adoption theory was done to form the framework for the empirical study. The empirical data for this study was collected with semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were in charge of their company's mobile marketing. The companies they worked for are among the biggest retailers in Finland. Findings and conclusions: The findings suggest that retail corporations have a different set of factors that affect their mobile marketing adoption compared to <b>smaller</b> <b>chain</b> stores. The factors that correlated well with adoption for retail corporations were the absorptive capacity of the firm and the perceived compatibility, complexity, and uncertainty of the innovation. The factors that seemed to influence the adoption decision of <b>smaller</b> <b>chain</b> stores were absorptive capacity, network externalities and the perceived compatibility, observability, uncertainty, and social approval of the innovation. It must be noted that the sample in this study was very small, so the results are only preliminary...|$|R
