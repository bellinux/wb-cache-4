40|$|Selecting {{potential}} parental {{lines that}} {{are characterized by}} a superior genetical disposition is an essential requirement in breeding <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>crops.</b> Flawed decisions in parental selection will have major consequences for breeding success. Currently, in breeding programs for <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>crops,</b> data is collected from several sources: observations from field experiments, molecular marker data analysis and pedigree information. As there is no statistical approach available in plant breeding, breeders do not use all of this data when making the selection. However, including all available information in the statistical analysis could enhance the selection response. The prediction of breeding values, using best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), which was introduced by Henderson (1984) in animal breeding, is a powerful method for estimating the true genetical disposition of individuals. Especially, in cross-pollinating crops, the prediction of breeding values has been determined in several research studies. A lot of work was done by Bernardo (1994, 1996 a, 1996 b, 1996 c, 1999) who determined the use of breeding values in maize breeding. In general, selection by breeding values {{was found to be}} superior to commonly used selection strategies. In this contribution, some news concerning recent developments in the prediction of breeding values of parental inbred lines of <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>crops</b> will be given. The objective is to present research studies that deal with the prediction of breeding values, combining different data information into a single statistical analysis. Particular emphasis is placed on methods that use molecular marker data in the prediction of breeding values and to multivariate statistical models. Currently, in the breeding of <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>crops,</b> molecular marker data is not included in the analysis nor is there any consideration of the correlation structure among traits.

40|$|Bambara {{groundnut}} is {{an indigenous}} African legume grown mainly in sub-Saharan Africa; {{it is an}} important source of protein to the rural majority. There are no established varieties and subsistence farmers grow locally adapted landraces which are generally low yielding. Bambara groundnut is a predominantly <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>crop</b> and is expected to exist as non-identical inbred lines, although the previous lack of co-dominant markers has prevented a formal assessment of heterozygosity within bambara groundnut genotypes. A total set of 75 microsatellites that were characterised in this study were used to investigate the genetic diversity of a set of 24 bambara groundnut landraces, to provide an evaluation of the markers for polymorphism and provide a link with DArT marker data that were previously analysed. Sixty eight microsatellites were identified that were found to be consistent and reproducible, from which a set of markers were selected and used for genetic variability studies of bambara groundnut, to compare the use of molecular markers with morphological markers, and to investigate using SSR markers in pure line selection. The genetic diversity of bambara groundnut was assessed based on morphological characters for two seasons; in a glasshouse experiment at the University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, UK and in a field experiment that was conducted at the Botswana College of Agriculture (Notwane farm), Gaborone in a randomised block design with three replicates. The landraces were characterised for 24 quantitative and 13 qualitative characters. The results indicated considerable variation for quantitative characters, while significant morphological differences were also recorded for most characters. Multivariate data analysis was conducted using principal component analysis, cluster analysis and heritability estimates were developed. The low cost, simplicity and agricultural relevance of morphological characterisation makes it an important tool in germplasm genetic variation studies. Thirty four lines from field experiments were investigated for genetic diversity based on 20 microsatellites. The expected heterozygosity (He) had an average of 1 in agreement with the fact that bambara groundnut is predominantly self-pollinating. Both cluster analysis and principle component analysis (PCoA) grouped landraces based mainly on their areas of origin. A thorough molecular analysis of genetic and morphological variation in bambara groundnut was conducted to investigate {{the relationship between the two}} assessment techniques. This comparison will assist in breeders making informed decisions as to which approach is best to use in germplasm characterisation and plant breeding and how best to apply such knowledge in practical situations. DNA markers could then aid with the selection of germplasm for breeding, quality control within breeding programmes and, potentially, direct selection via Marker Assisted Selection (MAS).

The model is still in common use today, though a number of more complex models are also now in use.

Maintenance selection can prevent this deterioration. How it is carried out depends on the reproduction system of the crop. Crops are therefore classified into four categories; typical cross-pollinating <b>crops,</b> <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>crops</b> with a substantial amount of outcrossing, typical <b>self-pollinating</b> <b>crops</b> with little outcrossing, and the vegetatively reproduced crops. Generally some of the ¿breeder seed¿ is used to plant a small plot with spaced plants. A fair number of healthy plants of the cultivar type is selected and the seed is harvested per plant. The progenies of the selected plants are grown in small plots. Non-uniform or deviating plots and plots with a seed-borne disease are removed. The seed of the progenies that are healthy, uniform and similar (and so of the cultivar type) are harvested per progeny to be tested next season on larger plots. The same selection is applied and only the seed of the progenies that are healthy, uniform and similar are harvested together to produce the ¿breeder seed¿.
