50|$|Rebound {{insomnia}} is insomnia {{that occurs}} following discontinuation of sedative substances taken to relieve primary insomnia. Regular {{use of these}} substances can cause a person to become dependent on its effects in order to fall asleep. Therefore, when a person has stopped taking the medication and is 'rebounding' from its effects, {{he or she may}} experience insomnia as a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> Occasionally, this insomnia may be worse than the insomnia the drug was intended to treat.|$|E
5000|$|In Ethiopian culture {{the word}} dukak (ዱካክ, [...] "depression") is used, which is {{believed}} to be an evil spirit that possesses people during their sleep. Some people believe this experience is a <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the stimulant khat. The evil spirit dukak is an anthropomorphic personification of the depression that often results from the act of quitting chewing khat. 'Dukak' often appears in hallucinations of the quitters and metes out punishments to its victims for offending him by quitting. The punishments are often in the form of implausible physical punishments (e.g., the dukak puts the victim in a bottle and shakes the bottle vigorously) or outrageous tasks the victim must perform (e.g., swallow a bag of gravel).|$|E
5000|$|Comedown or {{crashing}} is {{the deterioration}} in mood that happens as a psychoactive drug, typically a stimulant, is either decreasing or is cleared {{from the blood}} and thus the cerebral circulation. The improvement and deterioration of mood (euphoria and dysphoria) are represented in the cognitive [...] as high and low elevations; thus, after the drug has elevated the mood (a state known as a high), there follows a period of coming back down, which often has a distinct character from withdrawal in stimulants. Generally, a comedown ("down", [...] "low", sometimes [...] "crash") can happen to anyone as a transient symptom, but in people who are dependent on the drug (especially those addicted to it), it is an early <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> and thus can be followed by others. Various drug classes, most especially stimulants {{and to a lesser}} degree opioids and sedatives, are subject to comedowns. A milder analogous mood cycle can happen even with blood sugar levels (thus sugar highs and sugar lows), which is especially relevant to people with diabetes mellitus and to parents and teachers managing children's behavior, as well as in adults with ADHD. Stimulant comedowns are unique in that they often appear very abruptly after a period of focus or high, and are typically the more intensely dysphoric phase of withdrawal than that following complete elimination from the bloodstream. Besides general dysphoria, this phase can be marked by frustration, anger, anhedonia, social withdrawal, and other symptoms characteristic to a milder mixed episode in bipolar disorder. Alertness and other general stimulant effects are still present.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2007 {{review of}} the effects of {{abstinence}} from tobacco, Hughes concluded that [...] "anger, anxiety, depression, difficulty concentrating, impatience, insomnia, and restlessness are valid withdrawal symptoms that peak within the first week and last 2-4 weeks." [...] In contrast, [...] "constipation, cough, dizziness, increased dreaming, and mouth ulcers" [...] {{may or may not be}} <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> while drowsiness, fatigue, and certain physical symptoms ("dry mouth, flu symptoms, headaches, heart racing, skin rash, sweating, tremor") were not <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b>|$|R

50|$|Early {{treatment}} <b>of</b> acute <b>withdrawal</b> often includes medical detoxification, {{which can}} include doses of anxiolytics or narcotics to reduce <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> An experimental drug, ibogaine, is also proposed to treat withdrawal and craving.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective. Drug {{dependence}} {{is one of}} {{the serious}} problems around the world. Saffron is one of those beneficial medicinal plants which is embedded with a similar mechanism to methadone (e. g., inhibition of serotonin reuptake). Thus, it can be helpful in reducing the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study was to reduce the daily dose of methadone usage and reduce its side effects using saffron in the form of medicinal supplements. Methodology. This study was categorized as a clinical trial. Accordingly, 44 clients of addiction treatment centers in Sabzevar parish were randomly selected to participate in this study in 2016 – 2017. While the experimental group was treated with methadone syrup and self-made saffron capsules, the control group received methadone syrup and placebo capsules. Results. The results showed that the use of saffron and methadone alleviated the <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome (p< 0. 001). Conclusion. Having reviewed the research participants, it was indicated that the introduction of saffron alleviated the <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome in patients undergoing maintenance treatment for opioid addiction. Thus, it seems rational to make use of saffron in combination with methadone in order to alleviate the <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{addiction}} is maintained by negative reinforcement – alleviation <b>of</b> the negative <b>withdrawal</b> state. 1 •Acute (one time) administration of morphine, an opiate drug, elicits negative emotional <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> such as anxiety in rats. 2 •The withdrawal potentiated startle (WPS) paradigm {{is used to}} assess the negative withdrawal state in rats. It relies on the acoustic startle reflex, which {{has been shown to be}} elevated during acute morphine withdrawal, and represents the anxiety-like <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> 2 •Research in the Gewirtz laboratory has shown that one of the brain structures involved in mediating withdrawal from opiate drugs such as morphine is the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Morphine causes the VTA to release dopamine and excite downstream targets, which may be related to the onset <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> •In addition, increased levels of noradrenaline are also present during opiate withdrawal. 3,...|$|R

40|$|Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB, "liquid ecstasy") and {{its legal}} prodrugs gamma-butyrolactone and 1, 4 -butanediol are gaining {{importance}} as recreational drugs in Germany. Because {{of the wide}} availability of GHB and its prodrugs physicians are increasingly being confronted with cases of intoxication. The effect of GHB intoxication is comparable with those of alcohol and/or benzodiazepines. Likewise, <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> may occur.

50|$|There {{exists a}} higher rate of relapse, shorter periods of abstinence, and higher {{responsiveness}} to drug-related cues in women as compared to men. One study suggests that the ovarian hormones, estradiol and progesterone, that exist in females at fluctuating levels throughout the menstrual cycle (or estrous cycle in rodents), {{play a significant role in}} drug-primed relapse. There is a marked increase in progesterone levels and a decrease in estradiol levels during the luteal phase. Anxiety, irritability, and depression, three <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> both <b>withdrawal</b> and the human menstrual cycle, are most severe in the luteal phase. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> not associated with the cycle, such as hunger, are also enhanced during the luteal phase, which suggests the role of estradiol and progesterone in enhancing symptoms above the naturally occurring level of the menstrual cycle. The <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> craving also increase during the luteal phase in humans (it is important to note that the opposite result occurs in female subjects with cocaine addiction suggesting that cyclic changes may be specific for different drugs of abuse). Further, the drug-primed response is reduced during the luteal phase suggesting a time in the cycle during which the urge to continue use may be reduced. These findings implicate a cyclic, hormone-based timing for quitting a drug of abuse and preparing for magnified <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> or susceptibility to relapse.|$|R
40|$|The {{negative}} affective <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> opiate <b>withdrawal</b> powerfully motivate drug-seeking {{behavior and}} may trigger relapse to heroin abuse. To date, no medications exist that effectively relieve the negative affective <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> opiate <b>withdrawal.</b> The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) {{system has been}} hypothesized to mediate the motivational effects of drug dependence. The CRF signal is transmitted by two distinct receptors named CRF receptor- 1 (CRF 1) and CRF 2.

50|$|The driving {{principle}} behind ORT is the program's {{capacity to}} facilitate a resumption of stability in the user's life, while the patient experiences reduced <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> drug <b>withdrawal</b> and less intense drug cravings; a strong euphoric effect is not experienced {{as a result of}} the treatment drug. In some countries (not the US, or Australia), regulations enforce a limited time period for people on ORT programs that conclude when a stable economic and psychosocial situation is achieved. (Patients suffering from HIV/AIDS or Hepatitis C are usually excluded from this requirement.) In practice, 40-65% of patients maintain complete abstinence from opioids while receiving opioid replacement therapy and 70-95% are able to reduce their use significantly. Along with this is a concurrent elimination or reduction in medical (improper diluents, non-sterile injecting equipment), psychosocial (mental health, relationships), and legal (arrest and imprisonment) issues that can arise from the use of illegal opioids. Clonidine or lofexidine can help treat the <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b>|$|R
30|$|Tobacco use {{is often}} {{considered}} {{as a tool to}} overcome difficult situations caused by social anxiety and lack of confidence in smokers suffering from anxio-depressive disorders. These disorders are more frequent among women, explaining in part their greater difficulty to stop smoking. The other reasons are the greater frequency of depressive disorders, the less effectiveness of nicotine substitutes, and the more important fear to gain weight once stopping smoking among women [38]. Furthermore, smokers would find in the consumption of cigarettes a way to reduce the negative emotions including the negative <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> [23].|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{frequent}} use results in high tolerance and dependence. Chemical dependency builds {{in relation to}} the frequency of use, dosage, age, sex, weight, and medical condition. Once chemical dependency has developed, abrupt cessation of use will cause withdrawal; symptoms include leg and abdominal cramps, mydriasis, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, cravings, lethargy, and anxiety. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> usually fade after 4-10 days but cravings and psychological dependence may continue for longer, in some cases up to a year. Treatment methods for addiction are generally the same for any opioid.|$|R
40|$|Nicotine, {{the main}} psychoactive {{ingredient}} of tobacco, induces negative emotional symptoms during abstinence {{that contribute to}} a profound craving for nicotine. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying how nicotine produces dependence remains poorly understood. We demonstrate one mechanism for both the anxiety-like <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> and excessive nicotine intake observed after abstinence, through recruitment of the extrahypothalamic stress peptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system and activation of CRF 1 receptors. Overactivation of the CRF–CRF 1 system may contribute to nicotine dependence and may represent a prominent target for investigating the vulnerability to tobacco addiction...|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects {{reported}} with naltrexone are gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea and abdominal cramping. These adverse effects are {{analogous to the}} <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> opioid <b>withdrawal,</b> as the mu receptor blockade will increase GI motility.|$|R
