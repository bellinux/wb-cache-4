I was {{surprised}} to hear the Gauchos, who have from infancy almost lived on horseback, say that, under similar circumstances, they always suffer. St. Jago told me, that having been confined for three months by illness, he went out hunting wild cattle, and in consequence, {{for the next two}} days, his thighs were so stiff that he was obliged to lie in bed. This shows that the Gauchos, although they do not appear to do so, yet really must exert much muscular effort in riding. The hunting wild cattle, in a country so difficult to pass as this is on account of the swampy ground, must be very hard work. The Gauchos say they often pass at full <b>speed</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> which would be impassable at a slower pace; {{in the same manner as}} a man is able to skate over thin ice. When hunting, the party endeavours to get as close as possible to the herd without being discovered. Each man carries four or five pair of the bolas; these he throws one after the other at as many cattle, which, when once entangled, are left for some days, till they become a little exhausted by hunger and struggling. They are then let free and driven towards a small herd of tame animals, which have been brought to the spot on purpose. From their previous treatment, being too much terrified to leave the herd, they are easily driven, if their strength last out, to the settlement.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{fishing vessel}} {{dynamics}} at a fine spatial scale {{is of great}} interest for defining appropriate spatial management plans. Different models {{have been developed to}} detect fishing activity from Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data. While mathematical and statistical methods differ, all rely on the idea that vessel <b>speed</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> provides information on fishing vessel activity. However, trawling with constant speed relative to the water mass may as well prove a winning strategy for both technical (to ensure sufficient trawl opening) and biological (to limit escapement of fish) reasons. Therefore, considering speed through water instead of <b>speed</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> might provide insights into fishing activities. We developed a method combining surface currents derived from ocean circulation models with VMS data to estimate vessel speed through water. We then used vessel speed through water as input to two previously published segmentation methods to infer fishing activity during a fishing trip. We illustrate the approach by analysing trajectories of trawlers operating in the Eastern English Channel. All vessels were equipped with VMS and part of the Obsmer national discard sampling programme. Overall, results showed that surface currents influenced fishing behaviour, and trawling preferentially occured parallel to surface currents. <b>Speed</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> associated with trawling behaviour was much more variable than speed through water, suggesting that trawling occured at constant engine regimes. However, for both segmentation methods using speed through water instead of <b>speed</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> did not improve our capacity to identify trawling sequences.

30|$|The {{difference}} between the time required for the upstream and downstream transects (Figure  3) {{was due to the}} boat’s advance over the ground being aided by the flood tide on the upstream pass and being retarded by the flood tide on the downstream pass. When towing a CTD at very shallow depths, speed relative to the water governs the towing response of the CTD and determines whether or not air bubbles are apt to pass through the conductivity sensor and cause erroneously low salinity values. This was an important operational consideration during the downstream pass of the round-trip transect, because, although the flood tide was slowing the boat’s <b>speed</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground,</b> it was increasing the tow speed of the CTD relative to the water.|$|E

If you are using differential GPS (DGPS) the measurement will also be accurate to a few centimetres per second when averaged over a few minutes. For an underwater vehicle, especially one designed for long transects, the story is quite different. While speed measurement relative to the surrounding water is straightforward measuring <b>speed</b> <b>over</b> the <b>ground</b> is not so easy-it could be 5000 m away. Acoustic Doppler logs have proven attractive, affordable and reasonably accurate solutions to this problem where the vehicle remains less than 200 m or so from the sea bed. Speed errors of less than 1 % can readily be achieved, with some users reporting errors of 0. 1 % after careful calibration. But, in water depths of 1000 m and more autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can not use any Doppler log presently available. The Doppler technique itself is part of the problem. It requires three or four narrow beams (typically 3 ˚) which, at the sub- 100 kHz frequencies needed for 1 km+ range, results in large and heavy acoustic transducers.
