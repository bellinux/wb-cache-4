2500|$|Often, signals can be {{represented}} well as a sum of sinusoids. However, consider a non-continuous signal with an abrupt discontinuity; this signal can still {{be represented}} as a sum of sinusoids, but requires an infinite number, which is an observation known as Gibbs phenomenon. This, then, requires {{an infinite number of}} Fourier coefficients, which is not practical for many applications, such as compression. Wavelets are more useful for describing these signals with discontinuities because of their time-localized behavior (both Fourier and wavelet transforms are frequency-localized, but wavelets have an additional time-localization property). Because of this, many types of signals in practice may be non-sparse in the Fourier domain, but very sparse in the wavelet domain. This is particularly useful in signal reconstruction, especially in the recently popular field of compressed sensing. (Note that the <b>short-time</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> (STFT) is also localized in time and frequency, but there are often problems with the frequency-time resolution trade-off.
