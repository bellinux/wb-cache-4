5|$|Abrahams Creek {{begins in}} Franklin Township. It flows {{south-southwest}} {{for a short}} distance before turning <b>south</b> <b>for</b> several tenths of a mile, passing through the border between Dallas Township, Franklin Township, and Kingston Township, and entering Kingston Township. The creek then continues <b>south</b> <b>for</b> {{more than a mile}} before turning southeast and eventually entering Frances Slocum Lake. On the southeastern end of the lake, the creek turns east-northeast for more than a mile, entering a deep valley. It then turns south-southeast for a few miles, entering West Wyoming flowing through a water gap. The creek then turns southeast for some distance before turning southwest and entering Wyoming. It then turns west-southwest for a few miles before turning south and then west. The creek then turns south again, crossing US Route 11. It then turns southwest for more than a mile, entering Forty Fort and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River.|$|E

5|$|The {{jet stream}} moves from West to East {{bringing}} changes of weather.

5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe storms—the first such {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued for {{a large part of}} the Deep <b>South</b> <b>for</b> March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, near the center of the low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|A journey between Arnos Grove and Southgate {{typically}} takes {{slightly more}} than four minutes. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3-9 minutes between 07:07 and 01:07 eastbound, and every 2-6 minutes between 05:19 and 00:06 westbound. When operational problems occur on the line, Arnos Grove station may act as a temporary terminus of a reduced service – either a shuttle service between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters or a truncated service from Central London. The station has a set of seven sidings to its <b>south</b> <b>for</b> stabling trains.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of success under head coach Dan McGugin and an undefeated 1921 season, Vanderbilt had outgrown its old stadium.

The steel-and-concrete structure cost about $200,000 and could seat 22,600. It was the first dedicated college football stadium in the South.|$|E

5|$|After passing {{playing fields}} to the south, the A1 briefly becomes Market Place, a former street market that {{has evolved into}} a short stretch of shops, then becomes Falloden Way – built between 1914 and 1924 as part of a {{programme}} of planned extensions to Hampstead Garden Suburb, and runs on an embankment due to a dip in the ground caused by Mutton Brook, a tributary of the River Brent, which runs parallel to the road immediately to the <b>south</b> <b>for</b> its entire length. The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks, whilst the southern side is occupied by a narrow strip of parkland following the brook, and by the northern tip of Big Wood and Little Wood – two of the few surviving remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered what is now north London.|$|E
5|$|Although lynchings and racially {{motivated}} murders {{had occurred}} throughout the <b>South</b> <b>for</b> decades, {{the circumstances surrounding}} Emmett Till's murder and the timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention {{to the case of}} a 14-year-old boy who had allegedly been killed for breaching a social caste system. Till's murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations between the North and South, the social status quo in Mississippi, the activities of the NAACP and the White Citizens' Councils, and the Cold War, all of which were played out in a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Arizona was {{commissioned}} into the Navy on 17 October 1916 with John D. McDonald as captain. She departed New York on 10 November 1916 after {{the crew had}} cleaned the ship and the propulsion system had been tested at the dock. After declinating the ship's magnetic compasses, the ship sailed <b>south</b> <b>for</b> her shakedown cruise. Outside Guantanamo Bay, a stripped turbine on 7 December forced the navy to order Arizona back to New York for repairs, although {{she was able to}} enter Chesapeake Bay to test her main and secondary gun batteries on 19–20 December. The turbine could not be repaired inside the ship, so the yard workers had to cut holes in the upper decks to lift the damaged casing out. It was reinstalled after almost four months of repairs at the naval yard.|$|E

5|$|As {{a student}} holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had {{become aware of}} the lack of resorts in Lancashire. He was {{concerned}} that the working classes of Lancashire could not afford to travel <b>south</b> <b>for</b> their holidays as wealthy people like him could. The number of railways in Great Britain steadily increased {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and Hesketh was impressed by the arrival in 1828 of the steam locomotive in Lancashire. As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event filled him with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to the seaside.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the federal and state governments left Philadelphia, but the city continued for some years to be the country's cultural and financial center. Its large free black community aided fugitive slaves and founded the first independent black denomination in the nation, the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Philadelphia {{became one of the first}} U.S. industrial centers with a variety of industries, the largest being textiles. It had many economic and family ties to the South, with southern planters maintaining second homes in the city and having business connections with banks, sending their daughters to French finishing schools run by refugees from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), selling their cotton to textile manufacturers, which in turn sold some products to the <b>South,</b> <b>for</b> instance, clothing for slaves. At {{the beginning}} of the American Civil War, there were many southern sympathizers, although most city residents became firmly Union as the war went on.|$|E

5|$|Both of the {{principal}} French squadrons departed Brest on 13 December, remaining {{together for the first}} two days before dividing in pursuit of separate British merchant convoys on 15 December. The squadron under Leissègues clashed with the convoy's escort, before breaking off and sailing <b>south</b> <b>for</b> the French Caribbean, where Leissègues was intending to land the 1,000 soldiers carried aboard as reinforcements for the garrison at Santo Domingo, via the Azores. The voyage was long and difficult, Leissègues struggling through winter storms that divided his squadron and inflicted severe damage to his ships. Arriving at Santo Domingo on 20 January, Leissègues disembarked his troops and began extensive repairs to his ships in preparation for raiding cruises in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|East of the waterway, NY31 follows East Broad Street to South Avenue, {{where it}} turns <b>south</b> <b>for</b> two blocks to a {{junction}} with Woodbury Boulevard.

Westbound NY31 in the area, however, follows one block of Woodbury Boulevard and two blocks of South Clinton Avenue to reach East Broad Street. At the Inner Loop, Chestnut Street becomes Monroe Avenue, the name NY31 retains to Pittsford. Over this stretch, NY31 maintains a constant southeasterly progression as it passes though southeastern Rochester {{and the town of}} Brighton. As the route exits downtown Rochester, it intersects I-490 at exit18.

5|$|Fighting in the {{northern}} sector continued during this time also, and although preparations in the <b>south</b> <b>for</b> the final advance towards Buin continued into August, combat operations on the island ceased as the war {{came to an end}} before these were completed.

By mid-August, however, following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan's subsequent unconditional surrender, a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this, it spelt an end to major combat operations.|$|E
