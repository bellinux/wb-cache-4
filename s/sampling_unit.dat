Road culverts allow the transportation system and lotic ecosystem to coexist, but their presence can introduce physical {{stress on the}} local ecology. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of road culverts on the benthic macroinvertebrate community. I collected physical habitat, water quality, and benthic macroinvertebrate data from three <b>sample</b> <b>units</b> near the culverted sections of two lotic ecosystems. <b>Sample</b> <b>units</b> were positioned in a longitudinal configuration with a reference <b>sample</b> <b>unit</b> located above the road culvert, a study <b>sample</b> <b>unit</b> below the outlet, and a recovery <b>sample</b> <b>unit</b> further downstream.

Also, adjusted semivariograms were used to observe that the correlation between neighboring <b>sample</b> <b>units</b> for number of trees was stronger than for the basal area.

In time, the length-weighted average grade for Matheron's three-dimensional block grade was replaced with the distance-weighted average grade for Agterberg's zero-dimensional point. Both central values turned into honorific kriged estimates or kriged estimators. An infinite set of Agterberg's zero dimensional points fits within any ore block, along any borehole, or inside any <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> or sample space. Matheron's block grades and Agterberg's point grades are unique because both are functions without variances.|$|E
50|$|Three {{functions}} {{are used in}} geostatistics for describing the spatial or the temporal correlation of observations: these are the correlogram, the covariance and the semivariogram. The last is also more simply called variogram. The sampling variogram, unlike the semivariogram and the variogram, shows where a significant degree of spatial dependence in the sample space or <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> dissipates into randomness when the variance terms of a temporally or in-situ ordered set are plotted against the variance of the set and the lower limits of its 99% and 95% confidence ranges.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between cluster sampling and stratified sampling {{is that in}} cluster sampling the cluster is treated as the <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> so sampling is done on a population of clusters (at least in the first stage). In stratified sampling, the sampling is done on elements within each strata. In stratified sampling, a random sample is drawn {{from each of the}} strata, whereas in cluster sampling only the selected clusters are sampled. A common motivation of cluster sampling is to reduce costs by increasing sampling efficiency. This contrasts with stratified sampling where the motivation is to increase precision.|$|E

The distribution variance, in contrast, is a measure for variability between primary increments in a <b>sampling</b> <b>unit,</b> and, thus, for its degree of heterogeneity.

50|$|The {{strength}} of WPM is comprehensiveness {{with respect to}} the sample of water points audited, which results in the need of roughly covering the overall area of intervention. The drawback of the WPM approach, however, is that the focus is on water points, while sanitation and hygiene data need to be collected at the household. An approach for WASH data collection that combines a water points mapping with a household-based survey might overcome previous constraint. The new methodology takes the WPM as a starting point to comprehensively record all improved water points, being the water point basic <b>sampling</b> <b>unit.</b> This information can be then combined with data provided from a household survey to assess sanitation and hygienic habits. In terms of method, the approach adopted includes: (i) identification and audit of all improved water points; (ii) calculation of a sample size of households that is representative at and below the district level; and (iii) random household selection at the water point.|$|E

40|$|Forest {{inventories}} {{are usually}} compiled without {{taking into account}} the existing correlations between <b>sampling</b> <b>units,</b> which is debatable particularly where the calculations involve environmental variables. When the potential correlations between <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> are overlooked, the accuracy of such inventories becomes distorted in terms of the confidence interval range for the variable of interest, which is volume in cubic meters.

5000|$|Probability of {{detection}} (POD) tests are a standard way {{to evaluate a}} nondestructive testing technique in a given set of circumstances, for example [...] "What is the POD of lack of fusion flaws in pipe welds using manual ultrasonic testing?" [...] The POD will usually increase with flaw size. A common error in POD tests is {{to assume that the}} percentage of flaws detected is the POD, whereas the percentage of flaws detected is merely {{the first step in the}} analysis. Since the number of flaws tested is necessarily a limited number (non-infinite), statistical methods must be used to determine the POD for all possible defects, beyond the limited number tested. Another common error in POD tests is to define the statistical sampling units (test items) as flaws, whereas a true <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> is an item that may or may not contain a flaw. Guidelines for correct application of statistical methods to POD tests can be found in ASTM E2862 Standard Practice for Probability of Detection Analysis for Hit/Miss Data and MIL-HDBK-1823A Nondestructive Evaluation System Reliability Assessment, from the U.S. Department of Defense Handbook.|$|E
50|$|Ranked set {{sampling}} is {{an innovative}} design {{that can be}} highly useful and cost efficient in obtaining better estimates of mean concentration levels in soil and other environmental media by explicitly incorporating the professional judgment of a field investigator or a field screening measurement method to pick specific sampling locations in the field. Ranked set sampling uses a two-phase sampling design that identifies sets of field locations, utilizes inexpensive measurements to rank locations within each set, and then selects one location from each set for sampling. In ranked set sampling, m sets (each of size r) of field locations are identified using simple random sampling. The locations are ranked independently within each set using professional judgment or inexpensive, fast, or surrogate measurements. One <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> from each set is then selected (based on the observed ranks) for subsequent measurement using a more accurate and reliable (hence, more expensive) method for the contaminant of interest. Relative to simple random sampling, this design results in more representative samples and so leads to more precise estimates of the population parameters. Ranked set sampling is useful when the cost of locating and ranking locations {{in the field is}} low compared to laboratory measurements. It is also appropriate when an inexpensive auxiliary variable (based on expert knowledge or measurement) is available to rank population units with respect to the variable of interest. To use this design effectively, {{it is important that the}} ranking method and analytical method are strongly correlated.|$|E

Chinese balances with a maximum limit of 15 kilograms and a minimum of 20 grams were used. All processed foods (including edible oils and salt) remaining after the last meal before initiation of the survey were weighed and recorded. All purchases, home production, and processed snack foods were recorded. Whenever foods were brought into the household unit, they were weighed and preparation waste (e.g., spoiled rice, discarded cooked meals fed to pets or animals) was estimated when weighing was not possible. At the end of the survey, all remaining foods were again weighed and recorded. The number of household members and visitors were recorded at each meal.|$|E
