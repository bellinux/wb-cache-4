40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with estimation of heat and power consumption in a conceptual plant to produce hydrogen from sucrose-containing or <b>starchy</b> <b>biomass</b> by fermentation. A hydrogen plant connected with a sugar factory {{is regarded as the}} basic option; the sugar factory serves as a source of sucrose-containing thick juice for the hydrogen plant, where this feedstock is processed to hydrogen. As another option, a stand-alone hydrogen plant in which starch must initially be converted to fermentable glucose solution is considered. The values of key process parameters are assumed on the basis of preliminary experimental data. For both options of the hydrogen plant, heat consumption is estimated taking heat recovery in a heat exchanger network into account. Power consumption is estimated by calculating power needed for pumping of liquid and gaseous process media. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>starchy</b> <b>biomass</b> as an {{industrial}} raw material bring commercial success of amylases, which have potential industrial applications {{due to the}} ability to hydrolyze starch to glucose. The implementations of conventioanl method that employ sreening using one factor at a time usually give inaccurate optimum condition. Moreover,this method is time consuming. Thus,this paper aims to apply design of experiment as a tool to optimize reaction. In this work,the two-level full factorial design and response surface methodology with central composite design was used to identify and optimize the significant parameters. The experiments were conducted with the aid of Design Expert Software 7. 1. 6. The effect of pH, temperature,substrate concentration and enzyme concentration were studied. The result concluded that the optimized value for pH,temperature and substrate concentration were 8. 90, 40. 76 'C and 5. 46 % (w/v), respectively;with R 2 of 81. 86 %. The experimental design was proven to be tool for optimization process with less number of experiments and more accurate optimum value...|$|E
30|$|Second-generation {{biodiesel}} is {{made from}} non-food sources such as rice straw, wood residue, corncob, and sugarcane bagasse. Lignocellulosic hydrolysates from these feedstocks are composed mainly of glucose, xylose, and l-arabinose (hereafter referred to simply as arabinose) (Huang et al. 2009; Kumar et al. 2009; Madhavan et al. 2012; Roberto et al. 1995; Tsigie et al. 2011). The ratio of the sugars and their concentration in the hydrolysates {{vary depending on the}} feedstock used and pretreatment conditions (Behera et al. 2014; Kumar et al. 2009). A previous study investigated lipid accumulation using a medium containing 3  % glucose by Vanrija musci JCM 24512 (formally Cryptococcus musci) (Tanimura et al. 2014 b). The strain showed higher lipid-producing ability from glucose compared to typical oleaginous yeasts such as Lipomyces starkeyi and Rhodosporidium toruloides. Strains like this that can convert glucose to lipid with high productivity are well suited for the production of glucose-rich hydrolysate such as the hydrolysate of <b>starchy</b> <b>biomass.</b> However, because pentoses content ranged from 20 to 40  % of the total released sugars (Sumphanwanich et al. 2008; Tanimura et al. 2012), glucose utilization alone is insufficient for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. In other words, sequential utilization of the sugars extends fermentation times. Therefore, economically feasible production of lipid will require a yeast strain with the ability to co-ferment the lignocellulosic sugars.|$|E
40|$|Fuel ethanol (or) {{bioethanol}} {{production from}} biomass {{is one of}} the best ways to reduce the crude oil consumption and envionmental pollution. Production of bioethanol can be from starchy substances (e. g. corn, wheat, tapioca, etc.) and lignocellulosic biomass (e. g. agricultural waste, woody biomass, algae, municipal solid waste, etc.). One of the major problems in fuel ethanol production is the availability of raw materials. <b>Starchy</b> lignocellulosic <b>biomass</b> (SLC) such as canvas pulp, sago palm waste, banana peel waste, potato peel waste, residues from starch, food and brewery industries, and etc., are cost effective, renewable, and require less pretreatment. Any lignocellulosic biomass that contains certain proportion of starch in its chemical composition is called as <b>starchy</b> lignocellulosic (SLC) <b>biomass,</b> Besides, SLC biomass can be used to produce high yield ethanol compared to agriculture and woody biomass. The aim of this review is to summarize the existing processing technology for fuel ethanol production from <b>starchy</b> lignocellulosic <b>biomass,</b> analysing the steps involved in bioethanol processing and potential challenging issues and possible solutions to improve bioprocessing are also addressed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} pathway for biogas production {{consists in}} the anaerobic digestion of <b>starchy</b> and sugar <b>biomass</b> mainly from dedicated energy crops, needing agricultural land and heavy irrigation. A retrofitting {{of the existing}} biogas plants is proposed {{in order to reduce}} competition with food crops and to increase the sustainability of the whole chain in terms of land and water consumption; moreover the use of the lignocellulosic biomass is evaluated. The biomass after physical, chemical or biological pretreatment can be digested in a biogas plant to reduce the current diet without affecting the biogas production. The present study analyzes {{the state of the art}} in the lignocellulosic biomass feeding into biogas plants and describes a preliminary techno-economical study of the pathway and the layout to be adopted, including the efficiencies and energy yields of the involved processes...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{lignocellulosic}} biomass as {{the most}} abundant renewable resource has been widely considered for bioalcohols production. However, the complex structure of lignocelluloses requires a multi-step process which is costly and time consuming. Although, several bioprocessing approaches {{have been developed for}} pretreatment, saccharification and fermentation, bioalcohols production from lignocelluloses is still limited because of the economic infeasibility of these technologies. This cost constraint could be overcome by designing and constructing robust cellulolytic and bioalcohols producing microbes and by using them in a consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) system. This paper comprehensively reviews potentials, recent advances and challenges faced in CBP systems for efficient bioalcohols (ethanol and butanol) production from lignocellulosic and <b>starchy</b> <b>biomass.</b> The CBP strategies include using native single strains with cellulytic and alcohol production activities, microbial co-cultures containing both cellulytic and ethanologenic microorganisms, and genetic engineering of cellulytic microorganisms to be alcohol-producing or alcohol producing microorganisms to be cellulytic. Moreover, high-throughput techniques, such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, next generation sequencing and synthetic biology developed to explore novel microorganisms and powerful enzymes with high activity, thermostability and pH stability are also discussed. Currently, the CBP technology is in its infant stage, and ideal microorganisms and/or conditions at industrial scale are yet to be introduced. So, it is essential to bring into attention all barriers faced and take advantage of all the experiences gained to achieve a high-yield and low-cost CBP process...|$|E
40|$|Banana {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} fruit crops in the world. The plant bears one bunch in its life, leaving behind a large amount of agricultural residues (starchy and lignocellulosic biomass), which could be used for different purposes such as bioenergy. Ecuador is the largest exporter of banana fruits. In this work, the potential of banana residual biomass produced in the province of El Oro, Ecuador for bioenergy applications was assessed using Geographic Information Systems?GIS. The methodology included the assessment of biomass distribution, facility location, transport optimization and a novel virtual land parcel that allows for these kinds of studies in areas with lack of geo-referenced information. According to our approach, El Oro province has an available biomass potential of 190, 102 t fm year? 1 of starchy residual biomass and 198, 602 t dm year? 1 of lignocellulosic residual biomass. Two candidate points located at 79 ° 51 ? 12 ?W 3 ° 11 ? 21 ?S and 79 ° 52 ? 49 ?W 3 ° 17 ? 49 ?S were identified for the installment of energy conversion facilities supplied with residual biomass. From the available potential of <b>starchy</b> <b>biomass</b> it would be possible to obtain up to 19 million liters of bioethanol per year assuming an average yield of 101. 2 l t? 1 fresh matter; while the available lignocellulosic biomass, which energy content (Lower Heating Value, moisture free biomass) was determined at 12. 9 MJ kg? 1 on average, could be used for power generation with an installed capacity of 18 MW. Chemical characterization of the lignocellulosic biomass suggested that further studies should be undertaken regarding the potential application of these crop residues to second generation bioethanol...|$|E
40|$|Transportation fuels are {{the major}} driver for fossil fuel production, a burden that many {{countries}} have tried to ease by blending fossil fuels with biofuel substitutes such as ethanol. Current U. S. ethanol production relies on fermentation of <b>starchy</b> <b>biomass</b> (e. g., corn), which competes with food. Using lignocellulose avoids competition with food; however, {{it is difficult to}} digest using traditional batch saccharification. This work investigates countercurrent saccharification as an alternative that reduces enzyme requirements. Compared to baseline yields for standard batch saccharification, countercurrent saccharification reduces enzyme requirements by 5 to 37 times. Initial studies identified Solka-Floc as an acceptable substrate to represent treated biomass; it is readily available and reliably consistent from sample to sample. To measure yields, batch saccharifications were performed at various enzyme loadings and reaction times. Two relatively low enzyme concentrations were selected for further study: 2 and 5 mg protein/g biomass, or 2. 6 and 6. 4 mg protein/g glucan, respectively. Both of the selected loadings are below levels suggested for commercial use. For each enzyme loading tested, a multi-stage, semi-continuous countercurrent train was constructed. The first experiments used trains consisting of eight 1 -L bottles loaded with ?-cellulose, using the same concentrations as the batch experiments. Liquid and solid phases were countercurrently contacted, with transfers of each phase occurring every second day for approximately 4 ? 6 weeks, until steady-state operation was maintained for at least 10 days. At 2 and 5 mg/g enzyme loadings, total sugar yields reached 55. 9 % and 85. 3 %, respectively. A follow up study using 16 bottles and 2 mg/g loading produced total sugar yields of 73. 4 %. In the interest of future scale-up, alternatives to the cycloheximide and tetracycline antibiotic cocktail were investigated. Preliminary results suggest that chloroform or a volatile essential plant oil may be effective. Future work is needed to confirm the antimicrobial strength of these compounds at low concentrations, which is needed to limit enzyme inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} is one sustainable alternative {{to avoid the}} negative environmental effects often caused by conventional agriculture. BioConcens is an interdisciplinary project aims at developing new biorefinery concept and processes for co-production of bioethanol, biogas and animal feed based on resources from organic agriculture (clover grass, straw) and associated food processing (whey). Bioenergy produced in organic agriculture can reduce its dependency of fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse-gas emission, {{and at the same}} time it is important that carbon and nutrients cycle are not influenced negatively. Biogas can be produced from any carbon rich waste/by-product, which can be further utilized in combined heat and power plant to produce heat and electricity for organic farm. Bioethanol can be a substitute for gasoline, and the effluent from whey-based fermentations will be valuable product for organic animal production. Co-production of bioethanol and biogas would allow all the components of both plant biomass and animal manure to be used. In this study we have tested agriculture <b>starchy</b> and lignocellulosic <b>biomass</b> (rye grain, clover grass) and food processing by-product (whey permeate) originated from organic farming for combined bioethanol and biogas production. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExcessive {{consumption}} of fossil fuels, particularly in large urban areas, {{has resulted in}} generation of high levels of pollution {{during the last few}} decades. All petroleum-based fuels can be replaced by renewable biomass fuels such as bioethanol, bio-diesel, bio-hydrogen, etc. Bioethanol is an attractive alternative fuel because it is a renewable bio-based resource and it is oxygenated thereby provides the potential to reduce particulate emissions in compression ignition engines. It has a higher octane number, and lower cetane number, broader flammability limits, higher flame speeds and higher heats of vaporization than gasoline. The bioethanol can be produced from lignocellulosic <b>biomass,</b> <b>starchy</b> materials such as corn, wheat, cereals etc and sucrose containing feedstocks. Major portion of the production methods uses corn for the same, but since India being the second largest producer of wheat and there is availability of different varieties of wheat, we have selected wheat as a feedstock. After thorough review of extensive literature we finalized two enz ymes viz; glucoamylase and -amylase followed by fermentation process using bake yeast Saccharomyces Cerivisiae. Experiments were carried out to see the day wise decrease in concentration of glucose and increase in concentration of Ethanol by calculating the absorbance using Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. Results obtained were in agreement with the possibility of wheat {{to be used as a}} raw material for maximum yield of bioethanol...|$|R

It produces jet fuel from sugary, <b>starchy,</b> and lignocellulosic <b>biomass,</b> such as sugarcane, corn grain, and switchgrass, via fermentation of sugars to ethanol or other alcohols. This study assesses the ATJ biofuel production pathway for these three biomass feedstocks, and advances existing techno-economic analyses of biofuels in three ways. First, we incorporate technical uncertainty for all by-products and co-products though statistical linkages between conversion efficiencies and input and output levels. Second, future price uncertainty is based on case-by-case time-series estimation, and a local sensitivity analysis is conducted with respect to each uncertain variable. Third, breakeven price distributions are developed to communicate the inherent uncertainty in breakeven price. This research also considers uncertainties in utility input requirements, fuel and by-product outputs, as well as price uncertainties for all major inputs, products, and co-products. All analyses are done {{from the perspective of a}} private firm. Results The stochastic dominance results of net present values (NPV) and breakeven price distributions show that sugarcane is the lowest cost feedstock over the entire range of uncertainty with the least risks, followed by corn grain and switchgrass, with the mean breakeven jet fuel prices being $ 0. 96 /L ($ 3. 65 /gal), $ 1. 01 /L ($ 3. 84 /gal), and $ 1. 38 /L ($ 5. 21 /gal), respectively. The variation of revenues from by-products in corn grain pathway can significantly impact its profitability. Sensitivity analyses show that technical uncertainty significantly impacts breakeven price and NPV distributions. Conclusions Technical uncertainty is critical in determining the economic performance of the ATJ fuel pathway. Technical uncertainty needs to be considered in future economic analyses. The variation of revenues from by-products plays a significant role in profitability. With the distribution of breakeven prices, potential investors can apply whatever risk preferences they like to determine an appropriate bid or breakeven price that matches their risk profile.
