2500|$|Herbert E. Ives and Frank Gray of Bell Telephone Laboratories gave a {{dramatic}} demonstration of mechanical television on April 7, 1927. The reflected-light television system included both {{small and large}} viewing screens. The small receiver had a two-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24inches wide by 30inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets also received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a copper wire link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from Whippany, New Jersey. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. A flying-spot <b>scanner</b> <b>beam</b> illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved {{at a rate of}} 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 milliseconds. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: [...] "It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality." ...|$|E

As high accuracy in demanding and variable conditions is required, the sensitive sensors must be securely fastened. The most important goal is maintaining the exact respective position of the upper and lower measurement platforms in relation to their distance from each other, in MD and in CD [...] This is achieved through a robust construction and by reducing the effects of temperature and other environmental effects and through a moving mechanism with minimized backlash of the measurement platform.|$|E

If the web speed is 1200 m/min and web width 8.5 m, the web moves 280 m during a scan, and the sensor moves the same distance diagonally across the web. The measurements are taken on the diagonal line and act as basis for profile (machine and cross-direction) and variation calculations. This value is subject to integration depending on the machine speed. If the measurement signal sampling frequency is in size range 2000/s, then the smallest measurement element is about 0.2 cm in cross-direction.

40|$|Today laser {{scanning}} {{is used as}} a powerful technology in measuring various simple and complex objects in cultural heritage applications. Depending on the size and the complexity of the objects, these measurements are usually made from several stations. Similar to all other surveying techniques, the coordinate systems of such measurements need to be registered. For this, a number of retro-reflective targets visible from different stations are used. In practice, the target centres are entered in the computations. The accuracy of the target centres, therefore, need to be high or the final object coordinates might not be of sufficient accuracy. A number of factors including the distance between a target and the laser scanner, the direction of the target surface with respect to the laser <b>scanner</b> <b>beams,</b> the intensity and the number of reflected laser beams affect the accuracy of target centres. In this paper, various tests are carried out to examine the effect of such factors on the accuracy of coordinates obtained for the target centres.

40|$|Assessment of bone {{structural}} property changes due to loading regimens or pharmacological treatment typically requires destructive mechanical testing and sectioning. Our group has accurately and non-destructively estimated three dimensional cross-sectional areal properties (principal moments of inertia, Imax and Imin, and principal angle, Theta) of human cadaver long bones from pixel-by-pixel analysis of three non-coplanar densitometry scans. Because the <b>scanner</b> <b>beam</b> width {{is on the}} order of typical small animal diapbyseal diameters, applying this technique to high-resolution scans of rat long bones necessitates additional processing to minimize errors induced by beam smearing, such as dependence on sample orientation and overestimation of Imax and Imin. We hypothesized that these errors are correctable by digital image processing of the raw scan data. In all cases, four scans, using only the low energy data (Hologic QDR- 1000 W, small animal mode), are averaged to increase image signal-to-noise ratio. Raw scans are additionally processed by interpolation, deconvolution by a filter derived from <b>scanner</b> <b>beam</b> characteristics, and masking using a variable threshold based on image dynamic range. To assess accuracy, we scanned an aluminum step phantom at 12 orientations over a range of 180 deg about the longitudinal axis, in 15 deg increments. The phantom dimensions (2. 5, 3. 1, 3. 8 mm x 4. 4 mm; Imin/Imax: 0. 33 - 0. 74) were comparable to the dimensions of a rat femur which was also scanned. Cross-sectional properties were determined at 0. 25 mm increments {{along the length of the}} phantom and femur. The table shows average error (+/- SD) from theory of Imax, Imin, and Theta) over the 12 orientations, calculated from raw and fully processed phantom images, as well as standard deviations about the mean for the femur scans. Processing of phantom scans increased agreement with theory, indicating improved accuracy. Smaller standard deviations with processing indicate increased precision and repeatability. Standard deviations for the femur are consistent with those of the phantom. We conclude that in conjunction with digital image enhancement, densitometry scans are suitable for non-destructive determination of areal properties of small animal bones of comparable size to our phantom, allowing prediction of Imax and Imin within 2. 5 % and Theta within a fraction of a degree. This method represents a considerable extension of current methods of analyzing bone tissue distribution in small animal bones...|$|E
40|$|Line {{scanning}} {{cameras are}} used in photogrammetric applications to record images with a very high resolution and a field of view up to 360 ° horizontally. In order to generate 3 D information more than one image is required, which limits the flexibility at complex object geometries. On the other hand terrestrial laser scanner systems {{are used in}} numerous applications since some years as a versatile tool for recording 3 D geometry in terms of 3 D point clouds. For {{the analysis of the}} laser scanner data additional image information is often very useful for interactive modelling purposes and for automation of the analysis. Producers of terrestrial laser scanners therefore implement digital cameras to their laser scanner systems. This is mainly done by mounting a digital camera on the laser scanner. This approach requires an accurate orientation between both devices, and it makes the system bulky. Furthermore, the existence of occlusions due to different positions of camera and laser scanner is unavoidable. The paper presents an approach, which combines the advantages of both, reliable 3 D information of a laser scanner and high resolution image information of a panoramic camera in one single device. For this combination a concept of an opto-mechanical configuration was developed, where the laser <b>scanner</b> <b>beam</b> and the image information run through the same optical path. One important precondition is the use of a single silicon micro scanning mirror, which was courtesy of IPMS (Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Mikrosystems) for the investigations.

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this project is the design and the {{fabrication}} of a laboratory prototype of a Chirp-Laser-Radar for range scanning at a distance up to 100 m. One of the primary objectives is the use and the performance assessment of various optoelectronic components for the scan signal modulation and for the subsequent demodulation of the burst signal. The scanner employs a highly linear chirp pulse that is generated by a VCO driven by a direct digital synthesizer. The wide band modulation of the laser beam intensity is accomplished by means of direct current modulation of the laser diode or through an external beam modulation employing acousto-optical elements. The latter permits the modulation of several incoherently overlapped laser beams operating at different wavelengths (total bandwidth of 80 nm) without significant degradation of the <b>scanner</b> <b>beam</b> quality. This facilitates the attainment of high beam power that {{is necessary for the}} scanning of non-cooperative targets. Two different principles of signal demodulation were pursued during this project: a) optical and b) electronic signal analysis. An entirely optical signal processing uses an acousto-optical signal processor comprising several Bragg-cells. This processor exhibits two output channels. The burst resulting from the superposition of the reference and target signals is analyzed in the first channel as a time domain signal. The second output provides a stationary diffraction field that is analyzed by a CCD-camera. The chirp pulse length is 11 #mu#sec and the attained resolution is in the order of 5 x 10 "-" 4. The fully electronic signal processor analyzes the burst signal in the frequency domain and in the time domain. The chirp length here is 1 msec and the achieved resolution is 10 "-" 5. The range finder could be used in factory automation and in the construction industry. (orig.)

40|$|A new {{non-destructive}} methodology {{based on}} the experimental application of integrated use of 3 -D terrestrial laser scanning (3 -D TLS) and ultrasonic techniques in the range (54 - 82 kHz) in {{evaluating the quality of}} stone building materials in monumental structures has provided satisfactory results. In this paper our target is to evaluate the state of conservation of the previously described materials by correlating the ultrasonic measurement results with the reflectivity of the reflected 3 -D laser <b>scanner</b> <b>beam</b> pulse transmitted to the target of an investigated surface. Ultrasonic methods are very effective in detecting the elastic characteristics of stone materials and thus their mechanical behaviour even though data interpretation is very complex as elastic wave velocity depends on moisture, heterogeneity, porosity and other physical properties. The study of the propagation of the longitudinal ultrasonic pulses is improved from the digital signal processing which allows to obtain information from the wavetrains. Therefore accurate ultrasonic analyses based not only on longitudinal pulse velocity analysis but also on frequency spectra and cross-spectra analyses allowed to improve the results of the diagnostics in assessing and monitoring the status of the investigated materials. In a 3 D Terrestrial Laser Scanner the travelling time of coherent light laser pulse is converted into the distance between the instrument and the investigated object. The result of a laser scanning survey is a very dense cloud of points whose positions are known in a reference frame located in an arbitrary point inside the instrument. For each point of the surveyed target surface, the X, Y, Z coordinates and the reflectivity value are acquired and recorded, providing the area coverage necessary for the 3 -D reconstruction and characterisation of the surveyed structure. In general an interesting correlation between the spectral changes observed in the analysis of ultrasonic signals acquired in different sectors (damaged and intact) of the investigated monumental structure and those observed in the analysis of the 3 -D TLS reflectivity data acquired in the same sectors was found. The changes in spectral frequency composition of the ultrasonic and 3 -D TLS data seem to be related to changes in stone material properties, but the relationship between frequency composition and rock-properties is not early as definitive. Taking these results into account further digital processing procedures and analyses on the ultrasonic and 3 -D TLS data and their comparison with petrophysical aspects are now scheduled...|$|E
