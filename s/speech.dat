It was {{published}} by Johns Hopkins University Press in 2005. In it, Nelson discusses how the more general notion of free <b>speech</b> differs from that specifically applied to the First Amendment in American law.|$|E
5|$|Developmental verbal dyspraxia, {{also known}} as Childhood apraxia of <b>speech,</b> is a {{developmental}} motor <b>speech</b> disorder involving impairments in the motor control of <b>speech</b> production. The <b>speech</b> {{of a child with}} developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional <b>speech</b> therapy to improve <b>speech</b> production.|$|E

5|$|Jeremy Waldron {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The New York Review of Books, and was critical of Lewis' broad stance towards freedom of <b>speech</b> with respect to hate <b>speech.</b> Waldron later elaborated this position in his 2012 book The Harm in Hate <b>Speech,</b> in which he devoted an entire chapter to Lewis' book. Waldron emphasized that the problem with an expansive view of free <b>speech</b> is not the harm of hateful thoughts, but rather the negative impact resulting from widespread publication of the thoughts. He questioned whether children of racial groups criticized by widely published hate <b>speech</b> {{would be able to}} succeed in such an environment. Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens analyzed The Harm in Hate <b>Speech</b> and discussed Freedom for the Thought That We Hate, in a review for The New York Review of Books. Justice Stevens recounted Lewis' argument that an acceptance of hate <b>speech</b> is necessary, because attempts to regulate it would cause encroachment upon expression of controversial viewpoints. He pointed out that Lewis and Waldron agreed that Americans have more freedom of <b>speech</b> than citizens of any other country. In his review, Stevens cited the 2011 decision in Snyder v. Phelps as evidence {{that the majority of the}} U.S. Supreme Court supported the right of the people to express hateful views on matters of public importance. Stevens concluded that, although Waldron was unsuccessful in convincing him that legislators should ban all hate <b>speech,</b> The Harm in Hate <b>Speech</b> persuaded him that government leaders should refrain from using such language themselves.|$|E

Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the <b>speech</b> as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} <b>speech,</b> saying that the <b>speech</b> veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the <b>speech</b> as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the <b>speech</b> as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the <b>speech</b> as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E
