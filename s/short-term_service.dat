40|$|In {{this chapter}} we address the {{structural}} and institutional constraints faced by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) assisting Peruvian migrants in Chile {{to advocate for}} migrants’ rights. We argue that these constraints have provoked reactive rather than proactive strategic responses by NGOs in their promotion of migrants’ rights. In addition, the unchallenged acceptance of a traditional notion of citizenship has placed Chilean NGOs as <b>short-term</b> <b>service</b> providers rather than as long-term advocates. We propose that a conscious recognition of the possibilities opened up by international legal regimes to confront nation-states’ regulation of migrants’ rights offers a pragmatic approach to navigating such limits...|$|E

The analytical models are used to update the parameters of the demand process, which depend upon the current service level, and inventory control parameters. Simulation modelling allows for setting the safety factor at the level ensuring the required long-term service level. Combination of the simulation and analytical models in the runtime regime is vital for modelling the service-sensitive demand...|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 161 - 167). Resource sharing {{can be used}} as {{a short-term}} solution to the imbalance between the supply and demand of network resources. Resources sharing enables operators to provide services to their subscribers using networks belonging to other operators. Resource sharing in mobile networks is increasingly becoming an option for operators to provide service to their subscribers. In this thesis we explore a mechanism for sharing access network resources that utilises negotiable <b>short-term</b> <b>Service</b> Level Agreements (SLA) that can easily adapt to changing network conditions. Through this mechanism operators of resource constrained networks may use near real time dynamic SLAs to negotiate network access services for their subscribers. We refer to this form of resource sharing as 'Service Outsourcing'...|$|E
40|$|This thesis takes {{issue with}} current models of {{community}} engagement and service learning that do not {{take into consideration the}} constraints imposed upon graduate students or short-term instructors who teach a service learning course or who undertake community-oriented research. Bound up in the long history of academic needs overshadowing or entirely neglecting community concerns, campus-community partnerships involving graduate students {{are much more likely to}} maintain, to quote Linda Flower, a “naïve complicity in the social structures that put power and prestige on the university side of the ledger while putting passive need and incapacity on the debit, community side” (105). ^ While looking to approximate the work done by long-time scholars entrenched in their communities, this thesis also looks to the infrastructural model of a non-profit organization, College Possible, whose workforce is made up of recent college graduates and whose infrastructure allows it to get a lot out of these team members in a relatively short amount of time. By identifying the organization’s practices that allow it to keep community results and success at the forefront of their practices, and by sharing specific stories that ground these practices in lived experience, this thesis argues for a new practice of <b>short-term</b> <b>service</b> for graduate students that offers them the ability to engage in campus-community partnerships ethically, reflexively, and responsibly. ^ Finally, this thesis looks to a current First-Year Composition classroom taking part in an oral history partnership with a local retirement community. By triangulating the practices in this classroom with the practices of College Possible and the scholarship on service learning and community engagement, we can begin to see what such a model of graduate student-led <b>short-term</b> <b>service</b> would look like in action. This thesis ends by suggesting further areas of inquiry and study for future projects regarding graduate students and service learning or community engagement partnerships. ...|$|E

A utility based power and rate allocation algorithm which aims at optimizing system's performance while satisfying multiple services' diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements is introduced and analyzed. For the efficient support of real-time users our proposed methodology takes into account their short-term throughput QoS constraints satisfaction, which is achieved by dynamically adapting their utility functions with respect to their corresponding <b>short-term</b> <b>service</b> performance information. Through modelling and simulation it is demonstrated that significant performance improvements are achieved in terms of the short-term throughput requirement satisfaction even for large number of real-time users, without any considerable loss in the total system's throughput. © 2007 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{short-term}} robustness of production planning and control systems. This robustness is defined {{here as the}} system's ability to maintain <b>short-term</b> <b>service</b> probabilities (i. e., {{the probability that the}} fill rate remains within a prespecified range), in a variety of environments (scenarios). For this investigation, the paper introduces a heuristic, stagewise methodology that combines the techniques of discrete-event simulation, heuristic optimization, risk or uncertainty analysis, and bootstrapping. This methodology compares production control systems, subject to a short-term fill-rate constraint while minimizing long-term work-in-process (WIP). This provides a new tool for performance analysis in operations management. The methodology is illustrated via the example of a production line with four stations and a single product; it compares Kanban, Conwip, Hybrid, and Generic production control schemes.
