40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} perceptions held for the leadership styles of principals in native schools in Saskatchewan. In describing the leadership styles of principals in native schools, the writer sought principals' own perceptions, the perceptions of their subordinates and the perceptions of their <b>superordinates</b> using the "Situational Leadership Model" developed by Hersey and Blanchard (1982). The study was further designed to describe the leadership styles of principals as they varied according to the principals' demographic variables of training, experience, age and size of school. The population for the study consisted of all the principals, teachers and superintendents in the Saskatchewan native school system. Two questionnaires were utilized: (1) The demographic data sheet which collected information on respondents' training, experience, age, size of school and jurisdictional control, and (2) the Leader Effectiveness and Adaptability Description Questionnaire. The latter consisted of the Lead-Self and the Lead-Other. The Lead-Self gathered information on the principals' own perceptions, while the Lead-Other collected subordinates' and superordinates' perceptions. The findings indicated that responding principals perceived themselves as having a predominant style of Selling (S 2), while subordinates and <b>superordinates</b> perceived principals' predominant styles to be Selling (S 2) and Participating (S 3) respectively. That is, principals and subordinates perceived principals as employing a structured approach to leadership, while principals were perceived by <b>superordinates</b> as utilizing a more democratic approach to leadership. Principals saw themselves as having a limited "style-range" while subordinates and <b>superordinates</b> were consistent in ascribing a wide "style-range" to principals. With respect to demographic variables, principals' leadership styles did not vary markedly in respect to these variables. However, principals with less professional training were perceived to have a more structured style than those principals with more professional training. Regardless of administrative experience, principals saw themselves as having a limited "style-range. " Subordinates perceived younger principals to be more democratic in their decision-making process, while older principals were seen as more structured. In respect to size of school, <b>superordinates</b> perceived principals in smaller schools as having a more participative style, while principals, in larger schools were perceived as having a more structured style...|$|R

500|$|Furthermore, Whorf {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the allophone, a word that describes positional phonetic variants of a single <b>superordinate</b> phoneme; in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory. The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition. Whorf considered allophones to be another example of linguistic relativity. The principle of allophony describes how acoustically different sounds can be treated as reflections of a single phoneme in a language. This sometimes makes the different sound appear similar to native speakers of the language, even {{to the point that they}} are unable to distinguish them auditorily without special training. Whorf wrote that: [...] " [...] are also relativistic. Objectively, acoustically, and physiologically the allophones of [...] phoneme may be extremely unlike, hence the impossibility of determining what is what. You always have to keep the observer in the picture. What linguistic pattern makes like is like, and what it makes unlike is unlike".(Whorf, 1940) ...|$|E

Under the dynamic F-RAN environments, system agents try to maximize their own profits in a competitive or cooperative manner. In this study, we develop a new game model, called embedded game, for the F-RAN system. According to the decision making method, the embedded game procedure can be divided two phases. At the first phase, the CS and F-APs play a <b>superordinated</b> game; the CS distribute the available spectrum resource to each F-AP by using a cooperative manner. At the second phase, F-APs and MUs play subordinated games. By employing a non-cooperative manner, an individual F-AP selectively admits its corresponding MUs to provide different application services. Taken as a whole, multiple subordinated games are nested in the <b>superordinated</b> game.|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} the major {{division}} in leadership or management styles is a preference for either task or relationship orientation has long prevailed in the literature.

A large-scale evaluation of leadership in the Royal Air Force from the perspective of followers suggests that although there is some surface support for the task/relationship dichotomy, the more important division is threefold: between people who only look upwards to satisfy the demands of their <b>superordinates</b> (Orpheans), those that tend to focus downwards at the demands of their subordinates (Prometheans) and those that try to look both ways (Janusians).

In this study <b>superordinated</b> clusters of dyspnea were investigated in combination with a dimensional approach. Design: We examined the use of 20 respiratory symptom descriptors by healthy volunteers who completed a protocol of seven experimental conditions: Quiet breathing, breath holding, paced breathing, climbing stairs, resistive load breathing, voluntary hyperinflation, and voluntary hyperventilation. Main Outcome Measures: We analyzed the ratings of these descriptors with multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis. Results and Conclusion: While similarities with prior studies were found on a lower fusion level, we were able to demonstrate the usefulness of interpreting higher fusion levels with four clusters related to work of breathing, coordination, suffocation, and struggling for air, merging into two <b>superordinated</b> clusters, effort and air hunger that are compatible with widely accepted primary components of dyspnea. MDS results also suggested that future studies should consider further breathing sensations related to cognitive control of breathing. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{examples}} of a network model of semantic memory is the Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC). [...] In this model, each node is a word, representing a concept (like [...] "Bird"). With each node is stored a set of properties (like [...] "can fly" [...] or [...] "has wings") as well as pointers (i.e., links) to other nodes (like [...] "Chicken"). A node is directly linked to those nodes {{of which it is}} either a subclass or superclass (i.e., [...] "Bird" [...] would be connected to both [...] "Chicken" [...] and [...] "Animal"). Thus, TLC is a hierarchical knowledge representation in that high-level nodes representing large categories are connected (directly or indirectly, via the nodes of subclasses) to many instances of those categories, whereas nodes representing specific instances are at a lower level, connected only to their superclasses. Furthermore, properties are stored at the highest category level to which they apply. For example, [...] "is yellow" [...] would be stored with [...] "Canary", [...] "has wings" [...] would be stored with [...] "Bird" [...] (one level up), and [...] "can move" [...] would be stored with [...] "Animal" [...] (another level up). Nodes may also store negations of the properties of their <b>superordinate</b> nodes (i.e., [...] "NOT-can fly" [...] would be stored with [...] "penguin"). This provides an economy of representation in that properties are only stored at the category level at which they become essential, that is, at which point they become critical features (see below).|$|E
