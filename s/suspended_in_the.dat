5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CSF is {{equivalent}} to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E

Construction of the entire route was completed in 2006; further development entails new exits, new rest areas and the reconstruction of the existing motorway. The construction cost of the A3 motorway is estimated at 7 billionCroatian kuna (approximately 958.9 millioneuro).|$|E

5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E

Tatum's boyfriend, Stu Macher throws a party to celebrate the school's closure. The party is attended by Sidney, Tatum, their friend Randy Meeks, and multiple other students. Reporter Gale Weathers attends uninvited to cover the situation, as she expects the killer to strike. Tatum's brother deputy sheriff Dewey Riley also looks out for the murderer at the party. Tatum is killed during the party after having her head crushed by the garage door. Billy arrives to speak to Sidney privately, and the two ultimately consummate their relationship. Dewey and Gale investigate a nearby abandoned car. Many party attendees are drawn away after hearing news of Himbry's death; Sidney, Billy, Randy, Stu, and Gale's cameraman Kenny remain.|$|E

5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, O'Brien, by now in {{poor health}} as a {{consequence}} of alcohol abuse, sold his shares in the brewery to Joseph Segber, who appointed F. Vinnicomb to manage the company day-to-day. The sale of alcohol in the territory was <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autumn of 1919, full prohibition followed the next year, and the company ceased trading. Initially the premises were kept maintained, probably in case the company was able to reopen, but most of the equipment was sold off to a new brewery in Fairbanks in 1933. The buildings were soon dismantled, probably for firewood, and vegetation reclaimed the site. The rusting brewery steam boiler remained on the site, surrounded by mounds of used bottles, many of which were dug up and removed by collectors over subsequent years, leaving perhaps over 3,000 intact bottles still in place. The remains of a Perfection Bottling Machine and a Crown capping device were left buried beneath the debris.|$|E
5|$|On lap 43 of the race, Bianchi {{lost control}} {{of his car and}} veered right towards the run-off area {{on the outside of the}} Dunlop Curve (turn seven) of the Suzuka Circuit. He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had spun out of control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the roll bar destroyed as it slid under the tractor crane. The impact was such that the tractor crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air by the crane, to fall back to the ground. The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
30|$|The {{bigger the}} yield stress was, {{the better the}} slurry {{stability}} turned out to be, which could be interpreted from two aspects. On the one hand, the diameter range of bubbles that can steadily <b>suspend</b> <b>in</b> slurry increases with increasing yield stress, {{and there will be}} more bubbles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stable suspension system to prevent sedimentation of particles. On the other hand, particles can steadily <b>suspend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slurry only when the yield stress is greater than the settling stress, which makes it possible that the slurry possesses good stability.|$|R

5|$|On the {{edition of}} SmackDown! {{following}} The Great American Bash, Eddie Guerrero revealed the secret {{he had been}} keeping; he was Dominick's real father, not Rey Mysterio (was thought to be). At SummerSlam, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a ladder match, where {{the goal is to}} climb a ladder to retrieve an object that is <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. As per pre-match stipulations, Mysterio gained complete custody of Dominick. On the September 9 edition of SmackDown!, Guerrero defeated Mysterio in a steel cage match to end the feud. Guerrero then began a feud with Batista when Guerrero was given a title match at No Mercy. Guerrero, however, died unexpectedly of heart failure on November 13, 2005. In 2006 Guerrero was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Mysterio, his nephew Chavo Guerrero, and Chris Benoit.|$|E
5|$|The {{muscles and}} nerves are much simpler {{than those of}} most other animals, {{although}} more specialised than in other cnidarians, such as corals. Cells in the outer layer (epidermis) and the inner layer (gastrodermis) have microfilaments that group into contractile fibers. These fibers are not true muscles {{because they are not}} freely <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body cavity as they are in more developed animals. Longitudinal fibres are found in the tentacles and oral disc, and also within the mesenteries, where they can contract the whole length of the body. Circular fibers are found in the body wall and, in some species, around the oral disc, allowing the animal to retract its tentacles into a protective sphincter.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Bianchi {{collided}} with {{the rear of the}} tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its roll bar was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (<b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air by the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database—which sources information from racing accidents worldwide—indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123km/h (76mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather; Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15km (9.3mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 2014, Rob Edwards was {{appointed}} {{as the new}} manager replacing Ronnie Moore, who was <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of February 2014 for breaching FA rules. The summer transfer window saw twelve players join the club, including experienced striker Kayode Odejayi while Ryan Lowe left the club shortly after being handed the Player of the Season award. Edwards was sacked after just five months following the home loss to Plymouth Argyle which saw Tranmere Rovers {{at the bottom of}} League Two. Three days later Micky Adams was announced as new manager. A brief improvement in results which saw Tranmere reach the Third Round of the FA Cup and move out of the relegation zone was followed by disastrous spring form resulting in Adams leaving Tranmere by mutual consent two games {{before the end of the}} season, with the club again bottom of the table. Assistant manager Alan Rogers took charge, but on 25 April Tranmere was defeated at Plymouth Argyle which confirmed Rovers' relegation to the National League one round prior to the end of the season. Thus, Tranmere Rovers' ninety-four-year presence in the Football League had ended.|$|E
5|$|On February 18, WWE {{announced}} via {{its website}} that the fourth annual Money in the Bank ladder match {{would take place}} at WrestleMania XXIV, a match where {{the objective is to}} retrieve a briefcase <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air using a ladder. The match involved wrestlers from all three WWE brands. The winner would earn a contract to challenge for any of the three WWE World Championships (the WWE Championship of Raw, the World Heavyweight Championship of SmackDown, or the ECW Championship of ECW) at any time and any place over a one-year period. Qualifying matches occurred to determine the participants in the match at WrestleMania, starting on that night's Raw with Jeff Hardy and Mr. Kennedy defeating Snitsky and Val Venis respectively to qualify. Shelton Benjamin became the third participant when he defeated Jimmy Wang Yang on the following episode of SmackDown. During the next two weeks on Raw, Chris Jericho defeated Jeff Hardy, and Carlito defeated Cody Rhodes to qualify. At a non-televised SmackDown/ECW house show held on March 8, Montel Vontavious Porter qualified when he defeated Jamie Noble. On the March 11 episode of ECW, CM Punk became the seventh entrant when he defeated Big Daddy V. John Morrison was the final person to qualify when he beat The Miz on the March 14 episode of SmackDown. Jeff Hardy was later removed from the match after a legitimate suspension by WWE for a drug violation of the company's Wellness Policy. WWE decided not to add another superstar in his place, making that year's Money in the Bank ladder match the first year to have seven participants.|$|E
