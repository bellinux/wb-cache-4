50|$|Most {{animal manure}} {{consists}} of feces. Common forms of animal manure include farmyard manure (FYM) or farm slurry (liquid manure). FYM also contains plant material (often straw), {{which has been}} used as bedding for animals and has absorbed the feces and urine. Agricultural manure in liquid form, known as slurry, is produced by more intensive livestock rearing systems where concrete or slats are used, instead of straw bedding. Manure from different animals has different qualities and requires different application rates when used as fertilizer. For example horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, and guano from seabirds and bats all have different properties. For instance, <b>sheep</b> <b>manure</b> is high in nitrogen and potash, while pig manure is relatively low in both. Horses mainly eat grass and a few weeds so horse manure can contain grass and weed seeds, as horses do not digest seeds the way that cattle do. Chicken litter, coming from a bird, is very concentrated in nitrogen and phosphate and is prized for both properties.|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of intensive livestock industry has greatly increased {{the discharge of}} animal manure. Reasonable utilization of large amounts of phosphorus(P) in animal manure can not only save the fertilizer resource, but also avoid water pollution from manure due to direct discharge or excess application in farmland. In this study, P contents and fractionation in 76 animal manures were analyzed using Hedley P fractionation method based on the survey for 52 livestock farms, and P mobility and environmental risks in different manures were evaluated as the reference for manure P management. The results showed that {{there were significant differences}} in total P content of animal manures. The mean P contents were 22. 5, 13. 7, 12. 9, 9. 6 g P·kg- 1 and 7. 5 g P·kg- 1, in which the proportion of organic P in total P were 33. 1 %, 41. 5 %, 66. 4 %, 28. 1 %and 36. 8 %in pig, chicken, duck, cattle and <b>sheep</b> <b>manures,</b> respectively. The contents of total and organic P in non-ruminant animal manure(pig, chicken and duck manures) were 1. 7 ~ 3. 0 times and 2. 1 ~ 3. 0 times greater than that in ruminant <b>manure</b> (cattle and <b>sheep</b> <b>manures)</b> and the proportion of organic P in total P in poultry manure was higher than that in other manures. P mineraliza-tion was easier in non-ruminant animal manure with lower C/P ratio(19 ~ 29), compared with that in ruminant manure with C/P ratio of 38 ~ 45. Manure P was sequentially extracted by deionized water(H 2 O-P), NaHCO 3 (NaHCO 3 -P), NaOH(NaOH-P) and HCl(HCl-P). The pro-portion of H 2 O-P, NaHCO 3 -P, NaOH-P, HCl-P and residual-P in total P in ruminant animal manure were 27. 8 %, 32. 8 %, 18. 1 %, 15. 2 %and 6. 1 %, respectively, while that were 24. 6 %, 19. 4 %, 12. 7 %, 34. 4 % and 8. 9 % in non-ruminant animal manure. The significant differences were in NaHCO 3 -P and HCl-P between ruminant and non-ruminant animal manures. Ruminant manure had greater proportion of liable P (H 2 O-P and NaHCO 3 -P) in total P(> 60 %), but the characteristics of higher mineralization rate might result in fast release of liable P in nonruminant animal manure. Both ruminant and non-ruminant animals have high availability of P in manures. Therefore, the contribution of long-term application non-ruminant animal manure to environmental risk is similar to application of ruminant animal manure with applica-tion of the same amount of P.

Both the experiments were carried out on small land farmer field at District Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (Northwest Pakistan) during summer 2015. The results revealed that in both experiments the control plot had significantly (p≤ 0. 05) less productivity than the average of all treated plots with organic sources and P level. The increase in P levels in both experiments (animal manure vs. plant residues) had resulted in higher rice productivity (90 = 60 > 30 > 0 kg P ha- 1).

Two organic waste materials (pine bark compost and <b>sheep</b> and horse <b>manure</b> compost), with different pHs and varying degrees of humification and nutrient contents, were applied as amendments to assess their effects on copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) bioavailability and on fertility conditions of mine soils. Soil samples collected from two abandoned mining areas near Madrid (Spain) were mixed with 0, 30 and 60 t ha? 1 of the organic amendments. The concentrations of metals among the different mineral and organic fractions of soil were determined by several extraction procedures to study the metal distribution in the solid phase of the soil affected by the organic amendments. The results showed that the manure amendment increased the soil pH and the cation exchange capacity and enhanced the nutrient levels of these soils. The pine bark amendment decreased the soil pH and did not significantly change the nutrient status of soil. Soil pH, organic matter content and its degree of humification, which were altered by the amendments, were the main factors affecting Cu fractionation. Zn fractionation was mainly affected by soil pH. The addition of manure not only improved soil fertility, but also decreased metal bioavailability resulting in a reduction of metal toxicity.

Treatments with DAP (T 3, T 4 and T 5) showed better development of the leaf area (231. 50 cm 2, 221. 30 cm 2 and 231. 80 cm 2 respectively), increased the number of leaves (9. 67, 9. 83 and 10. 17 per plant respectively), the plant height (270. 80 cm, 266. 70 cm and 271. 70 cm respectively), the number of pods (11. 17, 11. 33 and 13. 33 per plant), the pod weight (10. 68, 10. 98 and 12. 11 g plant- 1) and the total pod yield (2. 44 tha- 1, 2. 51 tha- 1 and 3. 31 tha- 1 respectively). Agronomic efficiency (AE) was the highest in Andisol (5. 17 kg of snap bean pod yield per kg nitrogen applied) and in pots that received <b>sheep</b> <b>manure</b> combined with DAP (6. 52 kg of snap bean pod yield per kg nitrogen applied). Conclusion: Use of <b>sheep</b> <b>manure</b> and DAP could be a potential option for fertilisation of snap bean in Northern Rwanda...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to evaluate the effect of <b>sheep</b> <b>manure</b> {{on the development of}} coffee leaf rust under greenhouse conditions. The seedlings of coffee cv. Mundo Novo were obtained from a nursery planted in washed sand and transplanted at the stage of "orelha de onça" to 5 -liter plastic containers containing different substrates. The substrate was obtained by mixing a Dark Red Dystroferric Latosol with 2 kg of calcareous, 5 kg of simple superphosphate and 0. 5 kg of potassium chloride per m 3. Composted <b>sheep</b> <b>manure</b> was added to the mixture in the concentrations of 0; 2. 5; 5; 7. 5; 10; 15; 20; 30; 40; and 50 % (v/v). The plants were inoculated three times, with a suspension (2 mg mL - 1) of urediniospores of Hemileia vastatrix race II, in 90 days intervals. The parameters evaluated were the number of lesions per injuried leaf (NL/IL), % of infected leaves (%IL), height of the plants, total foliar nitrogen, pH, electric conductivity (EC), total microbial activity in the substrate by hydrolyses of fluorescein diacetate and lesions sporulation (LS). For the NL/IL and %IL, the response to the incorporation of <b>sheep</b> <b>manure</b> in the substrate was quadratic, reaching its maximum at 30 %, for the three inoculations of urediniospores of H. vastatrix. The coefficients of determination of the quadratic curves for the NL/IL were 0. 86; 0. 88 and 0. 94 for the first one, the second and third inoculation, respectively; while that for the %FL were 0. 70; 0. 26 and 0. 86, respectively. The maximum increases in the NL/IL in relation to the control were 263. 2; 400 and 157. 3 %, respectively, for the first, the second and third inoculations. Also for the height of the plants the curve of quadratic response was adjusted, with a maximum peak up at 10 %. The increase in the concentration of <b>sheep</b> <b>manure</b> resulted in a significant and linear increase in the total foliar nitrogen, in pH and the EC of the substrate, with R 2 =O. 87; 0. 92 and 0. 76, respectively. <b>Sheep</b> <b>manure</b> in the studied concentrations did not induce resistance to the coffee leaf rust. 200...|$|E
40|$|In agopastoral {{systems of}} the semi arid West African Sahel, {{targeted}} applications of ruminant manure to the cropland is a widespread practice to maintain soil productivity. However, studies exploring the decomposition and mineralisation processes of manure under farmers' conditions are scarce. The present research in south west Niger was undertaken to examine the role of micro organisms and meso fauna on in situ release rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) from cattle and <b>sheep</b> goat <b>manure</b> collected from village corrals {{during the rainy season}}. The results show that (1) macro organisms played a dominant role in the initial phase of manure decomposition; (2) manure decomposition was faster on crusteb than on sandy soils; (3) throughout the study N and P release rates closely followed the dry matter decomposition; (4) during the first 6 weeks after application, the K concentration in the manure declined much faster than N or P At the applied dry matter rate of 18. 8 Mg ha t, the quantities of N, P and K released from the manure during the rainy season were up to 10 fold larger than the annual nutrient uptake of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), the dominant crop in the traditional agro pastoral systems. The results indicate considerable nutrient losses with the scarce but heavy rainfalls which could be alleviated by smaller rates of manure application. Those, however, would require a more labour intensive system of corralling or manure distribution...|$|R
30|$|In {{a second}} {{solution}} of 15  µg C ml− 1 and pH 7.5, absorptions at 280, 253 and 203  nm were measured. The ratio between absorptions at 253 and 203  nm (Korshin et al. 1997) was then calculated (henceforth, E BTZ ratio). In {{addition to the}} E BTZ ratio, the E 253 /E 220 ratio (Fuentes et al. 2006) was also applied to the obtained humic fractions. The latter is the ratio between absorptions at 253 and 220  nm, and it was proposed {{as an alternative to}} the former, because the absorption at 203  nm may be affected by the presence of nitrate, which absorbs also at this wavelength. However in our work, the original E BTZ ratio (253 / 203) gave more consistent results and allowed detecting more differences between the humic fractions depending on their origin (<b>sheep</b> or cow <b>manure).</b> Thus, only the results for the E BTZ ratio will be shown here.|$|R
40|$|Mixed farming systems {{constitute}} {{a large proportion}} of agricultural production in the tropics, and provide multiple benefits for the world’s poor. However, our understanding of the functioning of these systems is limited. Modeling offers the best approach to quantify outcomes from many interacting causal variables in these systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an integrated crop–livestock model to assess biophysical and economic consequences of farming practices exhibited in sheep systems of Yucatán state, Mexico. A Vensim™ dynamic stock-flow feedback model was developed to integrate scientific and practical knowledge of management, flock dynamics, sheep production, partitioning of nutrients, labor, and economic components. The model accesses <b>sheep</b> production and <b>manure</b> quantity and quality data generated using the Small Ruminant Nutrition System (SRNS), and interfaces on a daily basis with an Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model that simulates weather, crop, and soil dynamics. Model evaluation indicated that the integrated model adequately represents the complex interactions that occur between farmers, crops, and livestock...|$|R
