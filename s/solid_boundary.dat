In this method complex geometries are embedded on a computational grid, which usually does not conform {{to the shape of}} the geometries.

As compared to methods using a body-fitted grid, the advantages of the IBM are the computational efficiency (in particular when using a simple Cartesian grid), the ability to represent moving obstacles without the need for regridding and the relative ease of programming. However, disadvantages of the IBM are that it requires typically more grid points to represent the flow near <b>solid</b> <b>boundaries</b> and there may be non-zero slip and penetration velocities across <b>solid</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Process and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Currently, Eulerian flow solvers {{are very}} {{efficient}} in accurately resolving flow structures near <b>solid</b> <b>boundaries.</b> On the other hand, {{they tend to}} be diffusive and to dampen high-intensity vortical structures after a short distance away from <b>solid</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The use of high order methods and fine grids, although alleviating this problem, gives rise to large systems of equations that are expensive to solve. Lagrangian solvers, as the regularized vortex particle method, have shown to eliminate (in practice) the diffusion in the wake. As a drawback, the modelling of <b>solid</b> <b>boundaries</b> is less accurate, more complex and costly than with Eulerian solvers (due to the isotropy of its computational elements). Given the drawbacks and advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers the combination of both methods, giving rise to a hybrid solver, is advantageous. The main idea behind the hybrid solver presented is the following. In a region close to <b>solid</b> <b>boundaries</b> the flow is solved with an Eulerian solver, where the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved (possibly with an arbitrary turbulence model or DNS, the limitations being the computational power and the physical properties of the flow), outside of that region the flow is solved with a vortex particle method. In this work we present this hybrid scheme and verify it numerically on known 2 D benchmark cases: dipole flow, flow around a cylinder and flow around a stalled airfoil. The success in modelling these flow conditions presents this hybrid approach as a promising alternative, bridging the gap between highly resolved and computationally intensive Eulerian CFD simulations and fast but less resolved Lagrangian simulations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a model for micro gas flows {{consisting}} of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations (NSF) extended by a description of molecular collisions with <b>solid</b> <b>boundaries</b> and discontinuous velocity slip and temperature jump boundary conditions. By considering the molecular collisions with the <b>solid</b> <b>boundaries</b> in gas flows we capture some of the near wall effects that the conventional NSF with linear stress/strain-rate and heat-flux/ temperature-gradient relationships seem to be unable to describe. The model that we propose incorporates the molecular collisions with <b>solid</b> <b>boundaries</b> as an extension to the conventional definition of the average travelling distance of molecules before experiencing intermolecular collisions (the mean free path). By considering both of these types of collisions we obtain an effective mean free path expression, which varies with distance to surfaces. The effective mean free path is proposed to be used to obtain new definitions of effective viscosity and effective thermal conductivity, which will extend the applicability of NSF equations to higher Knudsen numbers. We show results of simple flow cases that are solved using this extended NSF model and discuss limitations to the model due to various assumptions.

50|$|In fluid dynamics, the Taylor-Couette flow {{consists}} of a viscous fluid confined in the gap between two rotating cylinders. For low angular velocities, measured by the Reynolds number Re, the flow is steady and purely azimuthal. This basic state is known as circular Couette flow, after Maurice Marie Alfred Couette who used this experimental device {{as a means to}} measure viscosity. Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor investigated the stability of Couette flow in a ground-breaking paper. Taylor's paper became a cornerstone in the development of hydrodynamic stability theory and demonstrated that the no-slip condition, which was in dispute by the scientific community at the time, was the correct boundary condition for viscous flows at a <b>solid</b> <b>boundary.</b>|$|E
