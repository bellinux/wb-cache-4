40|$|The aim of my “two years master thesis” was {{to examine}} <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> {{perceptions}} about important information literacy skills that the students {{should be able to}} control, perceptions about what role the teachers and the librarians have in teaching students information literacy and perceptions about the collaboration between these groups. My questions have been: Have the <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> reflected upon the conception of information literacy? What conceptions do <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> have about important information literacy skills that the students should be able to control? What role do they consider the teachers and the librarians to have in making all students information literate? How do they consider the collaboration between the teachers and the librarians work? What role do they consider themselves to have on a management level to make all students’ information literate? I used a phenomenographical method and carried out six qualitative interviews with <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> from five senior high schools in the municipality of Gävle. Both public schools and independent schools were included in the study.   Most of the <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> considered information literacy to be the same as criticism of sources, which they also considered {{as one of the most}} important information literacy skills. Only one of the <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> thought that information literacy is about arranging the information. All of the <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> thought that the teachers have the main responsibility for the education in information literacy. The  librarians were by the <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> considered not to be used at their full potential and the perceptions about the librarians tasks was that they were to be a guidance in databases, tempt students in to reading by talking about books and ask students critical questions through the information literacy process. The <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> thought that the collaboration between the teachers and the librarians was satisfying. All of the <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> thought that they should provide the right conditions for collaboration between the groups, but that the <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> should not run the project. One of the reasons why the <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> in my essay focused on criticism of the sources and not on the arranging of information can be due to that information literacy is vaguely described in the school curriculum. A conclusion in the study is that the <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> have insufficient knowledge and insight in how the collaboration between the teachers and the librarians work and that the <b>school</b> <b>administrators</b> do not allocate enough time for the teachers and librarians to collaborate...|$|R
