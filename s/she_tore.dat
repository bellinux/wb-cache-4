25|$|All the {{characters}} immediately feel awe for Aslan. Jadis expresses this as fear and hatred, and before fleeing she assaults Aslan {{with an iron}} bar that <b>she</b> <b>tore</b> from a lamp-post in London. Aslan is unperturbed and continues calling plants and animals into existence. The power of his song {{is so great that}} even the iron bar, dropped on fertile earth, grows into a functioning lamp post, and toffees sprout into fruit trees. Aslan claims the power of his song will last for a few days.|$|E

Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News, believed Selena [...] "conquered the Latin pop landscape", while Herón Márquez called it a [...] "landmark success". In a November 1994 Billboard issue, it was named, among other Latin recordings, as an example to show that American Latinos were able to sell albums in English-speaking markets across the US that had historically overlooked Latin music. According to Gisela Orozco of the Chicago Tribune, Selena became the most successful Tejano musician following the release of Amor Prohibido. During the 25th anniversary of the D.C.

2500|$|Whistler's arresting 1858 {{portrait}} of Fumette, his lover at the time, reflects {{not only his}} aversion to sentimentality in painting but also the character of Fumette herself, who was a rather unusual grisette. Although Whistler had dubbed her 'Fumette' in imitation of 'Musette', a character in Scènes de la vie de Bohème, her real name was Eloise. A milliner's assistant, artist's model and reciter of poetry, she was known throughout the Latin Quarter as [...] "the tigress" [...] (la tigresse) for her raging voice and dangerous temper.

It was when Wilberforce roused the church of God, and when the church of God addressed herself to the conflict, then <b>she</b> <b>tore</b> the evil thing to pieces. I have been amused with what Wilberforce said the day after they passed the Act of Emancipation. He merrily said to a friend {{when it was all}} done, [...] "Is there not something else we can abolish?" [...] That was said playfully, but it shows the spirit of the church of God. She lives in conflict and victory; her mission is to destroy everything that is bad in the land.|$|E

And there, in an Indian shawl and a pale-green crape bonnet--there, fresh, portly, blithe, and pleasant--there stood Madame Beck.|$|R
50|$|Left alone, Rosmonda {{is found}} by Enrico. He {{attempts}} {{to win her}} over by informing her that the Councillors have agreed to their marriage.
