50|$|The 'Mister Softee' Ice Cream Van (428) was {{introduced}} in March 1962 and {{was based on a}} Commer BF 1 ton van and which featured a plastic knob on the underside that allowed the ice cream salesman inside to be rotated. It also featured a <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>window.</b> In 1965 a Thames Wall's Ice Cream Van (447) {{was introduced}}. This was a smaller vehicle based on the Thames 5 cwt van, a commercial version of the Ford Anglia, and the bodywork featured a pointed roof design and a <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>window.</b> The model also came with a sheet of stickers which could be applied and also included were models of an ice cream vendor and small boy. An alternative version (474) with musical chimes operated by a handle protruding {{from the back of the}} model was introduced a year later, but without the plastic figures. A Karrier Bantam-based Mobile Butchers Shop (413) was released in October 1960 and was later updated to become a Chipperfield's Circus Booking Office (426) in January 1962 and with the addition of an opening side hatch, a detailed kitchen interior and revolving chef it was re-issued in March 1965 as Joe's Diner Mobile Canteen (471). An export version to be sold in Belgium featured 'Patates Frites' stickers on the side in place of the usual 'Joe's Diner'.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the lines}} ran on or {{alongside}} roads {{it was decided}} to design the locomotives as tramway or 'box' locomotives (Kastenlokomotive). They had a fully glazed, box body and the drive was covered to reduce the risk to passers-by or horses. In order to enable the engine driver to see the line there was a <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>window.</b> The driver himself stood to one side next to the boiler. The water tank was integrated into the rivetted plate frame. The filling points were on the front wall the left and right of the smokebox. Coal was stored behind the outer firebox on the footplate. As a result, the engines could only be laboriously coaled using baskets.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1972, began {{production}} of the first production series ZiU-682B (with designation change ZiU ZiU -9 -682 {{was due to the}} labeling requirements of bringing industry classifier). First serial trolley cars differed from later releases. Until 1974, had an angular wheel arches, and not circular. The first batch of trolleybuses raised outdated engine DC-207G, which in 1973 was replaced by the DC-210 110 kW. Suspension on the first ZiU-682B was pneumatic, with torque rods as guiding elements, later became pnevmoressornoy. Rear funded playground had a reduced level of the floor, which reduced the number of steps one at the back door and to facilitate loading wheelchairs and prams and large items. However, this [...] "advantage" [...] was leveled by a high handrail on the steps of separating the rear and middle doors. Transition from high floor in the cabin to lower smoothly carried out in the aisle between the rear wheel arches, which caused inconvenience to passengers at peak hours (especially in winter), standing on an icy downhill [...] "hill." [...] In 1991, developers have replaced high-speed separator handrail attached to the door, but by this time all storage sites were at three stages from sidewalk level. For natural ventilation the roof of the cabin was equipped with four ceiling hatches, each equipped with a <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> pane. Currently, the only instance of ZIU-9B is preserved and operated in the linear regime in the city of Zaporozhye and has the side number 562.|$|E

50|$|Scout 80s {{were built}} between 1960 and 1965. These models were {{identifiable}} by removable <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> in 1960-1961 {{and even some}} very early 1962 models, a fold-down windshield, vacuum windshield wipers mounted {{to the top of}} the windshield and an IH logo in the center of the grille. The Scout 80 had the gasoline-powered 152 four-cylinder as its standard engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} version used {{upper and lower}} square-section steel frames, clad with glass fibre panels and large flat glass windows. On most models <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> acted as doors. It used {{the front and rear}} sub frames and mechanical components from the British Leyland Mini, Metro or BMC1100/1300. The Hustler came in four and six wheel versions: the six wheel version used two Mini rear sub frame assemblies. The style was very much off-road/utility in the rectilinear idiom of the Lagonda and Bulldog.|$|R
50|$|This van was {{produced}} in New Zealand by Todd Motors at their Petone Factory. It was last produced in 1974 in their secondary body factory {{on the other side}} to the railway tracks from the main car assembly plant. They produced a standard panel van, a mini bus body with <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> and cab and chassis models. The seats for the mini bus were produced by other coach builders. They used the high compression steel head motors; not the alloy head Hillman Hunter units.|$|R
5000|$|The Dyna Junior was {{characterized}} by simple lines and few frills. Exterior decoration {{was limited to the}} grille inherited from the Dyna X. The car had exposed hinges on the trailing edge of the two passenger doors that opened [...] "Suicide"-style. There were no external door handles, so opening the door required reaching in through the <b>sliding</b> plastic <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> to reach the interior latch. There was likewise no external trunk lid, with the rear storage compartment accessed by folding down the backrest of the two-place bench-seat. The interior was spartan, with a single centre-mounted dial for the speedometer and a gearshift lever sprouting from the dashboard as in the Dyna X.|$|R
50|$|Chrysler Australia {{launched}} {{the first generation}} in April/May 1979 as the MA series Chrysler D-50. Initially, two pickup versions were sold, the Commercial with the 1.6-liter Saturn (4G32) engine and the higher specification Recreational with the 2.0-liter Astron (4G52) engine. Commercials received the three-speed column-shift manual, with the floor-mounted four-speed transmission and taller axle ratio for the Recreational. Commercials were specified with heavy duty suspension rated for 1000 kg payloads; the Recreational version carries a 500 kg load. The reason for the halved payload {{was due to the}} sedan-type suspension of softer springs and more supple shock absorbers. The Recreational model also featured radial ply tires, electronic ignition, bucket seats, pile carpet, radio, floor console, sports steering wheel and an adjustable steering column as standard. An optional sports stripe package was also available. Options included a weather-tight, fibreglass canopy with foam rubber mattress. This was manufactured by Challenge Industries and incorporated <b>sliding</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows.</b> Later in 1979, a cab chassis body variant of the Commercial was released. In March 1980, the D-50 was renamed Chrysler L200 Express to form linkage with the newly released L300 Express vans. In October 1980, the Chrysler labelling made way for Mitsubishi badges following the establishment of Mitsubishi Motors Australia from Chrysler Australia's old operations. In June 1981, Mitsubishi released 4WD versions of the pickup and cab chassis, both with the 2.0-liter motor. Free-wheeling hubs to reduce noise and fuel use in 2WD mode were optional. In late 1981, the 2.0-liter with five-speed manual was made optional for the 2WD one-tonne suspension models.|$|R

5000|$|The GM Truck and Coach PD-4103 was {{the last}} {{in a series of}} low-budget [...] "conversion" [...] parlor coach models which were, in actuality, based upon the basic Yellow Coach/GM Truck and Coach transit bus models which first {{appeared}} in 1940. Favored GM customer Greyhound Lines had already been given a near monopoly on the PDA-3701/PD-3751 [...] "Old Silversides" [...] models, which were in part designed by Greyhound themselves. In order to answer complaints from arch competitor Trailways and other independent operators about being locked out from purchasing the PD-3751 model, GM simply took their existing 96" [...] wide, 35' long suburban transit model, added more luggage bay space underneath, added <b>sliding</b> highway-style <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> added reclining seating, and shortened the overhung portion of the front end by moving the front axle forward using a new front end from the wartime Yellow Coach [...] "Victory Cruiser" [...] model. This was the PD-4101, which appeared shortly after the end of World War II. GM created the model PD-4102 by restyling its PD-4101 in 1950 using a distinctive new front end with the destination sign below the windshield and a new, restyled rear end which used a full-width engine access door, an aluminum alloy bumper to match that on the front and a [...] "post-less" [...] picture window in the rear which used biradial curved glass (a new development by GM supplier, Libbey-Owens-Ford), replacing the divided flat transit bus-type rear windows found on the PD-4101. The front end styling job on the PD-4102 was reactionary, as it closely mimicked the striking styling of the IC41 intercity bus built by ACF-Brill Corporation in 1947-1954, a model bought in large quantities by Trailways to compete with Greyhound Lines' successful and much more efficient PD-3701/PD-3751 [...] "Silversides" [...] models. Mechanically and electrically, however, the PD-4102 was mostly a carry-over model from the PD-4101, including the optional refrigeration unit for air conditioning which used a four cylinder Continental [...] "pony motor" [...] driving an Ingersoll-Rand [...] "oil-less" [...] rotary vane compressor rated at five tons, a unit identical to that used by the PDA-3501/PD-3751 for Greyhound Lines. Only 116 were built.|$|R

50|$|There were {{numerous}} differences between 6170 {{and the other}} rebuilt Scots. 6170's boiler was longer {{and it had a}} new cab with <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> whereas the other rebuilt Scots retained their old cut-out cabs (the rebuilt Jubilees retained their original <b>side</b> <b>window</b> cabs and the rebuilt Patriots gained new <b>side</b> <b>window</b> cabs). It was the only rebuilt Scot built with a single chimney. Changes during its lifetime saw the fitting of a double chimney and smoke deflectors.|$|R

50|$|The present-day {{standard}} wagon for moisture-susceptible palletised goods has <b>sliding</b> <b>sides</b> rather than fixed side walls, which enables {{access to the}} entire loading area for loading and unloading. These wagons with <b>sliding</b> walls or <b>sides</b> did not evolve from the original covered wagon, but were derived in the 1950s from wagons with <b>sliding</b> roofs and <b>sides,</b> {{which is why they}} used to be grouped in Class K.|$|R
40|$|Flow {{over an open}} <b>side</b> <b>window</b> in a car {{exhibits}} similar {{characteristics as}} the flow over an open cavity. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation over a cavity was done as a benchmark. The unsteady flow simulation was carried out using Scale Adaptive Simulation (SAS) turbulence model. The benchmark results, frequency and sound pressure levels of feedback and resonance modes, all well matched with the experimental data. Then, with the right rear window, for example, the mechanism of the <b>side</b> <b>window</b> buffeting was investigated. The simulation results show that <b>side</b> <b>window</b> buffeting noise is generated by large scale vortices and in low frequency. Furthermore, buffeting noise characteristics under several patterns of <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> opening were also numerically investigated. As a result, rear window buffeting noise is more severe than that of front window when one window open, and combination pattern of <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> open can reduce buffeting noise. To decrease the interior noise and improve car ride comfort, four suppression measures through adding a <b>side</b> <b>window</b> weather deflector at the A-pillars, constructing a cavity at the B-pillars, combination of {{the front and rear}} windows and installing a row of square cylinder deflector at the B-pillars were also studied, respectively. In conclusion, certain noise reduction can be achieved through four passive control methods...|$|R
