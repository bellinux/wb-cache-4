5000|$|This is {{slightly}} greater than 2.048 Mbit/s + 50ppm. If an extra gap is added, this {{is slightly}} smaller than 2.048 Mbit/s - 50ppm. Thus on average the data rate {{can be made}} exactly equal to the incoming rate by adding a gap in some frames and not others. This extra gap is in a fixed place in the frame and {{is referred to as}} the “stuffable bit”. If it does not contain data (i.e. it’s a gap) it is “stuffed”. The data from the 4 data streams in now contained in 4 data streams of 2.112 Mbit/s which are synchronous and can easily be multiplexed to give a single stream of 8.448 Mbit/s by taking 1 bit from stream #1, followed by 1 bit from stream #2, then #3, then #4 etc. Some of the fixed gaps accommodate a <b>synchronisation</b> <b>word</b> which allows the demultiplexer to identify the start of each frame and others contain control bits for each stream which say whether or not the stuffable bit is stuffed or not (i.e. contains data or not). The process can then be reversed by the demultiplexer and 4 data streams produced with exactly the same bit rate as previous. The timing irregularity is ironed out using a phase locked loop.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{efficiently}} implementing a continuous MAP decoding algorithm is presented. A sliding window technique {{is used to}} reduce the block size {{at the expense of}} extra computations. The smaller block size results in a large reduction in memory storage requirements, reduced delay, and the ability to implement a continuous MAP decoder. A technique for reducing the synchronisation time for a turbo decoder without the use of <b>synchronisation</b> <b>words</b> is also presented. This technique artificially forces the low delay inner decoder to synchronise to a large number of states so that the large delay outer decoder (due to the interleaver between the inner and outer decoder) has fewer states to synchronise to. The overall synchronisation time is thus reduced. Index Terms#MAP decoding, continuous decoding, turbo codes, synchronisation I. INTRODUCTION Turbo codes [1] combined with iterative decoding are currently the most powerful form of error control known. The first results from [1] showed t [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{bringing}} all major organisations {{into line with}} Nazi principles and into {{the service of the}} state was called Gleichschaltung. Gleichschaltung is usually translated as [...] "coordination", but sometimes as [...] "forcible coordination". It is a compound word, consisting of gleich, meaning alike, and schaltung, which means switching. The NSDAP meant to imply a particular mechanical meaning of the word: a certain means of wiring an electrical generator and electric motors, so that when the generator is made to turn at a given speed or turned to a certain angle, each motor connected to it will also turn at that speed, or to the same angle—in other <b>words,</b> <b>synchronisation.</b> The NSDAP was thought of as the generator, and other civil groups as motors wired to it.|$|R
40|$|While Hong Kong's {{monetary}} policy is effectively {{tied to the}} US, its real economy has been experiencing increased integration with the Mainland through trade, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), tourism, and increasingly financial flows. Co-movements of business cycles in Hong Kong and the Mainland have increased steadily since the 1990 s. Although its co-movements with the US dipped in the late 1990 s, {{there has been a}} significant increase in the synchronisation of business cycles among these three economies since 2000. This finding naturally raises a question as to what factors drive the co-movements of business cycles among the three economies. Our structural vector auto-regression analysis suggests that over the medium to long run, about 60 % and 45 % of variations in output and prices in Hong Kong respectively can be explained by US shocks, while the impact of Mainland shocks mostly concentrates on Hong Kong's price movements. It is estimated that Mainland shocks explain over one-third of Hong Kong's price developments. Using a methodology to distinguish between the effects of common US shocks and idiosyncratic domestic shocks, we find little correlation between the business cycles in Hong Kong and the Mainland in the absence of the common US influences, whereas the influence of the US shocks on these two economies leads to a high degree of <b>synchronisation.</b> In other <b>words,</b> the business cycle co-movements of Hong Kong and the Mainland are largely due to the common influence of economic conditions in the Unites States and possibly their US dollar pegged exchange rate system. The lack of similarity of domestic shocks between Hong Kong and the Mainland can be mostly attributed to their continuing structural differences and stage of economic development. Since the similarity of shocks is the most important factor for the choice of exchange rate regime, it follows that the Linked Exchange Rate system based on the US dollar would continue to be desirable in the foreseeable future. ...|$|R
