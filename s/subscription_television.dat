5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Authority's response, titled Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting, {{recommended}} that the Australian Government support the early introduction of digital broadcasting as a free-to-air service with the loan of a 7MHz channel for each broadcaster, in order to enable high-definition television from the outset. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations supported this, as well as freedom for its members to launch multi-channel services. At the same time, the Australian <b>Subscription</b> <b>Television</b> and Radio Association, questioned the commercial viability of HDTV, was opposed {{to the idea of}} multi-channeling, and argued for a competitive system that would allow the entry of new players.|$|E

5|$|The company's {{television}} stations, for {{the most}} part non–network affiliated, were known for showing classic films (both RKO productions and many others) under the banner of Million Dollar Movie, launched by New York's WOR-TV in 1954. In June 1962, RKO General and Zenith Electronics initiated what became the first extended venture into <b>subscription</b> <b>television</b> service: through early 1969, Hartford, Connecticut's WHCT-TV aired movies, sports, classical and pop music concerts, and other live performances without commercials, generating income from descrambler installation and weekly rental fees as well as individual program charges. However, RKO General's most notable legacy is what may be the longest licensing dispute in television history. It began in 1965, when General Tire was accused of obliging vendors to buy advertising with one of its stations if they wanted to keep their contracts. More than two decades' worth of legal actions ensued, eventually forcing GenCorp (the parent company since 1983 of both General Tire and RKO General) to sell off its broadcast holdings under FCC pressure. RKO General exited the media business permanently in 1991.|$|E
