40|$|A {{relationship}} between <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> (lysozyme) activity and granulocyte kinetics {{has been described}} (1 - 5). Increased turnover of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes usually is associated withi increased <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> activity. Conditions associated with reduced numbers of granulocytes, such as aplastic anemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, frequently have reduced <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> activity(3, 4). Nitrogen mustard-induced granulocytopenia in rabbits results in reduction in <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> activity whereas rapid granulocyte destruction {{in response to an}} injection of antigranulocyte serum causes a transitory increase in <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> activity(6). These clinical observations and experiments all are in accord witlh the concept that most of the serum muramiclase is lerived from the degradation of granulocytes and monocytes, and that a direct quantitative relationslhip exists between the turnover of these cells and serum enzyme activity. These studies suggest the possibility that tissue muramidase may be mostly of leukocyte origin. In order to test this hypotlhesis, the distribution of muramidase in serum ancd tissues was studied in rats treated with intravenous nitrogen mustard and correlatedl with changes in circulating leukocytes and tissue hiistology. The total animal muramidase pool was also estimated. METHODS All studlies were performiedI on male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 - 300 g. They were mainitained on a stanclard lab chow and water ad lib...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether variations in <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> (lysozyme) activity in neutropenic patients have clinical significance. The possibility of a valid relationship is based on the premise that most of the normal plasma enzyme activity is derived from the degradation of senescent neutrophils with subsequent release of enzyme from their granules(I- 4). There now is abundant evidence that muramidase is found predominantly in the lysosomes of mature neutrophils and monocytes(5), and that the number of circulating mature neutrophils correlates well with <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> activity(2 - 4). It also has been demonstrated that increased <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> activity is associated with expanded total granulocyte or monocyte populations in patients with leukemia(l, 3, 6, 7) and the probable increase in marrow granulocyte turnover in megaloblastic anemias(8). On the other hand, serum enzyme activity frequently is reduced in acute lymphocytic leukemia in relapse(7) and other conditions which appear to reduce the total body neutrophil population(l, 3). These observations suggest that neutropenia due to diminished granulopoiesis may result in reduce...|$|E
40|$|The <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> {{levels were}} {{measured}} in 128 patients with primary or metastatic colorectal cancer, 166 tumour-free patients after resection of a colorectal cancer, and 172 controls. Muramidase levels over 10 μg/ml were detected in 30 %- 39 % of the tumour-bearing patients, in 8 · 2 % of the tumour free, and in only 1 · 7 % of the controls (normal level 6 · 68 ± 1 · 42 μg/ml). Long-term follow up indicated that raised levels may {{occur as a}} transient phenomenon in recurrent or metastatic disease. The likely relation of abnormal <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> activity and stimulation of the reticuloendothelial system is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Potassium balance {{studies were}} carried out in 32 {{consecutive}} patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and its variants. Serum K level fell below 3. 5 meq/litre in 19 (59 %) of these patients at some stage of their illness. There was no correlation between urinary and <b>serum</b> lysozyme (<b>muramidase)</b> concentrations and the low serum K level. In addition to the unexplained urinary K loss, there appear to be other factors contributing to the development of hypokalaemia. UNEXPECTED HYPOKALAEMIA is a frequent and serious complication associated with acute myeloid leukaemia. The precise mechanism underlying this abnormality has remained obscure. Osserman and Lawlor (1) considered a possible relation between hypokalaemia, hyperkaluria, and the high concentration of urinary lysozyme (murami...|$|R
40|$|<b>Serum</b> {{lysozyme}} (<b>muramidase)</b> estimation is a simple, {{convenient and}} useful laboratory investigation. A {{review of the}} literature shows that lysozyme has been implicated as an aetiological factor in various disorders, and credited with being a prognostic indicator in acute myeloid leukaemia, but these promises have not been fulfilled. This low molecular weight protein is found in the urine of some patients with renal tubular disorders, but some workers have emphasized its importance as a causal agent in hypokalaemia of acute myeloid leukaemia. Research should be concentrated on muramidase as an expression of cell functions rather than as an aetiological factor. Hypokalaemia in acute myeloid leukaemia may be caused by an unidentified substance of molecular weight similar to that of lysozyme...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{peripheral blood}} granulocyte pools, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by granulocytes, migration of granulocytes out of skin windows, <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> activity and bone marrow reserve of granulocytes during uncomplicated bronchopneumonia were studied.

40|$|Human cyclic {{neutropenia}} {{is characterized}} by severe depression of blood neutrophil levels approximately every 21 days. To investigate the mechanism of cyclic neutropenia four patients were studied with daily complete blood counts, serial bone marrow examinations, marrow reserve testing, <b>serum</b> <b>muramidase</b> determinations, DF 22 P granulocytokinetic studies, and, in one patient, in vivo [3 H]TdR labeling. Periodogram analysis of the serial blood counts in the latter patient and visual inspection of multiple cycles in the others revealed periodic fluctuations in the levels of blood neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, reticulocytes, and platelets. Rhythmic changes in the morphologic and radioisotopic studies {{as well as the}} marrow reserve tests and muramidase measurements were consonant with a mechanism of periodic failure of marrow production rather than peripheral destruction. Human cyclic neutropenia is analogous to cyclic neutropenia in the grey collie dog and may be viewed as the consequence of cyclic hematopoiesis...|$|E
