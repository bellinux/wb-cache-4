40|$|Impinging jet heat {{transfer}} on a target plate was enhanced by using two parallel confining <b>plates</b> <b>mounted</b> between a rectangular nozzle end plate and a jet target plate. The target plate was set equal to 2, 3, 4, and 5 times the jet exit width, h, {{and the gap}} ratio of two parallel confining plates, W/h, were changed from 2. 7 to 8. 0 only by impinging length H= 5 h and from 2. 7 to 6. 7 by H≠ 5 h. Two confining parallel <b>plates</b> <b>mounted</b> near the jet exit produced swing-type flow under some conditions. As a result, the maximum Nusselt number attained around the stagnation point was augmented by about 50 % compared to the one for normal impinging jet without the two parallel plates and then spatial mean Nusselt number was increased by about 40 %...|$|R
50|$|The Starlet 80 {{series was}} {{introduced}} to the Japanese market in December 1989. It featured a more rounded body style and interior. Japanese models received new twin cam engines: 4E-F, 4E-FE, and turbocharged 4E-FTE. Export models retained the 1E and 2E engines, and the special version 4E-FE (only for UK and Hong Kong facelift models). The 1N 1.5-litre diesel engine was also available. The Starlet for Japan and Indonesia have a rear center garnish and therefore the license <b>plate</b> is <b>mounted</b> on the bumper. 80 Series Starlets exported to other destinations have their number <b>plates</b> <b>mounted</b> on the hatch centre panel.|$|R

Another method of making the assembly is by defining and etching a <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> and attaching the first mounting surface to the header and the semiconductor device to the second mounting surface. This assembly and process provides an efficient means for mounting semiconductor devices and in particular electro-optic devices such as lasers...|$|R
