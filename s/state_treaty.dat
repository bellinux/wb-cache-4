5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918 and the proclamation of the First Austrian Republic, diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were established on 25 February 1924. The first Soviet Plenipotentiary in Vienna was Yan Antonovich Berzin. Diplomatic relations were broken in March 1938 after the German invasion of Austria and its incorporation into Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, the USSR and Austria re-established diplomatic relations at the level of political representation, which in 1953 was converted into embassies. The preamble of the Austrian <b>State</b> <b>Treaty,</b> signed on 15 May 1955 by the USSR, United States, United Kingdom, France and Austria, established that the treaty formed the basis of Soviet relations with Austria. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations continued between the Russian Federation and the Austrian state.|$|E
25|$|The four-power {{control of}} Vienna lasted until the Austrian <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> {{was signed in}} May 1955. That year, after years of {{reconstruction}} and restoration, the State Opera and the Burgtheater, both on the Ringstraße, reopened to the public. The Soviet Union signed the <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> only after having been provided with the political guarantee {{by the federal government}} to declare Austria's neutrality after the withdrawal of the allied troops. This law of neutrality, passed in late October 1955 (and not the <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> itself), ensured that modern Austria would align with neither NATO nor the Soviet bloc, and {{is considered one of the}} reasons for Austria's late entry into the European Union.|$|E
25|$|Most of Carinthia {{remained}} part of Austria {{and around}} 42,000 Slovenes (per 1951 population census) were {{recognized as a}} minority and have enjoyed special rights following the Austrian <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> (Staatsvertrag) of 1955. Slovenes in the Austrian state of Styria (4,250) are not recognized as a minority and do not enjoy special rights, although the <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 27 July 1955 states otherwise. Many Carinthians remain uneasy about Slovene territorial claims, pointing {{to the fact that}} Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars. The former governor, Jörg Haider, regularly played the Slovene card when his popularity started to dwindle, and indeed relied on the strong anti-Slovene attitudes {{in many parts of the}} province for his power base.|$|E

25|$|The {{right for}} bilingual {{topographic}} signs for the regions where Slovene and Croat Austrians live alongside the German-speaking population (as {{required by the}} 1955 <b>State</b> <b>Treaty)</b> is still to be fully implemented {{in the view of}} some, while others believe that the treaty-derived obligations have been met (see below). Many Carinthians are afraid of Slovenian territorial claims, pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, Jörg Haider, has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing {{to increase the number of}} bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the Kärntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.|$|E
25|$|Many of Vienna's famous parks include monuments, {{such as the}} Stadtpark {{with its}} statue of Johann Strauss II, and the gardens of the baroque palace, where the <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> was signed. Vienna's {{principal}} park is the Prater which {{is home to the}} Riesenrad, a Ferris wheel, and Kugelmugel, a micronation the shape of a sphere. The imperial Schönbrunn's grounds contain an 18th-century park which includes the world's oldest zoo, founded in 1752.|$|E
25|$|They put up {{barbed wire}} fences around the {{perimeter}} of West Berlin in 1953, but not in Vienna. By 1955, the Soviets, by signing the Austrian <b>State</b> <b>Treaty,</b> agreed to relinquish their occupation zones in Eastern Austria as well as their sector in Vienna. In exchange they required that Austria declare its permanent neutrality after the allied powers had left the country. Thus they ensured that Austria would not be a member of NATO and that NATO forces would therefore not have direct communications between Italy and West Germany.|$|E

25|$|Also in September 2009 it was {{reported}} that an East European network of the Joint CIS Air Defense System was to be set up by Russia and Belarus. This network was intended to protect the airspace of the two countries as defined in the supranational 1999 Union <b>State</b> <b>treaty.</b> Its planned composition was to include five Air Force units, 10 anti-aircraft units, five technical service and support units and one electronic warfare unit. It was to be placed under the command of a Russian or Belarusian Air Force or Air Defence Force senior commander.|$|E

25|$|Austria–India {{relations}} {{refers to}} the bilateral ties between Austria and India. Indo-Austrian relations were established in May 1949 by the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru and the Chancellor of Austria Leopold Figl. Historically, Indo-Austrian ties have been particularly strong and India intervened in June 1953 in Austria's favour whilst negotiations were going on with Soviet Union about the Austrian <b>State</b> <b>Treaty.</b> There is a fully functioning Indian embassy in Vienna, Austria's capital, which is concurrently accredited to the United Nations offices in the city. Austria is represented in India by its embassy and Trade commission in New Delhi, India's capital, as well as Honorary Consulates in Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Goa.|$|E

25|$|However, in 1949, {{there was}} only a {{temporary}} roof on the Staatsoper, as construction work continued. It was not until November 5, 1955, (after the Austrian <b>State</b> <b>Treaty),</b> that the Staatsoper could be reopened with a performance of Beethoven's Fidelio, conducted by Karl Böhm. The American Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, was present. The television station ORF used the occasion to make its first live broadcast, {{at a time when there}} were only c. 800 televiewers in the whole of Austria. The new auditorium had a reduced capacity of about 2,276, including 567 standing room places. The ensemble, which had remained unified until the opening, crumbled in the following years, and slowly an international ensemble formed.|$|E
25|$|The severe {{winter of}} 1946–1947 was {{followed}} by the disastrous summer of 1947, when the potato harvest barely made 30% of pre-war output. Food shortages of 1947 were aggravated by the withdrawal of UNRRA aid, spiraling inflation and the demoralizing failure of <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> talks. In April 1947, the government was unable to distribute any rations, and on 5 May Vienna was shaken by a violent food riot. Unlike earlier popular protests, the demonstrators, led by the Communists, called to curb the westernization of Austrian politics. In August, a food riot in Bad Ischl turned into a pogrom of local Jews. In November, food shortage sparked workers' strikes in British-occupied Styria. Figl's government declared that the food riots were a failed communist putsch, although later historians said this was an exaggeration.|$|E
25|$|Until 1985, {{when the}} first of twenty-four Saab 35 Draken were delivered, the country had {{remained}} essentially without the capacity to contest violations of its airspace. The Drakens, reconditioned after having served the Swedish Air Force since the early 1960s, were armed, {{in accordance with the}} restrictions on missiles in the <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1955, only with a cannon. However, following Austria's revised interpretation of its obligations under the treaty, a decision was made in 1993 to procure AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The first of these missiles were purchased from Swedish air force inventory, while later a higher performance model was acquired directly from the United States, with deliveries commencing in 1995. French Mistral surface-to-air missiles systems were purchased to add ground-based protection against air attack. The first of the systems arrived in Austria in 1993; final deliveries concluded in 1996.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 May 1955, after talks {{which lasted}} {{for years and}} were {{influenced}} by the Cold War, Austria regained full independence by concluding the Austrian <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> with the Four Occupying Powers.

2500|$|The 1955 Austrian <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> {{ended the}} {{occupation}} of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the Federal Assembly passed a constitutional article in which [...] "Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality". The second section of this law stated that [...] "in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy {{on the basis of}} neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian) Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I, Austria adopted and used the name the Republic of German-Austria (...) , in an attempt at union with Germany, but this was forbidden under the treaties the Treaty of Versailles and Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). The name was changed to Austria (...) and shortly afterwards The First Austrian Republic was established in 1919. In 1938 Nazi Germany annexed Austria in the Anschluss. This lasted until the end of World War II in 1945, after which Germany was occupied by the Allies and Austria's former democratic constitution was restored. In 1955, the Austrian <b>State</b> <b>Treaty</b> re-established Austria as a sovereign state, ending the occupation. In the same year, the Austrian Parliament created the Declaration of Neutrality which declared that the Second Austrian Republic would become permanently neutral.|$|E
2500|$|Western {{powers were}} stunned; Wallinger {{reported}} to London {{that the deal}} [...] "was far {{too good to be}} true, to be honest".

The Soviets left in Vienna the large Soviet War Memorial and to the new government a symbolic cache of small arms, artillery and T-34 tanks; the Americans left a far greater gift of [...] "Stockpile A" [...] assets. The only political spokesman who has been publicly upset about the outcome was Konrad Adenauer, who called the affair [...] "die ganze österreichische Schweinerei" [...] ("the whole Austrian scandal") and threatened the Austrians with [...] "sending Hitler's remains home to Austria".|$|E
