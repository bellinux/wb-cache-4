6000|$|In asking your and Mrs. Hood's {{leave to}} bring Mrs. D.'s sister (who <b>stays</b> <b>with</b> <b>us)</b> <b>on</b> Tuesday, {{let me add}} that I should {{very much like to}} bring {{at the same time a}} very {{unaffected}} and ardent admirer of your genius, who has no small portion of that commodity in his own right, and is a very dear friend of mine and a very famous fellow; to wit, Maclise, the painter, who would be glad (as he has often told me) to know you better, and would be much pleased, I know, if I could say to him, [...] "Hood wants me to bring you." ...|$|R

"My {{love for}} Mamie {{as you know}} was most true and tender - so was her sister's and Harry's - But the loss - out of our lives - is not so great {{as it would have}} been years ago - For it is a long time since she ceased to be my companion. She had not lived in London for nearly 18 years. She was always dearly beloved {{whenever}} she came to see <b>us</b> - and <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> special occasions. But she had given up all her family and friends for those people whom she had taken to live with her - Mr Hargreaves is a most unworthy person in every way - and it was always amazing to me that she could keep up this strong feeling and regard and affection for him to the very end of her life.Mrs Hargreaves has kept true and devoted in her attentions to Mamie during her long illness - and Kitty and I were very grateful to her - I don't know what we could have done without her help at the last - we were thankful to have our darling Mamie all to ourselves - as both Mr and Mrs Hargreaves went away before she died - Kitty and I had been staying close by her for some time - and finally were always in her room - I don't know - and I don't care! what has become of Mr Hargreaves - I never want to meet his kind again - and I only hope and pray I never see him alive! She poor woman has been living since Mamie's death with some friends in the country and has two sisters who are very good to her - she is trying now to get some casual service as housekeeper or Companion and if Kitty or I can help or recommend her we shall be only too glad to do so - she has had a sad life - and will be much better without her detestable husband." ...|$|R
5000|$|By mid-February, it {{was widely}} {{reported}} that the team was in imminent danger of collapse due to financial problems, and that Hurley had withdrawn his backing from the project. On February 20, Ken Anderson said that the team were asking the FIA if it could miss the first four races {{of the season and}} begin at the [...] He said the FIA were working with him to evaluate options for the team. Furthermore, Anderson said that Peter Windsor was still in the project, and that Chad Hurley remained with the team. He also weighed up the fact that LÃ³pez could take his money to rival team Campos Meta but he hoped he'd <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> F1. <b>On</b> February 23, Locstein, a Swiss-based financial services firm and potential sponsors of the team, released a press statement saying [...] "When it was apparent that the team was not able to participate in the entire 2010 season, Locstein elected to withdraw from further involvement with USF1". The withdrawal sparked fresh allegations {{about the state of the}} team's finances, forcing the FIA to evaluate the situation further.|$|R
6000|$|The {{correspondence}} {{grew more}} interspaced, {{and with the}} year 1861 and the following, when we were at home again, became {{a matter of the}} occasional note. I have before me a series of beautiful examples of Emerson's share in it--during the earlier time copious enough; but these belong essentially to another case. I am all but limited, for any further show of the interesting relation than I have already given, to reproducing a few lines from Emerson's Diary, passages unpublished at the moment I write, and the first of them of April 1850. [...] "I have made no note of these long weary absences at New York and Philadelphia. I am a bad traveller, and the hotels are mortifications to all sense of well-being in me. The people who fill them oppress me with their excessive virility, and would soon become intolerable {{if it were not for}} a few friends who, like women, tempered the acrid mass. Henry James was true comfort--wise, gentle, polished, with heroic manners and a serenity like the sun." [...] The hotels of those days may well have been an ordeal--distinct to me still, from no few childish glimpses of their bareness of ease and rudeness of acceuil; yet that our justly fastidious friend was not wholly left to their mercy seems signified by my not less vivid remembrance of his <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> occasion in New York; some occasion, or occasions, I infer, of his coming on to lecture there. Do I roll several occasions into one, or amplify one beyond reason?--this last being ever, I allow, the waiting pitfall of a chronicler too memory-ridden. I [...] "visualise" [...] at any rate the winter firelight of our back-parlour at dusk and the great Emerson--I knew he was great, greater than any of our friends--sitting in it between my parents, before the lamps had been lighted, as a visitor consentingly housed only could have done, and affecting me the more as an apparition sinuously and, I held, elegantly slim, benevolently aquiline, and commanding a tone alien, beautifully alien, to any we heard roundabout, that he bent this benignity upon me by an invitation to draw nearer to him, off the hearth-rug, and know myself as never yet, as I was not indeed to know myself again for years, in touch with the wonder of Boston. The wonder of Boston was above all just then and there for me in the sweetness of the voice and the finish of the speech--this latter through a sort of attenuated emphasis which at the same time made sounds more important, more interesting in themselves, than by any revelation yet vouchsafed us. Was not this my first glimmer of a sense that the human tone could, in that independent and original way, be interesting? and didn't it for a long time keep me going, however unwittingly, in that faith, carrying me in fact more or less on to my day of recognising that it took much more than simply not being of New York to produce the music I had listened to. The point was that, however that might be, I had had given me there in the firelight an absolutely abiding measure. If I didn't know from that hour forth quite all it was to not utter sounds worth mentioning, I make out that I had at least the opposite knowledge. And all by the operation of those signal moments--the truth of which I find somehow reflected in the fact of my afterwards knowing one of our household rooms for the time--it must have been our only guest-chamber--as [...] "Mr. Emerson's room." [...] The evening firelight played so long for me upon the door--that is to the length probably of three days, the length of a child's impression. But I must not let this carry me beyond the second note of the Diary, this time of May 1852. [...] "'I do not wish this or that thing my fortune will procure, I wish the great fortune,' said Henry James, and said it in the noblest sense." [...] The report has a beauty to me without my quite understanding it; the union of the two voices in it signifies quite enough. The last very relevant echo of my father's by itself, in the connection, I hasten now to find in a communication that must have been of the summer of 1869, when Dr. Wilkinson paid his only visit to America--this apparently of the briefest. The letter to Emerson from Cambridge notes that his appearance there had been delayed.|$|R
