The uncertainty is not due to our action, but to their threats. Our action has been regular, constitutional, and necessary. Their threats are violent, unprecedented, and outrageous.

40|$|The {{best way}} to work out how much money the ABC needs may be to look at its competitors, writes Rodney Tiffen ONE of the {{recurring}} motifs in Australian political life is the ABC saying it needs more money, and the government saying it won’t give more. The essential {{problem is that the}} ABC’s funding has no relationship to its performance. Its revenue does not go up if its audiences rise, or vary with their relative satisfaction. Rather, its budget is determined by extraneous factors, such as the government’s general budgetary strategy, or its degree of political hostility to the national broadcaster. Although there is no objective basis for saying at what level the ABC should be funded, the debate does not have to proceed in a data vacuum. We have three sets of available comparisons, and each suggests that the ABC is not generously funded. A first source of data, which is used quite often, is to look at trends over time. ABC managing director Russell Balding <b>said</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> that in real terms the ABC’s budget in 2003 was about 70 per cent of what it had been in 1985, a substantial cut. A second, more rarely used source of data is to look outward, to compare the ABC with public service broadcasters in other advanced democracies. The ABC ranks near the bottom, compared with national broadcasters in 16 other countries. In 1999, it ranked second-last in terms of revenue per head of population. It received $US 29 per year, compared with the mean for the others of $US 63. A third source of data has almost never been used - namely, to compare the ABC’s budget with that of the commercial networks in Australia. This is a strange omission because this comparison is directly relevant to the environment the ABC must operate in. Moreover, the results may surprise many, especially those who like to contrast the flabby and inefficient public sector with the lean, mean private sector. According to research by Professor Glenn Withers at the ANU, the average hour of ABC television costs 42 per cent as much as the average hour on commercial television, while for radio the equivalent figure is 40 per cent. Moreover, both figures have fallen over time. In 1981, the figures were 71 per cent and 48 per cent respectively. So, in relation to commercial television, the ABC’s costs have fallen dramatically. While some economists may see this as an increase in efficiency, many viewers probably suspect it has meant a decline in quality. By all measures, the ABC is relatively poorly funded. What level should it be funded at? Friends of the ABC might think it deserves to be funded at the same level as the commercials. But no Australian government in 2004 would dispense such largesse. Perhaps ABC lobbyists could adopt the modest request: ‘Give the ABC half what the commercials get. ’ Associate Professor Rodney Tiffen is the author, with Ross Gittins, of How Australia Compares (Cambridge University Press, 2004).
