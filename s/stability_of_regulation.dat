40|$|The final master thesis {{analyzes}} {{the system of}} temperature regulation of the heat exchanger. The Simulink model of the heat transfer medium is made. The designed system consists: of condensing heat exchanger, four way valve with drive, circulation pumps, heater, regulator. The main objective of the research is to design PID and fuzzy regulators that would control {{the position of the}} four way valve in the contour of temperature regulation of the condensing heat exchanger. While applying the quality indicators of automated regulation, such as <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation,</b> re-regulation, duration of the transitional time, the conclusion is drawn which regulator is more suitable for this system. The objective of the designed valve regulator is to maintain the chosen, stable temperature that is transferred to the condensing heat exchanger regardless of the load of the boiler and changing temperature. The output signal directly sets the position of the four way valve. This method of regulation has impact on the environmental and energy indicators of the boiler...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the development of self-regulation across preschool and early childhood, with an emphasis on identifying basic developmental processes, implications for adjustment, and contextual influences. Study 1 utilized a path analytic framework to assess longitudinal transactional relations between emotion and behavior regulation. Study 2 utilized a latent change analytic framework to assess the development of self-regulation and the influence of context. The use of these two complementary paradigms sought to clarify individual patterns of growth and stability, and to elucidate the mechanism behind potential cross domain effects. Data were drawn from a diverse sample of 250 children who completed annual observational assessments of regulation during laboratory tasks at ages four, five, and six. Additional measures included parent report of adversity exposure, teacher report of social competence, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems, and laboratory-measured academic achievement. Study 1 found modest <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> across early childhood, and bidirectional prospective relations between emotion and behavior regulation. Better behavior regulation at age four predicted better emotion regulation at age six, while better emotion regulation at age five predicted better behavior regulation at age six. Each cross-domain longitudinal relation controlled for the stability of prior within-domain regulation and concurrent cross-domain relations. Behavior regulation evidenced direct relations with adjustment in multiple domains, with indirect effects of emotion regulation emerging through its effect on behavior regulation. Study 2 found that emotion and behavior regulation evidenced different patterns of growth. Emotion regulation improved from age four to five, and remained relatively constant from age five to six. Furthermore, higher levels of cumulative adversity predicted a decrease in the slope of emotion regulation trajectories, such that children who experienced more adversity improved less in emotion regulation over time. There was no significant effect of adversity on initial levels of regulation. Although behavior regulation appeared to increase in a linear fashion, a latent change model could not be fit successfully, which precluded assessing the effect of adversity on behavior regulation, or interrelations between regulatory trajectories. Implications are for the development of context-sensitive interventions and increased specification of key domains of self-regulation in investigations...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Trichotillomania (TTM) is {{characterized}} by recurrent hair-pulling behaviours that cause significant distress. Deficits in affective regulation {{have been reported in}} individuals with TTM. We aimed to investigate temporal <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> affective <b>regulation</b> in TTM individuals. METHODS: Eighty-one TTM individuals underwent an online intervention. Affective Regulation Scale (ARS), Massachusetts General Hospital Hair-Pulling Scale (MGH-HPS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores were obtained at baseline, post-treatment (4 weeks), and follow-up (6 months). We examined the effect of phenotypes including hair-pulling severity and depressive symptoms on absolute and relative <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> affective <b>regulation</b> over time, using multiple linear and hierarchical regression analyses. RESULTS: The ARS total-score from the present TTM sample was significantly lower than the score from non-hair pullers (p <  0. 001). ARS total-scores inversely correlated with the MGH-HPS total-scores at baseline (p =  0. 001) and post-treatment (p =  0. 02), and with BDI total-scores at all time-points (p <  0. 001). Although ARS total-scores significantly increased, all ARS sub-scores, except guilt sub-scores, did not change over time, indicating absolute stability. Baseline ARS total-, and sub-scores (except tension) were found to predict their ARS follow-up scores (all p <  0. 01), confirming relative stability (i. e., {{the extent to which the}} inter-individual differences remained the same over time). The relative <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> ARS total-scores and all but two sub-scores (irritability and guilt) were independent from BDI baseline scores. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with TTM reported deficits in affective regulation that demonstrated mostly high relative stability and partly absolute stability. Therefore, targeting to improve affective regulation in individuals with TTM during therapy is warranted...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the main}} speciﬁcities of walking robots is their non-permanent contact with the ground which impairs their stability. The only <b>stability</b> {{analyses}} <b>of</b> control laws that have been proposed so far for walking robots have been distinctly focusing on each contact phases, with the strong assumption that these phases are never perturbated [11, 13]. In this study we aim at analysing the <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> a <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> {{the position of a}} walking robot without any assumption on the state of these contacts. In order to do so, we proposed in [2] to work in the framework of nonsmooth dynamical systems, what provides a general formulation of the dynamics that does not depend on the contact state. Classical stability theorems cannot be applied to this framework, so we needed to derive in [2] a Lyapunov stability theorem and a Lagrange Dirichlet theorem speciﬁcally for Lagrangian dynamical systems with non-permanent contacts. Based on these theorems, we will prove here the <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> a simple control action that realizes the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the position and contact forces of a walking robot...|$|R

The reasons behind the astonishing economic growth have seldom been investigated. Especially, no {{research has been done}} to explain the specific economic phenomena in the NHTP from the perspective of institutions. We aim to have more knowledge about the relationship between institutions and economic growth. Further the result of the dissertation will be presented to the NHTP administrative committee as well as some suggestions to improve economic management. Four theories that are the theory of institutional change, the theory of state, the theory of property rights and transaction costs theory are used to explain the establishment of the NHTP with new institutions and how these new institutions motivate investment. The Solow Growth Model and Porter’s Diamond Model were shortly introduced in order to give a picture of the relationship between institutions, investment and economic growth. The research results indicated that all the institutional changes in the NHTP are important to attract investment. The five most important institutions can be grouped into two categories. They are the visible profits including “the favorable tax policies and subsidies from the local government” on one hand, the efficiency of government including “the <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> and policy, the simplified administrative procedure and the high quality service of servant” on the other hand.

This requires coordination of several levels <b>of</b> <b>regulation,</b> including turnover and translation efficiencies of mRNAs. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways are implicated in many aspects of the environmental stress response, including initiation of transcription, translation efficiency, and mRNA turnover. In this study, we analyze mRNA turnover rates and mRNA steady-state levels at different time points following mild hyperosmotic shock in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> mRNA <b>stability</b> is transient and affects most genes for which there is a change in transcript level. These changes precede and prepare for the changes in steady-state levels, both regarding the initial increase and the later decline of stressinduced mRNAs.
