The canopy {{coverage}} at four sites on the creek ranges from 0 percent to 75 percent. The algal biomass of the creek ranges from 0.01 to 1.21 in terms of chlorophyll a per <b>square</b> <b>centimeter.</b> The Roaring Creek Bluffs are listed on the Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory. Jeweled shooting-star, which is threatened in Pennsylvania, occurs at this site. Other plant species in this area include hydrangea, fragile fern, maidenhair spleenwort, golden saxifrage.

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per <b>square</b> <b>centimeter</b> (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E

Classical afro-textured hair {{has been found to be}} not as densely concentrated on the scalp as other follical types. Specifically, the average density of afro-textured hair was found to be approximately 190 hairs per <b>square</b> <b>centimeter.</b> This was significantly lower than that of Caucasian hair, which, on average, has approximately 227 hairs per <b>square</b> <b>centimeter.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{degree of}} {{inactivation}} by ultraviolet radiation {{is directly related}} to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per <b>square</b> <b>centimeter,</b> or equivalently as microwatt seconds per <b>square</b> <b>centimeter</b> (µW·s/cm2). Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000µW·s/cm2. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for one-decimal-logarithm reduction of cryptosporidium, a minimum dose of 2,500µW·s/cm2 is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.|$|E

5000|$|Similar to {{selectin}} binding, FimH binding {{also have}} a threshold where it only starts binding to the host cells above this threshold. This shear stress threshold is about 1 dynes per <b>squared</b> <b>centimeter,</b> slightly larger than that of selectin binding. Above this threshold, FimH also alternate between binding, pause and unbinding with the mannose residues. However, different from selectin binding, FimH binding to mannose-BSA can either have a very long or very short pauses. This cause FimH binding to exhibit a [...] "stick-and-roll" [...] adhesion, not rolling adhesion {{in the case of}} selectin binding. And unlike selectin binding which requires integrin to help with firm adhesion, FimH binding can become stationary, and this process is reversible. All of this is mediated by shear stress level: at shear stress higher than 20 dynes per <b>squared</b> <b>centimeter,</b> FimH binding is stationary. At shear stress higher than 100 dynes per <b>squared</b> <b>centimeter,</b> slow rolling is observed.|$|R

25|$|The first {{heterojunction}} diode lasers were single-heterojunction lasers. These lasers utilized aluminum {{gallium arsenide}} p-type injectors situated over n-type gallium arsenide layers grown on the substrate by LPE. An admixture of aluminum replaced gallium in the semiconductor crystal {{and raised the}} bandgap of the p-type injector over that of the n-type layers beneath. It worked; the 300 K threshold currents went down by 10× to 10,000 amperes per <b>square</b> <b>centimeter.</b> Unfortunately, this was still not in the needed range and these single-heterostructure diode lasers did not function in continuous wave operation at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|They can {{potentially}} be fashioned into non-volatile solid-state memory, {{which would allow}} greater data density than hard drives with access times similar to DRAM, replacing both components. HP prototyped a crossbar latch memory that can fit 100 gigabits in a <b>square</b> <b>centimeter,</b> and proposed a scalable 3D design (consisting of up to 1000 layers or 1 petabit per cm3). In May 2008 HP reported that its device reaches currently about one-tenth the speed of DRAM. The devices' resistance would be read with alternating current so that the stored value would not be affected.

25|$|Chirped-pulse {{amplification}} {{was originally}} introduced as {{a technique to}} increase the available power in radar in 1960. CPA for lasers was invented by Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland at the University of Rochester in the mid 1980s. Before then, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because a laser pulse at intensities of gigawatts per <b>square</b> <b>centimeter</b> causes serious damage to the gain medium through nonlinear processes such as self-focusing. For example, {{some of the most}} powerful compressed CPA laser beams, even in an unfocused large aperture (after exiting the compression grating) can exceed intensities of 700 gigawatts/cm2, which if allowed to propagate in air or the laser gain medium would instantly self focus and form a plasma or cause filament propagation, both of which would ruin the original beam's desirable qualities and could even cause back-reflection potentially damaging the laser's components. In order to keep the intensity of laser pulses below the threshold of the nonlinear effects, the laser systems had to be large and expensive, and the peak power of laser pulses was limited to the high gigawatt level or terawatt level for very large multi beam facilities.|$|E

25|$|Soon after {{discovering}} superconductivity in 1911, Kamerlingh Onnes {{attempted to make}} an electromagnet with superconducting windings but found that relatively low magnetic fields destroyed superconductivity in the materials he investigated. Much later, in 1955, George Yntema succeeded in constructing a small 0.7-tesla iron-core electromagnet with superconducting niobium wire windings. Then, in 1961, J. E. Kunzler, E. Buehler, F. S. L. Hsu, and J. H. WernickSn at High Current Density in a Magnetic Field of 88 kgauss”, Phys. Rev. Lett. 6, 89 (1961). made the startling discovery that at 4.2 kelvins, a compound consisting of three parts niobium and one part tin was capable of supporting a current density of more than 100,000 amperes per <b>square</b> <b>centimeter</b> in a magnetic field of 8.8 tesla. Despite being brittle and difficult to fabricate, niobium-tin has since proved extremely useful in supermagnets generating magnetic fields as high as 20 teslas. In 1962, Ted Berlincourt and Richard Hake discovered that alloys of niobium and titanium are suitable for applications up to 10 teslas. Promptly thereafter, commercial production of niobium-titanium supermagnet wire commenced at Westinghouse Electric Corporation and at Wah Chang Corporation. Although niobium-titanium boasts less-impressive superconductng properties than those of niobium-tin, niobium-titanium has, nevertheless, become {{the most widely used}} “workhorse” supermagnet material, in large measure a consequence of its very high ductility and ease of fabrication. However, both niobium-tin and niobium-titanium find wide application in MRI medical imagers, bending and focusing magnets for enormous high-energy particle accelerators, {{and a host of other}} applications. Conectus, a European consortium for superconductivity, estimated that in 2014, global economic activity, for which superconductivity was indispensable, amounted to about five billion euros, with MRI systems accounting for about 80% of that total.|$|E
500|$|In the r-process (r is for [...] "rapid"), captures happen {{faster than}} nuclei can decay. This occurs in environments {{with a high}} neutron density, such as a {{supernova}} or the merger of two neutron stars. The neutron flux involved {{may be on the}} order of 1022 neutrons per <b>square</b> <b>centimeter</b> per second. The r-process does not form as much lead as the s-process. It tends to stop once neutron-rich nuclei reach 126 neutrons. At this point, the neutrons are arranged in complete shells in the atomic nucleus, and it becomes harder to energetically accommodate more of them. When the neutron flux subsides, these nuclei beta decay into stable isotopes of osmium, iridium, and platinum.|$|E
500|$|Investigators {{found that}} a flaw {{in the design of}} the F28's wings made them {{extremely}} vulnerable to ice buildup. Because of the angle of the wings, even a very small amount of ice could have devastating effects.

500|$|The most {{important}} isotope is astatine-211, {{the only one}} in commercial use.
