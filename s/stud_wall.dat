40|$|A {{number of}} recent papers have {{determined}} the compliance of steel studs {{for use in a}} model for predicting the sound insulation of cavity <b>stud</b> <b>walls.</b> Previously, the steel studs have usually been modelled as line connections. In this paper, they are also modelled as point connections where the points are the screws attaching the wall leaves to the steel studs. The compliance of the combination of resilient channel bars and wooden or steel studs, modelled as point or as line connections, is also presented. The values of compliance which make a theoretical model agree with the experimental data have been calculated. The experimental sound insulation data were measured by the National Research Council of Canada. There were 126 steel <b>stud</b> <b>walls,</b> 78 resilient channel bar and wooden <b>stud</b> <b>walls,</b> 15 resilient channel bar and steel <b>stud</b> <b>walls</b> and 4 walls with resilient channel bars on both sides of wooden studs.

5000|$|The {{method of}} {{installation}} {{and type of}} drywall can reduce sound transmission through walls and ceilings. Several builders' books state that thicker drywall reduces sound transmission, but engineering manuals recommend using multiple layers of drywall, sometimes of different thicknesses and glued together, or special types of drywall designed to reduce noise. Also important are the construction details of the framing with steel studs, wider stud spacing, double studding, insulation, and other details reducing sound transmission. Sound transmission class (STC) ratings can be increased from 33 for an ordinary stud-wall to as high as 59 with double 1/2" [...] drywall {{on both sides of}} a wood <b>stud</b> <b>wall</b> with resilient channels on one side and fiberglass batt insulation between the studs.|$|E
5000|$|A thermal {{performance}} analysis in 1998 using “HOT 2000” computer software showed {{the relationship of}} domestic wall types and their insulating values. The simulation revealed an R value of 20.5 for the sample cordwood wall. Compare this to the basic 2 x 4 wooden <b>stud</b> <b>wall,</b> and 2 x 6 foam insulated and sheathed wall with R values of 15.8 and 25.7, respectively. Cordwood walls are not the best natural insulators but can be built to thermal efficient standards. The R value of a cordwood wall {{is directly related to}} its ratio of wood to mortar and insulation medium. However, R value in cordwood construction is not as significant as it is in stick-frame building due to the high thermal mass which increases a significantly higher [...] "effective R-value.” Builders tailor their design and ratios to the existing climate.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{a variety}} of factors (wall thickness, type of wood, {{particular}} mortar recipe), the insulative value of a cordwood wall, as expressed in R-value is generally less than that of a high-efficiency <b>stud</b> <b>wall.</b> Cordwood walls have greater thermal mass than stud frame but less than common brick and mortar. This is because the specific heat capacity of clay brick is higher (0.84 versus wood's 0.42), and is denser than airy woods like cedar, cypress, or pine. Thermal mass makes it easier for a building to maintain median interior temperatures while going through daily hot and cold phases. In climates like the desert with broad daily temperature swings thermal mass will absorb and then slowly release the midday heat and nighttime cool in sequence, moderating temperature fluctuations. Thermal mass does not replace the function of insulation material, but is used in conjunction with it.|$|E
50|$|Often, {{platforms}} {{that are}} kept in stock have coffin locks inset in their framing or lids, in order to fasten them to adjacent platforms. The legs or <b>stud</b> <b>walls</b> that support the platform typically require diagonal cross bracing, often made of very thin lumber.|$|R

50|$|A newer {{rating is}} the Speech Privacy Class (ASTM E2638-08); {{it applies to}} closed rooms. PI {{is a measure of}} the speech from a talker at a {{specific}} location to a listener at a specific position. It is applicable to situations such as open offices as well useful for evaluating the efficacy of a listening device hidden in a <b>stud</b> <b>wall.</b> SPC makes use of average values so is very useful in the design and evaluation of closed rooms for speech privacy from casual listeners. There are several other measures such as, Speech Privacy Potential (SPP), Speech Intelligibility Index (SII), Speech Transmission Index (STI), Speech Interference Level (SIL) and Speech Intelligibility Contrast (SIC). Discussion and definitions of these ratings can be found in the literature. The advantage of the Privacy Index is that comparison of that rating to school grades makes the designer and user feel more comfortable with the rating; some of the others are more technical.|$|E
50|$|The Drywall - The contestants, {{after another}} lesson, must attach drywall {{to their new}} <b>stud</b> <b>wall</b> as well as add a coat of plaster.

Angela passes despite her husband, while Deen, after having realized he built his wall three inches too tall for his liking, fails as he runs out of time. For Simon, who chose to close {{a hole in the}} wall with his wall, he must also attach a steel mesh to close the sizeable gap between the wall's edge and the wall.

Angie claims third, after making several mistakes early on and {{having a hard time}} catching up. However, by far the biggest story is Eric's behaviour in this challenge; he starts to put the frame together early in violation of the challenge rules, and when Andrew reminds him of this, Eric angrily smashes the frame apart with a hammer (nearly hitting Andrew, and sending debris flying toward the nominators) before storming out of the challenge altogether, blaming his actions on Michelle's presence.|$|E

Based on the experimental testing of the specimens, the results show that the use of cement based joint compound on drywall joints produces higher shear capacity for the wall system as compared to similar specimens finished with conventional non-cement based joint compound.

Great for sound deadening, STC 53 (ASTM E413-73); does not echo like other foams. Environmentally friendly. Non-expansive (good for existing homes where interior sheathing is in place). Fully sustainable: Consists of phenolic, a foaming agent, and air. Blown with air (no CFCs, HCFCs or other harmful blowing agents). Nontoxic, even during application. Does not shrink or settle. Zero VOC emission. Chemically inert (no known symptoms of exposure per MSDS). Insect resistant. Mold Proof. Insoluble in water.

Great for sound deadening; does not echo like other foams. Environmentally friendly. Non-expansive (good for existing homes where interior sheathing is in place). Fully sustainable: Consists of magnesium oxide cement and air, which is made from magnesium oxide extracted from seawater. Blown with air (no CFCs, HCFCs or other harmful blowing agents). Nontoxic, even during application. Does not shrink or settle. Zero VOC emission. Chemically inert (no known symptoms of exposure per MSDS). Insect resistant. Mold Proof. Insoluble in water. Disadvantages: Fragile at the low densities needed to achieve the quoted R value and, like all foams, it is more expensive than conventional fiber insulations. In 2010, the Ontario Building Code Commission ruled that AirKrete did not conform to requirements for a specific application in the building code. Their ruling states [...] "As the proposed insulation is not impermeable, it could allow water or moisture to enter the wall assembly, which could then cause damage or deterioration of the building elements."
