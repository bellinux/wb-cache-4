On August 21-25, 1933, a special international conference to that effect took place in London. It was attended by the representatives of Germany, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Spain, USA, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Romania, UK, Sweden, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. The Final act of the conference established a Wheat Advisory Committee, which purposes were defined in the preamble as [...] "to adjust the supply of wheat to effective world demand and eliminate the abnormal surpluses which have been depressing the wheat market and to bring about a rise and <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> at a level remunerative to the farmers and fair to the consumers of breadstuffs".|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} empirically {{whether a}} central bank can promote financial stability by stabilising inflation and output, and whether additional <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> asset <b>prices</b> and credit growth would enhance financial stability, in particular. We employ an econometric model of the Norwegian economy to investigate the performance of simple interest rate rules that allow a response to asset prices and credit growth, in addition to inflation and output. We find that output stability also promotes financial stability, while inflation stability is achieved {{at the expense of}} both output and financial stability. A <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> house <b>prices,</b> equity prices and/or credit growth enhances stability in both inflation and output, but not financial stability. By contrast, <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> the nominal exchange rate induces excess volatility in general. Monetary policy, financial stability, asset prices, interest rate rules. ...|$|R

The programme covered the principal commodity exports and its objectives aside from the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> commodity <b>prices</b> were: 'Just and remunerative pricing, taking into account world inflation', the expansion of processing, distribution and control of technology by LDCs and improved access to markets.|$|R

40|$|The {{intervention}} system for beef in the EU has undergone major changes since its inception. These changes were introduced because of changing circumstances in the EU beef market {{and because of}} cost factors and inefficiencies associated with and arising from the {{intervention system}} itself. While justified from these perspectives {{it can be said}} that from the perspective of beef producers the system has changed from being a mechanism which aimed at and operated to achieve a producer Guide Price which in turn was defined as “…… [...] the price which it is hoped to attain on average on the Community market for all the quantities marketed during a given marketing year” (Com 370, July 1976) to one which has abandoned all efforts at achieving a desirable producer price and which provides at best very short term <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> at its market level. The aim of this paper is to trace the major changes which have occurred to the intervention system and the concomitant <b>price</b> achievement <b>of</b> beef in general in the EU and especially that of Irish beef. These changes together with other market and policy factors occurring on and since 1996 have combined to give a historically poor price performance for Irish beef which despite the growing importance of direct payments is still of major significance in the incomes and welfare of beef producers.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} in {{a unified}} framework the twin {{issues of the}} appropriate horizon for achieving price stability {{in the face of}} unexpected disturbances and the choice <b>of</b> a <b>price</b> level versus an inflation objective. Using a small estimated forward-looking model of the euro area economy, the three main findings are: 1) The policy horizon becomes shorter the greater the weight on price stability in society's objective function, the higher the degree of 'forward-lookingness' in the economy and the greater the slope of the Phillips curve; 2) The optimal policy horizon for a price level objective is generally greater than that for an inflation objective; 3) Even if society cares about inflation stabilisation (rather than the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>price</b> level), it often pays to give the central bank a price level objective (rather than an inflation objective), provided the horizon is optimally chosen to be somewhat longer and there is a small weight on interest rate stabilisation in the loss function. This result depends, however, on the structure of the economy. JEL Classification: E 4, E 5 euro area, monetary policy, policy rules, strategy...|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyses}} Kaldor’s {{ideas on}} economic policy, {{his interest in}} policy issues, and his contribution on specific policies. It underlines Kaldor’s strong and cogent views on three main topics: monetary and fiscal policy, the control of cost inflation, and the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> commodity <b>prices.</b> The author suggests how Kaldor might have reacted to the most important economic policy questions that still face Britain and the European Union, thirty years after his death. Kaldor was a prominent opponent of Britain’s entry into the then Common Market in the 1970 s: {{not on the basis}} of any emotive English nationalism, but rather because he believed that the British economy would be damaged by an exposure to unlimited competition from more successful European industries. Perhaps he would have argued that, by 2016, the damage has already been done, and that Britain should now remain in the Union to continue the fight for more sensible macroeconomic policies. He would certainly have been pleased that his adoptive country had refused to join the Eurozone. JEL: B 31; E 61; E 5...|$|R
40|$|The alcohol {{of sugar}} cane, {{produced}} by Brazil has shown great potential {{to contribute to}} alleviate the energy crisis in which we dip and it is direct effect of pollution caused by fossil fuels, which turned the great villains {{for the survival of}} humanity. As well as the increasing demand for fuels from renewable sources. The National Program of Alcohol (Proalcool) was not the first Brazilian experience in producing alcohol for use in vehicles, however, the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> a barrel of oil and the problems faced by plants as lack of management and the withdrawal of subsidies led a large number of them to break, stopping thus this program. It is clear however, that the production of alcohol and sugar was not completely stopped because many plants remained providing alcohol for vehicles that still used this fuel. Now, with the need for immediate reduction of emission of greenhouse gases, produced on a large scale by fossil fuels, biofuels emerge as a solution and so the brazilian alcohol back to the scene. The alcohol produced in Brazil contains 370 % more energy than spend for their achievement. A high cost benefit compared to the alcohol produced from corn, the USA, which produces energy in only 10 % more than spent (BARROS, 2007). Biofuels led by biodiesel and alcohol become an important step for change in the global energy matrix...|$|R
40|$|The European Union has set {{a system}} of climate and energy targets {{comprising}} target values for greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), Emission Trading Sectors ETS and non-ETS sectors, energy efficiency and renewable energies until 2020. A new framework up to 2030 is just being developed. We analyse what lessons {{can be learned from}} the EU 2020 target system and how a new 2030 framework could be designed coherently. We derive a coherent target system for 2030 from a bottom-up assessment of energy efficiency potentials. Thus we show that ambitious energy efficiency and renewable energy targets also guarantee significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of 47 - 60 % compared to 1990. ETS sectors can contribute significantly to the GHG reduction, provided that a <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> the carbon <b>price</b> can be reached. An alternative design with a 40 % GHG emission reduction as the only headline target, as currently debated, will not exploit all cost-effective energy saving potentials and so not take advantage of the macroeconomic co-benefits of energy efficiency either...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades the world has seen {{acceleration}} in the process of globalisation, affecting virtually all industries and consumers. The wine sector is no exception, witnessing increased exports and imports, decreasing consumption per capita in the producing countries, and a wave of direct foreign investment and mergers and acquisitions in the industry. Among European wine producers the Port wine {{can be seen as a}} representative case of globalisation and as a benchmark, because almost 90 % of its production is exported. With this in mind, the main objective of this paper is to analyse the structure and behaviour of the Port wine chain in terms of industrial organisation and trade. To achieve this objective a survey about the role of organisations in national growth and descriptions of the European wine industry and of the Port wine chain was conducted. Moreover, we identify and characterise the dynamics <b>of</b> production, <b>price</b> and trade <b>of</b> the Port wine after World War II. Despite the Port wine activity having been subjected to cycles there has been a trend toward a continued increase in production and exports, <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> real market <b>prices</b> and a slight increase in the real prices paid to grape growers, leading to positive economic effects for Port wine firms and grape growers. The pro-active behaviour of Port wine chain agents contributed to this result, namely exporters who were able to adopt market strategies to respond to the challenges of globalisation.
