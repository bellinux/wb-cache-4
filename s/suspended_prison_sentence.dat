5|$|On 30 March 2017, Édouard was {{suspected}} of having shot at a passer-by with an airsoft gun on 11 February, injuring him in the head. As {{a result of the}} incident, he was interrogated by police and his loan was prematurely terminated by Toulouse. At the time of his loan being cancelled, Edouard had made 17 appearances and scored one goal for Toulouse. It was later revealed that his teammate, Mathieu Cafaro, had confessed to being the one who had fired the gun. Cafaro later recanted, however, and on 13 June the Toulouse Prosecutor asked that Édouard be charged with a four months <b>suspended</b> <b>prison</b> <b>sentence</b> and a €6,000 fine for his involvement in the incident. Édouard alleged that Cafaro fired the shot while Cafaro claimed not to have been in the car {{at the time of the}} shooting. On 4 July, Édouard was sentenced to a suspended four months' prison sentence by the Correctional Court of Toulouse. He was also ordered to pay a fine of €6,000 as well as damages of €2,600 to the victim for the wounds suffered to his ear.|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{suspended}} sentences {{are increasingly}} imposed as alternatives to short-term imprisonment {{in an attempt}} to reduce recidivism. However, little research has been done to examine recidivism outcomes after suspended sentences. This study used official data on adult offenders sentenced to either fully <b>suspended</b> <b>prison</b> <b>sentences</b> or short-term imprisonment in the court districts of Amsterdam and The Hague (n = 2115). Using propensity score matching, no significant differences in the risk of reconviction between the two sentences were found. Regarding criminal history, first offenders given fully <b>suspended</b> <b>prison</b> <b>sentences</b> had a higher risk of being reconvicted than first offenders sentenced to short-term imprisonment. In contrast, recidivists sentenced to short-term imprisonment had a higher risk of being reconvicted...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has focused mainly on determining the effectiveness of suspended sentences compared with other sentences, and seldom on understanding {{to what extent the}} different types of suspended sentences reduce recidivism rates. This study examined reconviction rates of offenders (N = 1, 258) who received fully or partly <b>suspended</b> <b>prison</b> <b>sentences,</b> with or without special conditions, in 2006 in two of the largest court districts in the Netherlands. Cox proportional hazard models revealed no difference in reconviction rates between fully and partly <b>suspended</b> <b>prison</b> <b>sentences,</b> with and without special conditions. However, suspended sentences without special conditions had significantly lower reconviction rates compared with special conditions that were solely control-orientated. Although there are indications that certain types of suspended sentences reduced reconviction rates more than other types, more rigorous research is still required...|$|R

He subsequently received a Presidential amnesty from then-French President Jacques Chirac and Barroso was unaware of the conviction until it was raised by Parliament. Despite this, Barroso stood by Barrot stating he was fit for office. Farage had also made allegations against vice-president Siim Kallas, stating he had a criminal record in fraud. However this proved false, based on an inaccurate newspaper article, and an apology was published.|$|E
25|$|Courtney was {{released}} from prison and returned to his home in the Glencairn area {{to the north of the}} Shankill. However in 2013 Courtney was convicted of the assault of Tracey Coulter at the offices of the Lower Shankill Community Association. According to court reports Coulter had gone to the offices to speak to Courtney's associates about the death of her cousin, a drug-user, a week earlier. During Coulter's visit she had become embroiled in an argument with an unnamed man when Courtney intervened and head-butted her. Courtney is due to be sentenced in January 2014. Coulter, who is the daughter of Jackie Coulter (a close associate of Adair's who was killed in the 2002 feud with the UVF), had her house burnt down in an arson attack soon after Courtney's conviction. She publicly accused the UDA of being behind the attack. In December 2013 Courtney was again brought before the courts, to face charges of harassing Coulter in the aftermath of his previous conviction, as well as threatening to kill campaigner Raymond McCord, who was with Courtney during the alleged incident. Courtney was given a <b>suspended</b> <b>prison</b> <b>sentence</b> of four months and ordered to pay Coulter £500 for the incident. He was subsequently also found guilty of threatening to kill McCord, although a similar charge relating to Coulter was dismissed.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, a 51-year-old police constable {{attracted}} a 16-year-old girl {{to his house}} by showing her his badge, where he got her drunk and raped her twice. The constable was fired and sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence. In 2007, an Iranian-born immigrant, Rasoul Pourak, was beaten in a cell at Pasila Police Station, Helsinki. The ill-treatment caused Pourak bruises all over his body, an open wound over his eyebrow, and a fractured skull. In addition, facial bones were broken and the victim was left permanently damaged. One guard participating in the assault was sentenced to an 80-day <b>suspended</b> <b>prison</b> <b>sentence.</b> In 2010, two police officers assaulted {{a man in a}} wheelchair in connection with an arrest. The police twisted the man's hands and pushed him backward causing him to break a femur. In 2013, two policemen were sentenced to 35 day fines for assault and breach of duty in connection with stamping on a man's head onto the asphalt thrice. According to the police, the man of Romani descent resisted, yet according to eyewitnesses, the man did not resist. The event was captured in surveillance video, which was stored but accidentally destroyed according to a third officer present.

(It had won a mayorship only once before, {{in the small town}} of Saint-Gilles-du-Gard in 1989.) Le Pen then declared that his party would implement its [...] "national preference" [...] policy, with the risk of provoking the central government and being at odds with the laws of the Republic. The FN pursued interventionist policies with regards to the new cultural complexion of their towns by directly influencing artistic events, cinema schedules, and library holdings, as well as cutting or halting subsidies for multicultural associations. The party won Vitrolles, its fourth town, in a 1997 by-election, where similar policies were pursued. Vitrolles' new mayor Catherine Mégret (...) (who ran in place of her husband Bruno) went further in one significant measure, introducing a special 5,000 franc allowance for babies born to at least one parent of French (or EU) nationality. The measure was ruled illegal by a court, also giving her a <b>suspended</b> <b>prison</b> <b>sentence,</b> a fine, and a two-year ban from public office.|$|E

Dabo said that he had been hit several times, was left unconscious and had to go to hospital after suffering injuries to his head, including a suspected detached retina. Dabo requested that the police press charges against Barton, and as a result, Barton was arrested and questioned by Greater Manchester Police. This altercation effectively ended Barton's time at City, although he later cited a [...] "relationship breakdown" [...] with Stuart Pearce as the main reason he left the club. Barton was bailed until August and was later charged with assault, to which he initially pleaded not guilty. He later changed this to a guilty plea and on 1 July 2008 was sentenced to a four-month <b>suspended</b> <b>prison</b> <b>sentence</b> plus 200 hours of community service and ordered to pay £3,000 compensation and Dabo's court costs.

2500|$|Alec {{grew up on}} the [...] {{family farm}} in Selukwe (now Shurugwi). Selukwe was a small mining and farming town with a {{population}} in the 1950s of around 8,500 (8,000 black and 500 white). In April 1964, when Alec was 14, his father became Prime Minister of Rhodesia. Alec later suggested that this had caused family life to suffer. In 1970 Alec started studying for a degree in law at Rhodes University in South Africa. On his own for the first time, Alec became increasingly alienated from his background and neglected his studies in favour of partying, alcoholism, and drugs. He first came to public attention at this time by applying for a British passport while declaring that he did not agree with his father's political views and still considered himself a loyal British subject. He was expelled from university {{at the end of his}} first year in 1971.
