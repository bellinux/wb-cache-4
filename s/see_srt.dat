40|$|With the {{constant}} improvement {{of computers and}} devices, the webclient in a client-server architecture can perform large portions of logic that typically resides server-side. When the architect chooses to upload and execute the business logic on the webclient, the webserver requires fewer resources. Fewer resources result in a smaller server landscape. Although this sounds promising, shifting more logic to the webclient increases the required resources on the webclient. Because of {{the large amount of}} possible devices, the architect cannot predict the specific device on which the application runs. When the application performs more logic on the webclient, the user's device increasingly influences the user experience. The characteristics of web application influence the user experience. To provide the architect with information on the user experience we discuss these characteristics. Web applications use AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And XML) for communication between client and server. A web application uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to change the HTML document of the web page to communicate with the user. Because of the large amount of possible devices, the architect cannot predict the specific device on which the user interacts with the application. However the architect can measure the user experience when the user is interacting with the application. To provide the architect with these measurements, we utilize the Software Operation Knowledge (SOK) framework. A metric of user experience which the client heavily influences is user-perceived latency. Using the steps of human computer interaction we provide with a formal definition of user-perceived latency (UPL). In UPL we see two types of actors, the user and the system. The architecture cannot influence the user, but can influence the system. Therefore we divided UPL into two components, Human Interaction Time (HIT) and System Response Time (SRT). User experience is an element used to describe the quality of the system. Because SRT is not a property of the application, we <b>see</b> <b>SRT</b> as a metric. Therefore we describe the relation between SRT and the following quality attributes: functional suitability; reliability; performance efficiency; operability; security; compatibility; maintainability; and transferability. To measure SRT, we instantiate the SOK framework for SRT based measurements. Architectural erosion and architectural degradation result in uncertainties for the architect. Therefore, the architect is unable to predict the effect of changes in the software's architecture on SRT. To cope with architectural erosion and architectural degradation, the instantiated framework includes a simulation step. The architect reproduces SRT in the simulation step so that they can predict the effect on SRT. We use the adjusted framework to provide a method aimed at gaining knowledge about SRT and the effects of changes in the software's architecture on SRT. The method aids in measuring, improving, and simulating SRT. To improve SRT, we perform data mining techniques and process mining techniques onto the data. The architect uses presentation means to visualize the data and identify improvements in the architecture. After the architect improves the software's architecture and the software, they create and utilize a test environment to obtain an accurate prediction of the effect of these changes on SRT. To validate this method we performed a case study at AFAS Software B. V [...] During the case study, we put the method into practice to measure SRT of Profit Next. The case study increased the awareness of the importance to measure, monitor, and improve SRT. As a result, the architects are currently improving and adding functionalities to the implementations provided by the method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Chest wall injury after {{stereotactic}} radiotherapy (SRT) for primary lung cancer {{has recently been}} reported. However, its detailed imaging findings are not clarified. So this study aimed to fully characterize the findings on computed tomography (CT), appearance time and frequency of chest wall injury after {{stereotactic radiotherapy}} (SRT) for primary lung cancer Materials and methods A total of 177 patients who had undergone SRT were prospectively evaluated for periodical follow-up thin-section CT with special attention to chest wall injury. The time at which CT findings of chest wall injury appeared was assessed. Related clinical symptoms were also evaluated. Results Rib fracture was identified on follow-up CT in 41 patients (23. 2 %). Rib fractures appeared at a mean of 21. 2 months {{after the completion of}} SRT (range, 4 - 58 months). Chest wall edema, thinning of the cortex and osteosclerosis were findings frequently associated with, and tending to precede rib fractures. No patients with rib fracture showed tumors > 16 mm from the adjacent chest wall. Chest wall pain was seen in 18 of 177 patients (10. 2 %), of whom 14 patients developed rib fracture. No patients complained of Grade 3 or more symptoms. Conclusion Rib fracture is frequently <b>seen</b> after <b>SRT</b> for lung cancer on CT, and is often associated with chest wall edema, thinning of the cortex and osteosclerosis. However, related chest wall pain is less frequent and is generally mild if present. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Sudden {{sensorineural hearing}} loss (SSNHL) is a true {{emergency}} that must be diagnosed and treated immediately. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the efficacy of treatment with intratympanic dexamethasone plus oral prednisolone daily or every other day with that of treatment with oral prednisolone alone. Materials and Methods: Sixty-three patients with SSNHL that had been present for less than 10 days prior to the start of treatment were randomly allocated to three different groups. Patients in group A were treated daily with oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg for 10 days plus intratympanic dexamethasone 2 mg for the first 3 days of treatment. Patients in group B were treated every other day with oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg for 10 days with the addition of intratympanic dexamethasone 2 mg for the first 3 treatments. Patients in group C were treated daily with oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg alone for 10 days. Audiometric parameters including pure tone audiometry (PTA), speech reception threshold (SRT), and speech discrimination score (SDS) were assessed on days 1, 5, and 10. Results: There was a significant improvement in PTA, SRT and SDS in each group over the 10 days but the greatest improvement was <b>seen</b> in the <b>SRT</b> measurements of group A in comparison with group B (19. 81 ± 2. 15, P= 0. 04) and C (26. 26 ± 0. 08, P= 0. 01). The difference in SRT between groups B and C was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The administration of intratympanic dexamethasone 2 mg daily for 3 days has an additive effect to that of 10 days of oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg in the treatment of SSNHL...|$|R
