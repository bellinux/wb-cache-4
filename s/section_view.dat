We extend the Internet Imaging Protocol {{with an open}} specification for re-questing tiled sections of 3 D objects. We evaluate {{the performance of the}} protocol and demonstrate it with a platform independent web viewer that allows on-the-fly browsing of <b>section</b> <b>views</b> of multi-gigabyte 3 D objects. The method uses Woolz, an efficient image processing library, to pro-vide very fast access to <b>section</b> <b>views</b> of the volumetric data. The server has been implemented to run on standard Linux systems and it avoids the requirement for high-performance parallel processing or expensive software. We have tested the system on data volumes up to 13. 4 GB and demonstrated no loss of responsiveness for the user. ...|$|R
