5|$|The PHEBUS {{experiment}} {{was designed by}} CESR (Toulouse) to record high energy transient events in the range 100keV to 100MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated electronics. Each detector consisted of a bismuth germanate (BGO) crystal 78mm in diameter by 120mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4π <b>steradians.</b> The burst mode was triggered when the count rate in the 0.1 to 1.5MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 sigma in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds. There were 116 energy channels.|$|E

50|$|In optical {{engineering}} and telecommunications engineering, the flick is {{a unit of}} spectral radiance. One flick corresponds to a spectral radiance of 1 watt per <b>steradian</b> per square centimeter of surface per micrometer of span in wavelength (W·sr−1·cm−2·μm−1). This is equivalent to 1010 watts per <b>steradian</b> per cubic meter (W·sr−1·m−3). In practice, spectral radiance is typically measured in microflicks (10−6 flicks). One microflick is equivalent to 10 kilowatts per <b>steradian</b> per cubic meter (kW·sr−1·m−3).|$|R
50|$|A <b>steradian</b> can {{be defined}} as the solid angle {{subtended}} {{at the center of a}} unit sphere by a unit area on its surface. For a general sphere of radius r, any portion of its surface with area A = r2 subtends one <b>steradian.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In radiometry, radiant {{intensity}} is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit solid angle, and spectral intensity is the {{radiant intensity}} per unit frequency or wavelength, {{depending on whether}} the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. These are directional quantities. The SI unit of radiant intensity is the watt per <b>steradian</b> (...) , while that of spectral intensity in frequency is the watt per <b>steradian</b> per hertz (...) and that of spectral intensity in wavelength is the watt per <b>steradian</b> per metre (...) —commonly the watt per <b>steradian</b> per nanometre (...) [...] Radiant intensity is distinct from irradiance and radiant exitance, which are often called intensity in branches of physics other than radiometry. In radio-frequency engineering, radiant intensity is sometimes called radiation intensity.|$|R

5000|$|In radiometry, {{radiance}} is {{the radiant}} flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received by a given surface, per unit solid angle per unit projected area. Spectral radiance is the radiance of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength, {{depending on whether}} the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. These are directional quantities.

[...] The microflick is also used to measure spectral radiance in some fields. Radiance is used to characterize diffuse emission and reflection of electromagnetic radiation, or to quantify emission of neutrinos and other particles. Historically, radiance is called [...] "intensity" [...] and spectral radiance is called [...] "specific intensity". Many fields still use this nomenclature.
