5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E

25|$|George {{has played}} every ODI for West Indies since then, playing 12 on {{tour of the}} Indian subcontinent in 2003–04 – a tour which {{included}} a career highest score of 53, and George made 269 runs {{at an average of}} 22.41 on tour. In the 2005 World Cup, she was no longer the highest-scoring batter – her 72 runs came at an average of 12, behind Juliana Nero (197 runs), Pamela Lavine (145 runs) and Nelly Williams (121 runs) – but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> celebrate two victories, over Sri Lanka (their first win over the Lankans, in their eighth attempt) and Ireland (to get revenge for the loss at the 2003 IWCC Trophy, when George got a duck and the West Indies were bowled out for 52 chasing 85 to win). The West Indies finished fifth – their best position at a World Cup ever – to qualify for the 2009 World Cup, and also beat South Africa 2–1 in an ODI series immediately following the World Cup. George made a combined total of 10 runs in the two wins, but was the only one to make it into double figures in the third ODI.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{made her}} 2006 debut at the Australian Open. Defending the title, Williams lost to Daniela Hantuchová {{in the third}} round. After the tournament, Williams told the press that she was injured, blaming a lack of fitness and a knee injury for keeping her off the court. However, in her biography, Serena claims that she was {{actually}} suffering from depression. Serena stayed away from pro tennis for six months during the 2006 season. After she had shut herself off from {{the world for a}} period, Williams saw a therapist daily. After a chance meeting with a young girl who idolized Serena and believed that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> win, Williams signed up to play in Cincinnati, her first tournament since Melbourne. Williams had slipped to 139 in the world, the lowest ranking she had held since 1997. On her return, Williams defeated Myskina and Bethanie Mattek, before losing in the semifinals to Vera Zvonareva. She also reached the semifinals in Los Angeles, losing to Janković in straight sets. At the US Open, Williams needed a wildcard to enter the tournament, as her ranking at the cut-off time was 139th in the world, outside the automatic 102. However her ranking had improved to 79th by the time the tournament came around. She lost to top-seeded Mauresmo in the fourth round. Following the U.S. Open, she did not play again in 2006, ending the year ranked world No. 95, her lowest year-end ranking since 1997.|$|E

500|$|Dayton {{underwent}} {{gender reassignment}} surgery in 1969 and changed {{her name to}} Barbara. She claimed to have staged the Cooper hijacking two years later, disguised as a man, in order to [...] "get back" [...] at the airline industry and the FAA, whose insurmountable rules and conditions had prevented her from becoming an airline pilot. She said she hid the ransom money in a cistern near her landing point in Woodburn, a suburban area south of Portland, Oregon. Eventually she recanted her entire story, ostensibly after learning that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be charged with the hijacking. The FBI has never commented publicly on Dayton, who died in 2002.|$|E

500|$|Prosecutors {{agreed that}} Cisneros was guilty {{under the law}} of the parties - that she was guilty of the crime of murder even though she did not commit the crime directly. However, {{prosecutors}} failed to word her charge appropriately, suggesting that Cisneros [...] "directly" [...] hired Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez to murder Fischer instead of working through intermediaries. On February 14, a state appeals court in Corpus Christi ordered Cisneros released on a US$50,000 bond, about one-sixth of the original bond posted for her trial. The order stated that the prosecution did not agree to the bail, but the document stated they had failed to file the appropriate paperwork within the mandatory ten days. On February 22, a judge ordered her released from prison. She was unavailable for comment, and it was not known if she returned to Brownsville. Fischer's family denounced the ruling and said the appeals court [...] "seemed to have lost sight" [...] that their son was killed. Brownsville prosecutors said even if there was not enough evidence to convict Cisneros for capital murder, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be convicted of ordinary murder, since the appeal was approved because there was no direct evidence linking Cisneros with a murder-for-hire charge. The reversal was upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in November 1996.|$|E

500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{if there were}} laws dealing with epikleroi prior to Solon's {{legislative}} activity around 594 BCE. According to the 1st century CE writer Plutarch, Solon authored legislation covering the epikleros. Solon's laws attempted to prevent the combination of estates by the marriage of heiresses. Modern historians have seen this {{as part of an}} effort by Solon to maintain a stable number of households. According to Plutarch, Solon also legislated that the husband of an epikleros must have sexual intercourse with her at least three times a month in order to provide her with children to inherit her father's property, but by the time of Pericles (d. 429 BCE) this law is definitely attested. It is unclear whether or not the nearest relative had the power to dissolve an epikleros' [...] previous marriage in order to marry her himself in all cases. The historian Sarah Pomeroy states that most scholars lean towards the opinion that the nearest relative could only dissolve the previous marriage if the heiress had not yet given birth to a son, but Pomeroy also states that this opinion has not yet been definitely proven. Roger Just disagrees and has argued that even if the epikleros had a son <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be forced to marry her nearest relative. Athenian law also required that if the next of kin did not marry the heiress, he had to provide her with a dowry. It may have been Solon who legislated that if the new spouse was unable to fulfill his thrice monthly duties to his wife, she was entitled to have sex with his next of kin so that she could produce an heir to her father's property. Alternatively, she might have been required to divorce and marry the next nearest relative.|$|E

The production came about after Webb met a commissioning editor for BBC Radio 2 at a concert honouring Don Black in late 2013 at which she'd performed two songs from the piece. Asked whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> do the whole show, she suggested that, with a small band, it could be recorded for radio broadcast. The producer Robert Mackintosh then suggested a week's run prior to the recording, the popularity of which led to another three weeks at a second theatre.
