25|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{place the}} sunken island in northern Europe, including Doggerland in the North Sea, and Sweden (by Olof Rudbeck in Atland, 1672–1702). Doggerland, {{as well as}} Viking Bergen Island, {{is thought to have}} been flooded by a megatsunami following the Storegga <b>slide</b> <b>of</b> c. 6100 BC.

25|$|The Hatlestad Slide was a <b>slide</b> <b>of</b> mud {{and rock}} which {{occurred}} {{in the early morning}} of September 14, 2005 in a rural area in Bergen, Norway, as a result of heavy rainfall. The slide killed three people, wounded seven, and displaced many more, as it hit a row of residential houses in its path while the houses' occupants were asleep. The event is notable not only for the loss of life it caused, but also for how it altered Norwegian policies on environmentalism and housing construction, as well as emergency management. In addition, the question on whether or not to end the treatment of fatally wounded Kristina Hjartåker, who was put on a ventilator until her death in February, sparked national debate, both on the case itself and on the ending of life-prolonging treatment in general.|$|E

25|$|Despite the Omni's lack of success, it {{was used}} as the point of {{departure}} for the military M-82 design. While the appearance of the pistol remained the same, the mechanism was completely changed and numerous features copied from the Beretta M-92 including the locking mechanism, the trigger mechanism and the number of rounds (15) in the magazine. However, the open-topped <b>slide</b> <b>of</b> the Beretta was rejected in favour of a traditional closed slide with ejection port. An extractor-mounted loaded chamber indicator, reversible magazine release and ambidextrous safety levers were also included. Military models had a magazine safety, but this could be removed on request for commercial customers. The M-82 began production in 1986 and was adopted by the Spanish forces in 1987 as Modelo M-82 Doble Accion. Commercial models experience difficulties feeding some brands of hollowpoint ammunition, and unsurprisingly, best reliability is achieved with NATO specification ball ammunition.|$|E
25|$|At {{approximately}} 1:30 on {{the morning}} of 14 September 2005, the cliff over the houses of Hatlestad Terrasse broke apart; the resulting <b>slide</b> <b>of</b> clay, mud and rocks did not collapse the buildings. The debris flowed through the ground floors of several houses and buried ten people. Occupants on higher floors were not touched by the flowing debris and were then evacuate through non-first floor windows. The municipality and the city hospital were both put on disaster alert, and a large number of emergency responders, including 12 ambulances, were sent to the scene. The first unit to reach the site was a fire engine which arrived only three minutes after the slide, as it was already in the area, having just completed a water draining mission, and it was able to use its siren to awaken residents for the start of an evacuation. In addition to firefighters and paramedics, the Civil Defense and the National Guard also responded. Search dogs were used to locate survivors because heavy machinery could not be deployed due to the unstable nature of the ground; the extraction of buried survivors was made by hand, and with tools such as axes and shovels.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Adams {{experienced}} two slides {{seven weeks}} apart {{that were the}} largest slides in the Cascades, ignoring the catastrophic landslide eruption of Mount St. Helens, since a slide that occurred on Little Tahoma in 1963. The first occurred {{at the end of}} August and consisted of mainly snow and ice with some rock. It fell from a similar location and in a similar path to the <b>slide</b> <b>of</b> 1921. The second slide that year occurred in late October and originated high on Battlement Ridge just below The Castle. It consisted of mainly rock and flowed three miles down the Klickitat Glacier and the Big Muddy Creek streambed. Both slides were estimated to have moved as much as [...] of material.|$|E
500|$|The Trout Lake Mudflow is the {{youngest}} large debris flow from Adams and the only large one {{since the end of}} the last Ice Age. The flow dammed Trout Creek and covered [...] of the White Salmon River valley. Impounded water later formed Trout Lake. The Great <b>Slide</b> <b>of</b> 1921 started close to the headwall of the White Salmon Glacier and was the largest avalanche on Adams in historic time. The slide fell about [...] and its debris covered about [...] of the upper Salt Creek area. Steam vents were reported active at the slide source for three years, leading to speculation that the event was started with a small steam explosion. This was the only debris flow in Mount Adams' recorded history, but there are five known lahars.|$|E
500|$|At {{the barber}} shop, Ramsey {{explains}} to Morales his {{theory that the}} Phantom attacks every 21 days. The next attack falls {{on the day of}} a high school prom, and decoys are set up on the edges of town. After the dance, on April 14, trombone player Peggy Loomis leaves with her boyfriend Roy Allen. Despite her worries, they go to Spring Lake Park in the middle of town. When they leave, the Phantom jumps on the driver's door and pulls Roy out of the car, causing Peggy to crash. She flees as the Phantom beats Roy, but he catches her and ties her hands around a tree. Roy awakens, but is shot to death while attempting to escape. The Phantom attaches a pocket knife to the distal end of the <b>slide</b> <b>of</b> Peggy's trombone and kills her while [...] "playing" [...] the instrument by repeatedly projecting the slide-with-knife forward into her back while she is tied to the tree.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{from the}} fact that the slide took place {{virtually}} at the same time as Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, it was widely covered by the Norwegian media, and is still referred to in news and articles on severe weather and climate change, sometimes along with the lesser <b>slide</b> <b>of</b> Hetlebakken (see section Other 2005 precipitation-induced [...] ). However, with the exception of the deceased, most notably Kristina Hjartåker, most victims avoided being personally named in the media, with the exception of those who voluntarily gave interviews to papers such as Bergens Tidende and Fanaposten.|$|E

30|$|The {{fluidized}} {{coarse silt}} with sheared {{sand and silt}} layers may {{have been responsible for}} minor <b>sliding</b> <b>of</b> the SSDs horizons, which introduced shear stress within the liquefied layer below the surface. In particular, the interval E obviously shows <b>sliding</b> <b>of</b> the beds. The Locs. 9 and 9 - 1 are close to the buried flexure (Fig.  3), which was active during the Pleistocene (Sakai and Gajurel, 2012) and its activity could be the trigger of slidings. Tilting of the surface was the only possible trigger for sliding, because the environment of sedimentation was almost flat. This result suggests that <b>sliding</b> <b>of</b> the plain area could happen in conjunction with future large earthquakes centered around the Kathmandu Valley. As the future studies, the distribution of seismites hosting evidence <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> within the valley should be specified for creation of the hazard map indicating the possibility <b>of</b> <b>sliding</b> {{as well as for the}} risk management of the plain area.|$|R

2500|$|The Ruger SR40 {{started to}} ship in October 2010 to dealers. This is a {{full-size}} variant chambered in [...]40 S. The full-size [...]40 S magazines hold 15 rounds. The SR40 ships with two 15-round, flush-fit magazines and a loading tool. The basic overall dimensions and barrel {{length of the}} SR40 {{are the same as}} for the SR9, though the through-hardened stainless steel slide was modified and is [...] wider than the <b>slide</b> <b>of</b> the SR9. According to Ruger, the added mass of the SR40 slide reduces slide velocity during cycling to help reduce felt recoil and increase service life expectancy.|$|E
2500|$|Creating {{music with}} a <b>slide</b> <b>of</b> some type has been traced back to {{primitive}} stringed instruments in African culture and also to {{the origin of the}} steel guitar in Hawaii. [...] Near {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, blues musicians in the Mississippi Delta popularized the bottleneck slide guitar style, and the first recording of slide guitar was by Sylvester Weaver in 1923. Since the 1930s, performers including Robert Nighthawk, Earl Hooker, Elmore James and Muddy Waters popularized slide guitar in the electric blues genre and influenced later slide guitarists in the rock genre including the Rolling Stones, George Harrison, Duane Allman and Ry Cooder.|$|E
