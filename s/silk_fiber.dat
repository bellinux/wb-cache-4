The materials maintain the structural hierarchy and mechanical properties of natural silks, including a modulus of 11 ± 4 GPa, even higher than natural spider silk.

5000|$|Unlike most fabric/yard goods {{which are}} {{sold by the}} yard (or metre), silk is sold to the {{wholesaler}} by weight. The first step in processing the <b>silk</b> <b>fiber</b> is [...] "degumming the fibre," [...] the gum being a byproduct of {{the production of the}} silk fibre by the worm. Approximately one-fifth of the weight of the silk fibre is lost in the degumming process, and manufacturers felt they had the [...] "right" [...] to replace this lost weight with a filler of some sort. Silk has an affinity for several metallic salts, the most common of which being iron, lead, and tin. It was discovered to be an easy process to return this weight lost in the degumming process by soaking the fibre in a bath of these metallic salts. This process was called weighting, and by increasing the weight of the raw silk, the merchant increased his profit. Weighting with some metallic salts did improve the drapeability of the fibre; however greedy merchants soon began adding more weight than the lost one-fifth; sometimes the final weight was increased tenfold.|$|E
