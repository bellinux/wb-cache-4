5|$|The <b>solid-state</b> device {{came into}} its own with the {{invention}} of the transistor in 1947. Common <b>solid-state</b> devices include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, <b>solid-state</b> drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E
5|$|All the {{elements}} commonly recognised as metalloids (or their compounds) {{have been used}} in the semiconductor or <b>solid-state</b> electronic industries.|$|E
5|$|FX console (1965) – double manual {{with sound}} effects. Designed to be quieter than the Mk II, with a {{different}} DC motor and a <b>solid-state</b> power amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Having {{already made}} their name {{producing}} <b>solid-state</b> pre-/power- amplifier separates, Naim launched a low-powered integrated amplifier that embodies {{the qualities of}} its amplifiers, aimed at cost-conscious audiophiles.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, ionic {{compounds}} {{are often}} used as precursors for high-temperature <b>solid-state</b> synthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrical}} properties of silicon and germanium enabled {{the establishment of}} the semiconductor industry in the 1950s and the development of <b>solid-state</b> electronics from the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Controller {{advances}} have exploited dramatic {{increases in the}} voltage and current ratings and switching frequency of <b>solid-state</b> power devices {{over the past six}} decades. Introduced in 1983, the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) has {{in the past two decades}} come to dominate VFDs as an inverter switching device.|$|E
5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} <b>solid-state</b> synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a <b>solid-state</b> reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E
5|$|Older vacuum tube-based {{communications}} receivers are affectionately {{known as}} boatanchors for their large size and weight. Such receivers include the Collins R-390 and R-390A, the RCA AR-88, the Racal RA-17L and the Marconi Elettra. However, even modern <b>solid-state</b> receivers {{can be very}} large and heavy, such as the Plessey PR2250, the Redifon R551 or the Rohde & Schwarz EK070.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, 2015, Microsoft {{announced}} Xbox One Elite—a new SKU with a 1TB <b>solid-state</b> hybrid {{drive and}} an Elite controller. It {{was released in}} November 2015 and retails for US$499.99. In the US, the Elite bundle was a timed exclusive to GameStop and Microsoft Store.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro also {{supported}} Serial ATA <b>solid-state</b> drives (SSD) in the 4 hard drive bays via an SSD-to-hard drive sled adapter (mid-2010 models and later), and by third-party solutions for earlier models (e.g., by an adapter/bracket which plugged into an unused PCIe slot). Various 2.5-inch SSD drive capacities and configurations were available as options.|$|E
5|$|The Pro-Line {{series was}} durable and fault-tolerant, with many models lasting for years. However, because they used <b>solid-state</b> amplifiers, {{they are not}} as highly {{regarded}} as the older tube-based Leslies, because they lack the characteristic sound when the amp is overdriven.|$|E
5|$|The {{contributions}} of Salam and Ward to the Standard Model {{were used in}} the development of the theoretical structure of the Higgs boson. Ward also made contributions to quantum mechanics, fermion theory, quantum <b>solid-state</b> physics, and statistical mechanics and the Ising model.|$|E
5|$|Write {{amplification}} (WA) is an undesirable phenomenon {{associated with}} flash memory and <b>solid-state</b> drives (SSDs) where the actual {{amount of information}} physically written to the storage media is a multiple of the logical amount intended to be written.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{selenide}} was {{the first}} material for blue LEDs, but gallium nitride is dominating the market now. Cadmium selenide was an important component in quantum dots. Sheets of amorphous selenium convert X-ray images to patterns of charge in xeroradiography and in <b>solid-state,</b> flat-panel X-ray cameras. Ionized selenium (Se+24) {{is one of the}} active mediums used in X-ray lasers.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other <b>solid-state</b> welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|As an even-numbered lanthanide, in {{accordance}} with the Oddo-Harkins rule, ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, thulium and lutetium, which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it has few commercial applications. Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the , a <b>solid-state</b> laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by <b>solid-state</b> devices such as the transistor.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{introduced}} {{their first}} integrated circuit (IC) model, the Concorde, in 1971. The company had stopped manufacturing tonewheel organs entirely by 1975, {{due to increased}} financial inefficiency, and switched to making IC models full-time. Console models included the 8000 Aurora (1976) and 8000M Aurora (1977), which contained drawbars and a built-in rotating speaker. Spinet organs included the Romance series, manufactured between 1977 and 1983. In 1979, a Japanese offshoot, Nihon Hammond, introduced the X-5, a portable <b>solid-state</b> clone of the B-3.|$|E
5|$|In {{some unusual}} ionic compounds: fast ion conductors, and ionic glasses, {{one or more}} of the ionic {{components}} has a significant mobility, allowing conductivity even while the material as a whole remains solid. This is often highly temperature dependant, and may be the result of either a phase change or a high defect concentration. These materials are used in all <b>solid-state</b> supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells, and in various kinds of chemical sensors.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing basic ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Ionic compounds without these ions are also known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. Ionic compounds can also be produced from their constituent ions by evaporation of their solvent, precipitation, freezing, a <b>solid-state</b> reaction, or the electron transfer reaction of reactive metals with reactive non-metals, such as halogen gases.|$|E
5|$|Samarium-doped calcium {{fluoride}} crystals {{were used as}} an active medium {{in one of the}} first <b>solid-state</b> lasers designed and constructed by Peter Sorokin (co-inventor of the dye laser) and Mirek Stevenson at IBM research labs in early 1961. This samarium laser emitted pulses of red light at 708.5nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and thus did not find practical applications.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium {{is used in}} cadmium {{telluride}} (CdTe) solar panels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests of tellurium demonstrated {{some of the greatest}} efficiencies for solar cell electric power generators. Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased tellurium demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a <b>solid-state</b> X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges.|$|E
5|$|Thulium is the second-least {{abundant}} of the lanthanides after promethium, {{which is}} only found in trace quantities on Earth. It is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery-gray luster. It is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air. Despite its high price and rarity, thulium is used as the radiation source in portable X-ray devices, and in some <b>solid-state</b> lasers. It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic.|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} of the machine were produced. The first was the world's first transistorised computer, and became operational in November 1953. The second version was completed in April 1955. The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 <b>solid-state</b> diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. The machine did however make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry {{to read and write}} on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorised computer, a distinction that went to the Harwell CADET of 1955.|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{is used in}} {{light-emitting}} devices called xenon flash lamps, used in photographic {{flashes and}} stroboscopic lamps; to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light; and, occasionally, in bactericidal lamps. The first <b>solid-state</b> laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a xenon flash lamp, and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target {{and in the}} first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6micrograms) of berkelium by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years. This irradiation method was and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most <b>solid-state</b> studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.|$|E
5|$|The Leslie was {{originally}} designed to mimic the complex tones and constantly shifting sources of sound emanating from {{a large group of}} ranks in a pipe organ. The effect varies depending on the speed of the rotors, which can be toggled between fast (tremolo) and slow (chorale) using a console half-moon or pedal switch, with the most distinctive effect occurring as the speaker rotation speed changes. The most popular Leslies were the 122, which accepted a balanced signal suitable for console organs, and the 147, which accepted an unbalanced signal and could be used for spinet organs with a suitable adapter. The Pro-Line series of Leslies which were made to be portable for gigging bands using <b>solid-state</b> amps were popular during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|They {{designed}} and built the telemetry modules {{in their homes and}} garages but they were only able to sell a few hundred units. Mims had sold a feature article about the new <b>solid-state</b> device, light-emitting diodes, to Popular Electronics (circulation 400,000) that May. With the hope of selling kits to the larger readership; Roberts and Mims designed a device that would transmit voice over a beam of light, the Opticom. The editors accepted the project story and both articles were featured {{on the cover of the}} November 1970 issue. The payment for the articles was $400 but meeting Les Solomon, Popular Electronics technical editor, proved to be significant to both Mims and Roberts future success.|$|E
5|$|Windows Mobile 6.5, Windows RT {{and core}} edition of Windows 8.1 include device encryption, a feature-limited version of BitLocker that encrypts the whole system. Logging {{in with a}} Microsoft account with {{administrative}} privileges automatically begins the encryption process. The recovery key is stored to either the Microsoft account or Active Directory, allowing it to be retrieved from any computer. While device encryption is offered on all versions of 8.1, unlike BitLocker, device encryption requires that the device meet the InstantGo (formerly Connected Standby) specifications, which requires <b>solid-state</b> drives, non-removable RAM (to protect against cold boot attacks) and a TPM 2.0 chip.|$|E

25|$|A hybrid {{amplifier}} involves {{one of two}} {{combinations of}} tube and <b>solid-state</b> amplification. It may have a tube power amp fed by a <b>solid-state</b> pre-amp circuit, as {{in most of the}} original MusicMan Amps, later amplifier models from Alamo Electronics, the Fender Super Champ XD, and the Roland Bolt amplifier. Randall Amplifiers V2 and T2 use hybrid amp technology. Alternatively, a tube pre-amp can feed a <b>solid-state</b> output stage, as in models from Kustom, Hartke, SWR and Vox. This approach dispenses with the need for an output transformer and easily achieves modern power levels.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that {{transmitters}} with vacuum tubes are better able to survive lightning strikes than transistor transmitters do. While it was commonly believed that at RF power levels above approximately 20 kilowatts, vacuum tubes were more efficient than <b>solid-state</b> circuits, this is no longer the case, especially in medium wave (AM broadcast) service where <b>solid-state</b> transmitters at nearly all power levels have measurably higher efficiency. FM broadcast transmitters with <b>solid-state</b> power amplifiers up to approximately 15kW also show better overall power efficiency than tube-based power amplifiers.|$|E
