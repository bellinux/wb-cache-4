40|$|Abstract â€” A 3 D {{laser scanner}} is built {{by adding a}} {{rotating}} mirror to a conventional 2 D scanner. The scanners are deployed on four robots to build full 3 D representations of an indoor environment. An original representation mechanism referred to as occupancy lists, rather than standard 2 D free space grids, is used to maintain the 3 D map. Localization is done by extracting horizontal <b>sub-ceiling</b> cross-sections. Taking cross-sections from near the ceiling in this way results in more reliable and time invariant maps. Experimental results show inter-robot sightings and the sharing of map data aid mapping by improving the reliability of localization. Mapping with four robots reduced the average position error from 0. 35 m for single robot operation to 0. 1 m when cooperating...|$|E
