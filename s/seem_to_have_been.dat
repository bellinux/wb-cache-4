5|$|From various {{symbolic}} motifs the tapestries <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made {{to celebrate}} a marriage, probably that of Anne of Brittany (1477–1514) and Louis XII of France (1462–1515). The royal arms of Louis and Anne would have once decorated the sky {{in most of the}} tapestries.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{forces in}} Asia Minor <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reorganised in 497 BC, {{with three of}} Darius's sons-in-law, Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes, taking charge of three armies. Herodotus {{suggests}} that these generals divided up the rebellious lands between themselves and then set out to attack their respective areas.|$|E
5|$|The Persians <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{reluctant}} {{to resort to}} naval action. There was some minor Sasanian naval action in 620-23, and the only major Byzantine navy's action was during the Siege of Constantinople (626).|$|E

5|$|The third Persian army, {{under the}} command of Otanes and Artaphernes, {{attacked}} Ionia and Aeolia. They re-took Clazomenae and Cyme, probably in 497 BC, but then <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> less active in 496 BC and 495 BC, probably {{as a result of the}} calamity in Caria.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer in the set is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in the set. This problem does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not necessarily vice versa.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> driven by competition for resources but instead {{by the fact that}} each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E

5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> vestigial. The {{bones of the}} forearm (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% {{of the length of}} the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held straight, and the elbow joint was immobile.|$|E
5|$|Fleshy lobe-fins {{supported}} on bones rather than ray-stiffened fins <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an ancestral trait of all bony fishes (Osteichthyes). The lobe-finned {{ancestors of the}} tetrapods evolved them further, while the ancestors of the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) evolved their fins in a different direction. The most primitive group of actinopterygians, the bichirs, still have fleshy frontal fins.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{the title}} Cakravarti <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{commonly}} used in the Pandyan kingdom as a caste or job title. Compound titles exist, such as Maravacakravarti that belonged to a Maravar chief as well as Malavacakravarti that belonged to a Malava chief. Ariyar in Tamil could denote a noble or a learned person, a Brahmin or alternatively a person from Aryavarta. Thus the title Arayacakravarti seems to fit the structure of similarly used titles across the Pandyan kingdom.|$|E

5|$|In Zambia, Gryllotalpa africana is held {{to bring}} {{good fortune to}} anyone who sees it. In Latin America, Scapteriscus and Neocurtilla mole crickets are said to predict rain when they dig into the ground.

5|$|In response, {{a series}} of {{potential}} heirs <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> selected, among them Tiberius and his brother Drusus. In 24BC {{at the age of}} seventeen Tiberius entered politics under Augustus' direction, receiving the position of quaestor, and was granted the right to stand for election as praetor and consul five years in advance of the age required by law. Similar provisions were made for Drusus.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{the area}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used for summer grazing, Costa <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{populated}} year-round only since 1300.

50|$|The Ormond {{manor house}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> at the {{southern}} end of the village. It was still standing when Fritwell was assessed for the hearth tax in 1655 but <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> demolished by 1677, when a map of the village was made that showed no trace of it. Dovehouse Farm <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> built on its site and incorporating fragments of the old house. A large dovecote was built for it in 1702 and was still standing in 1897. By 1955 the dovecote had gone and the farm <b>had</b> <b>been</b> renamed Lodge Farm.|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the first}} two years of Timesitheus's {{prefecture}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> spent producing a stable environment in which government of any sort could be carried on. His main weapon <b>to</b> this end <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> strengthen the authority of the Praetorian Prefecture, his own office, and to move equestrians with a fiscal background - such as himself - into positions of power. The main effect of his manoeuvring <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the kind of men who had carried on the government under Alexander Severus were restored to effective office.|$|R
5|$|Schubert's piano sonatas <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mostly {{neglected}} {{during the}} entire nineteenth century, often dismissed for being too long, lacking in formal coherence, being un-pianistic, etc. However, references to the last sonatas can be found among two nineteenth-century Romantic composers who took serious interest in Schubert's music and were influenced by it: Schumann and Brahms.|$|E
5|$|Sigurd {{was in the}} {{fortunate}} position that on his accession to the earldom there <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> no other serious contenders.
