Such <b>superpositions</b> of vortex states are formed by adiabatic manipulation of interacting ultracold atoms confined to a one-dimensional ring trapping potential when stirred by a barrier.

Adiabaticity conditions for changing the stirring rate reveal that <b>superpositions</b> of many atoms are most easily accessed in the strongly-interacting, Tonks-Girardeau, regime, {{which is also the}} most robust at finite temperature. NOON-type <b>superpositions</b> of weakly interacting atoms are most easily created by adiabatically decreasing the interaction strength by means of a Feshbach resonance.

25|$|When {{considering}} psycho-physical parallelism, <b>superpositions</b> appear {{rich enough}} to represent primitive conscious awareness.

Quantum theory would admit their <b>superpositions,</b> too, thus giving rise to a far greater variety of physical states which may be experienced by the subjective observer.

40|$|Abstract: A simple {{experimental}} procedure {{based on}} the Elitzur-Vaidman scheme is proposed to test the persistence of macroscopic <b>superpositions.</b> It is conjectured that its implementation will reveal the persistence of <b>superpositions</b> of macroscopic objects {{in the absence of}} a direct act of observation. PACS: 03. 65. Bz Schroedinger’s cats have kept physicists mulling since their appearance in [1] and the properties of macroscopic <b>superpositions</b> are still hotly debated. The apparent impossiblity to detect <b>superpositions</b> of macroscopic objects (e. g. cats which are at the same time dead and alive) has given rise in recent years to a theory of environment-induced decoherence (see [7] for a detailed introduction to its different aspects and [9] for a survey of alternative approaches) which attributes the apparent absence of macroscopic <b>superpositions</b> to environment-induced perturbations. We propose here a simple experimental procedure based on Elitzur-Vaidman’s ”interaction-free measurement” to test the persistence of macroscopic <b>superpositions.</b> According to current environment-induced decoherence theory ([7]), the impossibility to detect macroscopic <b>superpositions</b> is induced by the system’s interaction with the environment. Our present experimental procedure tests this claim, yielding different outcomes in the case when state vector reduction takes place (e. g. the cat is either dead or alive) and in the case where random phase changes affect macroscopic <b>superpositions.</b> We conjecture that the implementation of our experimental procedure will reveal the persistence of <b>superpositions</b> of macroscopic objects {{in the absence of a}} direct act of observation. Interaction-free measurement is considered in the Elitzur-Vaidman scheme ([4], see also [6]) and in earlier work by Dicke ([3]) and Renninger ([2]). In the Elitzur-Vaidman scheme, which has attracted considerable interest in recent years (see e. g. [8]), a robust interference technique is used to ascertain a system’s unknown macroscopic properties. The theoretical arguments motivating the present proposal are set forth in [5], but they are not strictl...|$|R

5|$|Certain quantum effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a <b>superposition</b> of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, {{it is impossible to}} control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of <b>superposition</b> to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E

25|$|The {{second type}} is named the <b>superposition</b> eye. The <b>superposition</b> eye {{is divided into}} three types; the refracting, the {{reflecting}} and the parabolic <b>superposition</b> eye. The refracting <b>superposition</b> eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom, and no side wall. Each lens takes light at an angle to its axis and reflects it to the same angle on the other side. The result is an image at half the radius of the eye, which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are. This type of compound eye, for which a minimal size exists below which effective <b>superposition</b> cannot occur, is normally found in nocturnal insects, because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes, though at the cost of reduced resolution. In the parabolic <b>superposition</b> compound eye type, seen in arthropods such as mayflies, the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array. Long-bodied decapod crustaceans such as shrimp, prawns, crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting <b>superposition</b> eyes, which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses.|$|E
