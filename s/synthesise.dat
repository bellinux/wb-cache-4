5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to <b>synthesise</b> ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} <b>synthesise</b> other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E

Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of using commensurate lines {{is that the}} commensurate line theory allows circuits to be <b>synthesised</b> from a prescribed frequency function. While any circuit using arbitrary transmission line lengths can be analysed to determine its frequency function, that circuit cannot necessarily be easily <b>synthesised</b> starting from the frequency function. The fundamental problem is that using more than one length generally requires more than one frequency variable. Using commensurate lines requires only one frequency variable. A well developed theory exists for <b>synthesising</b> lumped element circuits from a given frequency function. Any circuit so <b>synthesised</b> {{can be converted to}} a commensurate line circuit using Richards' transformation and a new frequency variable.|$|R

5|$|Edgar was {{concerned}} about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform rules {{to be followed by}} all. The rules were set out in the key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the Concordia was the regularisation of the form of church services, and Æthelwold tried to <b>synthesise</b> what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice.|$|E

30|$|The {{synthesis}} of the maleamic acids involves {{the opening of the}} anhydride cycle (Fig.  1). We have slowly added the solution of MA in dimethylformamide (DMF) to the solution of aniline derivative in DMF. The final solution is easily stirred at room temperature for 2  h. The compounds are obtained by semiamide (maleamic acid) precipitation in water with ice, filtration and recrystallization from methanol with different final yields depending which aniline derivative has been used [37]: 17  % for the monomer <b>synthesised</b> with para-aminobenzoic acid (M 1), 34  % for the monomer <b>synthesised</b> with para-nitroaniline (M 2), 27  % for the monomer <b>synthesised</b> with 4,N,N diethyl aniline (M 4) and 80  % for the monomer <b>synthesised</b> with 2, 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine (M 7).

5|$|Renal {{disease may}} lead to hyperparathyroidism. When too much calcium is lost, there is a {{compensation}} by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands hypertrophy to <b>synthesise</b> more parathyroid hormone. This is known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
5|$|While many {{bacteria}} and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, {{they also have}} another type of polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself. This enzyme is found in bacteria, mitochondria, plastids and as a constituent of the archaeal exosome (in those archaea that have an exosome). It can <b>synthesise</b> a 3' extension where {{the vast majority of}} the bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, polyadenylation by polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes degradation of the RNA in plastids and likely also archaea.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{are further}} divided into lithotrophs that use {{inorganic}} electron donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron donors. Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds {{as a source}} of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction. This reaction releases energy {{that can be used to}} <b>synthesise</b> ATP and drive metabolism. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the electron acceptor. In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds, such as nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively.|$|E

5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, <b>synthesise</b> vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to <b>synthesise</b> amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E

Their attempts at the latter two involve targets of 248Cm with projectiles of 54Cr and 51V respectively; the reaction of 248Cm with 55Mn would produce the same isotopes of element 121 as the JINR's suggested reaction of 249Bk with 54Cr in the 3n (300Ubu) and 4n (299Ubu) channels. Before this, the RIKEN team had successfully produced livermorium (element 116) in the fusion of 248Cm with 48Ca, and will next try to produce new isotopes of oganesson (element 118) in the fusion of 248Cm with 50Ti.|$|E

40|$|Anionic {{polymerisation}} {{techniques have}} been optimised {{to develop a}} “one-pot”, facile method to produce both linear and branched polystyrenes utilising the “Strathclyde” route to highly branched structures. ATRP was investigated as a possible method but anionic polymerisation was found to give much better control over the size and structure of polystyrenes produced. Using this anionic polymerisation relatively monodisperse linear polystyrenes were <b>synthesised</b> with dispersity values as low as 1. 03 for a polystyrene chain with a targeted degree of polymerisation (DPn) of 100 monomer units. A number of different structures of branched polystyrene were <b>synthesised,</b> and their different physical properties examined by viscometry measurements and differential calorimetry scanning experiments. It {{has been found that}} very dense, highly branched materials (with approximations of 48 polymer chains branched together) can be <b>synthesised</b> with a targeted primary chain DPn = 10 monomer units. Weight average molecular weight (Mw) values as high as 992, 000 gmol- 1 for branched polystyrene can be <b>synthesised</b> with a primary chain length of DPn = 50 monomer units. Functional polystyrenes were <b>synthesised</b> both by initiation with an amine containing compound and sec-BuLi, resulting in chain end functionalisation, and also post-functionalised by sulphonation of <b>synthesised</b> polystyrenes, resulting in a statistical distribution along the polymer chains pendant groups. The hydrophilicity could be manipulated by the percentage of sulphonation. At over 30 % sulphonation of the pendant polystyrene groups, the polymers become water soluble. Polymer nanoparticles have been <b>synthesised</b> by a nanoprecipitation method from functionalised branched polystyrene <b>synthesised</b> by anionic polymerisation techniques. Nanoparticles <b>synthesised</b> from DPn 10 branched sulphonated polystyrenes were analysed by dynamic light scattering and found to be approximately 60 nm with dispersity values as low as 0. 15. They were found to be stable after 6 months ambienmt storage, and some preliminary testing on the encapsulation of Oil red suggests that the nanoparticles may be capable of encapsulating hydrophobic drugs...|$|R
5|$|Unbiunium has not {{yet been}} synthesised. Nevertheless, because it is only three {{elements}} away from the heaviest known element, oganesson (element 118), its synthesis may come in the near future; it is expected {{to be one of the}} last few reachable elements with current technology, and the limit may be anywhere between element 120 and 124. It will also likely be far more difficult to <b>synthesise</b> than the elements known so far up to 118, and still more difficult than elements 119 and 120.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the idea that plants could <b>synthesise</b> almost all their tissues from {{atmospheric}} gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would take many more years. Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between the pigment chlorophyll and starch production was finally made in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915.|$|E
5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to <b>synthesise</b> aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E
