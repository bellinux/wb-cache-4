2500|$|When Griffin took power, {{he sought}} to banish overt anti-Semitic {{discourse}} from the party. He informed party members that [...] "we {{can get away with}} criticising Zionists, but any criticism of Jews is likely to be legal and political suicide". In 2006, he complained that the [...] "obsession" [...] that many BNP members had with [...] "the Jews" [...] was [...] "insane and politically disastrous". In 2004, the party selected a Jewish candidate, Pat Richardson, to <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> during local council elections, something Tyndall lambasted as a [...] "gimmick". References to Jews in BNP literature were often coded to hide the party's electorally unpalatable anti-Semitic ideas. For instance, the term [...] "Zionists" [...] was often used in party literature as a euphemism for [...] "Jews". As noted by Macklin, Griffin still framed many of his arguments [...] "within the parameters of recognizably anti-Semitic discourse". The BNP's literature is replete with references to a conspiratorial group who have sought to suppress nationalist sentiment among the British population, who have encouraged immigration and mixed race relationships, and who are promoting the Islamification of the country. This group is likely a reference to the Jews, an old fascist canard.|$|E
