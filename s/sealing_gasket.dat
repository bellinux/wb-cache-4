50|$|The cams {{at the end}} of each lever on {{the female}} end align with a {{circumferential}} groove on the male end. When the levers are rotated to the locked position, they pull the male end into the female socket, creating a tight seal up against a gasket. The arms lock into position using an over-center arrangement, preventing accidental decoupling. Because the groove is cut all the way around the male end, there is no specific alignment necessary to couple as there would be with threaded connectors, and there is no opportunity for cross-threading. This results in an error-resistant, faster coupling operation. Because the compression between the two fittings is limited by the size of the cams on the end of the levers and the rotation of the levers themselves, there is also no possibility of over- or under-tightening the fitting; the pressure against the <b>sealing</b> <b>gasket</b> is effectively constant from one coupling operation to the next, reducing possibility of leaks.|$|E

The structure, material, {{production}} and application situation of metal winding gasket were summarized, and the preparation technology and product properties of metal winding gasket were analyzed. The results showed: {{under the same}} gasket stress, the leakage rate increased {{with the increase of}} medium pressure; Under the same medium pressure, the leakage rate declined with the increase of the gasket stress. By comparing with the performance of traditional asbestos winding gasket, the new metal winding gasket’s performance has reached the requirement of asbestos winding gasket and can replace asbestos winding gasket.

The effect of contact with can coatings, <b>sealing</b> <b>gaskets</b> and the epoxidised oils used in gasket manufacture on furan formation was studied. The objective was to identify factors affecting furan formation. Furan present in heat-processed food samples persisted during cooking. Furan was shown to form in foods on heating, although it did not accumulate to a significant degree on heating in an open vessel. There were no interactions between foods and cans, can coatings or gaskets that had a significant influence on furan formation. Furan accumulated particularly in heat-processed canned and jarred foods because they are sealed containers that receive a considerable thermal load.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} water {{transport}} behavior in PEFC, {{particularly in the}} area situated between flowfield and <b>sealing</b> <b>gasket.</b> An in situ investigation of fundamental water and gas transport effects in this edge region was performed by means of neutron radiography. Five different 50 cm 2 test cell setups were operated, basically differing in the applied sealing solution, whereby it was accounted for the requirements posed by metallic bipolar plates. Main influencing factors on the water transport were identified, namely channel geometry, gas inlet humidification, temperature and gas pressure under static and dynamic conditions. It {{was found that the}} design of the edge region can have a significant influence on water transport properties and water accumulation in the cell. Depending on its gas accessibility, the edge region can act as a reservoir for water accumulation. Time constants for water transport can be shifted to the range of hours, which is crucial for an effective water removal as it is essential for cold starts. In addition, relatively wide edge channels, as required for sub-gasket based cell setups, can enable strong bypass flows around the flowfield and thus lower the effective stoichiometry, which can {{have a significant impact on}} the water content in the flowfield...|$|E

40|$|It is {{the object}} of the {{presented}} paper to provide an electromechanical rotary valve actuating system for opening and closing valves of an internal combustion engine capable of separately controlling both the inlet and exhaust valve operations of each individual cylinder in a multi-cylinder engine. This indicates that only one valve will be required for each cylinder of the engine. Previously published versions of this concept require a separate valve for intake and exhaust in each cylinder. The system provides an alternative to the camshaft assembly in an attempt to overcome the limitations and inadequacies inevitably posed by a fully mechanical system. The prototype development is approached in a theoretical manner beginning with the conceptualization and design of a rotating disk with a notches and corresponding closure surfaces to open and close the flow path. The actuated disk and notch design is then refined and followed by the design of an inlet and exhaust manifold to correspond to the valve design and the theorizing and design of a <b>sealing</b> <b>gasket.</b> The rotating speed of the valve is determined by a general idling speed and can be varied to provide variable valve timing with the motor. The final assembly eliminates a majority of the moving parts currently used in camshaft systems like the cam camshaft rocker arm push rod and springs and results in a significantly lighter valve actuation system. By eliminating the translatory motion of valves the problem of valves slamming on the valve seats at high velocities is eliminated thus greatly reducing engine wear...|$|E

40|$|Energy saving is {{strongly}} affected by air leakages which also influence IAQ. Particularly, several {{studies show that}} the air-tightness energy losses contribution of the windows ranges up to 40 %, with a value 15 % higher than that predicted by the ASHRAE. Such values confirm the high influence of the windows and the possibility to significantly reduce heat losses by ventilation by only operating on the windows. Furthermore, inefficiency of windows is often combined with unsealed rolling-shutter boxes and a bad mounting of the window. On the other hand, in the ventilation system design, air-tightness is generally neglected and included in the air change rate due to mechanical ventilation system. Such a practice increases energy consumptions and improves indoor air quality; on the contrary, a wrong assessment of the contribution of air infiltration can lead to the over-sizing of the ventilation system in the design phase. To better understand the influence of the windowed components on the air change rate under a pressure difference value of 50 Pa, the class of air-tightness should be assessed for each tested component, in compliance with EN 12207 Standard, and as a function of: (i) the type of material, (ii) the presence of the seal; (iii) the type of closure; (iv) the sealing of the door; (v) the maintenance condition. In this paper, the Authors present the first experimental results of air-tightness measurements carried out in three residential buildings in which windows retrofit consisted in <b>sealing</b> <b>gasket</b> on the wooden window and replacing them with PVC or aluminum windows. Moreover, the effectiveness of investigated windows retrofits has been estimated in terms of energy saving by using the fan pressurization method. Obtained results showed a high variability of the air permeability although windows used for retrofit were characterized by lowest permeability values according to EN Standard 12207. This was mainly due to the poor care devoted during the windows installation and the lack of tests...|$|E
