40|$|Immunoglobulin A (IgA) {{deficiency}} occurs {{more frequently}} in patients with celiac disease (CD) than {{in the general population}} and can lead to false-negative results in the best serologic <b>test</b> <b>for</b> CD, endomysial IgA (EMA). To evaluate the impact of IgA deficiency on serologic detection of CD in a reference laboratory setting, IgA levels were measured in 510 consecutive serum specimens <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> EMA; 510 consecutive serum specimens <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> Helicobacter pylori IgG testing served as a gastrointestinal symptom control group. The frequency of IgA deficiency was significantly higher among the specimens <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> EMA (5. 1 %) than among the specimens from the symptom control group (1. 4 %). Three subsets of sera from the group of specimens <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> EMA were then tested by additional serologic assays for CD; these subsets were EMA-positive sera (n = 25), EMA-negative, IgA-deficient sera (n = 26), and control sera (from EMA-negative, IgA-nondeficient patients age matched to IgA-deficient patients; n = 26). The proportions of EMA-positive sera positive by other assays for CD were 92 % for transglutaminase IgA (TG-IgA), 80 % for gliadin IgA, 84 % for gliadin IgG, 60 % for endomysial IgG (EMG), and 32 % for transglutaminase IgG (TG-IgG). Very low proportions (0 to 8 %) of IgA-deficient sera and control sera were positive for TG-IgA, gliadin IgA, EMG, and TG-IgG. Eight of 26 (31 %) IgA-deficient serum samples were positive for gliadin IgG, whereas 3 of 26 (12 %) control serum samples were positive for gliadin IgG, but this difference was not statistically significant. Physicians supplied clinical data for 18 of 26 patients with IgA deficiency; only 4 patients had undergone small-bowel biopsy, and 0 of 4 patients showed villous atrophy. These findings show that IgA deficiency is found more frequently among sera <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> EMA in a reference laboratory setting, but there was no clear-cut serologic or clinical evidence of CD in EMA-negative, IgA-deficient patients...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a method of performing surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is to screen specimens <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> Clostridium difficile <b>testing.</b> We compared this approach to our focused surveillance program of high-risk units during October 1997 to compare the yield of VRE and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDRE) with both methods.

Although stools <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> C. difficile <b>testing</b> resulted in a higher percentage of positive cultures, 14 VRE- and 2 MDRE-positive patients from our high-risk population were missed because many patients had no stool <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> C. difficile <b>testing.</b> Therefore, while screening stools <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> C. difficile <b>testing</b> cannot replace our focused surveillance program, it appears advantageous to assess these stools at various intervals to detect new patient reservoirs of drug-resistant organisms that may benefit from routine surveillance cultures...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Cats are {{the second}} most <b>tested</b> animal <b>for</b> rabies each year in Massachusetts. In {{order to reduce the}} cost of rabies prevention, trap-spay/neuter-return (TNR) {{programs}} for feral cats can be used to reduce the population of cats, thus reducing potential rabies exposure. This is significant to public health because reducing the free-roaming cat population may not only reduce exposure to rabies, but reduce rabies prevention costs, freeing resources which can be used on other interventions. Methods The effectiveness of TNR programs in Massachusetts was assessed using analysis of variance and analysis of covariance tests which compared the number of animals <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> rabies <b>testing</b> per year by county. Spearman’s rank order correlation test was used {{to determine whether or not}} differences in the number of animals <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> rabies <b>testing</b> were associated with the number of free-roaming cat population reduction interventions present in each county.

50|$|In 1897, the C-93 Borchardt pistol was <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> to the Swiss Military Trials Committee. The Committee {{found the}} Borchardt too heavy and {{unwieldy}} {{to serve as}} a military sidearm. Georg Luger was tasked by DWM with improving upon the Borchardt pistol.

By shortening the cartridge case, Luger was able to design a narrower grip, and the toggle action required a shorter stroke than in the original Borchardt design. A transitional Borchardt-Luger model in the new caliber was submitted to the Swiss commission in 1898. After further improvements, the final result became the DWM Pistole-Parabellum ("Luger pistol"). The loading for the new cartridge was standardized and mass production began in 1900-1901 in DWM's factory in Karlsruhe, Germany.|$|R
