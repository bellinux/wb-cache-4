2500|$|The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering's 2004 {{report on}} the {{implications}} of nanoscience and nanotechnologies was inspired by Prince Charles' concerns about nanotechnology, including molecular manufacturing. However, the report spent almost no time on molecular manufacturing. [...] In fact, the word [...] "Drexler" [...] appears only once {{in the body of}} the report (in passing), and [...] "molecular manufacturing" [...] or [...] "molecular nanotechnology" [...] not at all. [...] The report covers various risks of nanoscale technologies, such as nanoparticle toxicology. [...] It also provides a useful overview of several nanoscale fields. The report contains an annex (appendix) on grey goo, which cites a weaker variation of Richard Smalley's contested argument against molecular manufacturing. It concludes that there is no evidence that autonomous, <b>self</b> <b>replicating</b> <b>nanomachines</b> will be developed in the foreseeable future, and suggests that regulators should be more concerned with issues of nanoparticle toxicology.|$|R

50|$|The {{quest for}} self-reconfiguring robotic {{structures}} is {{to some extent}} inspired by envisioned applications such as long-term space missions, that require long-term self-sustaining robotic ecology that can handle unforeseen situations and may require self repair. A second source of inspiration are biological systems that are self-constructed out of a relatively small repertoire of lower-level building blocks (cells or amino acids, depending on scale of interest). This architecture underlies biological systems' ability to physically adapt, grow, heal, and even <b>self</b> <b>replicate</b> - capabilities that would be desirable in many engineered systems.|$|R

50|$|Centrioles are {{involved}} in the organization of the mitotic spindle and in the completion of cytokinesis. Centrioles were previously thought to be required for the formation of a mitotic spindle in animal cells. However, more recent experiments have demonstrated that cells whose centrioles have been removed via laser ablation can still progress through the G1 stage of interphase before centrioles can be synthesized later in a de novo fashion. Additionally, mutant flies lacking centrioles develop normally, although the adult flies' cells lack flagella and cilia and as a result, they die shortly after birth.The centrioles can <b>self</b> <b>replicate</b> during cell division.|$|R
