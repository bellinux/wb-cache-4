40|$|Several {{thousand}} inventions result {{each year}} from research supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA seeks patent protection on inventions to which it has title if the invention has important use in government programs or significant commercial potential. These inventions cover {{a broad range of}} technologies and include many that have useful and valuable commercial application. NASA inventions best serve the interests of the United States when their benefits are available to the public. In many instances, the granting of nonexclusive or exclusive licenses for the practice of these inventions may assist in the accomplishment of this objective. This bibliography is published as a service to companies, firms, and individuals seeking new, licensable products for the commercial market. The NASA Patent Abstracts Bibliography is a semiannual NASA publication containing comprehensive abstracts of NASA owned inventions covered by U. S. patents. The citations included in the bibliography arrangement of citations were originally published in NASA's Scientific and Technical Aerospace Reports (STAR) and cover STAR announcements made since May 1969. The citations published in this issue cover the period July 2002 through. December 2002. This issue includes 10 major subject divisions separated into 76 specific categories and one general category/division. (See Table of Contents for the <b>scope</b> <b>note</b> of each category, under which are grouped appropriate NASA inventions.)

40|$|The Library of Congress’s (LC’s) recent {{implementation}} of subfield v — “form subdivision”—in subject heading strings (USMARC bibliographic fields 600 – 651) {{has raised the}} collective consciousness of catalogers about the many questions that remain unresolved regarding the provision of access to form data in online catalogs. These questions are shared by thesaurus builders, system designers, public services librarians, and, perhaps unknowingly, by searchers. Information about the form or genre of a work or physical item, as distinct from {{the subject of the}} work, {{can be found in a}} variety of places in the USMARC bibliographic record. The 006, 007, and 008 fixed fields contain coded form data, such as the books format 006 / 17, “biography. ” Some subfields of the 240, uniform title field, also contain form data, such as subfield s, “libretto. ” Likewise, the 245 title field may include a general material designator (GMD) for materials other than print-on-paper, as in subfield h, “computer file. ” Subject headings have long included form data, even though it was not coded as such; for example, “dictionaries, ” or “scores and parts. ” Until recently, LC has continued the longstanding entanglement between “works of ” (i. e., form headings) and “works about ” (i. e., topical headings). The Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) <b>scope</b> <b>note</b> for the heading “Large type books ” exemplifies this ambiguity: “Here are entered books set in a type size larger than normal for the benefit of persons with impaired vision, as well as works about such books. ” In addition to the peculiarities found in LCSH, the nature of form data and how it is included in subject headings has varied depending on the thesaurus used, the field of study, and the physical characteristics of the material.

40|$|Abstract Background Evidence-informed health policymaking logically {{depends on}} timely access to {{research}} evidence. To our knowledge, despite the substantial political and societal pressure {{to enhance the}} use of the best available research evidence in public health policy and program decision making, there is no study addressing availability of peer-reviewed research in Canadian health ministries. Objectives To assess availability of (1) a purposive sample of high-ranking scientific journals, (2) bibliographic databases, and (3) health library services in the fourteen Canadian health ministries. Methods From May to October 2011, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among librarians employed by Canadian health ministries to collect information relative to availability of scientific journals, bibliographic databases, and health library services. Availability of scientific journals in each ministry was determined using a sample of 48 journals selected from the 2009 Journal Citation Reports (Sciences and Social Sciences Editions). Selection criteria were: relevance for health policy based on <b>scope</b> <b>note</b> information about subject categories and journal popularity based on impact factors. Results We found that the majority of Canadian health ministries did not have subscription access to key journals and relied heavily on interlibrary loans. Overall, based on a sample of high-ranking scientific journals, availability of journals through interlibrary loans, online and print-only subscriptions was estimated at 63 %, 28 % and 3 %, respectively. Health Canada had a 2. 3 -fold higher number of journal subscriptions than that of the provincial ministries’ average. Most of the organisations provided access to numerous discipline-specific and multidisciplinary databases. Many organisations provided access to the library resources described through library partnerships or consortia. No professionally led health library environment was found in four out of fourteen Canadian health ministries (i. e. Manitoba Health, Northwest Territories Department of Health and Social Services, Nunavut Department of Health and Social Services and Yukon Department of Health and Social Services). Conclusions There is inequity in availability of peer-reviewed research in the fourteen Canadian health ministries. This inequity could present a problem, as each province and territory is responsible for formulating and implementing evidence-informed health policies and services for the benefit of its population...|$|E

40|$|Research Objective: Feasibility {{study of}} the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus {{considering}} the expansion of information {{in the field of}} women and family studies, as well as the wide span of related vocabulary and the development of vocabulary lists and bibliographies, the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus can be a professional tool for indexing and retrieval of women’s information in databases, library collections, archives and documentation centers as well as the Internet. Using this thesaurus, an indexing system will be developed which can be used for indexing, storage and retrieval of family and women’s databases. Methodology: The research method used in this study is documentary-based and the data gathering method was through library search in printed and electronic resources as well as interviewing professionals in the field of family and Women’s Studies. Through building a concept network between the terms, first the main structure of the thesaurus was determined using the inductive method and then the detailed structure was developed. Using this concept network, terms of the field were determined in a specific system and their interrelations were clarified. Findings: By studying resources including books, theses and articles in the field of women and family studies, and using ISO 25964 - 1 standard, the following 13 major categories were determined for the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus : 1. Religion; 2. Health and Hygiene; 3. Politics; 4. Economics; 5. Social Sciences; 6. Education; 7. Psychology; 8. History; 9. Culture and Literature; 10. International Relations; 11. Law; 12.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{a number of}} problems connected with the ‘apparatus’ used in grammaticalization theory. It will be argued that we get a better grip on what happens in processes of grammaticalization (and its ‘opposite’, lexicalization) if the process is viewed in terms of analogical processes, which are part of our general cognitive abilities. These analogical processes are connected with the modes of iconic and indexical thinking, which are prior to and underlie the mode of symbolic thinking (cf. Deacon 1997). I will make use of a simple analogical or usage-based grammar model, in which a distinction is made between processes taking place on a token level and those taking place on a type level. The model also involves taking more notice of the form of linguistic signs and of the synchronic grammar system at each stage of the grammaticalization process. This model will then be used on a classic example of grammaticalization (or subjectification), involving the modal verbs in the history of English. It will show that analogy lies at the basis of this grammaticalization process, and it will illustrate {{at the same time that}} the problems with <b>scope,</b> <b>noted</b> by Tabor and Traugott (1998), can also be dealt with if the process is seen as being steered by analogy...|$|R
