5|$|Tourism {{dominates the}} Croatian service sector and {{accounts}} {{for up to}} 20% of Croatian GDP. Annual tourist industry income for 2014 was estimated at €7.4billion. Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer <b>seasonal</b> <b>employment.</b> The industry is considered an export business, because it significantly reduces the country's external trade imbalance. Since {{the conclusion of the}} Croatian War of Independence, the tourist industry has grown rapidly, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers, with more than 11million tourists each year. The most numerous are tourists from Germany, Slovenia, Austria, Italy and the Czech Republic as well as Croatia itself. Length of a tourist stay in Croatia averages 4.9 days.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand has {{an annual}} quota of 75 Tuvaluans granted work permits under the Pacific Access Category, as {{announced}} in 2001. The applicants register for the Pacific Access Category (PAC) ballots; the primary criteria {{is that the}} principal applicant must have a job offer from a New Zealand employer. Tuvaluans also have access to <b>seasonal</b> <b>employment</b> in the horticulture and viticulture industries in New Zealand under the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Work Policy introduced in 2007 allowing for employment of up to 5,000 workers from Tuvalu and other Pacific islands. Tuvaluans can participate in the Australian Pacific Seasonal Worker Program, which allows Pacific Islanders to obtain <b>seasonal</b> <b>employment</b> in the Australian agriculture industry, in particular cotton and cane operations; fishing industry, in particular aquaculture; and with accommodation providers in the tourism industry.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1893, the Compagnie des Salins du Midi began to recruit workers to harvest seasalt from its {{evaporation}} ponds (salines). With unemployment increasing because of an economic crisis in Europe, the prospect of finding <b>seasonal</b> <b>employment</b> attracted more applicants than usual. They were divided into three categories: Ardéchois (peasants, not necessarily from Ardèche, who left their land seasonally); Piémontais (Italians originating from across northern Italy and recruited on the spot by team leaders); and trimards (composed partly of vagrants).|$|E
25|$|The {{county has}} a mixed economy. An {{important}} part of the economy is based on tourism: many visitors are attracted by the many beaches and the mountains. A significant part of the county lies within the Snowdonia National Park, which extends from the north coast down to the district of Merioneth in the south; it is much larger than Snowdonia proper. But tourism provides <b>seasonal</b> <b>employment</b> and thus {{there is a shortage of}} jobs in the winter. Another problem with tourism is the demand that it creates for second homes. This pushes house prices out of reach of local people, to the detriment of the position of the Welsh language in rural areas.|$|E

25|$|The Liberal Party of Canada {{has done}} well in the Maritimes in the past because of its interventionist policies. The Acadian Peninsula region of New Brunswick, long {{dependent}} upon <b>seasonal</b> <b>employment</b> in the Gulf of St. Lawrence fishery, tends {{to vote for the}} Liberals or NDP for this reason. In the 1997 federal election, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's Liberals endured a bitter defeat to the PCs and NDP in many ridings as a result of unpopular cuts to unemployment benefits for seasonal workers, as well as closures of several Canadian Forces Bases, the refusal to honour a promise to rescind the Goods and Services Tax, cutbacks to provincial equalization payments, health care, post-secondary education and regional transportation infrastructure such as airports, fishing harbours, seaports, and railways. The Liberals held onto seats in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, while being shut out of Nova Scotia entirely, the second time in history (the only other time being the Diefenbaker sweep). In 2015 the Liberals won every seat in The Maritimes, defeating Conservative and NDP incumbents.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{others have}} criticized Sowell for drawing causal inferences without a {{coherent}} methodology, and for commenting on subjects {{in which he}} has no training or formal background, a criticism Sowell has issued towards others. In 1981, The New York Times noted that two of Sowell's books, Markets and Minorities and Ethnic America, [...] "have just been published, to much praise from fellow conservatives and a lot of criticism, some of it bitter, from fellow blacks and from liberal intellectuals." [...] Bernadette Chachere, an economist at Hampton University, criticized Markets and Minorities for ignoring past economic research on income disparities between races: [...] "To cite one article published in 1973, after controlling for age, region of residence, parents' income, father's occupation and education, place where raised, number of siblings, health, local labor, market conditions, geographic mobility, and <b>seasonal</b> <b>employment,</b> there still remained a 70% difference in the earnings of whites and nonwhites unexplained... the lack of such a [...] review does preclude Sowell's claim to a monopoly on 'rigorous' analysis. Sowell is walking on severely trampled terrain as if it were virgin territory. There is not one footnote to this chapter." ...|$|E
30|$|In parallel, since 1997, the {{employment}} rate in Santiago {{has followed the}} macroeconomic conditions and the expected <b>seasonal</b> variation. <b>Employment</b> fell {{as a result of}} the consequences of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990 s, the global recession in the late 2000 s and the fall in commodity prices in the 2010 s. Male and female employment are sensitive to these fluctuations, but female employment remains, for the majority of the period under study, below 50 % (Table  2). Hours worked are calculated among those that are employed. Despite some seasonal variation, they have tended downwards, to an average of 44  hours per week.|$|R

Some of these work exclusively for a single employer, while others work for more than one employer. Some are live-in workers, while some are <b>seasonal.</b> The <b>employment</b> of these migrant workers is typically at the will of the employer and the worker, and compensation varies.|$|R

As an analytical tool we used an extended Human–Environment System Framework by focusing {{particularly on the}} dynamics and sustainability of livelihood strategies and mountain–valley interactions. Drawing from household surveys conducted in two mountain and two valley communities in 2005 and 2009, we show that the distinct income gap between mountain and valley households in 2005 ceased to exist in 2009. The main drivers for this development are the local tourist industry, persistent demand for forest resources, {{as well as local}} off-farm and <b>seasonal</b> migrant <b>employment...</b>|$|R

30|$|On the one hand, it can {{be argued}} that the {{short-term}} nature of seasonal work makes retirement and unemployment benefits a marginal issue for seasonal workers. In that case, workers should not be obliged to make mandatory contributions for social services. On the other hand, in countries with a long tradition of foreign <b>seasonal</b> worker <b>employment,</b> such as Germany and France, it is common for workers to return every season, and in some cases they have done this for more than 20  years. Consequently, access to social security is an important issue, especially when considering that agricultural work is often characterised by a high risk of accidents, and that the physically demanding tasks often leave workers unable to work when old or even before reaching the retirement age.|$|R

30|$|Australia and New Zealand {{have also}} {{bilateral}} agreements {{with a number}} of Pacific Island countries in the area of seasonal migration of unskilled labour, such as the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) policy New Zealand introduced in 2007 and a similar scheme Australia launched a year later. Such schemes had existed in the late 1960 s for Fijian, Tongan and Samoans to work mainly in agriculture and forestry until the first coup in Fiji (1987) brought the scheme to an end (Lee 2009 : 10). Under the RSE policy, at present, up to 8, 000 persons from (in order of absolute importance) Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Kiribati can come to New Zealand for seasonal agricultural work. The Australian scheme allows people from Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tonga, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and (since 2012) Timor Leste to enter Australia for <b>seasonal</b> unskilled <b>employment</b> mainly in the agricultural sector. Other economic sectors showed interest in employing temporary workers from the Pacific such as the New Zealand dairy and meat processing industries.|$|R

40|$|Tourism {{is viewed}} as an {{increasingly}} important component of rural economic potential, especially in peripheral regions of the UK.
