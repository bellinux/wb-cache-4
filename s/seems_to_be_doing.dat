500|$|Rather Ripped {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 34 reviews. In a review for the Toronto Star, Ben Rayner {{wrote that the}} band managed to condense all their expansive musical style into tighter songs [...] "without sacrificing the mercurial structures, subversive lyrical bent and reverence for noise that identify Sonic Youth as Sonic Youth". PopMatters editor Dave Heaton believed the album was a graceful and elegant way to end Sonic Youth's unique relationship with Geffen, describing it as a [...] "cohesive story about a band seeking {{the best way to}} take the reckless, brave spirits of free jazz, punk, and experimental music, and generate them within the confines of traditional rock song structure". He also praised Moore's lyrics, stating that [...] "his Beat-style poetry is especially evocative, and especially terse—a quality that fits well with an album that musically <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> much the same, communicating a lot with a little". Similarly, Dave Simpson of The Guardian felt that the band reinvented themselves with poppier songs, calling Rather Ripped [...] "an extraordinary state of affairs in Sonic Youth's 25th year".|$|E
2500|$|On February 15, {{during a}} closed-door hearing {{presided over by}} an Alabama judge, the charges were read to Bishop. Following the hearing, Bishop was on suicide watch, a {{standard}} procedure in such cases. Her husband said she called him prior to her arraignment and they spoke for approximately two minutes. He said, [...] "She <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> OK." [...] On March 12, while executing a search warrant on Bishop's residence, the police discovered a [...] "suspicious device" [...] prompting an evacuation of the nearby neighborhood; it was later identified by the bomb squad as non-explosive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{division}} {{participated in}} the invasion of French North Africa. The division landed in Oran, Algeria on November 8, 1942, as part of Center Task Force of Operation Torch {{under the command of}} Major General Lloyd Fredendall. Elements of the division then took part in combat in the Tunisia Campaign at Maktar, Medjez el Bab, Kasserine Pass, Gafsa, El Guettar, Béja, and Mateur, from January 21, 1943 to May 9, 1943, helping secure Tunisia. In July, 1943, the division {{participated in the}} Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky. In a 3 March 1943 letter to the Army Chief of Staff, Marshall, General Dwight D. [...] "Ike" [...] Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in North Africa, expressed his confidence in the 1st Infantry Division's two leaders: [...] "Terry Allen <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> a satisfactory job; so is Roosevelt." ...|$|E

2500|$|Her {{next film}} role was supervillain Poison Ivy in Batman & Robin (1997). Budgeted at over US$125 million, the film grossed a modest US$238 million internationally and was {{unanimously}} panned, with critics considering {{it one of}} the worst films of all time. However, Thurman's performance was largely highlighted; Houston Chronicle remarked that [...] "Thurman [...] sometimes <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> Mae West by way of Jessica Rabbit", and a similar positive comparison was made by The New York Times: [...] "ike Mae West, she mixes true femininity with the winking womanliness of a drag queen". She obtained a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Best Sci-fi Actress and was also nominated for Favourite Movie Actress at the Kids' Choice Awards. In 1998, she starred as a [...] British secret agent in The Avengers, another financial and critical flop; CNN described her as [...] "so distanced you feel like you’re watching her through the wrong end of a telescope." ...|$|E
2500|$|Act Two begins {{six months}} later, and still {{there is no}} sign of Drood. There is much {{speculation}} as to his fate. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Puffer has been investigating Drood's disappearance, but has also noticed a rather seedy looking figure who <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> the same. It turns out that this man (played by the same actor who plays Drood, normally), Dick Datchery, is a private investigator. They sing [...] "Settling Up The Score". The cast appears and summarizes the situation, warning the audience, [...] "don't fall back on your assumptions, hasty presumptions might do you in!", telling them to think carefully of who they will vote for as the murderer, in the song [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead". As the song climbs to a climax, the actors trail off, and the Chairman announces to the audience that it was at this place that Charles Dickens laid down his pen forever. [...] However, they, with the audience's help, will resolve the story and the public voting begins as to who Datchery and The Murderer are; unfortunately, the actress playing Drood and, up to that point, Datchery is not chosen as Datchery and exits the theater in a huff. [...] Once the votes have been tabulated, the cast come out and sing [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead" [...] to welcome the audience back into the story and to remind them that the mystery has not been solved.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I suppose {{placer mining}} {{is always a}} trifle uncertain. One would almost fancy that baking was more profitable. Your friend Miss Leger <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> well, or is it your venture?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be called Dr. John Wilkes," [...] the doctor, {{who was one of}} the most famous of his time, said, with a smile, as he shook hands with him. [...] "Your {{treatment}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> wonders." ...|$|E
6000|$|My silence {{began to}} irritate Philip. [...] "I never knew before how obstinate you could be," [...] he said; [...] "you <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> your best--I can't imagine why--to lower {{yourself}} in my estimation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks." [...] She smiled. [...] "You <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> all right, too. Commander Gross {{tells me}} that you're {{responsible}} for this project, Operation Head, as they call it. Whose head have you decided on?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, it's quite {{possible}} {{he did it}} before. I suppose you haven't asked yourself how Jasper makes a living.

Thanks to our beneficent legislature, whoever keeps it makes an excellent profit." ...|$|E
6000|$|Devine {{glanced at}} them both a trifle sharply, {{but there was}} nothing in their faces that gave him a clue to their thoughts.

60|$|All this greatly charmed Euphemia. It was so cute, so complete. There were no {{interviews}} with disagreeable trades-people, {{none of the}} ordinary annoyances of housekeeping. Everything <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with a bell, a speaking-tube or a crank.|$|R
50|$|Michael divided his {{activities}} between performance work and small, quiet, beautiful gouaches {{in a time}} when everyone else <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> big messy paintings. Many of these paintings were exhibited after his death at The Henry Peacock Gallery.|$|R
5000|$|While on suspension, Lupino {{had ample}} time to observe filming and editing processes, and she became {{interested}} in directing. She described how bored she was on set while [...] "someone else <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> all the interesting work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We buried him at sea. All {{this time}} we were making very slow progress; indeed the voyage has been very {{remarkable}} in all respects.

The temperature now is only 72 degrees, and I imagine that his constitution is less liable to that particular disease. Yet punctured wounds are always dangerous on this account.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} ails that Squirrel. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> {{a lot of}} scolding," [...] said Mrs. Brown, as she looked out of the window. And that shows {{how easy it is}} to {{misunderstand}} people when we don't know all about their affairs.

6000|$|... "You {{had better}} fan out this corner for a little," [...] {{said the old}} bee and passed on. Melissa dropped her head at once, took firm hold with her fore-feet, and fanned obediently at the {{regulation}} stroke three hundred beats to the second. Fanning tries a bee's temper, because she must always keep {{in the same place}} where she never <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> any good, and, all the while, she is wearing out her only wings. When a bee cannot fly, a bee must not live; and a bee knows it. The Wax-moth crept forth, and caressed Melissa again.|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't be a burden," [...] {{said the}} girl tenderly. [...] "I shall <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> it for your mother, but I know I shall <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> it for you. I do {{everything}} for you. Do you think it's right?" ...|$|R
