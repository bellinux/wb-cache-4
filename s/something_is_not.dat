5|$|Realizing <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{right with}} the dog, Julie takes him to a dog trainer, Carruthers (Burl Ives), who tells her to kill the dog. Another dog trainer named Keys (Paul Winfield), who is black himself, {{undertakes}} re-educating the dog as a personal challenge. He dons protective gear and keeps the dog in a large enclosure, taking him out on a chain and exposing himself to the dog each day and making sure {{he is the only}} one to feed or care for the dog.|$|E
25|$|By {{the same}} reasoning, this {{statement}} is evidence that (2) if <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> black then {{it is not a}} raven. But since (as above) {{this statement is}} logically equivalent to (1) all ravens are black, it follows that the sight of a green apple is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black. This conclusion seems paradoxical, because it implies that information has been gained about ravens by looking at an apple.|$|E
25|$|The classicist John Burnet doubts this account, however, as both Diogenes Laërtius and Cicero wrote {{hundreds}} of years later and as no such persecution of Protagoras is mentioned by contemporaries who make extensive references to this philosopher. Burnet notes that even if some copies of the Protagoras books were burned, enough of them survived to be known and discussed in the following century. A claim has been made that Protagoras is better classified as an atheist, since he held that if <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> able to be known it does not exist.|$|E

25|$|The term non-kosher means <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> allowed as food—non-kosher animals (e.g., pigs, camels, and turtles) {{were already}} {{generally}} prohibited, {{and questions about}} the status of mixtures involving their meat and milk would be somewhat academic. Nevertheless, the lack of a classical decision about milk and meat of non-kosher animals gave rise to argument in the late Middle Ages. Some, such as Yoel Sirkis and Joshua Falk, argued that mixing milk and meat from non-kosher animals should be prohibited, but others, like Shabbatai ben Meir and David HaLevi Segal, argued that, excluding the general ban on non-kosher animals, such mixtures should not be prohibited.|$|E

[...] "Nothing is square and, although you can't {{put your finger}} on it, it just makes you feel like <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> right". [...] Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. [...] "In the real world, the colors are bright and rich," [...] Willet said. [...] "In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. [...] Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic".|$|E
500|$|John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{are called}} in to investigate. They {{interview}} Mike, who claims that Blake died after visiting [...] "the Brady Bunch House". The three speak to the owner, Oliver Martin (Michael Emerson), but upon entering discover that the house looks nothing like the one featured in the teaser. Doggett, feeling <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> right, checks Martin's trashcan and finds asphalt shingles; earlier, on top of Mike's car, Doggett had found {{a piece of a}} shingle. He deduces that Blake was thrown through Martin's roof. Later that night, Mike looks into Martin's house and sees the whole Brady family eating dinner. He storms into the house, only to find that the family has disappeared. Suddenly, he is confronted by Martin, who tells him to leave. Mike refuses, and is thrown through the roof, only to be embedded in the yard.|$|E

2500|$|As the Indian Buddhist Vasubandhu writes: [...] "Anything {{the idea}} of which does not occur upon {{division}} or upon mental analysis, such as an object like a pot, that is a 'conceptual fiction'. The ultimately real is otherwise." [...] For Vasubandhu then, <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the ultimately real if it 'disappears under analysis', but is merely conventional.|$|E

2500|$|After Toussaint Louverture {{had become}} {{governor}} general of Saint-Domingue following a slave revolt, in 1801 Jefferson supported French {{plans to take}} back the island. [...] He agreed to loan France $300,000 [...] "for relief of whites on the island." [...] Jefferson wanted to alleviate the fears of southern slave owners, who feared a similar rebellion in their territory. Prior to his election, Jefferson wrote of the revolution, [...] "If <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> done and soon, we shall be the murderers of our own children." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Vimpany {{felt that}} this outrage was beyond endurance. If <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> done to atone for it, Miss Henley would be capable--her face, at that moment, {{answered}} for her--of leaving the house with Mr. Mountjoy. Mrs. Vimpany seized her husband indignantly by the arm.|$|R
60|$|Lady Bellamy {{saw that}} if <b>something</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> done quickly, {{there would be}} a {{shocking}} scene, which was the last thing she wanted, so she seized George and whispered in his ear, after which he followed her sulkily, turning round {{from time to time to}} look at Angela.|$|R
50|$|Discuss those discriminators {{that make}} one offeror better than another {{based on the}} {{selection}} criteria. Be as detailed and focused upon discriminators as the source selection results allow. If <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a discriminator then say so and also state why it <b>was</b> <b>not.</b> If the strength had no bearing on the offerors rating, state so.|$|R
2500|$|When {{attempting}} {{to define what}} something is, it is often helpful to define what <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> It {{is also important to}} note that many literary critics attempt to classify novels and literary works in only one genre, such as [...] "romantic" [...] or [...] "naturalist", not always taking into account that many works fall into multiple categories. Much discussion is cited from Maggie Ann Bowers' book Magic(al) Realism, wherein she attempts to delimit the terms magic realism and magical realism by examining the relationships with other genres such as realism, surrealism, fantastic literature, science fiction and its African version, the Animist Realism.|$|E
2500|$|According to Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti, {{the mind}} has two {{fundamental}} qualities: [...] "clarity and cognizes". If <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. [...] "Clarity" [...] {{refers to the}} fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and [...] "cognizes" [...] that it functions to know or perceive objects. [...] "Knowing" [...] refers {{to the fact that}} mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind - whose function is to cognize an object - existing without cognizing an object.|$|E
2500|$|Aboriginal {{people also}} criticised Grahame Walsh, arguing that {{he failed to}} hear their {{explanations}} of the significance that the paintings had in their culture. Crawford records being told by an Aboriginal elder in 1969 that the Bradshaws were [...] "rubbish paintings", a quote that Walsh would repeat continually {{in support of his}} own theory that the art was not of Aboriginal origin. In the local Indigenous English, rubbish is an adjective usually used to describe someone who is too old or too young to be active in the local culture. Another use is meaning <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> dangerous, for example, non-poisonous snakes are all considered to be rubbish while in contrast, poisonous snakes are all cheeky.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, RiverClan {{reveals that}} their Clan {{is facing a}} [...] "small problem" [...] {{and that they are}} being forced to live on the Gathering island for a short while. Though Leopardstar is {{fiercely}} protective of her Clan and refuses to elaborate, Hollypaw knows <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> right because her friend Willowpaw and the rest of RiverClan are acting extremely nervous. She informs Firestar of her concerns. However, he does not believe this is ThunderClan's problem and refuses to take action. Hollypaw heads to RiverClan on her own. When she arrives, Willowpaw shows her how human children are disturbing their camp, but the RiverClan cats are widening the river to discourage the children from playing near the camp. Hollypaw is kept with RiverClan so she cannot tell anyone about their secret because they think she is a spy.|$|E
2500|$|Baudrillard's {{published}} work emerged {{as part of}} a generation of French thinkers including Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Jacques Lacan who all shared an interest in semiotics, and he is often seen {{as a part of the}} post-structuralist philosophical school. In common with many post-structuralists, his arguments consistently draw upon the notion that signification and meaning are both only understandable in terms of how particular words or [...] "signs" [...] interrelate. Baudrillard thought, as do many post-structuralists, that meaning is brought about through systems of signs working together. Following on from the structuralist linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, Baudrillard argued that meaning (value) is created through difference—through what <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> (so [...] "dog" [...] means [...] "dog" [...] because it is not-"cat", not-"goat", not-"tree", etc.). In fact, he viewed meaning as near enough self-referential: objects, images of objects, words and signs are situated in a web of meaning; one object's meaning is only understandable through its relation to the meaning of other objects; for instance, one thing's prestige relates to another's mundanity.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{the space}} alien {{responsible}} for transforming Hazumu from male to female. He arrived to Earth via his spaceship {{run by an}} artificial intelligence named Jan Pu, but crash lands on the surface where Hazumu is, killing him instantly. Hitoshi rectifies this by regenerating Hazumu, but unexpectedly changes his physical sex in the process. This is a mystery to Hitoshi for some time until he is finally able to confirm that Hazumu's [...] "life grain" [...] count is slowly dissipating, {{and by the time}} Hitoshi confirms this, Hazumu only has one month left to live. Hitoshi originally came to Earth as a cultural anthropologist and to study the emotions of the human race since his species has long-since given up any emotion at all. Hitoshi recounts that {{at the peak of his}} people's civilization, they had discovered the means to destroy all life in the entire universe instantly, so in order to prevent this from ever happening, his people chose to discard their emotions. However, even after becoming a calm, logical race where emotional clashes such as violence and war disappeared completely, his people also started to lose their sexual urges in order to propagate his species further. In their current situation, if <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> done soon, his entire species will soon become extinct, which is why he is on Earth to find a way to save his species. He arrives at the conclusion that his species needs to remember how to love each other in order to survive, so love becomes a focus of his research. In order to observe humans more closely, along with Hazumu and her ongoing relationship with Yasuna and Tomari, Hitoshi starts working at Hazumu's school as a biology teacher, and inadvertently becomes the target of Namiko's extreme affections.|$|E

Potter himself fell under suspicion, but was apparently innocent, [...] "a strange man" [...] having dealt with all the arrangements that night.|$|R
