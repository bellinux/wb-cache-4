50|$|VLF {{signals are}} often {{monitored}} by radio amateurs using simple homemade VLF radio receivers {{based on personal}} computers (PCs). An aerial {{in the form of}} a coil of insulated wire is connected to the input of the soundcard of the PC (via a jack plug) and placed a few metres away from it. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) software in combination with a sound card allows reception of all frequencies below the Nyquist frequency simultaneously in the form of spectrogrammes. Because CRT monitors are strong sources of noise in the VLF range, it is recommended to record the spectrograms with any PC CRT monitors turned off. These spectrograms show many signals, which may include VLF transmitters and the horizontal electron beam deflection of TV sets. The strength of the signal received can vary with a <b>sudden</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance.</b> These cause the ionization level to increase in the ionosphere producing a rapid change to the amplitude and phase of the received VLF signal.|$|E

40|$|Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances are the {{immediate}} effects of solar flares, which impact the earth, and affect the upper atmospheric layers used for telecommunications. The {{aim of this}} project was to research, design and build a <b>sudden</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>Disturbance</b> Monitor for amplitude and phase perturbations occurring in the D-layer of the Ionosphere. For the design and implementation of this system an approach including research of various resources such as Internet, books, articles and journals was used in order to devise the system’s specification and the methodology {{that was to be}} followed on the next stages of the system’s development. During the design phase of the Sudden Ionospheric Monitor a loop antenna was considered as a means to transfer energy from free space into a guided wave into the receiver. A VLF receiver was also considered, which would incorporate all the signal processing and finally a data-logging device after the receiver to act as an interface between the analogue natural events and the digital interface to record data to a PC. At the implementation stage a balanced loop antenna was realised and tested for its applicability on the project and a VLF receiver was constructed to process the signals from distant transmitters as a means to observe the propagation of the transmitted VLF signals received by the system. Observations were made through graphical representations of the VLF signatures on the computer by using a data-logging interface...|$|E
40|$|We use {{observations}} {{from a pair}} of 20. 1 MHz riometers to constrain the magnitude and timing of the largest solar X-ray flare on record, a flare that saturated the detectors on the GOES- 12 satellite. Using recordings of the <b>sudden</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> associated with the flare, we show that by correcting the riometer absorption measurements for the solar zenith angle, applying a model for the effects of solar X-rays on the ionosphere, and, finally, calibrating the resulting data against the solar 0. 1 – 0. 8 nm flux from the GOES- 12 satellite, we are able to closely reproduce the temporal X-ray profiles of large solar flares. We demonstrate this using two reference flares to show that we can reproduce the flare peak magnitude to approximately ± 10 % and the time of the peak to better than 3 min, even when we simulate saturations of the GOES data at 50 – 60 % of the peak flare magnitude. Analysis of the 4 November 2003 flare is complicated by the presence of radio interference near the flare peak; however, a polynomial interpolation can be used to infer the flare characteristics at the peak. By applying this analysis and considering the likely error bounds, we constrain the peak flare magnitude to lie in the range 3. 4 – 4. 8 mW/m 2 (X 34 –X 48) peaking at 1944 – 1948 UT. The best fit gives a peak flux of 4. 0 mW/m 2 (X 40), peaking at 1946 UT. Taking the three independent published estimates for the peak X-ray magnitude that have associated error bounds, the weighted mean X-ray peak is found to be approximately 4. 0 mW/m 2 (X 40), peaking close to 1946 UT...|$|E

50|$|The Kp-index is {{used for}} the study and {{prediction}} of ionospheric propagation of high frequency radio signals. Geomagnetic storms, indicated by a Kp = 5 or higher, have no direct effect on propagation. However they disturb the F-layer of the ionosphere, especially at middle and high geographical latitudes, causing a so-called ionospheric storm which degrades radio propagation. The degradation mainly consists of a reduction of the maximum usable frequency (MUF) by as much as 50%. Sometimes the E-layer may be affected as well.

Using SPA magnitudes and flare time X-ray flux values, the threshold level of X-ray flux to induce an SPA has been estimated as 1.5 ⊙× 10 − 3 ergs/cm 2 /s.

30|$|In {{the present}} analysis, we also {{consider}} the influence on the X-ray radiation due to solar burst events. The bottom panel of Fig. 1 shows that the variation of the X-ray solar radiation intensity follows a similar behavior to the solar-cycle activity, which results in periodic disturbances in the Earth’s atmosphere and they are divided in the classes. Indeed, we have checked several cases of X-ray solar bursts associated with strong magnetic storms during solar cycle 23 (not shown here), including the present case. Most of the X-ray peaks (≈ 65 %) caused an absorption of radio waves with wavelengths compatible with those for E -region soundings. This radio wave absorption is attributed to <b>Sudden</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Disturbances</b> (SID), which occurred at the D-region height (Sahai et al., 2007), thereby not allowing us to observe the upper regions.
