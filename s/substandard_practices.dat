The aim of this study was to identify the frequency and the most causative agents of gastroenteritis outbreaks and to identify underlying factors contributing to disease outbreaks. We analysed 89 reported outbreaks documented by local epidemiologists to the Croatian National Institute of Public Health during 2006. Most outbreaks happened during the summer (39. 3 %). Causative agents in the summer were mostly bacteriae while viruses were mostly the causative agents in the spring (p< 0. 01). Also bacteria was the most causative agent in outbreaks conducted in private households and public restaurants, while viruses, mostly norovirus, were causative agents in outbreaks in homes for elderly people and hospitals (p< 0. 01). Bacterial infections were related to <b>substandard</b> <b>practices</b> in food preparation and warehousing, and virus infections were related to person-to-person contact (fecal-oral route and airborne transmission) (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Sub-standard {{practices}} and their adverse impact on safety performance remain {{a challenge in}} the South African gold mining industry. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the root causes of sub-standard {{practices and}} the effect on safety performance in South African gold mines. The focus of the study was on the underground production operations at a gold mine in the Free State. The study consisted of three parts: a personal investigation into the causes of sub-standard practices at the mine, a comparison with the results of a cultural study performed at the West Wits mines, and a behavioural survey. The studies described in this article yielded similar results in terms of the key drivers behind sub-standard practices. It was found that <b>substandard</b> <b>practices</b> had a number of causes, and the origin lies within the habits, attitude, and behaviour of employees. Current methods of addressing sub-standard practices and improving safety performance were found to discourage employees from performing work safely and according to procedure. It was concluded that the lack of critical behavioural habits for the given work environment and job title could possibly be the primary reason for the occurrence of sub-standard practices.

40|$|AbstractIn {{previous}} work, it {{was found}} that there were six HRM practices, which are most crucial in supporting service quality. The purposes of this paper are, firstly, to clarity the individual relationships among the six HRM practices and to examine how those practices support reach other, and secondly, to develop a model which incorporates all of the inter-relationships among the six HRM practices. Previously, each individual relationship has tended to be considered in isolation in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, the various inter-relationships were unified into a single model. In this new conceptual framework, the six HRM practices are inter-linked so that each of them may have a joint function in supporting service quality. The model can therefore be used to identify problem area(s) in order to improve service quality. For example, since all of the six HRM practices are important in supporting each other, if {{one or more of these}} practices are considered to be unsatisfactory, the model will indicate potential practice(s) which may have been causing the problem(s) or which might have been affected by the <b>substandard</b> <b>practice(s).</b> Since the six HRM practices are not stand along items, it is important to pay proper attention to all six practices in order to support service quality. As these inter-relationships are not specific to a certain type of service business, the model is likely to be applicable to a wide range of service industries...|$|E
40|$|In 2004, {{members of}} the McGill University Faculty of Medicine began {{implementing}} a new curriculum for undergraduate medical education entitled, Physicianship: The Physician as Professional and Healer. The initiative underscores the idea that physician training entails cultivating not only scientific knowledge and technical skill, but a mindset guided by intrinsic principles of doctoring. Although the McGill case exemplifies a wide-spread paradigm shift in medical teaching, there is a dearth of analysis concerning the degree of congruency between the objectives of formal undergraduate curricular revision and the so-called ‘hidden curriculum’ of the hospital training environment. With Physicianship {{as a point of}} departure, this dissertation maps evolutionary patterns in clinical medicine and, using qualitative methods, analyzes the perspectives of twenty physician-educators on curricular reform and the transforming clinical training environment. Physicians interviewed were generally supportive of the new curricular initiative. Concerns were raised, however, that many recent changes within the teaching hospital environment interfere with students’ cultivation of professional and healer attributes. These changes were organized into three main themes: scientific, institutional, and social. Physicians expressed concern that what is often considered beneficial for patients is often detrimental for medical training. For example, increased use of diagnostic technologies has improved patient care but reduces opportunities for trainees’ clinical skill development. Concern was raised that the concept of selfless service has been undermined through recent shift-work regulations and a culture gap between older and younger generation physicians. Alternatively, some perceived new policies of the clinical environment to be more conducive to physicians’ self-care and quality of life. Younger trainees were often described as more competent in managing medical information, more open to diversity, more candid about their needs, and more apt to challenge dogmatic or ethically <b>substandard</b> <b>practices.</b> The complexity of the transforming clinical environment is used to justify a rationale for developing the concept of Phronesis (practical wisdom) as a pedagogical framework. The concepts of ‘acuity of perception’ and ‘mastery of emotion’ are grounded in the data and analyzed for the development of Phronesis, to advance the field of medical education and support curricular initiatives such as the Physicianship program...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} shift work as viewed by New Zealand Medical Radiation Technologists (MRTs). The topic was chosen because during my career as an MRT I have encountered all derivations of shift work, but was never informed of the associated effects or their potential impact. Therefore this study investigates what MRTs considered the main effects to be, while also exploring the perceived impact they have in order to propose recommendations as to the management of any effects and build a foundation of knowledge and information for all MRTs in New Zealand. A large proportion of MRTs in New Zealand undertake shift work and minimal literature was found specific to this cohort {{with respect to their}} view of it, how they are impacted by the associated effects and other issues related to it. Notwithstanding the financial and service capability advantages to the departments in moving to this system, no-one to my knowledge has explored the effect this transition has had on the MRTs, potentially allowing <b>substandard</b> <b>practices</b> of a personal or professional nature to go unnoticed (Peate, 2007). The thesis used a case study as the research method informed through an interpretive paradigm, with qualitative data gathered from a number of MRT participants throughout NZ via in-depth interviews and questionnaires and also through data collected by questionnaires from Charge MRTs. The key findings included the fact that the perception of shift work did not align with the actual reality. Many advantages associated with shift work were identified, such as variation of work, flexibility, free time during the day, remuneration and increased family and social time. The disadvantages identified included altered sleep patterns, a negative impact on health, decreased family and social opportunities, performance impairment and detrimental professional effects. Some MRTs felt that the thought of shift work was worse than actually working the shift, while most found that their attitude towards shift work had a huge impact on how they coped with it. Society’s perception and treatment of shift workers had an impact, however most MRTs see themselves performing shift work in the longer term...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of senior physicians and calls for increased accountability of the medical profession by the public have led regulators and policymakers to consider implementing age-based competency screening.

40|$|This {{research}} focuses {{attention on}} safety challenges in maritime accidents, {{as the basis}} of conditions of unsafe actions of the human factor. Analyzing data is based on reports from JTSB (Japan Transport Safety Board) during 1991 - 2008. 	All equipment and systems has sensitive operations in working environment. While interacting of human in working performance have limitations in human element. In the strategy of Personal Identification (PIN) Safe model within working environment considering two condition about <b>substandard</b> <b>practices</b> of operators and substandard working conditions of operators. Substandard conditions are broken down from attribution of causes interacting with adverse mental states, adverse physiological states, and physical/mental limitations. Types of <b>substandard</b> <b>practices</b> include crew resource mismanagement and personal readiness. Each of these subcategories is discussed in the model of the characteristic of the human element in analyzing data. In the theory of causation in the maritime field is mentioned that one of the root cause analysis problems considered using 4 M (Man, Machine, Media, Management) Factors. Every factor while interacting where the center is a human who has the limitation in decision-making/taking actions will result in unsafe conditions or unsafe actions. While generating have a significant error from standard performance, can be said to be human error. Any unsafe actions or conditions lead to incident or accident has risks. 	Reliability of safety critical system is implemented in risks for human beings in its environment, such as unsafe actions in maritime accident. Critical systems engineering is to avoid disasters. A critical system is any system whose 'failure' could threaten human life, the system's environment of the organization which operates the systems. These people may interact with system or not. In safety critical system, people {{need to be aware of}} these risks and know what to do in the case of problems. Any reasonable conclusion possible as Personal Identification (PIN) Safe model is done in logic of pattern in working environment. 	In this research (as shown in fig. 1. 3) Logic of patterns (AND/OR), as developed by the author, is used to illustrate how a combination of both can occur. In the logic of the patterns, the author has conducted research how to implement logic such as AND / OR to determine the exposure of sensitive situation using taxonomy error codes which is implemented in a union set. It is integrated into a model called a Personal Identification (PIN) Safe model. Based on this reasoning, Personal Identification (PIN) Safe model is done in logic of patterns of human beings. The result of this research is: a. Identifying human elements in risk. 	Identifying human elements is based on unsafe actions and their root cause to determine any kind of risk in maritime accidents. Any unsafe actions have different characteristics that lead to kinds of maritime accidents. The assessment step is applied in probability weight as a measure to determine the level of risk associated with a specific hazard. The result indicates the level of consequences from a risk. Minimizing the decrease of quality human performance as impacted in unsafe actions is implemented with 3 A (awareness, action and attitude) behavior in part of PIN Safe model. b. Improving quality of decisions in response to unsafe actions 	Quality of decisions is increasing quality sense of decisions by input, process and output to get situational awareness and situational familiarity in working environment to minimize any significant deviations, particularly in the maritime transport system. These elements are embedded in very complex, interdependent, and dynamic relationships. The maritime transport system is a very complex and large-scale socio-technical environment system consisting of human actions that interact with each other and operate in a physical environment in the term man-machine-media and management. Knowledge of working environment is one part of decreasing the risk value of an individual ship. Every risk will reach to accident. Considering further that it has the probability accident which is determined by the ship???s time and location. Effective analysis and practice is the counter measure for reducing the human elements??? involvement by studying the patterns that have the same value as of probability weight in taxonomy error. These have been developed in order to get the performance shaping factors by PIN Safe model as anticipation of engineering controls. c. Controlling the patterns of unsafe action in risk 		Risk is the probability and severity of loss from exposure to the hazard. The accident probability for an individual ship is determined using so called ???exposures??? and a casualty rate. The exposures are the number of potential casualty sensitive situations in which the ship can be involved that could lead to an accident. This process definition will be easier to recognize by the taxonomy error in the performance of the seafarer. 		The probability weight and severity of accident that could result produce a pattern from the hazard, based upon the exposures of personal unsafe actions within the hazard. From such pattern there can be shown how navigation problems contribute as the highest input to the collision accident. It is expected that the exposures are a key to developing human performance. During operations of workers, it can be seen how they will be affected by a given event or, over time, by repeated events. d. Monitoring the patterns of unsafe action 		Repeated events as unsafe actions need evaluation. Regarding these situations, the author has been researching methods in the control of taxonomy error of unsafe actions till within 4 M factors as a comprehensive monitoring information process in PIN Safe model. These are needed for the role of management to evaluate. Strong management to analyze events??? characteristics of unsafe actions is important in establishing the evaluation strategies. Monitoring all factors should be done to avoid critical situations and to minimize human casualty. In chapter 5, there is a result that highest cases of human casualty come from unsafe actions such as improper management for ship operation, management of electrical equipment, improper handling and other tasks, improper fishing work, poor management of passengers and cargo loading; and others. There is the need for keeping continuous and specific training in a limited time. Knowing the kind of monitoring in unsafe actions can help to map features of human limitations to get a unique approach to improving human performance...|$|E

Advocates of this belief are seeking to ban amalgam use and to force dentists and den-tal organizations to compensate all persons who claim that amalgam has damaged their health. The National Council Against Health Fraud believes that amalgam fillings are safe, that anti-amalgam activities endanger public welfare, and that so-called “mercury-free dentistry ” is <b>substandard</b> <b>practice.</b> Background History Dental amalgam has been widely used for over 150 years. It is made by mixing approximately equal parts of elemen-tal liquid mercury (43 to 54 percent) and an alloy powder (57 to 46 percent) composed of silver, tin, copper, and some-times smaller amounts of zinc, palladium, or indium [1]. Although some forms of mercury are hazardous, the mer-cury in amalgam is chemically bound to the other metals {{to make it stable}} and therefore safe for use in dental applications. The difference between bound and unbound chemicals can be illustrated by a simple comparison. Elemental hy-drogen is an explosive gas. Elemental oxygen is a gas that supports combustion. When combined, however, they form water, which has neither of these effects. Saying that amal-gam will poison you is like saying that drinking water will make you explode and burst into flames.

40|$|Background: In Mali and Senegal, over 1 % {{of women}} die giving birth in hospital. At some hospitals, {{over a third}} of infants are stillborn. Many deaths are due to <b>substandard</b> medical <b>practices.</b> Criterion-based {{clinical}} audits (CBCA) are increasingly used to measure and improve obstetrical care in resource-limited settings, but their measurement properties have not been formally evaluated. In 2011, we published a systematic review of obstetrical CBCA highlighting insufficient considerations of validity and reliability. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop an obstetrical CBCA adapted to the West African context and assess its reliability and validity. This work was conducted as a sub-study within a cluster randomized trial known as QUARITE. Methods: Criteria were selected based on extensive literature review and expert opinion. Early 2010, two auditors applied the CBCA to identical samples at 8 sites in Mali and Senegal (n = 185) to evaluate inter-rater reliability. In 2010 - 11, we conducted CBCA at 32 hospitals to assess construct validity (n = 633 patients). We correlated hospital characteristics (resource availability, facility perinatal and maternal mortality) with mean hospital CBCA scores. We used generalized estimating equations to assess whether patient CBCA scores were associated with perinatal mortality. Results: Results demonstrate substantial (ICC = 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 54; 0. 76) to elevated inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 77; 0. 89) in Senegal and Mali, respectively. Resource availability positively correlated with mean hospital CBCA scores and maternal and perinatal mortality were inversely correlated with hospital CBCA scores. Poor CBCA scores, adjusted for hospital and patient characteristics, were significantly associated with perinatal mortality (OR 1. 84, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 3. 34). Conclusion: Our CBCA has substantial inter-rater reliability and there is compelling evidence of its validity as the tool performs according to theory...|$|R

During this period of time, several meetings were held with Federal and State agencies and community members {{to understand why the}} communities installed wastewater systems, who funded, designed and constructed the systems, and to assess community support or sense of ownership of the project. Project (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: International Development and Technology, 2010 Latin America and the Caribbean is the most urbanized region in the developing world. However, less than 10 percent of domestic and industrial wastewater is properly treated, causing severe environmental, health, social and economic problems. Over the past several years, Mexico has undertaken significant sanitation projects including wastewater treatment projects. State and federal water agencies have assisted both semi-urban and rural communities construct over 80 municipal wastewater treatment plants in the State of Oaxaca in southern Mexico. From July 2006 through February 2008, an investigation was conducted to evaluate ten (10) wastewater treatment systems in Oaxaca, Mexico. Nine (9) systems utilized vegetated gravel bed treatment systems and the tenth system used wastewater stabilization ponds. The objectives of the investigation were to understand the factors that motivated the communities to install wastewater treatment systems, select the type of systems, costs of the systems, and to review the design and construction of the projects. The evaluation also evaluated the social, political, economic and technical factors affecting the performance, operation and maintenance of the plants. The study found {{that the majority of the}} systems were in poor operating condition. The poor operating systems resulted from various factors including engineering designs using dated and inaccurate design criteria, inadequate operation and maintenance, and in some instances <b>substandard</b> construction <b>practices...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In Mali and Senegal, over 1 % {{of women}} die giving birth in hospital. At some hospitals, {{over a third}} of infants are stillborn. Many deaths are due to <b>substandard</b> medical <b>practices.</b> Criterion-based {{clinical}} audits (CBCA) are increasingly used to measure and improve obstetrical care in resource-limited settings, but their measurement properties have not been formally evaluated. In 2011, we published a systematic review of obstetrical CBCA highlighting insufficient considerations of validity and reliability. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop an obstetrical CBCA adapted to the West African context and assess its reliability and validity. This work was conducted as a sub-study within a cluster randomized trial known as QUARITE. Methods Criteria were selected based on extensive literature review and expert opinion. Early 2010, two auditors applied the CBCA to identical samples at 8 sites in Mali and Senegal (n = 185) to evaluate inter-rater reliability. In 2010 – 11, we conducted CBCA at 32 hospitals to assess construct validity (n = 633 patients). We correlated hospital characteristics (resource availability, facility perinatal and maternal mortality) with mean hospital CBCA scores. We used generalized estimating equations to assess whether patient CBCA scores were associated with perinatal mortality. Results Results demonstrate substantial (ICC = 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 54; 0. 76) to elevated inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 77; 0. 89) in Senegal and Mali, respectively. Resource availability positively correlated with mean hospital CBCA scores and maternal and perinatal mortality were inversely correlated with hospital CBCA scores. Poor CBCA scores, adjusted for hospital and patient characteristics, were significantly associated with perinatal mortality (OR 1. 84, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 3. 34). Conclusion Our CBCA has substantial inter-rater reliability and there is compelling evidence of its validity as the tool performs according to theory.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is {{a global}} health security threat and the reliability of surveillance systems that provide accurate information is crucial. Through the use of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, the surveillance and monitoring process can provide a diagnosis of AMR within under-resourced settings in South Asia. A literature review within a scoping/narrative structure was conducted for this capstone in order to illustrate current deficiencies in AMR surveillance and monitoring for select countries in the South Asian region. This capstone project embraces the perspective that AMR surveillance is {{the first and most}} crucial step in illustrating the current burden and impact of this issue and informing change-inducing policies and interventions. The project {{is a global}} call to action on AMR surveillance in the developing world. It was found that there is a general lack of systematic data collection regarding AMR in the region, rendering it a neglected problem within many countries. The emergence of AMR in developing nations in South Asia is a symptom of <b>substandard</b> surveillance <b>practices.</b> Pathogens that are problematic in terms of resistance are not well represented through surveillance information. Resource-related constraints and sociocultural attitudes are also problematic in terms of antibiotic use. Antibiotic misuse/overuse are important determinants as they can create environmental pressure that causes resistant strains to emerge in both humans and animals. It is often difficult to measure AMR burden in developing countries, due to biases in reporting, testing methodologies, defective legislative practices, etc. The development of a global surveillance system that overarches local systems and increases coordination, cohesion, and comprehensiveness is recommended. The ultimate goal is to supplement the creation of a global strategy to mitigate AMR through the development of stronger surveillance systemsand collaborative networksaroundthe world. These approaches should aid with the creation of time-oriented, realistic, and visible change.  The WHO report, in conjunction with this capstone project, is an important first step in highlighting the magnitude of the problem and moving towards addressing the visible gaps in AMR surveillance in South Asia and other resource-limited settings. The lack of evidence should fuel further examination of this issue and increased discussion within global health policy and practice...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: WHO {{recommends}} prompt {{diagnosis and}} quinine plus clindamycin {{for treatment of}} uncomplicated malaria in the first trimester and artemisinin-based combination therapies in subsequent trimesters. We undertook a systematic review of women's access to and healthcare provider adherence to WHO case management policy for malaria in pregnant women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched the Malaria in Pregnancy Library, the Global Health Database, and the International Network for the Rational Use of Drugs Bibliography from 1 January 2006 to 3 April 2014, without language restriction. Data were appraised for quality and content. Frequencies of women's and healthcare providers' practices were explored using narrative synthesis and random effect meta-analysis. Barriers to women's access and providers' adherence to policy were explored by content analysis using NVivo. Determinants of women's access and providers' case management practices were extracted and compared across studies. We did not perform a meta-ethnography. Thirty-seven studies were included, conducted in Africa (30), Asia (4), Yemen (1), and Brazil (2). One- to three-quarters of women reported malaria episodes during pregnancy, of whom treatment was sought by > 85 %. Barriers to access among women included poor knowledge of drug safety, prohibitive costs, and self-treatment practices, used by 5 %- 40 % of women. Determinants of women's treatment-seeking behaviour were education and previous experience of miscarriage and antenatal care. Healthcare provider reliance on clinical diagnosis and poor adherence to treatment policy, especially in first versus other trimesters (28 %, 95 % CI 14 %- 47 %, versus 72 %, 95 % CI 39 %- 91 %, p = 0. 02), was consistently reported. Prescribing practices were driven by concerns over side effects and drug safety, patient preference, drug availability, and cost. Determinants of provider practices were access to training and facility type (public versus private). Findings were limited by the availability, quality, scope, and methodological inconsistencies of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic assessment {{of the extent of}} <b>substandard</b> case management <b>practices</b> of malaria in pregnancy is required, as well as quality improvement interventions that reach all providers administering antimalarial drugs in the community. Pregnant women need access to information on which anti-malarial drugs are safe to use at different stages of pregnancy. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary...|$|R
40|$|Background: Reporting and {{recording}} {{are the major}} communication techniques used by health care worker in directing client based decision making and continuity of care. The medical records serve as a legal document for recording all client activities initiated by all health practitioners, its may be paper documents or electronic documents. Documentation allows nurses and other care providers to communicate about the care provided, and promote good nursing care and supports nurses to meet professional and legal standards. However, nursing documentation continues to draw criticism from professional, community, and regulatory organizations because of incomplete, <b>substandard</b> charting <b>practices.</b> Studies focused on time indicate that nurses spend {{a significant amount of}} time in recordkeeping. Nurses regularly copied data from the medical record and other documents to create personal records that guided their activities. The purpose of this paper: is to evaluate nurses' attitudes toward documentation for endorsing patient care and its value as mean of communication. Also to identify the problems and barriers in the nursing documentation for reflecting actual nurse work Load from nurses’ perspective. Methods: 1. Design :An exploratory descriptive study design was used. 2. Setting: The study was conducted over three months (March - May 2010) in pre natal,post natal and nursery departments, at Al aziziah Maternity and children hospital, in Jeddah. 3. Sample; A total of (160) female nurses working at the wards of the study settings, 60 of them of different nationality were recruited thought simple random sampling 4. Tools; A questionnaire sheet was developed by researchers for data collection, also Likert rating scale consisting of 10 items divided into two sections: documentation barrier (5 items), and Documentation-tension (5 items). The research tools was generated through review of the literature and consultation with nursing experts. The descriptive statistics of mean was use to analyze the data with a criterion mean at 2. 50. Results:. The present study findings revealed significant percentages of nurses’ agreement upon the benefit of documentation to patient care,(48. 7 %) reported that nursing notes always facilitate the movement toward the nursing goals, documentation leads to improve patient care recorded (30 %). Furthermore, the majority had reported that documentation is always related to nursing care that provided to patient (61. 7 %). On the other hand, 41. 7 % were thinking that documentation is often an accurate reflection of patient nursing care. Concerning the value of documentation to the nurses, (51. 7 %) agreed that use of documentation are often more of help for nurses than load, while (38. 3 %) reported that nursing notes are often important to every health provider and documentation is not wasting of time. Regarding documentation barriers, (30 %) had agreed upon that documentation is too heavily structured by quality assurance, and Workload demands hinder the completing of patient documentation. while (35 %) agreed upon the statement that Shortage of staff work hinder completing of patient documentation. While only (16. 7 %) agreed upon the statement that Language barrier decrease quality of nursing documentation, and (21. 7 %) reported that documentation consist a lot of double-charting and repetition. Conclusion: It is concluded that nurses have a positive attitude to ward documentation in the mean of patient care, communication and value. However, nurses are not certain upon documentation barriers and tension. There is also significant relation ship between barriers, tension and Saudi nurses. Therefore, it is recommended for further examination of nurses opinion regarding barriers and tension among Saudi nurses. It is also necessary for hospitals to adopt formal nurses’ documentation forms on their chart...|$|R
40|$|A project {{presented}} to the Department of Physician Assistant of Wichita State University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Physician Assistant. Rural and urban locations differ from each other culturally, structurally, economically, and socially. Because healthcare facilities serve the surrounding communities, the structural and cultural make up of these communities plays {{a large role in}} health care delivery. However, despite the significant difference between urban and rural communities, quality of healthcare is still determined by only one set of generalized standards of care. This leaves rural areas at a disadvantage, since they lack many of the elements that urban facilities possess such as the large patient numbers, technology, large number of healthcare providers, and specialty care. To improve the quality of care for rural patients, rural communities need to be recognized as a distinct entity and specific standards of care developed that address these unique traits. By doing so, rural health care can be recognized for the true specialty that it is instead of a <b>substandard</b> way of <b>practicing</b> medicine. Methodology: The purpose of this paper was to perform a systematic review of the literature and examine the cumulative data addressing the differences in quality of healthcare between urban and rural. This study investigates the factors that contribute to these differences, in the end making a clear distinction between urban and rural cultures and determining if these factors warrant a change in the current quality of care standards. This should demonstrate to healthcare providers that these differences can {{play a significant role in}} the quality of healthcare received. Articles used included those addressing rural adherence to acute myocardial infarction and diabetes care treatment guidelines, rural quality of care, and differences in social work and nursing in rural areas. Results: Thirty-four articles matched the criteria and were reviewed using evidence-based methods. After close analysis of the presented data, it appeared that there was a clear decrease in the quality of care in rural facilities compared to urban. However, the literature also showed a significant difference in make up of rural and urban communities. Rural communities differed from urban in many ways including: the lack of specialty care, smaller size of the community, lack of transportation, isolation of residents, shortage of healthcare providers, cultural characteristic discrepancies, increased community interaction, and decrease in economic opportunity. Conclusion: Rural healthcare was found to have a decreased quality of care compared to urban healthcare facilities. However, there are many factors that contribute to this disparity that are not considered in quality measurements. These distinctions make rural areas unique, and need to be considered when measuring the quality of care in rural areas...|$|R
40|$|O trabalho cooperativo nas comunidades escolares apresenta inúmeras vantagens ao nível do desenvolvimento dos alunos, dos professores e da própria escola. No entanto, continuam a existir várias lacunas neste tipo de actividades e, especificando Portugal, existem muitos trabalhos de tipo diagnóstico, que não chegam para implantar cultura de cooperação. Quando falamos da implementação da cooperação nas escolas, temos de atender, obrigatoriamente, à cultura de escola vivenciada nas mesmas e à liderança, pois influenciam a cooperação. Este trabalho tem como finalidade verificar até que ponto existe trabalho cooperativo entre professores e perceber como se desenvolve a cultura de cooperação entre professores nos diferentes grupos de área disciplinar duma mesma escola. Para verificar este objectivo, participaram 13 responsáveis dos diferentes grupos de Áreas Disciplinares de uma escola secundária da zona do Estoril. Estes foram inquiridos através da aplicação de um questionário adaptado, daquele que foi validado e utilizado por Bolam et al (2005), e através de uma entrevista semi-estruturada, para análise da percepção que os mesmos têm sobre a cooperação e a cultura vivenciada dentro dos seus Grupos de Área Disciplinar. No geral, verificou-se que, relativamente à cooperação e à cultura cooperativa de grupo, os Departamentos de Área Curricular não diferem significativamente entre si, não existindo um grande sentido de cooperação. De acordo com as percepções dos inquiridos, verificou-se que existe uma fraca participação dos professores em acções cooperativas focalizadas no desenvolvimento profissional docente e focalizadas no desenvolvimento da cultura cooperativa ou através das precárias condições ou práticas extrínsecas a este desenvolvimento. Analisando a globalidade das mudanças verificadas nos últimos dois anos, constatou-se que os Grupos de Área Disciplinar estão a viver um momento de estagnação na maioria das questões inquiridas. Averiguou-se, também, que a não/fraca liderança por parte dos responsáveis de grupo de área disciplinar, resulta numa fraca participação dos professores em questões cooperativas. Através deste estudo, pode-se concluir que existe uma fraca cooperação entre os professores do mesmo Grupo de Área Disciplinar desta escola. Conclui-se também que a escola atravessa um momento de estagnação, não existindo um real desenvolvimento da cultura cooperativa na escola. Cooperative work {{in school}} {{communities}} presents numerous advantages {{at the level}} of student, teacher and school development. However, there are still several gaps in this kind of activities and, specifically in Portugal, there have been many diagnostic-type studies, which are not enough to impose a cooperative culture. When referring to the implementation of cooperation in schools, one must necessarily cater to culture experienced in school, as well as to leadership, which influence cooperation. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine wither is cooperative work between teachers and to understand how this cooperation culture develops among teachers of different subject-area workgroups of the same school. To accomplish this goal, thirteen head teachers of different subject-area workgroups of the same school in Estoril participated in this study. They were inquired by means of a questionnaire, adapted from an existing survey that was validated and used by Bolam et al (2005), and through a semi-structured personal interview, in order to analyze their own perception of the culture and cooperation experienced within their workgroup. In general, it was found that, regarding cooperation and the cooperation culture within the workgroup, the various curricular departments did not significantly differ, and that there wasn’t a great sense of cooperation amongst them. According to the inquired individual’s self-perception, it was verified that there is an insufficient or weak participation of teachers in cooperative actions, focused on the professional teaching development, on the development of a cooperative culture or through precarious or <b>substandard</b> conditions and <b>practices,</b> extrinsic to this development. Analyzing the global changes observed in these past two years, it was found that the subject-area workgroups are going through a moment of stagnation in most of the inquired topics. It was also concluded that the weak or nonexistent leadership of the heads of the subject-area workgroups results in weak participation of teachers in cooperative matters. Through this study one concludes that there is weak cooperation between teachers of the same workgroup for this particular school. One also finds the school to be going through a stagnancy moment, revealing no real evolution or development of a cooperative culture in school. Orientação : Maria do Carmo Clímac...|$|R
