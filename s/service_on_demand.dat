In this paper, {{we discuss}} the major issues {{associated}} with the new model of software delivery – <b>service</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> – and explain why it alters the economics of software. As this model is expected to deliver fundamental leaps in cost efficiency, operation performance, infrastructure orchestration and ap-plication control, we describe the supporting technology required to achieve these goals. We also highlight those crucial operational processes for enhancing the quality of software delivery under the <b>service</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> model. We then briefly outline our research roadmap to develop an on demand operating envi-ronment based on the fundamental principles: standardization, repetition, and, ultimately, automation...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the impact of Federal Reserve membership on the price of bank services, mainly average loan rates <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and average deposit rates. In addition, this research investigated the influence of the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market on member banks pricing policies. ^ The research design involved the formulation of a system of equations incorporating bank inputs, output and the pricing of bank services. The system was estimated for all the sampled states (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska) as a group and for individual states (after the necessary modifications) using Three Stage Least Squares. ^ The data were secured from three sources: First, the balance sheets and income statements for insured commercial banks in the four sampled states from 1972 - 1977 were obtained from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Second: total population, retail sales, effective buying income and median household effective buying income were obtained from various issues of Sales and Marketing Management magazine. Finally, the adjusted monetary base (seasonally adjusted) figures were obtained from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. ^ Within the context of the theoretical framework that bank input, output, and the pricing decisions are simultaneously determined, the statistical results indicated that, on the average, member banks in the four states as a whole, had charged their customers lower average rates on loans, and lower <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits. In addition, the findings suggested that the higher the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market, the higher the <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and the lower average rates on time and savings deposits. However, the statistical results indicated that the effect of FRS was contingent on the state where member banks were located. For individual state, the findings were as follows: (1) Illinois member banks charged their customers higher average rates on loans and lower <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits than nonmember banks. (2) Iowa member banks charged their customers higher average rates <b>on</b> loans, higher <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits than nonmember banks. Furthermore, the higher the ratio of member banks in the market, the higher the average loan rate and the <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits. (3) Kansas member banks charged their customers higher <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits than nonmember banks. Furthermore, the higher the concentration ratio of member banks in the market the lower the <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and average deposits rate. (4) Nebraska member banks charged their customers lower average rates <b>on</b> loans, lower <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits. Furthermore, the higher the ratio of member banks in the market, the lower the <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits. ^ Including the interaction term between FRS membership and the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market yielded no statistically significant results for the sample as a whole. However, it was found that member banks in markets dominated by member banks charged their customers higher <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits (in the state of Illinois), lower <b>service</b> charges <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> deposits (in the state of Kansas) and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits (in the state of Nebraska). ...|$|R

In {{the second part of the}} thesis {{deals with the}} providers of AV media <b>service</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> operating outside of the Czech Republic, which are therefore unavailable for domestic users.

The final, third part of this thesis presents the security tools, whose basis allows their use to circumvent the geographical restrictions. In this chapter the performances of individual tools are evaluated, whereas the evaluation has been based on the original, two-month lasting research of internet speed connection, where particular security tools were used. The conclusion proves that it is possible to use security tools for circumvent geographic restrictions at providers of AV media services on demand. To prove this statement the author made a second test, where he observed the quality of instantly playing video with the use of individual security tools within the different providers of an AV media services on demand...|$|E

AppaaS provisions mobile applications as a cloud <b>service</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> {{with the appropriate}} access constraints. AppaaS provides a platform where mobile applications providers and users can match offerings with requests. The platform enables providers to customize their offerings and set proper access constraints according to the privileges of users and their context. It also enables users to conveniently find relevant applications to their situation and save the current application state for future reference. The platform handles several types of context information to ensure that selected applications best serve the user requesting the service. The proposed platform offers a user-friendly interface to facilitate the communication between users and the backend server, where all context processing and data storage management occur.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{wireless}} ad hoc {{network is}} an autonomous {{system that is}} made up of collaborative mobile nodes. Wireless ad hoc networks can be dynamically set up without relying on any pre-existing infrastructure or central administration. Implementing public key management is a challenging issue in wireless ad hoc networks due to its salient nature of the network. Without an online third party, the public key certificate distribution is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, we present On-demand Public Key Management (OPKM), a novel public key management scheme for wireless ad hoc networks. OPKM makes use of broadcasting technology and digital signature mechanism to provide key management <b>service</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand,</b> while protecting the certificate distribution against man-in-the-middle attacks. OPKM can be fully organised by nodes themselves without the need of any online trust third party. I...|$|E
40|$|Current Internet {{service plans}} for {{residential}} customers offer {{little or no}} choice of different quality levels. Instead, the vast majority encourages waste and leads to user cross-subsidies. However, {{in order to ensure}} further Internet growth and efficiently support quality-differentiated network services, users' choice options have to go beyond different service plans that only reflect a rough market segmentation. To further subdivide these segments, choice options also need to provide the means to let users express their current needs by instantaneously selecting the service quality. This argument is strongly supported by empirical evidence from the Internet Demand Experiment (INDEX), a market trial for quality-differentiated Internet services.
