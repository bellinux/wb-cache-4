To achieve such a functionality, new methods for nonlinear modulation are required, which are able to precisely tune the nonlinear interactions between resonant antenna elements.

The latter originates {{from the}} large ratio of the dielectric constants {{of the water and}} a surrounding media.

We show that at rather generic conditions the channels may undergo ion exchange phase transitions (typically of the first order). Upon such a transition a finite latent concentration of ions may either enter or leave the channel, or be exchanged between the ions of different valences.

40|$|Theoretical {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} origin of high temperature superconductivity are challenged by {{the complexity of the}} normal state, which exhibits three regimes with increasing hole doping: a pseudo-gap regime when underdoped, strange power laws near optimal doping and more conventional metallic behavior when heavily overdoped. We suggest that the origin of this behavior is linked to a zero temperature quantum phase transition separating the overdoped Fermi liquid from a spin-charge separated underdoped phase. Central to our analysis is a new $Z_ 2 $ gauge theory formulation, which supports topological vortex excitations - dubbed visons. The visons are gapped in the underdoped phase, splitting the electron's charge and Fermi statistics into two <b>separate</b> <b>excitations.</b> Superconductivity occurs when the resulting charge $e$ boson condenses. The visons are condensed in the overdoped phase, thereby confining the charge and statistics of the electron leading to a Fermi liquid phase.
