This paper describes the construction and operation of a subscale fire test that simulates the heat flux levels and thermochemistry of typical open pool fires.

30|$|The batch-processing {{feature in}} the fbp {{function}} was applied somewhat differently. Unlike FWI system variables, FBP system variables do not rely on previous time step values. Like the FWI system, the FBP system contains multiple output variables, 42 in total, 8 of which are considered primary and the rest are considered secondary. Input for fbp is a data.frame containing <b>fuel</b> types, <b>fire</b> weather components, and slope. Each vector of inputs defines a single FBP system prediction for a <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> type and set of weather conditions. By {{taking advantage of the}} vector computation in R, the fbp function was designed to evaluate the FBP system for a <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> type and instant in time, multiple records for a single point (e.g., one weather station, either hourly or daily weather stream for a period of time), or multiple points (multiple weather stations or a gridded surface) for a single time slice. In order to be more efficient in processing large datasets, the function also provides a parallel processing option, which may speed up the processing time significantly if the input data contains millions of data points.|$|R

The source of heating {{is assumed to be}} a hydrocarbon <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> burning in an adjacent compartment. The heat released from the fire raises the temperature of a common bulkhead which then radiates energy onto the ordnance in the magazine. The method compares well with data available in the literature for shipboard <b>fuel</b> <b>fire.</b> Based on the strength of these comparisons, the method is used to estimate the likely heating rate for the Penguin ASM while mounted within the ANZAC Air Weapons magazine...|$|R
40|$|The {{source term}} {{literature}} was reviewed to estimate aerosolized and respirable release fractions for accidents involving plutonium in high-explosive (HE) detonation and in <b>fuel</b> <b>fires.</b> For HE detonation, all estimates {{are based on}} the total amount of Pu. For <b>fuel</b> <b>fires,</b> all estimates {{are based on the}} amount of Pu oxidized. I based my estimates for HE detonation primarily upon the results from the Roller Coaster experiment. For hydrocarbon <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> oxidation of plutonium, I based lower bound values on laboratory experiments which represent accident scenarios with very little turbulence and updraft of a fire. Expected values for aerosolization were obtained from the Vixen A field tests, which represent a realistic case for modest turbulence and updraft, and for respirable fractions from some laboratory experiments involving large samples of Pu. Upper bound estimates for credible accidents are based on experiments involving combustion of molten plutonium droplets. In May of 1991 the DOE Pilot Safety Study Program established a group of experts to estimate the fractions of plutonium which would be aerosolized and respirable for certain nuclear weapon accident scenarios...|$|R

40|$|One of the IM tests {{described}} in STANAG 4439 is the Fast Cook-off (FCO) test. The Liquid <b>Fuel</b> or External <b>Fire,</b> Munition Test Procedures is {{described in}} STANAG 4240 : “The objective of the selected <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test is {{the determination of the}} reaction and time to reaction of the munition(s) when subjected to a liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> environment”. However, {{there is a lot of}} discussion about this typical test. The drawback of the <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test is the pollution of the environment during burning, as a result of the soot and many other substances in the fuel. Therefor a group of international experts is evaluating the use of propane as an alternate fuel for the Fast Heating Test Procedure identified in STANAG 4240 during a series of <b>Fuel</b> <b>Fire</b> Expert meetings (FFE). In the Netherlands the number of polluting large <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test per year is limited but also the performance of the Dutch small <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test leads to pollution and gives an undesirable situation. This is the reason that, in cooperation with the Knowledge Center of Weapons & Munitions of the Dutch MoD, also TNO has developed and tested a clean FCO test setup, based on propane. In the last IMEMTS conference the set-up was described and the results of several tests series, including a calibrating test series in co-operations with the US laboratories NSWC and NAWC, was presented. Since then, the set-up has been improved with respect to safety and several tests series have been performed to increase the hearth of the fire and improve the temperature distribution over the hearth. Also the heating of none cylindrical items such as munition boxes has been improved. The gas flow of the set-up is now remote controlled for safety reasons during live munition testing. The number of burners has been increased, up to 24 burners can now be used. Four relative expensive piezo-burners are used for ignition while the other have replace by cheaper burners without piezo-igniters. Also, the set-up of the burners has been changed; two lines of burners per side have been made, one pointing on the bottom of the tested item and one somewhere around the middle. This increases the hearth of the fire and the improves temperature distribution around the item. Now up to 10 cm below and above the test item, the temperatures are well above the 800 °C. One of the main advantages of this set-up is that burning is so clean that the fire is totally transparent and all items can be filmed during testing. With the new set-up and with the small <b>fuel</b> <b>fire</b> test a series of tests with live munitions has been performed. The results of the pre-test with the mock-ups, the results and comparison of the two tests series with live munition as well as the lessons learned from these tests series will be presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance and}} emissions contours of a hydrogen dual fueled compression ignition (CI) engine with two pilot fuels (diesel and rapeseed methyl ester), and compares the performance and emissions iso-contours of diesel and rapeseed methyl ester (RME) <b>single</b> <b>fueling</b> with diesel and RME piloted hydrogen dual fueling throughout the engines operating speed and power range. The collected data {{have been used to}} produce iso-contours of thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency, specific oxides of nitrogen (NOX), specific hydrocarbons (HC) and specific carbon dioxide (CO 2) on a power-speed plane. The performance and emission maps are experimentally investigated, compared, and critically discussed. Apart from medium loads at lower and medium speeds with diesel piloted hydrogen combustion, dual fueling produced lower thermal efficiency everywhere across the map. For diesel and RME <b>single</b> <b>fueling</b> the maximum specific NOX emissions are centered at the mid speed, mid power region. Hydrogen dual fueling produced higher specific NOX with both pilot fuels as compared to their respective <b>single</b> <b>fueling</b> operations.

30|$|Although we {{expected}} pre-burn fuel loads {{to be related}} to patterns of mean fire temperature, this was not consistently true in all plots. This finding contrasts with results of other studies that have found various measures of fire behavior (fire temperature, burn severity, fire intensity) to be correlated with vegetation and fuel heterogeneity (Hobbs et al. 1984, Hobbs and Atkins 1988, Gibson et al. 1990, Rice 1993, Odion and Davis 2000). It is possible that the combined effects of standing biomass, litter, and 1 – 1000 hour <b>fuels</b> on <b>fire</b> temperatures prevented us from seeing strong relationships with any <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> component. For example, overlaying the distribution of standing fuels and litter in Plot 7 would create a similar pattern as mean fire temperature. However, multiple regression analysis confirmed generally weak relationships between pre-burn fuel loads and mean fire temperature, indicating that other variables were likely contributing factors.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{paper was}} to {{investigate}} the development of the graphite/phenolic resin composite materials that were fabricated by compression molding for the bipolar plate of the fuel cell. Effect of the different amounts of resin and the graphite powder size on the porosity, density, bending strength, and electrical resistance of the composites would be analyzed. In addition, the composites of the bipolar plates would be machined into the groove channel using high speed milling, which then assembles into <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> cell. The I-V performance of the <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> cell would be also discussed. The experimental results showed that when the larger amount of resin was employed, the resulting composites had a lower porosity, a larger electrical resistance, and a higher bending strength. The graphite/resin composites showed a good machinability during the high-speed milling. Finally, the graphite/resin composites of bipolar plates containing 25 - 30 vol. % phenolic resins were fabricated into a <b>single</b> <b>fuel</b> cell, which displays a relatively better I-V performance...|$|R
