That paper considered the <b>supplementary</b> <b>forces</b> that are detected in a rotating frame of reference. Coriolis divided these <b>supplementary</b> <b>forces</b> into two categories. The second category contained a force that arises from the cross product of the angular velocity of a coordinate system and the projection of a particle's velocity into a plane perpendicular to the system's axis of rotation. Coriolis referred to this force as the [...] "compound centrifugal force" [...] due to its analogies with the centrifugal force already considered in category one. The effect was known in the early 20th century as the [...] "acceleration of Coriolis", and by 1920 as [...] "Coriolis force".|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In 1835, French {{scientist}} Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis wrote a {{paper in}} which he mathematically derived equations of motion for rotating coordinate systems [1]. In this paper he drew attention to two categories of <b>supplementary</b> <b>forces.</b> Coriolis referred to these forces in the plural. The forces in the first category were the ordinary centrifugal forces, while the forces in the second category were described as being equal to twice {{the product of the}} angular velocity of the mobile plane, taken with respect to the relative momentum as projected unto that plane. By analogy with the mathematical formula for the ordinary centrifugal forces, Coriolis called this second category of <b>supplementary</b> <b>forces</b> ‘The compound centrifugal forces’. This paper aims to establish the fundamental physical cause behind centrifugal force as well as its connection with the medium for the propagation of light...|$|R

5000|$|Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis ( [...] ; 21 May 1792 - 19 September 1843) was a French mathematician, {{mechanical}} engineer and scientist.

But most of these members were either already FLN members or were turned by the FLN once enlisted. Corpses of purported FLN members displayed by the unit were in fact those of dissidents and members of other Algerian groups killed by the FLN. The French Army finally discovered the war ruse and tried to hunt down <b>Force</b> <b>K</b> members. However, some 600 managed to escape and join the FLN with weapons and equipment.|$|R
50|$|On a more {{specific}} note, Iphicrates and Timotheos both commanded a <b>supplementary</b> <b>force</b> of 60 naval vessels and joined up with Chares's fleet {{in the summer of}} 356 BC. After Chares suffered defeat in the autumn expedition, he ultimately established a lawsuit against both Timotheos and Iphicrates. Timotheos faced impeachment {{in the aftermath of the}} lawsuit, which led to his ruination. As a result, Isocrates developed a personal hatred for Chares since Timotheos was one of his closest pupils.|$|R
5000|$|An Italian battlefleet {{covered a}} convoy bound for Benghazi. A British {{flotilla}} from Alexandria planned to link with <b>Force</b> <b>K</b> from Malta but the submarine [...] torpedoed and damaged [...] and the Italians retired.

Soon after, the British came across Italian battleships escorting a convoy to Tripoli and the First Battle of Sirte took place. After seeing Breconshire into Malta, <b>Force</b> <b>K</b> sailed again {{to search for}} the Tripoli convoy but ran into a minefield off Tripoli.

On the night of 8/9 November 1941, in the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy <b>Force</b> <b>K</b> destroyed the convoy, forcing the Italian high command to consider Tripoli [...] "practically blockaded". Soon after, <b>Force</b> <b>K</b> was reinforced at Malta by Force B, with the light cruisers [...] and [...] and two J, K and N class destroyers. The combined force was so effective that during November 1941, the Axis supply line suffered 60 percent losses.|$|R

5000|$|Part of {{the reason}} for this {{favourable}} outcome in November 1941, was the arrival of <b>Force</b> <b>K</b> of the Royal Navy, which during the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy sank all the ships, which practically blockaded Libyan ports. Soon after, <b>Force</b> <b>K</b> was reinforced by the arrival in Malta of Force B with the light cruisers [...] and [...] and the K-class destroyers, Kimberley and Kingston, on 27 November. Joint operations with the RAF were so effective that during November 1941, Axis fuel losses amounted to 49,365 tons out of 79,208 tons. Among the contributors to the sinking of Axis shipping was 828 Naval Air Squadron, 830 Naval Air Squadron, the British 10th Naval Flotilla and 69 Squadron which shadowed convoys with their Maryland aircraft. Special flights of RAF Wellingtons fitted with air-to-surface vessel (ASV) radar, were important to <b>Force</b> <b>K</b> operations and Ultra intelligence reached Malta on Axis convoy movements. The RAF Malta Command would then dispatch the ASV-Wellingtons to sweep the seas and direct the British naval forces to the convoy.|$|R
