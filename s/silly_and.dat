5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised when he saw the additions, because he originally thought they were <b>silly</b> <b>and</b> would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E

25|$|We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet {{almost none}} of the {{information}} we think we possess is true. Eskimos do not rub noses. The rickshaw was invented by an American. Joan of Arc was not French. Lenin was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither haggis, whisky, porridge, clan tartans or kilts are Scottish. So we stand, silent, on a peak in Darien a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. QI country. Whatever is interesting we are interested in. Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at in the right way. At one extreme, QI is serious, intensely scientific, deeply mystical; at the other it is hilarious, <b>silly</b> <b>and</b> frothy enough to please the most indolent couch-potato.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the meeting}} in Cologne, Papen and Hitler had been photographed going into Schröder's house {{and the next day}} 5 January 1933 the news of the Hitler-Papen summit was front-page news all over Germany. Schleicher did not regard the Papen-Hitler talks as a threat, {{regarding}} Papen as a <b>silly</b> <b>and</b> foolish man unable to accomplish anything. On 9 January 1933, Papen met with Hindenburg to tell him that he believed that Hitler was now willing to support a presidential government headed by himself. That same day, Papen met with Schleicher to tell him that he had only been seeking to have Hitler support his government at the Cologne meeting, and furthermore he had was not angry about being ousted by him or Schleicher's attacks on him in public. Based on what Papen had told him, Schleicher now believed Hitler was now only seeking to be the defense or interior minister in his government. To continue the talks which started in Cologne, it was decided that henceforth that Papen and Hitler would meet at the house of Joachim von Ribbentrop in Berlin as Ribbentrop was a Nazi who was also an old friend of Papen's going back to their service together in the Ottoman Empire in 1917-18.|$|E

This led to this version of To Tell the Truth being labeled similar to I've Got a Secret.

500|$|Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic {{awarded the}} episode {{five out of}} five stars, and called it one of [...] "the best episodes in years". Forcella praised the [...] "continuity and callbacks". He {{also noted that the}} tension between Michael and Holly were [...] "easing the viewers towards the end of Carrell's [...] stay at The Office". Alan Sepinwall wrote that, despite the episode being [...] "goofy [...] <b>silly,</b> <b>and</b> [...] about as {{nonsensical}} as the film itself", [...] "Threat Level Midnight" [...] was [...] "a fun, sweet tour through the history of the Michael Scott era".|$|E
500|$|Josh Ralske from AllMovie {{gave the}} film 1½ out of 5 stars, {{saying it was}} [...] "a flawed docudrama" [...] though due to Eberhardt being such a {{fascinating}} character the film was still interesting. He concluded [...] "unfortunately, the film is not quite good enough to recommend to those who aren't familiar with Isabelle Eberhardt's life and work, {{and those who are}} familiar with her are likely to be disappointed." [...] Fabienne Pascaud from Télérama gave a scathing review, advising fans of Eberhardt to avoid the film, saying it was flat and <b>silly</b> <b>and</b> filled with ridiculous and unbelievable scenes.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{mentioned}} jokingly in a 1990 BBC Television {{interview on}} the program Omnibus, that the main theme of the video and the cat metaphor represented that [...] "Pussy rules the world".

500|$|DC Comics {{abandoned}} {{these characters}} in 1964 when newly appointed Batman-editor Julius Schwartz judged them too <b>silly</b> <b>and</b> therefore inappropriate. Schwartz had asserted that these characters should be removed, considering the Batman related comic books had steadily declined in sales, and restored the Batman mythology {{to its original}} conception of heroic vigilantism. Bat-Girl, along with other characters in the Batman Family, were retconned out of existence following the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. However, even though Bat-Girl {{did not exist in}} the post-Crisis continuity, {{a modified version of the}} character, Mary Elizabeth [...] "Bette" [...] Kane, introduced as the superhero Flamebird, continues to appear in DC Comics publications.|$|E
500|$|The Fame Ball Tour {{received}} acclaim from critics. Whitney Pastorek from Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed {{review of}} the concert saying, [...] "Her onstage banter was at times a bit <b>silly</b> <b>and</b> the visuals occasionally lacking in coherent theme, but her voice was strong and refreshingly free of overbearing tracking vocals. For all her cocky bluster, perhaps the most undeniable aspect of Gaga's talent is this: The girl can, and does, sing." [...] The show was described to be a [...] "sartorial experimentation that it made Rocky Horror look like cotillion. One presumed the Lady approved– and somewhere, to be sure, Andy Warhol stirred in his grave." ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{pre-production}} for the episode, {{the cast}} and crew realized that the Halloween conceit would allow the various cast members to wear costumes, rather than their [...] "usual, realistically plain suits". B. J. Novak called the dress-up experience [...] "fun", noting that [...] "seeing the most serious of our plotlines play out alongside such <b>silly</b> <b>and</b> bizarre visuals was, I think, one of the most inspired ideas of the episode's writer, Greg Daniels." [...] The idea for Pam to be dressed as a cat was inspired by several unused stories, created by Gene Stupnitsky, in which [...] "Pam Beesley must disguise herself as a cat". The plot lines were vetoed by the shows writers, but Stupnitsky successfully petitioned to allow Pam to wear a cat costume.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} of the episode, Hader ad-libbed calypso scat singing, which series creator Loren Bouchard cited as an [...] "amazing [...] when a person comes in and ad-libs music." [...] Bouchard further stated: [...] "There's something so musical about it and he's clearly so talented, but it's also <b>silly</b> <b>and</b> in character. It's nice to have your cake and eat it, too." [...] Hader's singing is incorporated into a scene in the episode where Mickey sings while making a hole in Bob's basement wall, and is later reprised in the episode's end credits. The same scene sees Mickey attempting {{to cover up the}} hole with a Big film poster, which serves as a reference to the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Vibe, Beyoncé explained that the concept for the video in depth after being questioned as an [...] "everyday woman." [...] "I don't sing any of the song. The whole time it's like a silent movie and I'm being myself. I'm not performing. I reveal a side of myself no one's ever seen. I'm <b>silly</b> <b>and</b> goofy and not...{{trying to be a}} diva, or trying to be a star – just me." [...] The video features a black and white theme and a grainy film texture. Beyoncé does not lip-sync the lyrics but acts out parts of the song and poses. Several of the scenes used in the video had been shot in 2006 for a B'Day promotional ad by Wal-Mart.|$|E
