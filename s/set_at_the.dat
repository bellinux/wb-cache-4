5|$|Attendances {{have gone}} down since all-seater stadia were introduced, with many records <b>set</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> terraced grounds they replaced. In several cases records were {{achieved}} at a former ground rather than the club's current location.

5|$|Given Hasbro's {{framework}} for Littlest Pet Shop, the developers Cahills pitched their {{adaptation of the}} property. Hasbro originally felt discouraged over having the show <b>set</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pet store, finding the exchange of animals they thought would come from that disconcerting. The Cahills saw the studio's definition of such stores as antiquated, convincing them that most modern locations provide grooming and day care services as opposed to merely selling pets. Production followed quickly, much to their surprise.|$|E

It combines the best of both workers. If both of them work to gather coconuts only, the economy will have 144 coconuts in all, 96 from Crusoe and 48 from Friday. (This can be obtained by setting F=0 in their respective PPF equations and summing them up). Here the slope of the joint PPF is -1/2.|$|E

5|$|Tonelli {{arrived in}} Moscow facing a heavy schedule: he was {{nominated}} in the 100m freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, the 200m backstroke and the 4100m medley and the 4200m freestyle relays. Tonelli came third in his heat of the 100m freestyle to qualify fourth {{with a time of}} 52.04s. However, he swam slower in coming fifth in his semifinal in a time of 52.17s to miss the final by 0.26s. Overall, he was ranked 10th, but if he repeated his Australian record of 51.80 <b>set</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> selection trials, he would have come sixth.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Enzema was {{the sole}} male athlete {{representing}} Equatorial Guinea at the Rio Games at age 27. He had previously competed at the 2012 Summer Games.

He was drawn in the third heat on 12 August, finishing eighth out of nine athletes, {{with a time of}} one minute and 52.14 seconds. Enzema ranked ahead of final-placed finisher Alex Beddoes of the Cook Islands (one minute and 52.76 seconds) but behind Brazil's Lutimar Paes (one minute and 48.38 seconds) in a heat led by eventual gold medallist David Rudisha from Kenya (one minute and 45.09 seconds). Overall, he finished 50th out of 54 runners, and was unable to advance to the later rounds because he finished 7.15 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his heat who progressed to the second round.|$|E
5|$|Dodge's {{screenplay}} for Bad Words was {{featured on the}} 2011 Black List and was shortly thereafter picked up by Bateman.

After two other actors declined to play the main character, Bateman decided to take on the role himself, and cast the other roles by a combination of contacting friends and open casting calls. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the end of 2012.|$|E
