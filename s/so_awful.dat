500|$|Quesada sees Peter's {{making a}} [...] "deal with the Devil" [...] as a villain (Mephisto) taking {{advantage}} of someone at his weakest moment. This, he feels, is a better resolution than Peter and Mary Jane getting divorced, which would indicate [...] "they gave up on their love, that their life in love together was <b>so</b> <b>awful,</b> so stressful, so unfulfilling {{that they had to}} raise a red flag and walk away from it. They quit on their marriage and even more tragic, (they) quit on each other. Instead, we had them make a deal with the devil. [...] 'Cause that isn't as bad." [...] Quesada went on to say, [...] "Peter and MJ didn't quit on their love, they sacrificed it to save a life, that to me is a pretty heroic story." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the light}} of the {{physical}} demands of performing in theatre Paige has said [...] "Musical theatre is the hardest thing any actor will ever do. [...] You become obsessive about sleeping, eating the right food, not speaking and giving yourself vocal rest and keeping exercised". Regarding the pressure of having to be in a fit condition to perform in theatre each night, she remarked [...] "you wouldn't want to read the letters people write when you're off and they're disappointed – it's <b>so</b> <b>awful,</b> the guilt one feels for not being there". As part of a rigorous routine before musical roles to look after her voice, Paige stops eating dairy products and drinking alcohol and works hard on her fitness. After about three months into the production when her voice is tiring from performing, she withdraws from her normal social life, sometimes only communicating by notepad and fax. She never reads her reviews, finding that it is not helpful to hear too many opinions of her work.|$|E
500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch {{of the group}} recollected: [...] "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, came in and said, 'Hey guess what—Madonna's manager called. Do {{you guys want to}} go on tour with her?" [...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why she {{thought it would be a}} good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were <b>so</b> <b>awful</b> that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} not a {{commercial}} success, and MacColl's portrayal of Oscar, in particular, was criticized; it was felt by some critics that she {{was not a}}ndrogynous enough to play Oscar. On Midnight Eye, Jasper Sharp says the film [...] "is one of those works that is <b>so</b> compellingly <b>awful</b> that entire dissertations could be written about what exactly went wrong." ...|$|R

2500|$|These {{technological}} possibilities enabled nuclear {{strategy to}} develop a logic considerably different from previous military thinking. Because {{the threat of nuclear}} warfare was <b>so</b> <b>awful,</b> it was first thought that it might make any war of the future impossible. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's doctrine of [...] "massive retaliation" [...] {{in the early years of}} the Cold War was a message to the USSR, saying that if the Red Army attempted to invade the parts of Europe not given to the Eastern bloc during the Potsdam Conference (such as West Germany), nuclear weapons would be used against the Soviet troops and potentially the Soviet leaders.|$|E
2500|$|Blackmore's fame today {{rests with}} his enemies. Garth's The Dispensary made {{him out to}} be a greedy fool with {{delusions}}, but Pope's criticisms would be the most lasting, and Pope hits Blackmore over and over again on his stupidity and delusions of grandeur. The Scriblerus Club (Pope, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Robert Harley, Henry St. John, Jonathan Swift, and Thomas Parnell) attacked Blackmore in 1717's Three Hours after Marriage. Pope further picked out Blackmore's foolish lines in Peri Bathos (1727) and gives a devastating characterization of [...] "Neverending Blackmore" [...] in The Dunciad (1728), where Blackmore's poetry is <b>so</b> <b>awful</b> that it can even put lawyers to sleep. These attacks were on top of Tom Brown's previous attacks, as well as Dryden's.|$|E
2500|$|Cowell has {{appeared}} as a guest voice in an episode of The Simpsons ("Smart and Smarter"), in which he gets beaten up by Homer Simpson (while criticising Homer's punches). In May 2010, he portrayed himself again in an episode of The Simpsons, [...] "Judge Me Tender". His voice was heard on an episode of Family Guy ("Lois Kills Stewie"), in which he told Stewie that his singing was <b>so</b> <b>awful</b> {{that he should be}} dead. He made an MTV Movie Award-winning cameo appearance as himself in Scary Movie 3, where he sits in judgment during a battle rap (and is subsequently killed by gunfire for criticising the rappers). He appears in the DVD version of Shrek 2 as himself in Far Far Away Idol, and also provided the voice.|$|E
5000|$|Pre-release demos {{featured}} at E3 2014 received mixed reception from journalists. Destructoid nominated Rise of Lyric for [...] "Best Platformer" [...] and [...] "Best Nintendo Exclusive" [...] {{for their}} [...] "Best of E3" [...] awards. In contrast, GameCentral {{was much more}} negative in their preview stating, [...] "the very worst game in the line-up was Sega's Sonic Boom, which was <b>so</b> unspeakably <b>awful</b> we couldn't even force ourselves to play through the whole demo".|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Phil," [...] {{cried the}} girl, in an earnest tone of entreaty; [...] "don't, oh, don't swear <b>so.</b> It is <b>awful</b> {{to think that}} God hears you, is near you-- at your very elbow--while you thus insult Him to his face." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{series was}} panned by most reviewers. Alison Graham of the Radio Times called it [...] "life-sappingly dreadful" [...] and asked, [...] "how did a series <b>so</b> crunchingly <b>awful</b> {{actually}} {{make it to}} a television screen?" [...] Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent described it as [...] "Enid Blyton with added shagging", concluding: [...] "It's terrible, {{but every now and}} then it glints oddly in the light {{in a way that makes}} it hard to write it off entirely." ...|$|R
2500|$|In April 1945, the Red Army seized Berlin, Hitler {{committed}} suicide, and Germany surrendered unconditionally. Stalin {{was annoyed}} that Hitler was dead, having wanted to capture him alive. He ordered his intelligence agencies to secretly bring Hitler's remains to Moscow, seeking {{to prevent any}} physical remains becoming a relic for Nazi sympathisers. As the Red Army had conquered German territory, they discovered the extermination camps that the Nazi administration had run. Many Soviet soldiers engaged in looting, pillaging, and rape, both in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe. Stalin refused to punish the offenders. After receiving a complaint about this from Yugoslav communist Milovan Djilas, Stalin asked how after experiencing the traumas of war a soldier could [...] "react normally? And what is <b>so</b> <b>awful</b> in his having fun with a woman, after such horrors?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Bree then invites Reverend Sykes to dinner, {{who tries}} to {{convince}} Andrew to enroll in Christian counselling. He refuses, saying [...] "I'm not confused. I know exactly who I am." [...] This deeply upsets Bree, who tells him he has to change or {{he will not be}} with her in heaven; Andrew is shocked and agrees to meet the reverend. In his final scene of the season, after swearing the reverend to secrecy, Andrew states that, not only that he does not believe in God and lied to his parents about being gay {{to get out of the}} camp. This confuses the reverend, who asks him whether he is heterosexual or not: Andrew replies, [...] "Look, I love vanilla ice cream, okay? But every now and then I’m probably gonna be in the mood for chocolate." [...] He then says he will get revenge on Bree for rejecting him by pretending to be a model son and then doing something <b>so</b> <b>awful</b> it is [...] "going to really destroy her".|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, a {{pregnancy}} was {{written into the}} character’s narrative. Natalie was shown to be distressed {{by the prospect of}} being a mother and planned to have an abortion. Speed commented [...] "Natalie desperately wants a baby but the thought of becoming a mother makes her unhappy. Her family background is <b>so</b> <b>awful</b> she doesn't want to make the same mistake her mother made, but feels the odds are stacked against her and Barry." [...] Viewers saw a “devastated Barry” react badly to the news in a special extended four-hander episode (written by Christopher Reason and directed by Clive Arnold) – the episode had a maternal theme with the action flitting between Barry and Natalie’s saga and scenes between Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and his dying mother, which included revelations of child abuse and incest. An EastEnders spokesman said: [...] "We are very proud of the programme. The storylines involving Steve and his mother and Barry and Natalie are the stuff of intense drama. All four actors give incredible performances." ...|$|E
5000|$|The novelist Charles Dickens {{attended}} the public execution, {{and in a}} letter written to The Times {{on the same day}} wrote, [...] "I believe that a sight <b>so</b> inconceivably <b>awful</b> as the wickedness and levity of the immense crowd collected at that execution this morning could be imagined by no man, and could be presented in no heathen land under the sun." [...] He later based one of his characters—Mademoiselle Hortense, Lady Dedlock's maid in Bleak House—on Manning's life.|$|R

She wouldn't {{let me look at}} the {{pictures}} in the big Bible another minute, and gave me a long hymn to learn, shut up in the back bed-room. She's a godly woman, Deacon Hurd says; but I think she's uncommon strict." ...|$|R
2500|$|Elements of {{the history}} of Star Wars are {{commonly}} disputed, as George Lucas' statements about it have changed over time. One of the claims is that he intended to make the film a Space Western. Lucas has said that it was early as 1971—after he completed directing his first full-length feature, THX 1138—that he first had an idea for a space fantasy film, though he has also claimed to have had the idea long before then. In the 2010 coffee table book Star Wars: Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle produced by DK Publishing and Lucasfilm, George Lucas is said to have made his film as a direct contrast to THX 1138. He felt that the bleak tone of the film led to it being poorly received, and therefore chose to make Star Wars a more optimistic film. This is what led to the fun and adventurous tone of the space opera. Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into his own films, having been fascinated by them since he was young. In 1979, he said, [...] "I especially loved the Flash Gordon serials... Of course I realize now how crude and badly done they were... loving them that much when they were <b>so</b> <b>awful,</b> I began to wonder what would happen if they were done really well." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, the Los Angeles Times {{wrote of}} her videos, [...] "this footage {{is a major}} hoot", and BroadwayWorld.com {{described}} Ballinger as an [...] "Internet Superstar." [...] The Times of London commented that although Miranda's videos have made her [...] "a darling of the Broadway musical-theatre scene ... is not online but on stage that Miranda truly comes to ghastly life." [...] In 2010, a BroadwayWorld review of Miranda's live comedy act said that Ballinger's [...] "'Miranda Sings' persona is a very unique and original concept devised by a very creative imagination. ... Miranda {{is not to be}} missed. [...] the old saying goes, it takes talent to be that bad". Another commentator wrote similarly: [...] "It's <b>so</b> <b>awful,</b> it's brilliant." [...] Woman Around Town called Miranda [...] "an atrocious, comedic masterpiece." [...] Perez Hilton praised Miranda's parody of the hit song [...] "Chandelier" [...] as [...] "the crowning achievement of music video parodies ... utterly fantastic". TheaterJones noted that Ballinger: [...] "has hit on a character that reflects the zeitgeist of our time and does it with tongue firmly planted in cheek." [...] In 2015, Playbill concluded: [...] "Miranda Sings is a huge talent. With very demonstrative facial expressions, a unique take on makeup and wardrobe and her almost unbelievable vocal stylings, she cuts an undeniable figure in the world of online music video." [...] The Guardian characterized Miranda's channel as [...] "so bad it's great". Miranda has been compared with such absurd comic creations as Roseanne Roseannadanna and Andy Kaufman's characters, Kimmy Schmidt, [...] "a distaff Napoleon Dynamite" [...] and Pee-wee Herman.|$|E

6000|$|... [11] It {{is a very}} {{ancient and}} {{prevailing}} opinion, that man is always attended by invisible spirits, whose powers or mode of intercourse with our spirits is unknown. These attendants are most active at the hour of death. They cannot be seen unless the eyes are made to possess new or miraculous powers. It may be that, when dying, the spirit, before it entirely quits its mortal habitation, has a glimpse of spiritual existences. If <b>so,</b> how <b>awful</b> for the sinner to see the infernal demons ready to drag away his soul; but most joyful for the Christian to embrace his celestial guides.
