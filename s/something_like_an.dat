However, two witnesses, Louis Bailey and Keith Dobson, testified that they saw Hodson carrying <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> iron-bar or baton as he was chasing after Walker. Governor Grindlay testified that he did not see a bar near Hodson's body but that he found one after Hodson's body was loaded into an ambulance.|$|E

25|$|A longstanding {{theory is}} that the name {{originated}} in the Gallo-Roman period and comes from the Latin antverpia. Antverpia would come from Ante (before) Verpia (deposition, sedimentation), indicating land that forms by deposition in the inside curve of a river (which is in fact the same origin as Germanic waerpen). Note that the river Scheldt, before a transition period between 600 and 750, followed a different track. This must have coincided roughly with the current ringway south of the city, situating the city within a former curve of the river. However, many historians think it unlikely that there was a large settlement which would be named 'Antverpia', but more <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outpost with a river crossing.|$|E
500|$|However, {{later that}} year, Rome {{dispatched}} a military force under praetorian authority {{to put down}} the rebellion. A Roman praetor, Gaius Claudius Glaber, gathered a force of 3,000 men, not regular legions, but a militia [...] "picked up in haste and at random, for the Romans did not consider this a war yet, but a raid, <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> attack of robbery." [...] Glaber's forces besieged the slaves on Mount Vesuvius, blocking the only known way down the mountain. With the slaves thus contained, Glaber was content to wait until starvation forced the slaves to surrender.|$|E

In July 1933, Heigo committed suicide. Kurosawa has commented on the lasting sense of loss he felt at his brother's death and the chapter of his autobiography (<b>Something</b> <b>Like</b> <b>an</b> Autobiography) that describes it—written {{nearly half a century}} after the event—is titled, [...] "A Story I Don't Want to Tell". Only four months later, Kurosawa's eldest brother also died, leaving Akira, at age 23, {{the only one of the}} Kurosawa brothers still living, together with his three surviving sisters.|$|E

500|$|An early {{interpretation}} of the film uses dream analysis to explain that the first part is a dream of the real Diane Selwyn, who has cast her dream-self as the innocent and hopeful [...] "Betty Elms", reconstructing her history and persona into <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old Hollywood film. In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last one-fifth of the film presents Diane's real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally. She arranges for Camilla, an ex-lover, to be killed, and unable {{to cope with the}} guilt, re-imagines her as the dependent, pliable amnesiac Rita. Clues to her inevitable demise, however, continue to appear throughout her dream.|$|E

[...] Smalley asked what kind of [...] "nonaqueous enzymelike chemistry" [...] Drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon, calling this [...] "a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries." ...|$|E
500|$|The genus name Cordyline {{derives from}} an Ancient Greek {{word for a}} club (kordyle), a {{reference}} to the enlarged underground stems or rhizomes, while the species name australis is Latin for [...] "southern". The common name cabbage tree is attributed by some sources to early settlers having used the young leaves as a substitute for cabbage. However the name probably predates the settlement of New Zealand — Georg Forster, writing in his Voyage round the World of 1777 about the events of Friday, April 23, 1773, refers on page 114 to the discovery of a related species in Fiordland as [...] "not the true cabbage palm" [...] and says [...] "the central shoot, when quite tender, tastes <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> almond's kernel, with a little of the flavour of cabbage." ...|$|E

500|$|The Evangelion {{series is}} {{permeated}} {{with references to}} Kabbalah, Christianity and Judaism, complicating viewers' attempts to form an unambiguous interpretation of the series. The series seems {{to be influenced by}} the Midrash, the Zohar and other Kabbalistic texts on the Book of Genesis, which are apparently reworked within the series to create a new Evangelion-specific mythology while still maintaining a connection with the original texts. Assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki said the religious visual references were intended to make the series more [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "exotic", and denied the existence of a [...] "Christian meaning" [...] for the use of Christian visual symbols in the show. However, according to Anno: [...] "As the symbols are mixed together, for the first time <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> interrelationship or a meaning emerges". The plot combines elements of esotericism and mysticism of the Jewish Kabbalah, including the Angels, which have many common features with the Angels of the religious tradition, such as Sachiel, Sandalphon and Ramiel.|$|E
500|$|Trumbull and Dykstra {{found the}} Magicam models problematic. The Klingon cruiser's {{lighting}} was so dim {{that there was}} no way to make them bright enough on film. As Trumbull also felt the Enterprises lights were ill-suited for his needs, he rewired both models. He questioned that the Enterprise could be traveling years from any source of light and yet still be fully illuminated. Instead of having the ship completely dark save for viewports, Trumbull came up with a system of self-illumination; he pictured the ship as <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> oceanliner, [...] "a grand lady of the seas at night". A similar method was used on the Klingon cruiser model, but he made it less well-lit to convey a different look than the clean visuals of the Federation—the cruiser was meant to evoke [...] "an enemy submarine in World War II that's been out at sea for too long". The models were filmed in multiple passes and composited together in post-production; multiple passes with only the model's lighting running were added to the original pass for the final look. The Klingon cruiser sequence was developed to avoid an opening similar to Star Wars, with one model used for all three seen in the film.|$|E

2500|$|A {{final point}} is that—although {{characters}} have remained {{roughly the same}} since the Han dynasty and some classical grammar is still part of the core curriculum of Chinese secondary schools—vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation have all changed from Old to Middle to Modern Chinese even within the prestige dialects. Thus, although modern Chinese read [...] "Confucius" [...] (...) as Kǒng Fūzǐ, the same title would have been Khuwng Pjutsi in the Tang dynasty and was probably <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> atonal Khongʔ Patsəʔ during his lifetime.

2500|$|Hildegard's {{last and}} grandest visionary work had its genesis {{in one of}} the few times she {{experienced}} <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ecstatic loss of consciousness. As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her Vita, sometime in about 1163, she received [...] "an extraordinary mystical vision" [...] in which was revealed the [...] "sprinkling drops of sweet rain" [...] that John the Evangelist experienced when he wrote, [...] "In the beginning was the Word..." [...] (John 1:1). Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the [...] "Work of God", of which humankind is the pinnacle. The [...] "Book of Divine Works", therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the Prologue to John's Gospel.|$|E
2500|$|Fred Hoffman hypothesizes that {{underlying}} Basquiat's {{sense of}} himself as an artist was his [...] "innate capacity to function as <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> oracle, distilling his perceptions {{of the outside world}} down to their essence and, in turn, projecting them outward through his creative acts." [...] Additionally, continuing his activities as a graffiti artist, Basquiat often incorporated words into his paintings. Before his career as a painter began, he produced punk-inspired postcards for sale on the street, and became known for the political–poetical graffiti under the name of SAMO. On one occasion Basquiat painted his girlfriend's dress with the words [...] "Little Shit Brown". He would often draw on random objects and surfaces, including other people's property. The conjunction of various media is an integral element of Basquiat's art. His paintings are typically covered with text and codes of all kinds: words, letters, numerals, pictograms, logos, map symbols, diagrams and more.|$|E
