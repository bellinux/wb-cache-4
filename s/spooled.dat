40|$|A <b>spool</b> valve as a flow {{direction}} control valve has usually been used in a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy control of the <b>spool</b> valve {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion of the <b>spool.</b> To analyze the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> valve, it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion of the <b>spool.</b> Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the <b>spool.</b> The motion of the <b>spool</b> is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion of the <b>spool,</b> and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> valve dose not exist at present. Final target {{of this study is to}} develop numerical code to predict precisely the dynamic motion of the <b>spool</b> valve. As the first step, dynamic characteristics of a <b>spool</b> valve coupled with electromagnetic and mechanical effects have been conducted in the present paper...|$|R

2500|$|Departing Sydney on 16 July {{using only}} one engine to {{conserve}} fuel, Marion headed through the Strait of Belle Isle and began her oceanographic survey mission. Initially, only Smith and his executive officer, Lieutenant Noble Ricketts, had {{the knowledge of}} how to sample the Arctic waters for temperature and salinity but they trained additional men to handle the instruments used for the survey. At each stop the ship's position was noted and a sounding was made while the temperature and salinity samples were collected. With [...] of sample wire in the water, both winches that handled the sampling equipment failed on 27 July. The crew managed to retrieve the wire in the dark in three hours by using the anchor windlass to heave the line in. In the meantime, one failed winch was repaired using parts scavenged from a spare and the line was <b>spooled</b> back onto the winch. The repair evolution was completed by morning with one winch operational. By July 31, Danish officials in Greenland had radioed permission for Marion to put into Godthaab for repairs to the other winch and the crew worked through the day to remove the two ton winch to shore for repair and replace it on the deckhouse. Marion departed Godthaab that evening with repairs completed.|$|E

2500|$|A fly reel is a single-action reel, {{normally}} {{operated by}} stripping line off the reel with one hand, while casting the rod {{with the other}} hand. [...] The main purpose of a fly reel is to store line, provide smooth uninterrupted tension (drag) when a fish makes a long run, and counterbalance the weight of your fly rod when casting. [...] When used in fly fishing, the fly reel or fly casting reel has traditionally been rather simple in terms of mechanical construction, and little has changed from the design patented by Charles F. Orvis of Vermont in 1874. Orvis first introduced {{the idea of using}} light metals with multiple perforated holes to construct the housing, resulting in a lighter reel that also allowed the <b>spooled</b> fly line to dry more quickly than a conventional, solid-sided design. [...] Early fly reels placed the crank handle {{on the right side of}} the reel. [...] Most had no drag mechanism, but were fitted with a click/pawl mechanism intended to keep the reel from overrunning when line was pulled from the spool. [...] To slow a fish, the angler simply applied hand pressure to the rim of the revolving spool (known as [...] "palming the rim"). [...] Later, these click/pawl mechanisms were modified to provide a limited adjustable drag of sorts. [...] Although adequate for smaller fish, these did not possess a wide adjustment range or the power to slow larger fish.|$|E

40|$|Within the Oil industry, subsea {{pipelines}} {{are used}} to transport hydrocarbons from one location to another. After the installation of a subsea pipeline, the final connection between the pipeline ant the interconnecting facilities are done by using tie-in <b>spools.</b> In principle, tie-in <b>spools</b> serve two purposes. First, it needs to provide an interface that bridges the inaccuracies associated with offshore pipeline installation. Inaccuracies related to pipeline installation are numerous, but {{can be related to}} the existing seabed infrastructure, orientation/position of the tie-in facilities with respect to pipeline installation vessel, bathymetry & soil accuracy of data among others. These factors cause the tie-in <b>spool</b> to be measured, fabricated and installed after the pipeline has been laid in order to make up the connection. Secondly, the tie-in <b>spool</b> needs to be a flexible element as pipelines expands during operational conditions because of heat and pressure differences between installation and operational stages. By the tie-in <b>spool</b> being flexible, the forces in connectors are reduced in order to ensure safe transportation of hydrocarbons. These key requirements can have significant impact of the overall cost of a project as they will affect all necessary operations related to tie-in <b>spools.</b> This report assesses key requirements related to tie-in <b>spools</b> by a detailed review about issues related to the design, fabrication, installation and operation of tie-in <b>spools.</b> By presenting details from the design of an actual installed tie-in <b>spool</b> in the southern North Sea this is sought achieved. By presenting a tie-in <b>spool</b> and its important design parameters, load steps that it is subjected to, and the results from loading analysis it is wanted to educate about the importance of tie-in <b>spools.</b> A modification of the tie-in <b>spool</b> where done to develop a simple technique to quickly assess the preliminary design/configuration of a tie-in <b>spool</b> based on bending moment capacity of the associated connector. The design parameters, such as pipeline expansion, where extracted from the presented tie-in analysis. Four different analysis methods where used in order to give recommendations on which method are most suited for <b>spool</b> piece analysis. By comparing results with the actual installed <b>spool,</b> calculated results showed that three methods can be suited for simplified <b>spool</b> piece analysis. In order to qualify one of the analysis methods, a downscaled tie-in <b>spool</b> was manufactured based on the modified <b>spool.</b> By innovative use of simple mechanical equipment, the tie-in <b>spool</b> was applied pipeline expansion via a winch. The bending moment in the connector where measured using an adjustable torque wrench. Measured bending moment was compared to the analysis methods and by comparison it was evident that numbers did not correlate. Due to this, no further recommendation on suitable analysis method could be given. A search for possible error sources contributing to no correlation was conducted.
