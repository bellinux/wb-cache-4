40|$|In {{this paper}} we review {{the methods of}} {{measuring}} the economic gains of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). We show that the widely employed event study methodology, whether for short or long event windows, has failed to provide meaningful insight and usable lessons regarding the central question of whether mergers and acquisitions create value. We believe {{the right way to}} assess the success and therefore the desirability of M&A is through a thorough analysis of company fundamentals. This will require examining smaller <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> with similar characteristics.

40|$|Purpose: To {{understand}} what affects the liquidity of individual {{commercial real estate}} assets {{over the course of}} the economic cycle by exploring a range of variables and a number of time periods in order to identify key determinants of sale probability. Design/Methodology: Analysing c. 12, 000 UK commercial real estate transactions (2003 to 2013) we use an innovative sampling technique akin to a perpetual inventory approach to generate a sample of held assets for each twelve month interval. Next, we use probit models to test how market, owner and property factors affect sale probability in different market environments. Findings: The types of properties that are most likely to sell changes between strong and weak markets. Office and retail assets were more likely to sell than industrial both overall and in better market conditions, but were less likely to sell than industrial properties during the downturn from mid- 2007 to mid- 2009. Assets located in the City of London more likely to sell in both strong and weak markets. The behaviour of different groups of owners changed over time, and this indicates that the type of owner might have implications for the liquidity of individual assets over and above their physical and locational attributes. Practical Implications: Variation in sale probability over time and across assets has implications for real estate investment management both in terms of asset selection and the ability to rebalance portfolios {{over the course of the}} cycle. Results also suggest that sample selection may be an issue for commercial real estate price indices around the globe and imply that indices based on a limited group of owners/sellers might be susceptible to further biases when tracking market performance through time. Originality/value: Our study differs from the existing literature on sale probability as we analyzed <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> drawn from all investor types, a significant advantage over studies based on data restricted to samples of domestic institutional investors. As well, information on country of origin for buyers and sellers allows us to explore the influence of foreign ownership on probability of sale. Finally, we not only analyse all transactions together, but we also look at transactions in five distinct periods that correspond with different phases of the UK commercial real estate cycle. This paper considers the UK real estate market, but it is likely that many of the findings hold for other major commercial real estate markets...|$|E

Using a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> from the Australian Stock Exchange-where broker identity is transparent-we provide evidence that consecutive buyer-/seller-initiated transactions by the same broker have a relatively high permanent price impact. This implies that broker identity conveys information to market participants, and that markets in which broker identity is disclosed {{are likely to be more}} efficient. We also find that medium-sized trades by the same broker convey greater information than large and small trades, which is consistent with stealth trading by informed investors.

We find that there are no significant abnormal returns around the announcement of an acquisition while there are positive abnormal returns at completions. We study the cross-sectional determinants of abnormal returns and find that announcement returns are mainly explained by the acquirer bank characteristics, while completion returns depend on opacity of the target and in large part on the drop in volatility associated with a reduction of uncertainty. ...|$|R

40|$|Evaluating the {{environmental}} {{performance of a}} building is rapidly gaining importance as a metric in real estate investments. Since interpretation of the technical measurements is difficult and requires high expertise, investors tend to rely on markers as provided by environmental certification standards instead of evaluating environmental performance directly. It is argued that there {{are likely to be}} three main drivers of price differences between certified and non-certified buildings. Drawing upon the CoStar database of US commercial real estate assets, hedonic regression analysis is used to measure the effect of certification on both rent and price. We first estimate the rental regression for a <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 110 LEED and 433 Energy Star as well as several thousand benchmark buildings to compare the sample to. The results suggest that certified buildings have a rental premium.

The expropriation threat appears to be most severe in the companies where the free float constitutes a substantial fraction of the shares outstanding. Moreover, the analysis reveals that liquidity costs considerably influence the level of block premia in Poland.

Nevertheless, by increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> <b>transactions</b> reflected in the reference rate, the adverse effects of the noise can be mitigated (or eliminated) provided the noise is idiosyncratic to individual transactions. However, if the noise is common to multiple transactions, then the adverse effects of the noisy reference rate cannot be reduced simply by increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> <b>transactions.</b> This suggests that the noise in the interest rates reported by {{just a few of}} large banks can end up making the entire market more volatile, thereby impairing the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. ...|$|R

We find strong evidence that insiders exploit inside information as they earn above average profits by front-running on subsequent news disclosures. Furthermore, looking at the type of insider, we find that members of the supervisory board (directors) and the group of other insiders (basically family members of senior managers and directors) profit substantially from exploiting inside information. In contrast, members of the executive board (senior managers) can be largely exculpated from exploiting inside information as they realize below average returns with their rare front-running transactions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose– This paper aims to {{identify}} the imbedded option value in price of auctioned land in Hong Kong, and to propose a more accurate valuation method in predicting land price. Design/methodology/approach– Based on records of land auctions and property transactions during two periods of very different market conditions, land prices are estimated using the traditional hedonic pricing method {{as well as the}} option model modified from Quigg. The results are compared to deduce whether there is any imbedded option value, thus concluding whether the option model facilitates a more accurate valuation of land prices. Findings– This study concludes that land auction prices have embedded option value in waiting to develop land. Option premiums increase with implied volatilities, which go up during market downturns, suggesting that developers place higher value on the option to develop during recessions. Research limitations/implications– The accuracy of the analysis may have been compromised by the limited number of land auctions conducted and the difficulties in inferring the value of multi‐ownership residential buildings from <b>sample</b> <b>transactions</b> <b>of</b> their constituent individual units. Future research will benefit from a larger <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions.</b> Practical implications– This paper illustrates that real option models provide the property industry with a valuation tool that addresses the concern arising from the irreversibility of investment decisions.

It is argued that there {{are likely to be}} three main drivers of price differences between certified and non-certified buildings. First, certified buildings offer a bundle of benefits to occupiers relating to business productivity, image and occupancy costs. Second, due to these occupier benefits, certified buildings can result in higher rents and lower holding costs for investors. Third, certified buildings may require a lower risk premium.
