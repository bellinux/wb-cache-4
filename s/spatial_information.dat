40|$|Natural images {{typically}} have an approximately 1 /f amplitude spectrum. Images that have relatively high amplitude at low spatial frequencies {{in comparison with}} a 1 /f spectrum {{have been found to}} be uncomfortable (Fernandez and Wilkins, 2008, Juricevic et al, 2010). Such images also tend to be perceived as more blurred (Webster et al, 2002, Murray and Bex, 2010). This suggests that the loss of high <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> might increase visual discomfort. This could be due to an effect on the accommodation response, which is influenced by the spatial frequency content of images (eg, Charman and Tucker, 1977). Stimuli with a relative increase in low <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> might be uncomfortable because they are a poor stimulus for accommodation. The current study investigates the relationship between perceived blur, visual discomfort, and relative amounts of high and low <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> using both simple “bull's eye target” stimuli and natural images. Loss of high <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> was found to increase both visual discomfort judgements and perceived blur in simple stimuli. Increasing blur (loss of high <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> through either sinc or Gaussian filtering) in natural images was also found to increase visual discomfort judgements. Loss of high <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> increases discomfort, and perceived blur, in both simple and complex images. These results suggest that discomfort arises in images that present a difficult stimulus for accommodation. It is important therefore to consider how stimuli are accommodated by the eye, as well how they are encoded by the visual cortex, in understanding visual discomfort...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to examine age-related declines in the {{processing}} of <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information.</b> Some current theories of spatial vision state that humans process high <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> separately or differently from low <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information.</b> There is also evidence that normal aging may affect the processing of some spatial frequencies more than others. Specifically, it has been proposed that older adults have deficits {{in their ability to}} process low <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information,</b> and that older adults process visual information more slowly in general than young adults. Eight observers in each of three age groups were tested on a localization task. The spatial frequency content of distractors presented in the visual field was varied along with speed of presentation and clarity of the display. A progressive loss in the extent of the functional visual field was demonstrated. Results were consistent with the position that older adults experience declines in their ability to process temporal information, and that older adults do process visual information at a slower rate than young adults...|$|R

25|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicate}} that the taxi drivers' (experts') recall of streets was higher in both the route order condition and the map order condition than in the two random conditions. This indicates that the experts were able to use their prelearned spatial knowledge to organize the information in such a way that they surpassed STM and WM capacity limitations. The organization strategy that the drivers employed is known as chunking. Additionally, the comments made by the experts during the procedure point towards their use of route knowledge in completing the task.

The current investigation examines whether these different modes of presentation map onto compatible mental representations of serial order.

40|$|We {{interact}} with {{the world through the}} assessment of available, but sometimes imperfect, sensory information. However, little is known about how variance in the quality of sensory information affects the regulation of controlled actions. In a series of three experiments, comprising a total of seven behavioral studies, we examined how different types of <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> affect underlying processes of response inhibition and selection. Participants underwent a stop-signal task, a two choice speed/accuracy balance experiment, and a variant of both these tasks where prior information was given about the nature of stimuli. In all experiments, stimuli were either intact, or contained only high-, or low- spatial frequencies. Overall, drift diffusion model analysis showed a decreased rate of <b>information</b> processing when <b>spatial</b> frequencies were removed, whereas the criterion for information accumulation was lowered. When <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> was intact, the cost of response inhibition increased (longer SSRT), while a correct response was produced faster (shorter reaction times) and with more certainty (decreased errors). When we manipulated the motivation to respond with a deadline (i. e., be fast or accurate), removal of <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> slowed response times only when instructions emphasized accuracy. However, the slowing of response times did not improve error rates, when compared to fast instruction trials. These behavioral studies suggest that the removal of <b>spatial</b> frequency <b>information</b> differentially affects the speed of response initiation, inhibition, and the efficiency to balance fast or accurate responses.
