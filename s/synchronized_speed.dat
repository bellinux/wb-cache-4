40|$|Negotiating intersections is {{a complex}} driving task that is {{particularly}} difficult for older drivers. This task requires accurate coordination of multiple driving subtasks, placing high demands on perception, attention and motor control that are known to decline with age. We analyzed intersection negotiation behavior in an instrumented vehicle and found striking differences in how drivers of different ages <b>synchronize</b> <b>speed</b> and heading control when turning right. The older drivers performed most of their steering while standing still instead of while accelerating as younger drivers do. This shift from parallel to serial control is a compensatory solution that drivers employ in response to age related decline in perception, cognition, and motor control abilities. Serialization of turning at an intersection reduces attentional demands largely by eliminating the need to switch attention between different driving sub-tasks...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{explains}} the method to <b>synchronize</b> <b>speed</b> and distance for contact size measurement. The contact size {{was measured using}} ultrasound that strikes continuously onto the surface. Part of the ultrasound energy was transmitted and another part was reflected. As this happen, there is a reduction in pulse amplitude due to the fraction between the reflected energy and the transmitted one. A series of reflection pulses were obtained as the ultrasound pulses strikes. These amplitude pulses reduce when enters contact and eventually return to normal. If the speed and distance of a track were measured, then {{it is possible to}} measure the contact size as the contact passing. However, the speed and ultrasound pulsing rate must be synchronized so that the distance is proportionate to speed changes. In this work, a 6410 deep groove ball bearing were used to measure contact size in circular motion. The method, calculation steps and validation are shown. It was found that the distance remained constant as the speed and pulsing rate changed proportionally...|$|R

40|$|A new {{normalized}} coupling synchronization (NCS) {{method is}} proposed {{to solve the}} problem of <b>synchronizing</b> the <b>speeds</b> of all wheels in a multi‐axis independent driving system without mechanical transmission connection. The NCS method integrates normalizing and coupling techniques by emulating mechanical line shaft. All wheelsʹ speeds are normalized, and thus can be synchronized whether the wheelʹs revolution speeds are the same or different. Then, all of the normalized wheel speeds are coupled in order to eliminate speed synchronization errors between any pair of axes. Therefore, the new algorithm is able to achieve global speed synchronization. It is applicable to multi‐ axis driving vehicles either driving in straight line or making a turn. The conducted computational simulation shows that the proposed method gets better result in reducing speed synchronization errors in both cases of same and different wheel speeds compared to some classic speed sync methods in the literature. To further validate the effectiveness and applicability of the NCS method, it is also applied to a four‐wheel‐driving and four‐wheel‐steering vehicle for comparison tests.

Some of these tests are fairly onerous, requiring manual, labor intensive, cost ineffective measurements that do not provide significant statistical validity, and are prone to errors through ignorance, negligence, or even in some cases through deliberate misrepresentation.

The system, although requiring increased capital investment, will result in objective, cost effective, and timely testing of aggregate shape. The system uses dual, <b>synchronized,</b> double <b>speed</b> progressive scan cameras to image the aggregate piece from two directions.
