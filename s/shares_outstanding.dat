500|$|The {{company was}} {{constantly}} emphasizing its stock price. Management was compensated extensively using stock options, {{similar to other}} U.S. companies. This policy of stock option awards caused management to create expectations of rapid growth in efforts to {{give the appearance of}} reported earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations. The stock ticker was located in lobbies, elevators, and on company computers. At budget meetings, Skilling would develop target earnings by asking [...] "What earnings do you need to keep our stock price up?" [...] and that number would be used, even if it was not feasible. On December 31, 2000, Enron had 96 million <b>shares</b> <b>outstanding</b> as stock option plans (approximately 13% of common <b>shares</b> <b>outstanding).</b> Enron's proxy statement stated that, within three years, these awards were expected to be exercised. Using Enron's January 2001 stock price of $83.13 and the directors’ beneficial ownership reported in the 2001 proxy, the value of director stock ownership was $659 million for Lay, and $174 million for Skilling.|$|E

Stocks with smaller floats tend to be more volatile than those with larger floats. In general, the large holdings of founding shareholders, corporate cross-holdings, and government holdings in partially privatized companies are excluded when calculating the size of a public float.|$|R

2500|$|The stock {{dividend}} {{in this case}} was the economic equivalent of a stock split—a transaction in which the corporation multiplies the total number of <b>shares</b> <b>outstanding,</b> but gives the new shares to shareholders in proportion to the number they previously held. [...] For example, if a corporation declares a [...] "two for one" [...] stock split (and distributes no money or other property to any stockholder), a stockholder who held 100 shares at $4 per share will now hold 200 shares with a value of $2 each, which is still $400 in value.|$|E
2500|$|The index has {{traditionally}} been capitalization-weighted; that is, movements in the prices of stocks with higher market capitalizations (the share price {{times the number of}} <b>shares</b> <b>outstanding)</b> have a greater impact on the value of the index than do companies with smaller market caps. [...] That is, Standard & Poor's now calculates the market capitalization of each company relevant to the index using only the number of shares available for public trading (called the [...] "float"). This transition was made in two steps, the first on March 18, 2005 and the second on September 16, 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Short Interest is a {{numerical}} term that relates {{the number of}} shares in a given equity that have been legally shorted divided by the total <b>shares</b> <b>outstanding</b> for the company, usually expressed as a percent.

2500|$|In February 2007, Overstock.com {{launched}} a $3.5 billion lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs {{and other large}} Wall Street firms, alleging a [...] "massive illegal stock market manipulation scheme" [...] involving naked short selling. Among its allegations, Overstock stated that since at least January 2005, naked short selling has accounted for large portions of Overstock stock, in some cases exceeding the 23.4 million total <b>shares</b> <b>outstanding.</b> The lawsuit alleged that this had created [...] "immense downward pressure" [...] on share prices over time. Kerry Fields, associate {{professor of law and}} business ethics at the University of Southern California, said, [...] "Byrne may be able to help set new law if he handles this right." [...] Fields said, Byrne's [...] "best approach now is probably to persuade the SEC, which continues to wander around the issue, or the government to serve subpoenas and let them decide whether or not his company was wronged." [...] John Coffee, director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia University Law School, described it as overly ambitious and [...] "extremely unpromising."

2500|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the {{dividend}} distribution, generally as cash dividends or via a share buyback. Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to retain earnings or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the value of <b>shares</b> <b>outstanding.</b> Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. [...] Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. [...] As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. [...] A share buyback program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of undistributed profits. [...] In all instances, the appropriate dividend policy is usually directed by that which maximizes long-term shareholder value.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shares</b> <b>outstanding</b> can be {{calculated}} as either basic or fully diluted. The basic count is the current number of shares. Dividend distributions and voting in the general meeting of shareholders are calculated according to this number. The fully diluted <b>shares</b> <b>outstanding</b> count, on the other hand, includes diluting securities, such as warrants, capital notes or convertibles. If the company has any diluting securities, this indicates the potential future increased number of <b>shares</b> <b>outstanding.</b>|$|E
