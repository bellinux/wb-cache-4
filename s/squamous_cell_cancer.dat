The {{etiology}} is still unclear and recently human papillomavirus infection and p 53 gene mutation have been taken into consideration. The aim of our study was the evaluation of HPV DNApresence and p 53 gene mutation in 45 benign and 38 malignant squamous lesions of the conjunctiva and eyelid. For HPV detection PCR-RFLP and immunohistochemical reaction were used; for p 53 gene mutation PCR-SSCP was used.

25|$|Most vulvar cancer (approximately 90%) is {{squamous}} cell carcinoma, which originates from epidermal {{squamous cell}}s, {{the most common}} type of skin cell. Carcinoma-in-situ is a precursor lesion of <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> that does not invade through the basement membrane. While this type of lesion is more common with older age, young women with risk factors may also be affected. In the elderly, complications may occur due to the presence of other medical conditions.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> of {{the head}} and neck region was the fifth most common cancer other than skin cancer, globally, with an annual {{incidence}} of 600,000 cases and about 60,000 cases annually in the United States and Europe. The global incidence of pharyngeal cancer in 2013 was estimated at 136,000 cases. For 2008 the Global Burden of Disease for OPC in 2008 is estimated at 85,000 cases, of which 22,000 were attributable to HPV, a population attributable fraction (PAF) of 26%. Of these, 17,000 were males and 4,400 females, 13,000 (60%) were aged between 50 and 69 years of age, and the majority of cases (15,000) were in developed regions compared to developing regions (6,400). Age Standardised Incidence Rates (ASR) differ considerably by region and country (see de Martel et al., 2017 Fig. 2b). ASRs for 2012 were highest in [...] Europe (Hungary 3.0) and North America (United States 1.7) but much lower in Africa (≤ 0.3), Asia (≤ 0.6), Latin America (≤ 0.4) and Oceania (≤ 0.2) (other than Australasia, Australia 0.9). Estimated average numbers of cases and ASR for the US in the period 2008–2012 were 15,738 and 4.5 respectively. HPV+OPC was much more common in males than females (12,638, 7.6 and 3,100, 1.7). The highest incidence age group was 60–69, and was higher in Caucasians than in other races.|$|E
40|$|Summary Fanconi anemia (FA) {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} characterized by an increased susceptibility to <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancers.</b> Fifteen FA genes are known, and the encoded proteins cooperate in a common DNA repair pathway. A critical step is the monoubiquitination of the FANCD 2 protein, and cells from most FA patients are deficient in this step. How monoubiquitinated FANCD 2 suppresses <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancers</b> is unknown. Here we show that Fancd 2 -deficient mice are prone to Ras-oncogene-driven skin carcinogenesis, while Usp 1 -deficient mice, expressing elevated cellular levels of Fancd 2 -Ub, are resistant to skin tumors. Moreover, Fancd 2 -Ub activates the transcription of the tumor suppressor TAp 63, thereby promoting cellular senescence and blocking skin tumorigenesis. For FA patients, the reduction of FANCD 2 -Ub and TAp 63 protein levels may account for their susceptibility to <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia. Taken together, Usp 1 inhibition may be a useful strategy for upregulating TAp 63 and preventing or treating <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancers</b> in the general non-FA population...|$|R
40|$|<b>Squamous</b> <b>cell</b> lung <b>cancer</b> causes {{approximately}} 400, 000 deaths worldwide per year. Identification {{of specific}} molecular alterations, such as activating mutations in the {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor kinase and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 /anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusions have led to significant therapeutic gains in patients with adenocarcinoma. However, meaningful therapeutic gains based on the molecular pathobiology of <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> lung <b>cancer</b> {{have not yet been}} realized. A comprehensive genomic characterization of 178 cases of <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> lung <b>cancer</b> has recently been reported. <b>Squamous</b> <b>cell</b> lung <b>cancer</b> appears to be characterized by a broader and more complex group of genomic alterations than adenocarcinoma. In this review, potentially targetable genes or pathways in <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> lung <b>cancer</b> are emphasized in relation to available therapeutic agents in development or active clinical trials. This organization of data will provide a framework for development for clinical investigation. <b>Squamous</b> <b>cell</b> lung <b>cancer</b> appears to be characterized by not only driver mutations in candidate genes but also gene copy number alterations resulting in tumor proliferation and survival. Better understanding of these genetic alterations and their use as therapeutic targets will require broad collaboration between industry, government, the cooperative groups and academic institutions with the ultimate goal of rapid translation of scientific advancement to patient benefit...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} and morbidity of <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancers</b> are increasing worldwide. Epidemiological studies with morbidity coefficients about {{this type of}} cancer are scarce in Brazil. OBJECTIVES: To determine morbidity coefficients, analyze and classify the <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancers</b> diagnosed {{in the city of}} Blumenau - SC from 1980 to 2011, according to clinical and histological features. METHODS: The authors revised 4000 histopathological exams with respect to sex, age, anatomic site and histological type. The morbidity coefficients were calculated using the number of <b>squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancers</b> found and the annual population estimated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics between 1980 and 2011. RESULTS: A total of 4000 tumors were identified, 2249 (56. 2 %) in male and 1751 (43. 8 %) in female patients. The standard incidence rates varied from 40 cases in 1980 to 120 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants in 2011. The morbidity above 70 years of age reached 1484 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants in male and 975 in female patients. As to primary anatomic site, we found more tumors on the lips and ears in male and on the face and legs in female patients. As to the degree of involvement, the more frequent were Well Differentiated <b>Squamous</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas (70 %) and Moderate <b>Squamous</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas (19, 1 %). The Low Differentiated <b>Squamous</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas, which represented those with the worst prognosis, were found in 4. 5 % of the tumors. CONCLUSION: <b>Squamous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancers</b> in Blumenau - SC have similar patterns of distribution regarding age, primary anatomic site and histological types as found in the international literature. The morbidity increased by 300 % in the last 31 years, which indicates that we need to dedicate special attention to the older population...|$|R
