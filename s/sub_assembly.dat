40|$|International audienceIn this work, new {{insights}} on the helium and neon atmospheric pressure ionization wave propagation in dielectric tubes {{and the associated}} transient electric field (EF) generation and propagation are proposed. To begin with, time and space-resolved electric field measurements with a new device (bi component EOP Kapteos probe) for the diagnostics of pulsed atmospheric-pressure plasma streams inside long dielectric tubes, produced by the Plasma Gun (PG) are reported. The key role of the voltage pulse polarity and the drastic impact {{of the presence of}} a target in front of the plasma jet are then discussed from Schlieren images of helium jets in ambient air. In the second part of this work, the development and experimental analysis, based on ICCD imaging and EF measurements, of multi jet devices derived from a single PG primary source are documented. The generation of multi jets is reported with both metallic and dielectric tubes and is shown to rely either on the synchronized secondary jets generation and propagation in ambient air, or on time-shifted successive splitting of the primary plasma stream during downstream propagation. The operation of plasma jet arrays consisting in up to one hundred of secondary jets from a single PG device was achieved with either dielectric and metallic tube setups or their combination both for free plasma plume generation in ambient air but also on different dielectric or metallic targets. As an illustration, the figure 1 illustrates the delivery of 34 multi jets through two <b>sub</b> <b>assemblies</b> of dielectric tubes having 0. 5 mm in diameter orifices with either 5 or 3 mm inter orifice separation. As observed with a conventional camera, the vast majority of 34 multi jets appear quite similar among each of the two <b>sub</b> <b>assemblies,</b> impacting at a constant distance from the tube axis with an almost identical intensity. Even with the smaller 3 mm orifice separation, in the right hand side tube in fig. 1, no indication for significant self influence of the 21 individual jets is observed, leading to a quasi line impact of the jets on the grounded target.
