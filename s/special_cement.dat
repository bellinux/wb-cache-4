50|$|The most {{striking}} and lasting of Cardinal Logue's legacies to the cathedral were, however, {{the scheme of}} mosaics he commissioned to adorn every inch of blank wall in the cathedral. Significant thought was given to how best {{to deal with the}} decoration of the walls of the building. Archbishop McGettigan had completed a scheme of painted murals and stencilling of the walls but, as a result of Armagh's damp climate, these had perished within a few years of completion. It was therefore decided to adopt a mosaic decorative scheme, the initial great cost being defrayed by the future saving on repainting a mural scheme. The material employed was Italian pottery of various colours in dice-shaped cubes with glass cubes for the gilt portions to prevent tarnishing and to give greater lustre. The sections were put together in two workshops in London and were carefully glued, face downwards, on strips of paper. These were then applied to a fresh coating of <b>special</b> <b>cement</b> on the walls in a manner resembling the hanging of wallpaper.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Stabilized {{aggregate}} containing <b>Special</b> <b>cement</b> with desulfurization residue {{is characterized}} by long setting time, slight expansion, and retarded inducing strength, therefore, research was conducted on its performance. Research results show that when on 28 d and compared with stabilized aggregate of PC 32. 5 cement, the stabilized aggregate of special cement’s unconfined compressive strength increased by 17 %, dry shrinkage energy anti-cracking coefficient by 78 %, whereas resilient modulus and splitting strength indicated small changes, whilst the performance of <b>special</b> <b>cement</b> materials showed vast improvements through significant increases in the stabilized aggregate’s mechanic and shrinkage performances. The strength of stabilized aggregate from <b>special</b> <b>cement</b> containing desulfurization residue mainly comes from AFt, Ca(OH) 2 and the C-S-H gel formed in the hydration of the <b>special</b> <b>cement</b> and also with the continuing dissolution of CaSO 3. The resultant new phase of C 3 A·CaSO 3 · 11 H 2 O is formed after the 7 d hydration period. Desulfurization residue in cement consists of {{a significant amount of}} Ca(OH) 2, therefore, the alkali content in the hydration phase is maintained at a very high level, which affects the consistency of ettringite through the formation of higher-quality needle-like crystals during hydration, which in turn is beneficial to reduce the base material’s self-shrinkage capability and improve its anti-cracking performance. At the same time, stimulated by Ca(OH) 2 -CaSO 4, the hydration of fly ash and ground granulated blastfurnace slag is also improved, which is advantageous for further improving the cement’s strength and anti-cracking performance at a later stage in the curing process...|$|E

The experiments were carried out using a specially designed high speed lathe with cemented tungsten carbide tools, which machined a rotating disc of the experimental materials.

The particleboards {{used in this study}} were made from oil palm empty fruit bunches and rubberwood, while solid rubberwood was the solid wood specimen.

40|$|<b>Special</b> <b>cements</b> are {{obtained}} from non-portland clinkers. In particular applications, when rapid hardening and high chemical resistance are required, they behave better than ordinary cements [1 - 4]. The peculiar composition of <b>special</b> <b>cements</b> {{can also be}} exploited for giving a more pronounced environment-friendly character to their manufacturing process. In this regard important features are: a) low synthesis temperatures; b) reduced thermal input and CO 2 generation; c) easy grindability; d) possibility of using hardly recoverable wastes and by-products. All the above mentioned features are present in calcium sulphoaluminate cements [5 - 14] based on 4 CaOּ 3 Al 2 O 3 ּ SO 3 (C 4 A 3 S, according to the cement chemistry notation under which C=CaO; A=Al 2 O 3; S =SO 3; S=SiO 2, H=H 2 O). Calcium sulphoaluminate is able to generate, upon hydration, ettringite (C 6 AS 3 H 32), a compound which regulates all the technical properties of calcium sulphoaluminate cements. When C 4 A 3 S reacts with calcium sulphate and water, {{in the absence of}} lime, a non-expansive ettringite is rapidly formed together with aluminium hydroxide, thus giving a high mechanical strength at early ages [4, 15 - 17]. Among the other phases present in C 4 A 3 S-based cements, dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) can play an important role because it is able to add strength and durability at later ages. Secondary constituents, such as gehlenite (C 2 AS), calcium sulphosilicate (C S S 5 2) and various calcium aluminates, have generally a poor hydraulic behaviour and provide a small contribution to the technical properties. Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) waste, mainly composed by exhausted sulphur sorbent and coal ash, contains CaO, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and SO 3 as major oxides, thus representing a potential raw material for the manufacture of calcium sulphoaluminate cements [18]. Both disposal in landfill and re-use of FBC waste is generally made difficult by its chemical and mineralogical composition. Upon hydration, exothermal and expansive phenomena occur due to the relatively high content of lime and calcium sulphate [13]. Moreover the utilization of FBC ash in the ordinary cement and concrete industry is hindered by its poor pozzolanic activity due to the reduced glass content related to combustion temperatures which are significantly lower than those of traditional pulverized coal combustors [14]. The identification of suitable application fields for such waste is therefore of critical importance. This paper is focused on the use of a CFBC (circulating fluidized bed combustion) fly ash as raw mix component for the synthesis of calcium sulphoaluminate cements. The raw mix composition was designed in order to combine all available sulphate and silica into calcium sulphoaluminate and dicalcium silicate, respectively. To this end additional sources of calcium and aluminium oxides were required: the former was given by pure calcium carbonate; the latter by pure alumina, red mud and/or bauxite...|$|R
