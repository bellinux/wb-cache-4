50|$|Historically, wooden {{shingles}} were usually thin (3/8 in to 3/4 in), relatively narrow (3 in to 8 in), of varying length (14 in to 36 in), {{and almost always}} planed or knifed smooth. The traditional method for making {{wooden shingles}} before the 19th century was to rive (hand split) them from straight grained, knot free, sections of logs pre-cut to the desired length known as bolts. These bolts were quartered or split into wedges. A mallet and froe (or axe) were used to split or rive out thin pieces of wood. The wood species varied according to available local woods, but only the more durable heartwood, or inner section, of the log was usually used. The softer sapwood generally was not used because it deteriorated quickly. Because hand-split shingles were somewhat irregular along the <b>split</b> <b>surface,</b> {{it was necessary to}} dress or plane the shingles on a shaving horse with a drawknife or draw-shave to make them fit evenly on the roof. This reworking was necessary to provide a tight-fitting roof over typically open shingle lath or sheathing boards. Dressing, or smoothing of shingles, was almost universal, no matter what wood was used or in what part of the world the building was located, except in those cases where a temporary or very utilitarian roof was needed.|$|E

40|$|A large {{model can}} be split into smaller {{components}} where by assembly features can be created and attached onto the components {{so that they can}} be reassembled to form the original model. The assembly features may function as positioning or interlocking purposes depending on the mating requirement. This paper describes a method for creating assembly features onto the solid components automatically. The main idea of the method is to construct spatial rectangular assembly cells inside the original model. This is done by ray tracing the tool surface that is used to split the model, provided that there is no undercut on the <b>split</b> <b>surface</b> along the assembly direction. The spatial cells represent solid regions in which assembly features can be attached. Different kinds of assembly features can be mapped to the spatial cells, which are then attached to the split components. The <b>split</b> <b>surface</b> can be planar, quadrics or higher order freeform surfaces, thus allowing a high degree of flexibility in creating the assembly feature shapes. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

With the reduction of film thickness, the classical magnetoresistance effect is completely suppressed, and only the weak anti-localization effect is observed. The parameters extracted from the analysis allow the study of the contribution of the different scattering mechanisms to the electronic transport properties in ultrathin Bi films.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{data from}} Tianjin tritonal sandhi patterns that challenge both traditional derivational approaches and standard Optimality Theoretic (OT) approaches to phonological alternation. If construed derivationally, Tianjin tritonal sandhi requires derivational reversals; but if construed within OT, involves combinations of opacity and transparency. The account proposed here appeals to a percolative model where phonological information from terminal nodes finds correspondences in higher nodes, {{such that the}} correspondences may be imperfect when triggered by markedness requirements. While this requires a total re-conceptualization of phonological representations, this paper argues that it is well worth it because it predicts firstly, that directionality is a derivate from branching; secondly that the depth of derivational opacity is confined by structural depth; thirdly, that constituency, not adjacency, provides the environment for triggering alternation and alternation rules can therefore be blocked when marked collocations belong to different constituencies; and fourthly that underlying entities can have <b>split</b> <b>surface</b> correspondences.

In combination with density functional calculations DFT, we directly show that Sb 2 Te 3 exhibits a partially occupied, single spin Dirac cone around the Fermi energy EF, which is topologically protected. DFT obtains a spin polarization of the occupied Dirac cone states of 80 90, which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data after careful background subtraction.

The cluster full geometrical optimization procedure which is suitable for small nanocrystals and large unit cell that simulates specific parts of larger nanocrystals preferably core part as in the present work.

The two methods use ab initio Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, respectively. The results show that both energy gap and lattice constant decrease in their value as the nanocrystals grow in size. The inclusion of surface part in the first method makes valence band width wider than in large unit cell method that simulates the core part only.

40|$|Records {{of surface}} motion, englacial tilt and repeat inclinometry {{are used to}} {{determine}} patterns of surface, internal and basal motion across the tongue of Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland, over temporal scales ranging from days to months. Findings are interpreted with reference to contemporaneous measurements of subglacial water pressures, and prior knowledge of the glacier's subglacial drainage-system structure. Long-term inclinometry results show pronounced extrusion flow over a subglacial drainage axis, with basal velocities up to twice those measured at the glacier surface. Deformation profiles are more conventional away from the drainage axis, with basal velocities ? 60 - 70 % of surface velocities. Comparison of long-term tilt rates from repeat inclinometry and englacial tilt-meters shows close correspondence. Englacial tiltmeter data are used to reconstruct internal velocity profiles and to <b>split</b> <b>surface</b> velocities into internal deformation and basal motion contributions over spring, summer and autumn/winter periods. Although, spatial patterns of surface movement are similar between periods, patterns of internal and basal motion are not.

40|$|Because of the {{fundamental}} role feedbacks play in determining the characteristics of climate it is important {{we are able to}} specify both the magnitude and response timescale of the feedbacks we are interested in. This paper employs three different climate models driven to equilibrium with a 4 × CO 2 forcing to analyze the magnitude and timescales of surface temperature feedbacks. These models are a global energy balance model, an intermediate complexity climate model and a general circulation model. Rather than <b>split</b> <b>surface</b> temperature feedback into characteristic physical processes, this paper adopts a linear systems approach to split feedback according to their time constants and corresponding feedback amplitudes. The analysis reveals that there is a dominant net negative feedback realised during the first year. However, this is partially attenuated by a spectrum of positive feedbacks for time constants in the range 10 to 1000 years. This attenuation was composed of two discrete phases which are attributed to the effects of ''diffusive – mixed layer'' and ''circulatory – deep ocean'' ocean heat equilibration processes. The diffusive equilibration was associated with time constants on the decadal timescale and accounted for approximately 75 to 80 % of the overall ocean heat equilibration feedback, whilst the circulatory feedback operated on a centennial timescale and accounted for the remaining 20 to 25 % of the response. It is important to quantify these decadal and centennial feedback processes to understand the range of climate model projections on these longer timescales...|$|E

We show that the BiAg 2 alloy is an especially suited substrate due to its inertness as support for molecular films, exhibiting an almost complete absence of substrate-molecular interactions.
