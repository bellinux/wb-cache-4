30|$|Most of {{the current}} {{evolutionary}} algorithms for constrained optimization algorithm are low computational efficiency. In order to improve efficiency, an improved differential evolution with <b>shrinking</b> <b>space</b> technique and adaptive trade-off model, named ATMDE, is proposed to solve constrained optimization problems. The proposed ATMDE algorithm employs an improved differential evolution as the search optimizer to generate new offspring individuals into evolutionary population. For the constraints, the adaptive trade-off model {{as one of the}} most important constraint-handling techniques is employed to select better individuals to retain into the next population, which could effectively handle multiple constraints. Then the <b>shrinking</b> <b>space</b> technique is designed to shrink the search region according to feedback information in order to improve computational efficiency without losing accuracy. The improved DE algorithm introduces three different mutant strategies to generate different offspring into evolutionary population. Moreover, a new mutant strategy called “DE/rand/best/ 1 ” is constructed to generate new individuals according to the feasibility proportion of current population. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a suite of benchmark functions and practical engineering problems. This research presents a constrained evolutionary algorithm with high efficiency and accuracy for constrained optimization problems.|$|E

When using EAs to solve COPs, the search algorithm plays a crucial role on {{the performance of}} hybrid approaches as well as the constraint-handling techniques. Hence, this study employs an advanced search algorithm (i.e. an improved DE) to further improve the performance of AATM. The improved DE employs three different characteristic mutant strategies to generate different offspring into evolutionary population. Hence, combining the advantages of an improved differential evolution with adaptive trade-off model and <b>shrinking</b> <b>space</b> technique, called ATMDE, is proposed to deal with COPs. The remainders of this paper are organized as follows. In Section  2, the definitions of COP and some relevant concepts of multi-objective optimization are given, respectively. In Section  3, the basics of DE are briefly introduced. In Section  4, the proposed ATMDE algorithm is presented in detail. In Section  5, the performances of ATMDE are tested by 18 well-known benchmark test functions from the 2006 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC 2006) and several engineering optimization problems. Section  6 concludes this paper.|$|E
