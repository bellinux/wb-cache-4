5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> {{is found}} in North Africa and the Middle East. In Africa its range extends through Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Niger. In the Middle East it is native to Oman, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan and its range extends as far as Pakistan and north west India. In 2016, a flock of around a hundred birds arrived at Kutch after a gap of 19 years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> is a ground-dwelling {{bird and}} feeds on seeds and other plant {{material}} that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the <b>spotted</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E
25|$|Mammals of the Western Desert {{have been}} {{depleted}} {{over the years}} and the addax and scimitar oryx are no longer found there, and the Atlas lion has probably gone as well. The remaining mammals include the rhim gazelle, dorcas gazelle, Barbary sheep, Rüppell's fox, lesser Egyptian jerboa and Giza gerbil. Notable birds from this desert include the <b>spotted</b> <b>sandgrouse,</b> greater hoopoe-lark and white-crowned wheatear.|$|E
5000|$|Within its delimited area, Kutch Bustard Sanctuary {{reportedly}} has three {{species of the}} bustards namely, the great Indian bustards (endangered) (local name: ghorad), the lesser floricans (endangered) (Sypheotides indica) and the houbara bustards (vulnerable). As per last reports, 66 floricans and 17 houbara bustards were reported. [...] The sanctuary also is habitat for harriers, common cranes, black partridges (local name: kalo tetar), sand grouses, black and grey francolin, <b>spotted</b> and Indian <b>sandgrouse,</b> quails, larks, shrikes, coursers and plovers. Vulnerable species such as the Stoliczka's bushchat and white-naped tit have also been recorded in the KBS. The migratory bird, the imperial eagle is also sighted here.|$|R
500|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>{{sandgrouse}}</b> has a rapid wing {{beat and}} flies swiftly. Its call is a musical [...] "queeto-queeto" [...] which distinguishes it from {{other species of}} sandgrouse with similar plumage.|$|E
500|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles senegallus) is {{a species}} of ground {{dwelling}} bird in the family Pteroclididae. It is found in arid regions of northern and eastern Africa and across the Middle East and parts of Asia as far east as northwest India. It is a gregarious, diurnal bird and small flocks forage for seed and other vegetable matter on the ground, flying once a day to a waterhole for water. In the breeding season pairs nest apart from one another, the eggs being laid in a depression on the stony ground. The chicks leave the nest soon after hatching and eat dry seed, the water they need being provided by the male which saturates its belly feathers with water at the waterhole. The <b>spotted</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> is listed as being of [...] "least concern" [...] by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in its Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
500|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> {{reaches a}} length of about [...] The male has a small reddish-brown nape {{surrounded}} by a band of pale grey that extends to the bill and round the neck in a collar. The chin, neck and throat are orange and the breast grey. The upper parts are pinkish-grey with dark flight feathers and dark patches on the wings, tail and lower belly. The primaries are pale with dark trailing edges, a fact that distinguishes this species from the crowned sandgrouse (Pterocles coronatus) which has completely dark primaries. The female also has an orange throat region but is generally duller in plumage than the male. The body colour is greyish-brown liberally spotted with small dark markings and with dark patches on the wings, tail and lower belly. The central tail feathers in both sexes are elongated {{but not to the}} extent that they are in the pin-tailed sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata). When flying overhead, a dark belly stripe is visible.|$|E

50|$|A {{fairly small}} {{sandgrouse}} which appears rather uniformy coloured {{from a distance}} except for darker flight feathers, the wholly dark flight fetahers being the best feature to identify Crowned Sandgrouse from the similar <b>Spotted</b> <b>Sandgrouse.</b> The dark flight feathers contrast with the sandy upper wing coverts and the creamy underwing coverts. The adult male has a black mask and lacks any grey tones on the neck and breast. The females and immatures lack the black mask and differ from <b>Spotted</b> <b>Sandgrouse</b> in having dark vermiculations, rather than spots, across the breast {{and all of the}} belly and not confined to the breast and upper belly as in Spotted. They are 27-29 cm long and have a wingspan of 52-63 cm.|$|E

50|$|In {{the coastal}} belt, bird species {{recorded}} are American flamingo on the beaches, and also many birds of prey. Migratory birds pass through Libya, and are seen mostly along the coastline. The most notable ones are the flamingo, Kentish plover in the Bengazi Reserve. Houbara bustard and the European white stork {{are reported in}} the Kouf National Park and in the beaches and lagoons. In the oases, desert larks, desert sparrows, and <b>spotted</b> <b>sandgrouse</b> have been reported. Other notable species reported are Aquila chrysaetos, Alectoris barbara, Pterocles spp. and Chlamydotis undulata with herons, ducks, waders, Ciconia nigra, Ciconia ciconia, and Milvus milvus (red kite) from the brackish lagoons.|$|E

It inhabits deserts and semi-arid countryside and is largely resident although there is some local movement of flocks. The population size has not been firmly established {{but it seems to}} be stable and the bird seems to be common over most of its extensive range. It is listed as being of [...] "least concern" [...] by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
