500|$|Pearson's career paralleled Richard Petty's, {{the driver}} {{who won the}} most races in NASCAR history. They {{accounted}} for 63 first/second-place finishes (with the edge going to Pearson). Petty said, [...] "Pearson could beat you on a short track, he could beat you on a superspeedway, he could beat you on a road course, he could beat you on a dirt track. It didn't hurt as bad to lose to Pearson as it did {{to some of the}} others, because I knew how good he was." [...] Pearson said of Petty: [...] "I always felt that if I beat him I beat the best, and I heard he <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> about me." ...|$|E
500|$|The United States Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, {{announced}} a formal {{interest in the}} Rhodesian situation in February 1976, and {{spent the rest of}} the year holding discussions with the British, South African and Frontline governments to produce a mutually satisfactory proposal. The plan that Kissinger eventually presented would give a transition period of two years before majority rule began, during which time an interim government would take control while a specially convened [...] "council of state", made up of three whites, three blacks and a white chairman, drew up a new constitution. This constitution would have to result in majority rule at the end of the two-year interim period. This plan was supported by Kenneth Kaunda and Julius Nyerere, the presidents of Zambia and Tanzania respectively, which South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster said guaranteed its acceptance by the black nationalists. Vorster had no reply when Smith ventured that he had <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> before the Victoria Falls talks in 1975, when Kaunda and Nyerere had agreed on no preconditions for talks, then allowed the nationalists to seek them.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{wanted to}} have Regine, his fiancée (see below), as his confidant but {{considered}} it an impossibility {{for that to happen}} so he left it to [...] "my reader, that single individual" [...] to become his confidant. His question was whether or not one can have a spiritual confidant. He wrote the following in his Concluding Postscript: [...] "With regard to the essential truth, a direct relation between spirit and spirit is unthinkable. If such a relation is assumed, it actually means that the party has ceased to be spirit." [...] Goethe had <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> earlier in his play Faust, [...] "Faust: Thou, who around the wide world wendest, Thou busy Spirit, how near I feel to thee! ...|$|E
2500|$|Busch {{also has}} a bitter history with Kevin Harvick. They raced each other at carnivals and go-kart tracks as {{teenagers}} and tangled many times starting in 2001. Their feud came to a boiling point in spring 2006. At Bristol in 2006, Harvick spent the drivers meeting and his pre-race interview taunting Busch following a feud at Atlanta. Busch ignored his insults and won the race, while Harvick ended up in second place. When Harvick was interviewed after the race ended {{he said that he}} was happy with his finish but said he was very upset to seeing Busch win, before calling Busch a [...] "whiner." [...] Richard Childress later apologized for his driver's comments and NASCAR gave Harvick a warning not to target Busch. In 2007 when Harvick won two races Busch dominated such as the 2007 Daytona 500, and the 2007 All-Star Race, Busch <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> about Harvick: [...] "I just hate losing to Kevin." [...] Ironically, in 2014, with both drivers moving from their previous teams to Stewart-Haas Racing, Busch and Harvick became teammates with Stewart.|$|E
2500|$|Trey Spruance joined former Mr. Bungle bandmate Mike Patton and {{the band}} Faith No More onstage {{for the first time}} to perform the King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime album in its {{entirety}} in Santiago in November 2011. Mike Patton recently sung on the Secret Chiefs 3 song [...] "La Chanson de Jacky" [...] in 2012 giving further speculation by fans on the chance of a reunion. Despite this, Trevor Dunn stated in a February 2013 interview with SF Weekly that there will be no Mr. Bungle reunion, saying, [...] "I've heard the faintest murmurings about it, but honestly I don't think anyone is interested. It's nothing personal, either. We all feel like that band said what it needed to say. It would feel weird and awkward to play that music again. It would take a pant-load of money to make it happen, and honestly, I don't want to do it for that reason. I would prefer to let go of it, respectfully." [...] When asked about Mr. Bungle reuniting in an interview published in February 2014, Patton responded by saying, [...] "Who knows? It certainly doesn't seem like it's on the tip of anyone's lips, but I could have <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> - and in fact, I did say the same thing - about Faith No More, and that happened. And I think it happened for the better." ...|$|E

60|$|Kennicott, Sam Clark, Jackson Elder, young Dr. McGanum, and James Madison Howland, {{teetering on}} their toes near the stove, conversed with the sedate pomposity of the commercialist.

60|$|The odd plangent certitude in {{his voice}} {{penetrated}} her. And all the young people <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> They were all waiting to go away. But for the moment the war held them up.|$|E

5000|$|However {{after the}} club's relegation {{at the end}} of the 2005-06 Premier League season, Cunningham was {{released}} along with seven other first team players. On 11 May 2006, Cunningham launched a scathing attack in the press on Bruce and the board, blaming the club's relegation on a lack of preparation throughout the season and likening the club to a [...] "stiff corpse" [...] that has [...] "no heartbeat and, more worryingly, no soul". While fans were in the main supportive of Cunningham's views, the club reacted furiously, and chairman David Gold wondered [...] "if Kenny would have <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> if we'd stayed up, Portsmouth had gone down and he'd been given a lucrative new contract".|$|R
60|$|The President of the Council was Niccolo Tornielli, and {{he opened}} the sitting by {{reminding}} his hearers of their object, and calling for their opinions. At first no one would speak. They {{did not know what}} was in Checco's mind, and they had no wish to say anything that might be offensive to him. The Forlivesi are a cautious race! After a while an old man got up and timidly expressed the thanks of the citizens for the freedom which Checco had bestowed upon them, suggesting also that he should speak first. The lead thus given, the worthies rose, one after another, and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> with an air of profound originality.|$|R

6000|$|... "They {{knew how}} to do it, they {{knew how to}} do it!"

6000|$|... "You {{can have}} no {{conception}} how unhappy I am about it. Of course Lady Fawn will tell me to go away. I went out on purpose to beg his pardon for what I said last night, and I just <b>said</b> <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> again." ...|$|R
60|$|Later still a {{man came}} to see me, without too {{publicly}} giving his name. He was {{in a small way}} of business, and told me (others had <b>said</b> much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing)</b> that if I gave him away his business would suffer. He talked for half an hour on end.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a {{tendency}} to attribute {{the development of the}} House of Rasheed to trading and commercial expansion, but documents have come to light which emphasise the significance of external pressures and the Rashidi's interaction with foreign governments and leaders, but Al Sauds are equally <b>said</b> of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> which catapulted them to power.|$|R
