Each speaking clock ensemble consisted of two announcing units (Zag 500), a <b>supervisory</b> <b>unit</b> (CCU 500), two phase-locked oscillators, two pulse distribution units, a Civil Time Receiver (plus a spare), and two or four Computime 1200 baud modems.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how multinational corporations (MNCs) selectively assign <b>supervisory</b> responsibilities to <b>units</b> {{in countries with}} varying levels of institutional quality. Arbitraging across institutional contexts is an important function of MNCs, but it also creates coordination challenges. The choice of organization structure, such as the differential assignment of supervisory responsibilities, is an important tool for managing these coordination challenges. Using data on the business activities and supervision relationships within U. S. multinational manufacturers in 1996 - 2008, I find that frontline subsidiaries in countries with weaker institutions {{are more likely to}} be supervised by foreign rather than domestic <b>supervisory</b> <b>units.</b> Foreign supervision is even more likely when subsidiaries in weak-institution countries conduct activities that are more central to or interdependent with their parents’ global operations. These findings confirm that MNCs use differential supervision to enhance global coordination. The paper highlights one of the most unique features of MNCs: a multinational hierarchy that resides within firm’s boundary but across national borders. It also connects MNCs’ hierarchical structure with institutional imperfections that give rise to the emergence of the firm in the first place...|$|R

30|$|Secondly, The Labour Contract Law in China {{excludes}} domestic workers. Up until {{around the}} year 2000, China’s domestic services market existed without government oversight. 5 It wasn’t until 2001 that the government acknowledged the work of domestic workers and classified it as a bona fide occupation. In 2006, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security promulgated the “National Professional Standards for Domestic Service Workers”. The Msinistry divided domestic workers into primary class (state professional qualifications fifth class), intermediary class (fourth class) and high class (third class). According to this standard, “domestic service worker” refers to “a person who according to requirements of the served family manages household chores, takes care of children, the elderly or the sick, and manages matters connected with the household”. Localities one after another established household services associations {{with the objective of}} “strengthening the professional self-discipline, standardizing professional behaviour, protecting the rights and interests of enterprises and enhancing the standards of the domestic services industry”. Some provinces and cities produced professional codes of practice, service quality standards, model contracts and other institutional documents.

Given a family of pre-designed stabilizing controllers, a <b>supervisory</b> <b>unit</b> infers in real-time the potential behavior of each candidate controller and selects the one providing the best potential performance.

Further, an implementation of the switching controller is proposed which always guarantees stability of the feedback loop, even if the disturbance characteristics are such that the switching is persistent.

40|$|Unfalsified Control Theory {{has been}} {{developed}} to provide a way for avoiding modeling uncertainties in controller design. It belongs to the class of control methods called Adaptive Supervisory Switching Control, which work by introducing in the control scheme a <b>supervisory</b> <b>unit</b> which chooses, from a set of candidate controllers the one most suited for the current plant. Unfalsified Control works by using a switching logic that dispenses {{with the need for}} a-priori knowledge of the dynamic model. At discrete moments of time, using the input/output data recorded up to that point, the supervisory calculates for each candidate controller a performance index, and compares it to a given threshold. Controllers surpassing that threshold are removed from the candidate controller set. This process is called falsification. If the controller in the loop is one such falsified controller it is replaced. In this paper we investigate the suitability of this method for aeronautical control applications. We review the theory behind this control scheme and adapt it to the case of controlling a fighter aircraft. We also provide a case study, where we test this control scheme on a simulated fighter aircraft...|$|E

40|$|In an {{aircraft}} {{electric power system}} (EPS), a <b>supervisory</b> control <b>unit</b> must actuate a set of switches to distribute power from generators to loads, while satisfying safety, reliability and real-time performance requirements. To reduce expensive re-design steps in current design methodologies, such a control problem is generally addressed based on minor incremental changes on top of consolidated solutions, since {{it is difficult to}} estimate the impact of earlier design decisions on the final implementation. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for the design space exploration and virtual prototyping of EPS supervisory control protocols, following the platform-based design (PBD) paradigm. Moreover, we describe the modeling infrastructure that supports the methodology. In PBD, design space exploration is carried out as a sequence of refinement steps from the initial specification towards a final implementation, by mapping higher-level behavioral models into a set of library components at a lower level of abstraction. In our flow, the system specification is captured using SysML requirement and structure diagrams. State-machine diagrams enable verification of the control protocol at a high level of abstraction, while lowerlevel hybrid models, implemented in Simulink, are used to verify properties related to physical quantities, such as time, voltage and current values. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on a prototype EPS control protocol design. Comment: Proceedings of Green Energy and Systems Conference 2013, November 25, Long Beach, CA, US...|$|R

Hybrid component models were developed and presented in detail as well as the simulations results mainly for NEDC cycle. The analysis was performed on four different parallel hybrid powertrain concepts: Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), High Speed Flywheel Hybrid Vehicle (HSF-HV), Hydraulic Hybrid Vehicle (HHV) and Pneumatic Hybrid Vehicle (PHV). In order to perform equitable analysis of different hybrid systems, comparison was performed also on the basis of the same usable system energy storage capacity (i. e. 625 kJ for HEV, HSF and the HHV) but in the case of pneumatic hybrid systems maximal storage capacity was limited by the size of the systems in order to comply with the packaging requirements of the vehicle.

The MCU was {{responsible}} for looking after all of its Registers and deciding from the dialled information where the call {{was going to be}} routed. The local exchange numbering system would be available to the MCU via threadings in the cyclic store so the MCU would be able to read this information and in this way all exchanges could be configured as required. If a call was identified by the MCU as being own exchange, usually by the first digit, then the MCU would tell the Register to come back when the complete number had been dialled. If the first dialled digit was a zero then this would normally be routed straight to the Group Switching Centre. However, if the exchange had an Alternative Available Route say 0296 then the MCU would have to wait until enough routing digits had been received to make a routing decision. Again this AAR information was stored in the cyclic stores. Once the MCU had decided the routing, it sent a command to the Interrogator/Markers to set up the required path and also told the Register what dialled digits to forward on. Then the MCU would {{move on to the next}} task. Once the connection had been established, the <b>Supervisory</b> Processing <b>Unit</b> (SPU) took care of the path and all the call metering tasks.
