25|$|At {{the age of}} 11 months Genie {{was still}} in overall good health, and had no noted mental abnormalities, but had fallen to the 11th {{percentile}} for weight. The people who later <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> believed this {{was a sign that}} she was starting to suffer some degree of malnutrition. When Genie was 14 months old, she came down with a fever and pneumonitis and her parents took her to a pediatrician who had not previously seen her. The pediatrician said that, although her illness prevented a definitive diagnosis, there was a possibility that she was mentally retarded and that the brain dysfunction kernicterus might be present, further amplifying her father's conclusion that she was severely retarded.|$|E
25|$|When Bonham Carter was five, {{her mother}} had a serious nervous breakdown, from which it took her three years to recover. Upon her recovery, her {{experience}} in therapy led her to become a psychotherapist herself – Bonham Carter now pays her to read her scripts and deliver her opinion of the characters' psychological motivations. Five years after her mother's recovery, her father was diagnosed with acoustic neuroma. He suffered complications during an operation to remove the tumour {{which led to a}} stroke that left him half-paralysed and using a wheelchair. With her brothers at college, Bonham Carter was left to help her mother cope. She later <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> father's movements and mannerisms for her role in The Theory of Flight. He died in January 2004.|$|E
25|$|She {{belonged to}} a family that {{produced}} professional artists over several generations. Her paternal grandfather was the prominent animal painter James Ward, who was related by marriage to fellow artists John Jackson and George Morland. Her parents were also artists: George Raphael Ward was {{best known for his}} printmaking, Mary Webb Ward for her miniatures. (One of her mother's pictures was Portrait of Henrietta Ward and her Favorite Guinea Pig, 1843.) An only child, the young Henrietta grew up surrounded by and familiar with her parents' artist acquaintances, including Sir Edwin Landseer, C. R. Leslie, and the brothers John James and Alfred Edward Chalon. She <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> craft at the Bloomsbury Art School and the academy started by Henry Sass.|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{recognized}} Müller's writing as political, [...] "as {{a form of}} manifest resistance against totalitarian claims to power," [...] and have <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> [...] "complex and ambiguous imagery." [...] According to Larry Wolff, reviewing the book for The New York Times, the poetic quality of the language is essentially connected to its author's objective: [...] "the author seeks to create a sort of poetry out of the spiritual and material ugliness of life in Communist Romania." [...] Critics have generally shown appreciation for the novel's language, as did Nicholas Lezard, writing in The Guardian: ...|$|E
500|$|The biopic Iris (2001) {{featured}} Winslet and Judi Dench as {{the novelist}} Iris Murdoch at different ages. The director Richard Eyre cast the two actresses after finding a [...] "correspondence of spirit between them". Winslet {{was drawn to}} the idea of playing an intellectual and zesty female lead, and in research, she read Murdoch's novels, <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> husband's memoir Elegy for Iris, and watched televised interviews of Murdoch. The project was filmed over four weeks and allowed Winslet to bring her daughter, who was six months old at the time, on set. Writing for The Guardian, the novelist Martin Amis commented that [...] "the seriousness and steadiness of [...] gaze effectively suggest the dawning amplitude of the Murdoch imagination". Winslet received her third Oscar nomination for Iris, in addition to BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E
500|$|Mah Laqa learned {{singing and}} {{classical}} Indian music Thumri from Khush hal Khan, a master musician of that time, and a great-grandson of the Tansen, the maestro of Mughal court. She excelled in Ghazal singing in multiple raga (melodic modes) and Taal (rhythms); she was adept at the Yaman raga and Khayal Tappa which she use to sing at special occasions. Mah laqa preferred using Bhimpalasi raga in romantic Ghazals. When singing Sufi songs she used Dhrupad raga mixed with taal chautala and raga Bhairavi. Mah Laqa excelled in singing love lyrics accompanied by Deccani style of Kathak dance. She established a cultural centre in which 300 girls were trained by her {{along with other}} masters. Maha Laqa's library contain manuscripts and books on poetry along with {{the arts and the}} science collections. She sponsored and supervised the publication of Mahnama, a historical book about the revival period of Hyderabad State. Although Mah Laqa practiced Islam, she was influenced by the understanding of Hindu books and philosophy. One author <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> writings and said that [...] "her verses had a distinct darbari ring in which she eulogized the king and nobles, a common style employed by poets during the 17th and 18th centuries." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coretta Scott King {{was also}} under {{surveillance}} by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1968 until 1972. Her husband's activities had been monitored during his lifetime. Documents obtained by a Houston, Texas television station {{show that the}} FBI worried that Coretta Scott King would [...] "tie the anti-Vietnam movement {{to the civil rights}} movement." [...] The FBI <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> memoir and concluded that her [...] "selfless, magnanimous, decorous attitude is belied by... actual shrewd, calculating, businesslike activities." [...] A spokesman for the King family said that they were aware of the surveillance, but had not realized how extensive it was.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the quality}} of her work and despite the energy and skill with which she worked both to develop her own talent and to further the {{progressive}} movement in American art, Weinrich received little recognition during her lifetime and has not received much more since her death. Most accounts {{of her life and}} work repeat a few salient facts. They do not provide citations and some of their claims cannot be confirmed. Only one person, Louise R. Noun, <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> in detail. See the exhibition catalog she co-wrote and the article by her, both cited in the [...] "Further reading" [...] section below.|$|E
2500|$|She <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> {{foundation}} at Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication, {{followed by}} Fashion Design at Central Saint Martins {{in the early}} 1990s: she graduated in 1995. Her graduation collection was modelled by friends and supermodels Naomi Campbell, Yasmin Le Bon and Kate Moss – for free – at the graduation runway show. The collection was shown to a song penned by her famous father, called [...] "Stella May Day." [...] The show made front-page news, and the entire collection was sold to Tokyo, a London boutique. The designs were licensed to Browns, Joseph, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus. In 1998, she designed her sister Mary's wedding dress for her wedding to television producer Alistair Donald.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{argument}} then, across {{the research is}} that Stella Browne had the most trouble getting her two beliefs to coexist appropriately. [...] Jones says that Browne constantly needed {{to be on the}} offensive around her ideals on eugenics around her socialist friends and Rowbotham comments on Browne’s “continuing double struggle” to maintain both of these ideals finding connections between the two, which others in her two separate streams of struggle may not have agreed with fully. Browne was a hardworking woman who believed in her work so much so that she was even considered to have a “personal intransigence [...] meant she was as often at odds with her allies as with this her enemies.” [...] One from the literature on Browne can conclude that she has value to the study of women’s sexuality and sexual reform that historians who have <b>studied</b> <b>her</b> believe should continue to be explored and brought to the public’s attention.|$|E
2500|$|The atomic {{bombings of}} Hiroshima and Nagasaki {{resulted}} in high acute doses of radiation {{to a large}} number of Japanese, allowing for greater insight into its symptoms and dangers. Red Cross Hospital Surgeon Terufumi Sasaki led intensive research into the syndrome {{in the weeks and months}} following the Hiroshima bombings. Dr Sasaki and his team were able to monitor the effects of radiation in patients of varying proximities to the blast itself, leading to the establishment of three recorded stages of the syndrome. Within 25–30 days of the explosion, the Red Cross surgeon noticed a sharp drop in white blood cell count and established this drop, along with symptoms of fever, as prognostic standards for Acute Radiation Syndrome. [...] Actress Midori Naka, who was present during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, was the first incident of radiation poisoning to be extensively <b>studied.</b> <b>Her</b> death on August 24, 1945, was the first death ever to be officially certified as a result of acute radiation syndrome (or [...] "Atomic bomb disease").|$|E
