40|$|Every day, {{millions}} of people are transported by buses, trains, and airplanes in Germany. Public transit (PT) is of major importance for {{the quality of life of}} individuals as well as the productivity of entire regions. Quality and efficiency of PT systems depend on the political framework (state-run, mar-ket oriented) and the suitability of the infrastructure (railway tracks, airport locations), the existing level of <b>service</b> (<b>timetable,</b> flight schedule), the use of adequate technologies (information, control, and booking systems), and the best possible deployment of equipment and resources (energy, vehicles, crews). The decision, planning, and optimization problems arising in this context are often gigantic and “scream ” for mathematical support because of their complexity. This article sketches the state and the relevance of mathematics in planning and operating public transit, describes today’s challenges, and suggests a number of innovative actions.

40|$|In an open railway access market, the Infrastructure Provider (IP), {{upon the}} {{receipts}} of service bids from the Train Service Providers (TSPs), assigns track access rights {{according to its}} own business objectives and {{the merits of the}} bids; and produces the train <b>service</b> <b>timetable</b> through negotiations. In practice, IP chooses to negotiate with the TSPs one by one in such a sequence that IP optimizes its objectives. The TSP bids are usually very complicated, containing a large number of parameters in different natures. It is a difficult task even for an expert to give a priority sequence for negotiations from the contents of the bids. This study proposes the application of fuzzy ranking method to compare and prioritize the TSP bids in order to produce a negotiation sequence. The results of this study allow investigations on the behaviors of the stakeholders in bid preparation and negotiation, as well as evaluation of service quality in the open railway market.

30|$|Dwell time {{predictability}} {{is important}} in the creation of <b>service</b> <b>timetables.</b> To this end, operators subdivide the dwell time to better understand where problems lie. Current timetable orthodoxy determines dwell times by mathematical means. While there are variations to the formula, they all in essence treat boarding and alighting as a linear period of time multiplied by a coefficient representative of how much passengers have been slowed down by the circumstances of other passengers, width of the doors and if they are carrying belongings [5]. Accurate calculation of these dwell times will inform operators of the predicted capacity of the network and so drive timetables with some accuracy.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the content and usefulness of departmental induction programmes to senior house officers (SHOs) and to explore perceptions of the usefulness of a range of topics to these trainees. A total of 64  SHOs, in five hospitals in the Anglia region, participated in semi-structured interviews up to 3  months after starting their post. The interviews investigated the content of any induction received and also examined what the trainees {{would have liked to have}} received. Almost half (29) of the SHOs also completed a questionnaire which examined the perceived usefulness of various induction topics for a trainee starting a new post. The results showed that, although a departmental induction programme is considered important and highly valued, a substantial minority of SHOs had not received one. Of this minority, 75 % would have welcomed an induction. Where an induction had taken place, the focus was primarily upon timetables, tours and meeting people, however, a quarter of the questionnaire sample had not received a <b>service</b> <b>timetable,</b> a third had not met any consultants, two-thirds had received no introduction to clinical management, and two-thirds had received no information about how their consultants manage their patients. Thus, although many trainees receive an induction, important information may not be covered. A staged approach to departmental induction is recommended, using a short, high-quality, and comprehensive induction programme. Flexible and timely programmes, supported by comprehensive written information, will contribute to meeting the needs of trainees in an efficient and effective way.    Keywords: induction; training; educatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mode-service choice model to assess competition between air transport, high-speed train services and private car at regional/national scale. It has been specified through a schedule-based approach which {{implies that the}} whole modeling system (demand, supply, path choice and assignment) has to consider <b>service</b> <b>timetable</b> explicitly. For this reason scheduled services have been represented by single runs instead of traditional service lines, and attributes at single run level for each scheduled transportation service have been taken into account to estimate the mode-service choice probabilities for a given O/D pair and user target time. The mode-service choice model is defined {{in the framework of}} the Random Utility Model theory by using a nested-logit structure in which the systematic utility of scheduled services is assumed linear in both attributes and parameters. Among attributes composing systematic utility, a key role is played by the early schedule penalty or late schedule penalty, which represents the disutility that occurs because of the difference between user desired departure time and run scheduled departure time or between user desired arrival time at destination and run scheduled arrival; it can be calculated explicitly considering a schedule-based approach only. The mode-service model has been specified and calibrated {{on the basis of a}} set of available data for Italy, and its application to the actual scenario allowed us to test its capability to reproduce the actual Italian market share between regional flights and high-speed trains, to be used as starting point for assessing future scenario forecasts. The first part of the paper describes the schedule-based approach and presents the general structure of the proposed mode-service choice model; the latter part reports results of the application to the Italian case, in which the proposed model has been specified, calibrated and applied...|$|E

40|$|In an open railway access market, the {{provisions}} of railway infrastructures and train services are separated and independent. Negotiations between the track owner and train service providers are thus required for the allocation of the track capacity and the formulation of the <b>services</b> <b>timetables,</b> in which each party, i. e. a stakeholder, exhibits intelligence from the previous negotiation experience to obtain the favourable terms and conditions for the track access. In order to analyse the realistic interacting behaviour among the stakeholders in the open railway access market schedule negotiations, intelligent learning capability {{should be included in}} the behaviour modelling.
