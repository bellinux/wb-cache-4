5|$|Filmed in full scale, {{the school}} {{explosion}} used drywall around {{the interior of}} the set to protect it from the fire. Physical effects supervisor Gary Monak oversaw the explosion. The destruction <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> cast as they were more used to optical effects in the series. Costume designer Robert Blackman created the Vedek costumes. Crew-members suggested that Blackman based his Vedek hats on the form of the Sydney Opera House, but Blackman denied the design was deliberate.|$|E
5|$|Having been forewarned {{about the}} attack, the Portuguese {{commander}} {{had been able}} to begin preparations for the assault; however, he had planned on receiving a frontal assault and when the force came under attack from the rear he was completely <b>surprised.</b> <b>The</b> Portuguese attempted to entrench themselves in rifle pits, but they became disoriented after Pinto and several other officers were slain early in the engagement.|$|E

5|$|Three months later, on September 19, Osan {{would be}} the {{location}} where the U.S. and U.N. forces {{under the command of}} the Eighth Army, advancing from the south, would meet up with forces of X Corps, advancing from the north after having recently <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> North Koreans with the Inchon Landings, as the two forces were in an offensive pushing the North Koreans back, which would culminate in a complete defeat of the North Korean Army in the south.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{conducted}} a frontal {{assault on the}} Gustav Line stronghold at Monte Cassino, and VI Corps, under Major General John P. Lucas from 20 September, was assigned to Operation Shingle, detached from the 15th Army Group to land behind enemy lines at Anzio on 22 January 1944. For this mission, CCA (Combat Command A) of the 1st Armored Division {{was attached to the}} 45th Infantry Division. Landing on schedule, VI Corps <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> Germans, but Major General Lucas's decision to consolidate the beachhead instead of attacking gave the Germans time to bring the LXXVI Panzer Corps forward to oppose the landings.|$|E

5|$|As he {{attempted}} to withdraw with the wounded soldier, Bleak was confronted by two more Chinese. Putting down the wounded soldier, Bleak reportedly <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> Chinese soldiers by charging them and smashing their heads together {{with such force that}} he may have fractured the skulls of {{one or both of the}} assailants before pushing them out of his way. Eventually, all 20 men of the patrol returned to the UN lines, but a third of them were wounded. Bleak was credited with saving the patrol, both by promptly treating the wounded and by aggressively attacking and killing or neutralizing five Chinese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|By the evening, the 2nd Battalion {{was ordered}} to {{separate}} from the main axis of the offensive and protect the right flank of the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Brigadeperforming the task originally assigned to the 10th Brigade of the Croatian TO. At the same time, the 10th Brigade commanding officer was relieved of duty for failure to advance. Regardless, the unit remained inactive. The HV units that managed to cross the river on 12 December <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> JNA and reported inflicting considerable casualties.|$|E
5|$|Frederick III's war on Sweden gave Charles X Gustav {{a reason}} to abandon the Polish–Lithuanian {{deadlock}} and fight Denmark instead. After marching his army {{to the west and}} making a dangerous crossing of the frozen straits in the winter of 1657/58, he <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> unprepared Frederick III on the Danish isles and forced him into surrender. In the Treaty of Roskilde, Denmark had to abandon all Danish provinces in what is now Southern Sweden. The anti-Swedish allies meanwhile neutralized the Transylvanian army and Polish forces ravaged Swedish Pomerania.|$|E

5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore You Are the Apple of My Eye {{earned a}} total of SGD$675,000, making it the second-highest-grossing film in Singapore that weekend despite the film's NC-16 rating (which meant that only viewers over age 16 were admitted); this <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> film's distributor, 20th Century Fox. The film broke the record for highest opening weekend for a Taiwanese film in Singapore, {{previously}} held by the 2007 film Secret. It surpassed the performance of other Taiwanese films such as Monga, Cape No.7 and Lust, Caution. You Are the Apple of My Eye was the highest-grossing Asian film of 2011 at the Singapore box office, with earnings of SGD$2.93 million.|$|E
5|$|In a {{nighttime}} raid, {{under the cover}} of darkness and a distraction by a P-61 Black Widow, the group <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> Japanese forces in and around the camp. Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack; the Americans suffered minimal casualties. The Rangers, Scouts, and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines. The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the death march and prison camp atrocities, which sparked a new rush of resolve for the war against Japan. The rescuers were awarded commendations by MacArthur, and were also recognized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A memorial now sits {{on the site of the}} former camp, and the events of the raid have been depicted in several films.|$|E

5|$|Ipswich {{made only}} one major signing during the off-season, buying Hermann Hreiðarsson from Wimbledon F.C. for a club record £4m {{two days before}} the season commenced. Television pundits Rodney Marsh and Mark Lawrenson both agreed relegation would be the obvious outcome. Ipswich <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> doubters; they {{sustained}} a high league position and narrowly missed out on qualification for the UEFA Champions League, when the team failed to win {{on the last day of}} the season against Derby County. The fifth-place finish gained the club a UEFA Cup place and earned George Burley the title of FA Premier League Manager of the Year, an award that until 2010 had, in every other season, been given to the manager of the Premier League champions.|$|E
5|$|Jordan then further <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> {{sports world}} by signing {{a minor league}} {{baseball}} contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994. He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and {{was assigned to the}} team's minor league system on March 31, 1994. Jordan has stated this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player. The White Sox were another team owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.|$|E
5|$|Kaim had six battalions of infantry, four squadrons of cavalry {{and plenty}} of {{artillery}} deployed at Rothenzholl. He posted three more battalions at Frauenalb {{to the north and}} an advance guard in Loffenau. Saint-Cyr left Duhesme's division behind to guard Freudenstadt and the Kneibis Mountain. He started from Gernsbach with 12 battalions plus six more borrowed from the Reserve. Finding that the Saxons were marching south along the Enz River to turn his right flank, he sent Taponier with six battalions and 150 hussars east to Wildbad. Taponier <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> Saxons and sent them scurrying back north. With Lambert and Lecourbe's brigades, Saint-Cyr advanced through Loffenau to Rothenzholl northwest of Dobel where he confronted Kaim. Finding the Austrians in powerful defenses, Saint-Cyr tried to draw Kaim's troops out of position.|$|E

5|$|On 22 November, Haislip gave Leclerc {{permission}} to advance on Strasbourg. Leclerc <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> Germans by advancing over country roads and tracks to bypass their defences. Strasbourg was reached on 25 November, and that afternoon the Tricolour {{flew over the}} Strasbourg Cathedral. The German offensive in the Ardennes in December and in Alsace in January led Eisenhower to consider abandoning Strasbourg, but strong opposition to the idea from the French caused him to back down. As a result, the 2e DB was transferred to de Lattre's command {{to assist in the}} reduction of the Colmar Pocket.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, 1996, a {{well-known}} gaming clan, the Rangers, <b>surprised</b> <b>the</b> Quake community with Diary of a Camper, the first widely known machinima film. This short, 100-second demo file contained {{the action and}} gore of many others, but {{in the context of}} a brief story, rather than the usual deathmatch. An example of transformative or emergent gameplay, this shift from competition to theater required both expertise in and subversion of the game's mechanics. The Ranger demo emphasized this transformation by retaining specific gameplay references in its story.|$|E
