5|$|On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed {{her final}} scenes for the series, {{along with two}} fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher). She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she {{was looking forward to}} {{pursuing}} other projects. Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future. Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character, he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline. However, she also felt like <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> another chance to prove herself.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E

25|$|While Zoe was criticised {{over her}} {{personality}} and for hogging {{most of the}} sales, the rest of Revolution had to grudgingly admit that <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> the most credit for the team's win.

25|$|The {{audience}} on You're Fired unanimously agreed that Jenny {{deserved to be}} fired, but were more divided on Jennifer. While the panel decided that <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> her fate, they also agreed that dismissing Michael would have been justified.

Greg Childs, the jockey who rode Sunline in 33 of her races, said <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> to bracketed with the Diva as the best racemares of the modern era. Makybe Diva was an outstanding stayer and Sunline was a champion middle distance horse.|$|E
25|$|There was no {{reward and}} no final {{boardroom}} as such in this episode; all of Atomic were dismissed upon {{the announcement of}} the task results, and the selection of the two finalists followed immediately afterwards. Zara was easily selected as the first finalist, as neither James nor Haya felt that <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> to be fired, and she was deemed to have been a very strong performer on almost every task. Though Lord Sugar indicated that he felt Haya had actually been more consistent overall than James, James's two victories as project manager ended up earning him the other finalists' spot.|$|E
25|$|From March 19 through May 7, 2010 Cătălin Moroşanu {{participated in}} one of the most popularly viewed show in the history of Romanian television, Dansez pentru tine (the local version of Dancing with the Stars). He stated that his {{motivation}} and financial winnings would go to support a young widow, who wanted to make her daughter's life easier, and filled with the happiness that <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> but had lost with the death of her father. He was considered to be the single most talented and entertaining male participant in the competition, and was the fan favorite. He made it to the Final elimination round, and won the 1st place spot at the end of the show, earning 60,000 Euros for Magdalena Ciorobea (his dancing partner in the show), collecting over 13,000 votes.|$|E

500|$|It topped several [...] "best {{episode of}} 2010" [...] lists, {{including}} Den of Geek, Give Me My Remote, and TV.com. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Entrada" [...] the fifth best {{episode of the}} series, calling it [...] "the sensational climax to season 3's sensational Olivia/Fauxlivia parallel universe interplay, which seemed {{to bring out the}} best in both the writers of Fringe as well as its actors, especially Anna Torv, who rocked the tricky material and created a convincingly distinct and unique doppelganger iteration of Olivia. <b>She</b> <b>deserved</b> an Emmy nomination for her work this season. Oh, well." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response was}} largely positive, with a TV Guide writer ranking [...] "Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?" [...] one of 2010's top 25 television episodes. Alec Stern of The Michigan Daily cited the episode {{as an example}} of the show's improved quality, and The Futon Critic's Brian Ford Sullivan also included it in his list of 50 best episodes of 2010. Strickland's performance received an overwhelmingly positive response after the episode first aired. The reviewer from TV Guide felt that Strickland's performance was worthy of an Emmy, and that the first time Freedman saw King's injuries was [...] "like we weren't even watching TV anymore". A TVLine post later listed Strickland as one of the Emmy Awards' 21 biggest snubs. E! News Kristin dos Santos also praised Strickland's portrayal of King, writing that <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> an Emmy nomination, and Winston Mize of SpoilerTV wrote that Strickland was [...] "robbed. of. all. the. awards". TV Fanatic Steve Marsi liked the episode, saying that its pacing and Strickland's performance immersed the audience despite the difficult subject matter.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of her abortion, Danielle was depicted as being increasingly emotionally unstable and angry with Ronnie, believing that <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> {{to belong to the}} Mitchell family. The writers had Archie discover her secret as a test of his character, experimenting with whether he would be despicable enough to conceal the truth. Lamb deemed Danielle [...] "a huge threat" [...] to Archie's position as patriarch of the Mitchell family, explaining why he chose to lie that Ronnie was suffering from depression and Danielle ought not tell her. Danielle accepted the lie, believing it to explain Ronnie's [...] "hot and cold" [...] reaction to her, and attempted to care for Ronnie and help her recover. Crace explained that despite their turbulent relationship, Ronnie was all Danielle had ever wanted. Despite seeing Archie as [...] "a domineering figure", Danielle initially trusted him and believed he would reunite her with her mother when the time was right. However, as time passed she became aware of Archie's [...] "true colours" [...] and grew afraid of him.|$|E

500|$|The truth finally emerges that Manju {{was merely}} baiting Thyagu {{to teach him}} a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he {{attempts}} {{to take advantage of}} her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl (Saritha). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, [...] "What do you think of women's liberation?". Arun's wife replies, [...] "I don't know". Manju replies with a cynical, [...] "that is why you are happy". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, [...] "She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That is how she is".|$|E
500|$|Manning {{supplemented}} {{her book}} writing by reviewing for The Spectator, The Sunday Times, The Observer, Punch and others, {{as well as}} making occasional contributions to the Palestine Post. Her fourth novel, A Different Face, was published in 1953. Set in a drab city based on Manning's hometown of Portsmouth, it chronicled the main character's attempts to leave his birthplace. The book was not well-reviewed, and as was frequently the case, Manning felt slighted, feeling {{that she did not}} get the reviews <b>she</b> <b>deserved.</b> Neurotic self-doubt and perfectionism made her difficult and easily offended, and she was very aware of younger writers outstripping her. Such an author was Iris Murdoch, with whom Manning shared an interest in flying saucers and an uneasy friendship that was tinged with jealousy at the younger Murdoch's greater success. Manning knew that she was spiteful, but could not help herself, frequently critiquing writer friends to others. However, she consistently praised and admired Ivy Compton-Burnett to whom she had been introduced in 1945, and whose friendship she greatly valued. She complained about her publisher Heinemann and her lack of recognition from her peers: Anthony Powell called her [...] "the world's worst grumbler", and the publisher remembered that she was [...] "never an easy author to handle." [...] A friend gave her the nickname [...] "Olivia Moaning", which was picked up by others, much to Manning's annoyance.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley), {{supported}} by her boyfriend Shane (LaMarcus Tinker), auditions {{for the role}} of Maria and impresses the directors—Emma, Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and Artie (Kevin McHale)—with her rendition of [...] "Spotlight". They schedule a callback between her and Rachel (Lea Michele) to help them decide who should be cast in the role. Mercedes is angry about what she perceives as continued favoritism shown to Rachel, especially in the awarding of solos, and when Will pushes her in the glee club's extra dance rehearsals that Rachel is excused from, she decides she has had enough and quits glee club. When Mercedes and Rachel compete by singing [...] "Out Here On My Own" [...] in the callbacks, Mercedes gives a performance that Rachel privately concedes was better, which prompts Rachel to begin a last-minute candidacy for senior class president to improve her college prospects; this dismays Kurt, who now has another rival to campaign against. The three directors decide to offer the role of Maria to both contenders, with each to do half the performances, but Mercedes is convinced <b>she</b> <b>deserved</b> to win the part outright and refuses to accept half a role. She withdraws from contention, which leaves Rachel as the sole Maria, and volunteers to join Shelby Corcoran's (Idina Menzel) new glee club. The cast list is posted, with Rachel as Maria, Blaine as Tony, Santana as Anita, Mike as Riff, and Kurt as Officer Krupke.|$|E
