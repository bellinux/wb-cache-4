50|$|A Flit gun {{consists}} of a pneumatic pump cylinder with a hand-operated piston to force air through an air nozzle in the front. Below <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pneumatic tube hangs a cylindrical container designed {{to act as a}} reservoir for liquid insecticide, this reservoir being set at 90 degrees to the pneumatic tube. In early versions, the reservoir is permanently secured to <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> and equipped with a removable, gasketed screw cap for filling. In later, improved versions, the insecticide reservoir is secured to <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> with a coarse screw fitting and a seal of cork composite or gasket paper, so that it can readily be unscrewed for filling. A siphon tube extends from <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> cylinder downward into the reservoir and <b>the</b> upper end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> siphon is positioned in front of a nozzle on <b>the</b> air <b>pump.</b> When a jet of high-velocity air exits <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> and streams across end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> siphon tube, it lowers the pressure in the siphon, drawing insecticide upward from the reservoir, which then atomizes the liquid as it is entrained in the air jet.

40|$|Commercial pumps {{tested at}} MIT's Jensen lab for {{applications}} pumping highly corrosive materials at medium pressure (100 - 300 psi) {{and a low}} flow rate (less than 50 mL/min) have proven unreliable. The most common failures observed have been check valve failure and insufficient chemical compatibility. Some of these pumps use dual reciprocating pistons to drive the fluid, requiring <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> four check valves. This lowers <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> as a whole to an undesirable level. A novel pump system design could operate {{without the need for}} any check valves. Operating three diaphragm pumps in series creates a pseudo-peristaltic pump, but requires check valves on both sides of each diaphragm pump. Instead, a diaphragm pump was designed such that the diaphragm can completely seal at <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> each <b>stroke,</b> eliminating <b>the</b> need for check valves between <b>the</b> <b>pumps.</b> Proper timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> draw and <b>pump</b> phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle <b>of</b> each <b>pump</b> eliminates <b>the</b> need for check valves at <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series as well. Thus, each <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> is able to drive fluid forward and seal to allow adjacent pumps to draw effectively and prevent them from creating backflow. Additionally, current pumps have problems with chemical compatibility due to poor material selection. Thus, this new pump could be made to be more reliable and more robust against corrosion by choosing materials with high chemical compatibility. <b>The</b> scope <b>of</b> this thesis is only <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diaphragm <b>pumps</b> to be used within <b>the</b> three <b>pump</b> system described above. by Michael Rodrigo.

50|$|Modern {{physical}} cell disruptors typically operate via either pneumatic or hydraulic pressure. Although pneumatic {{machines are}} typically lower cost, their performance can be unreliable due to {{variations in the}} processing pressure throughout <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air <b>pump.</b> It is generally considered that hydraulic machines offer superior lysing ability, especially when processing harder to break samples such as yeast or Gram-positive bacteria, due {{to their ability to}} maintain constant pressure throughout the piston stroke.

500|$|Despite an {{incomplete}} understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principles behind them, {{in some ways}} Evans's thinking {{about the potential for}} steam engines was once again far ahead of its time. In <b>the</b> postscript <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Steam Engineer's Guide, Evans noted that drawing a vacuum on water reduces its boiling point and cools it. He further observed that a vacuum would have the same effect upon ether, and the resulting cooling should be sufficient to produce ice. He went on to describe a piston vacuum pump apparatus to produce this effect, and also showed that a compression cylinder, or <b>the</b> compression <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vacuum <b>pump,</b> should produce heat in a condenser. Thus Evans had produced the first detailed and theoretically coherent design for a vapor-compression refrigerator, identifying all the major components (expander, cooling coil, compressor and condenser) of a refrigeration cycle, leaving some to credit him as <b>the</b> 'grandfather <b>of</b> refrigeration'. [...] Although Evans never developed a working model of his designs, and {{there is no evidence that}} he ever attempted to, Evans in his later life worked and associated extensively with fellow inventor Jacob Perkins on steam engines and the potential for refrigeration. Perkins would later develop and build a refrigeration device for which he received patents in 1834–1835, employing much the same principles originally put forward by Evans.|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional development goals like reliability, emission behaviour and energetic efficiency, the competition between the systems used for warming heating and drinking water is compelling <b>the</b> manufacturers <b>of</b> oil-fired heating systems to take increasingly into account product requirements such as adjustability, space requirements and operating noises, which {{have in the past}} been ignored. Above all, increasing importance is placed on reducing the lower power limit - which is at the moment around 15 kW for spray burners - against <b>the</b> background <b>of</b> a continuously falling need for heating energy. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> these constraints, <b>the</b> pre-mixing surface burner for EL heating oil, developed as part of this work, provides a promising approach to a solution which links <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> metering minimal fuel mass flow rates with favourable emission behaviour, output dynamics and the virtually noiseless operation of this type of burner. To create the aerosol a superheated fuel jet is injected into <b>the</b> pre-mixing section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burner via a closeable nozzle. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reduction in pressure at the nozzle outlet, vapour bubbles form with the injected jet, which is surrounded by air. <b>The</b> rapid growth <b>of</b> these vapour bubbles tears the liquid open. In addition, <b>the</b> kinetic forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal turbulence and the sheer forces cause the liquid film to break up along <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jet. In contrast to traditional methods of atomizing a liquid fuel much smaller drops are formed as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overlaying <b>of</b> thermal and kinetic jet fragmentation. The injection device is designed as a volume-controlled metering system. A piston <b>pump</b> moves <b>the</b> fuel from a storage tank to the fuel heater. The injection nozzle is located at <b>the</b> outlet end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuel heater. Given a constant <b>stroke</b> volume <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> fuel which is injected is determined by <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piston <b>pump.</b> Before <b>the</b> burner starts operating an electrical heating element heats the fuel to the required injection temperature. After the heater has operated for a brief period <b>of</b> time <b>the</b> hot reaction zone supplies the energy needed to heat up the fuel. The electrical heating element is either switched off, or activated at intervals in order to maintain a pre-set injection temperature. The fuel is heated under pressure in order to prevent <b>the</b> depositing <b>of</b> coke-like substances resulting from the liquid fuel phase. In order to provide a technical evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach, a test burner with a power output of 2 - 10 kW was developed and examined on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following criteria: pollutant emission, flame stability, modulating operation, electrical energy requirement, noises and reliability. The results show that the nitrogen oxide emission and the surface burner noise level are considerably lower than those of conventional spray burners. (orig.)

This allows use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> beam emitted by the laser diode, providing <b>the</b> efficient use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
40|$|Improved glycemic {{control with}} insulin pump therapy in {{patients}} with type 1 diabetes mellitus has shown gradual reductions in nephropathy and retinopathy. More recently, <b>the</b> emerging concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artificial pancreas, comprising an insulin pump coupled to a continuous glucose meter and a control algorithm, would become the next major breakthrough in diabetes care. The patient safety and <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> therapy are directly derived from <b>the</b> delivery accuracy <b>of</b> rapid-acting insulin. For this purpose, a specific precision-oriented design of micropump has been built. <b>The</b> device, made <b>of</b> a stack of three silicon wafers, comprises two check valves and a pumping membrane that is actuated against stop limiters by a piezo actuator. Two membranes comprising piezoresistive strain gauges have been implemented to measure the pressure in <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> chamber and at <b>the</b> outlet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> Their high sensitivity makes possible <b>the</b> monitoring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> accuracy with a tolerance of ± 5 % for each individual <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> 200 nL. <b>The</b> capability <b>of</b> these sensors to monitor priming, reservoir overpressure, reservoir emptying, outlet occlusion and valve leakage has also been studied...|$|R

50|$|The {{impeller}} in a DGF pump {{is designed}} with dual sides. One side {{is designed to}} drive the liquid like a normal centrifugal <b>pump</b> and <b>the</b> other side is designed to draw vapor into <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> and mix it with the liquid. In addition to the new impeller, a special seal was invented to extend <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> With these innovations <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> creates a sub-atmospheric pressure region within <b>the</b> <b>pump's</b> seal chamber. As the impeller draws in the vapor it is mixed with <b>the</b> liquid being <b>pumped</b> and compressed into micro-fine bubbles. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> close tolerance between <b>the</b> backvanes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impeller and <b>the</b> backplate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> <b>the</b> vapor is sheared into fine bubbles and then they are compressed in the sub-atmospheric pressure region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b> These fine bubbles become dissolved into the liquid within <b>the</b> volute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

50|$|SERCA {{consists}} of 13 subunits (labelled M1-M10, N, P and A). Calcium ions bind to the M1-M10 subunits (which are {{located within the}} membrane), whereas ATP binds to the N,P and A subunits (which are located outside the SR). When 2 calcium ions, along with a molecule of ATP, bind to <b>the</b> cytosolic side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> (i.e <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> outside <b>the</b> SR), <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> opens. This occurs because ATP (which contains three phosphate groups) releases a single phosphate group (becoming adenosine diphosphate). The released phosphate group then binds to <b>the</b> <b>pump,</b> causing <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> to change shape. This shape change causes <b>the</b> cytosolic side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> to open, allowing the two Ca2+ to enter. <b>The</b> cytosolic side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pump</b> then closes and the sarcoplasmic reticulum side opens, releasing the Ca2+ into the SR.|$|R
30|$|At present, {{the general}} {{idea is that}} the {{variable}} speed drive technology can decrease the polished rod peak load, the energy consumption and increase <b>the</b> oil production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pumping</b> system. However, in the beginning, the variable speed drive technology only improved the upstroke speed and decreased <b>the</b> down <b>stroke</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prime motor. Now the variable speed drive technology can be used to change <b>the</b> speed curve <b>of</b> motor in a pump stroke period to redistribution the speed profile for a more stable operating range and a lower polished rod peak load and a less energy consumption of pumping system.|$|R
