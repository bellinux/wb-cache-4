40|$|Liberals {{claim that}} {{countries}} avoid conflict {{in order not}} to disrupt economically beneficial exchange. The statement that economic integration reduces the likelihood of conflict is largely based on the effects of trade. A similar rationale can be applied to economic interdependence in the form of international capital exchange. A state is expected to avoid political risk, especially severe forms such as militarized disputes, {{in order not to}} deter investors. This study tests, on the dyadic and monadic levels of analyses, whether the liberal peace proposition holds when economic integration is operationalized as foreign direct investment (FDI) stocks, inflows, and outflows. The results for the years 1980 - 2000 indicate that inflows and <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>investment</b> reduce the risk of an outbreak of a fatal dispute, regardless of whether they are tested in a single equation or a simultaneous equation model. Thus, reverse causality does not bias the pacifying effect of foreign investment inflows and stock. The results also support the underlying notion of the commercial peace that militarized conflicts inhibit foreign investment. The onset of a fatal conflict reduces FDI inflows, and, if tested in a two-stage instrumental variable approach, FDI stock, the most complete measure of economic integration through foreign investment. Accounting for endogeneity seems particularly important when analyzing the link between the onset of fatal disputes and the outflow of FDI. causality, flows, foreign direct investment, militarized interstate disputes, stocks...|$|E

In this paper we investigate China 2 ̆ 019 s outward direct investment ODI in Africa using macro and micro data. The aggregate data on China 2 ̆ 019 s ODI in African countries reveal that China 2 ̆ 019 s share of the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>investment</b> is small, though growing rapidly. China 2 ̆ 019 s attraction to resource-rich countries {{is no different from}} Western investment. China 2 ̆ 019 s overall ODI is uncorrelated with a measure of rule of law, whereas Western investment favors the better governance environments. As a result, Chinese investment in strong and weak governance environments is about the same, but its share of foreign investment is higher in the weak governance states. The micro data that we use is MOFCOM 2 ̆ 019 s database on all registered Chinese firms investing in Africa between 1998 and 2012. We use key words in project descriptions to code the investments into 25 sectors. This database captures the small and medium private firms investing in Africa.

Furthermore, the contribution ratio <b>of</b> per capita <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> stock to China's regional income inequality has relatively been on a steady decline since 2002.

A numerically solvable general equilibrium model of trade and multinational firms is used to incorporate the following components of corporate taxation: parent and host country statutory corporate tax rates, withholding tax rates, and parent and host country depreciation allowances.

The hypotheses regarding the effects {{of changes in the}} tax parameters are investigated in a panel of bilateral OECD outbound <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> (FDI) from 1991 to 2002. For this, we compile annual information on taxation to construct the largest existing panel of tax parameters at the bilateral level based on national tax law and bilateral tax treaties.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} Poland’s trade liberalization 1994 - 2001 on the industry wage structure. The liberalization was undertaken in preparation for Poland’s accession to the European Union and was more pronounced in industries with larger shares of unskilled labour. Our analysis indicates that a decrease in an industry tariff was associated with higher wages being earned by workers employed in the industry, controlling for worker characteristics and geographic variables. The result is robust to including year and industry fixed effects, controlling for industry-level exports, imports, concentration, <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> direct <b>investment</b> and capital accumulation. The {{finding is consistent with}} liberalization increasing competitive pressures, forcing firms to restructure and improve their productivity, which in turn translates into higher profits being shared with workers. It could also be potentially attributed to trade liberalization lowering the costs of imported inputs, which enhances firm profitability. The result holds when skilled workers are excluded from the sample, thus suggesting that reductions in trade barriers benefited the unskilled in terms of an increase in wages. globalization; trade liberalization; transition; wages...|$|R
