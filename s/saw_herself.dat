5|$|Hogarth {{was still}} at work on A Harlot's Progress when she died, so she never <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> immortalised. There were other madams ready to step into her shoes, {{but it was not}} until Mother Douglas took over the King's Head in Covent Garden in 1741 that a brothel reappeared with a {{reputation}} to match that of Needham.|$|E
5|$|Knox began forcing Kelly to {{accompany}} him to ringside so he could {{keep an eye on}} her, making her his de facto valet. As a result, she found herself involved in the feud developing between Mike Knox and partner Test with Tommy Dreamer and his partner The Sandman, including being inadvertently hit with a cane by Sandman when Knox used her as a shield. She made her in-ring debut for the brand on the August 22, 2006 episode of ECW on Sci-Fi in a losing effort, as part of a six-person mixed tag team match which <b>saw</b> <b>herself,</b> Knox, and Test lose to Dreamer, Sandman and Torrie Wilson, in what was the last match of the feud.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} the lives of women that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E
60|$|She {{made that}} quaint {{reflection}} {{with a very}} troubled brow. The moonlight meeting had left some unwelcome remembrances in her mind. I saw that as plainly as I <b>saw</b> Naomi <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|Later I <b>saw</b> Inez <b>herself,</b> {{who said}} that she would have liked to come, {{although}} she hated to see great beasts killed, but that her father was against it because he thought she might catch fever. So she supposed that she had better remain where she was.|$|R
25|$|The {{king had}} several queens {{and at least}} 13 issue. Most chronicles say that his {{successor}} Tarabya was born to his chief queen consort Khame Mi. But the chronicle Yazawin Thit cites a 1401 inscription by Queen Shin <b>Saw</b> Gyi <b>herself</b> which says she {{was the mother of}} Tarabya.|$|R
25|$|Since 1960, Coronation Street has {{featured}} many characters whose {{popularity with}} viewers and critics has differed greatly. The original cast {{was created by}} Tony Warren, with the characters of Ena Sharples (Violet Carson), Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) and Annie Walker (Doris Speed) as central figures. These three women remained with the show for 20 years or more, and became archetypes of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials. Ena was the street's busybody, battleaxe and self-proclaimed moral voice. Elsie was the tart with a heart, who was constantly hurt by men {{in the search for}} true love. Annie Walker, landlady of the Rovers Return Inn, had delusions of grandeur and <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as better than other residents of Coronation Street.|$|E
500|$|Seven {{years after}} graduating from university, Rowling <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as a failure. Her {{marriage}} had failed, and she was jobless with a dependent child, but she described her failure as liberating and allowing her to focus on writing. During this period, Rowling was diagnosed with clinical depression and contemplated suicide. Her illness inspired the characters known as Dementors, soul-sucking creatures introduced in the third book. Rowling signed up for welfare benefits, describing her economic status as being [...] "poor as {{it is possible to}} be in modern Britain, without being homeless." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{turned to}} her {{paternal}} grandmother for solace. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly {{to take the place}} of their beloved mother. Madonna later told Vanity Fair that she <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody." [...] Terrified that her father Tony could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.|$|E
50|$|An {{extremely}} voluputuous female {{computer and}} physics expert, {{who works at}} the college's physics department as a math teacher. She had been trained since childhood to be the servant to Sorata, but decided that she would not follow Mouse blindly until she <b>saw</b> him <b>herself,</b> even planning to kill herself if she was made to follow a man she did not respect.|$|R
5000|$|Around 2003, a {{visit to}} her parents in Germany and an impromptu photo shoot had Iman {{questioning}} {{the difference between what}} she <b>saw</b> of <b>herself</b> in a mirror versus the self-portraits she shot while there. Returning to the states, she began exploring photography, lighting and the differences in perception versus reality in how all of us see and feel about ourselves.|$|R

500|$|While {{discussing}} the prostitution plot, Christina Hendricks said, [...] "This {{is a very}} confusing situation for Joan and for everyone involved. First off, it's just completely insulting. Second of all, it's quite an opportunity. Then {{all of a sudden}} you put the money involved or the opportunity involved or you put a label on it, then it becomes a scary road to go down." [...] Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was [...] "protection [...] her child." [...] Hendricks felt that Joan <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as an equal in a way to the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them do worse things over her thirteen years in employment.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn's {{relentless}} {{energy and}} enthusiasm for life {{is often cited}} in biographies, while a headstrong independence became key to her celebrity status. This self-assuredness meant she could be controlling and difficult; her friend Garson Kanin likened her to a schoolmistress, and she was famously blunt and outspoken. Katharine Houghton commented that her aunt could be [...] "maddeningly self-righteous and bossy". Hepburn confessed to being, especially early in life, [...] "a me me me person". She <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as having a happy nature, reasoning [...] "I like life and I've been so lucky, why shouldn't I be happy?" [...] A. Scott Berg knew Hepburn well in her later years, and said that while she was demanding, she retained a sense of humility and humanity.|$|E
500|$|Abi {{attempts}} to impregnant herself {{by having a}} one-night stand with Babe's relative, Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard), following encouragement from Babe to have a one-night stand. Badland explained that Babe regrets encouraging Abi, saying [...] "She got a bit over-enthusiastic and she gave her bad advice. Babe <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> in Abi and {{she really wanted to}} help her." [...] Abi's attempt at getting pregnant is unsuccessful so when Abi suffers a fall in The Vic, Babe persuades Abi to fake a miscarriage. This leaves Ben [...] "crushed" [...] when he learns of Abi's miscarriage. This plot twist was criticised by Zoe Clark-Coates, co-founder and CEO of The Mariposa Trust, who said, [...] "To regularly see TV shows using fake miscarriages as light entertainment could make people question genuine losses." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{that which}} Donna Inez most desired, [...] And <b>saw</b> into <b>herself</b> each day before all [...] The learnéd tutors whom for him she hired, [...] Was, that his {{breeding}} should be strictly moral: [...] Much into all his studies she inquired, [...] And {{so they were}} submitted first to her, all, [...] Arts, sciences--no branch was made a mystery [...] To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the picture}} seemed {{to become a}} reality and I <b>saw</b> Natalie <b>herself,</b> strangely changeful in her aspect, strangely varying in face and figure, strangely bright, {{standing}} {{in the mouth of}} a pass whereof the little bordering cliffs were covered with bushes and low trees, whose green was almost hid in lovely flowers. There in my dream she stood, smiling mysteriously, and stretched out her arms towards me.|$|R
60|$|She {{retreated from}} the window, fearful of being seen; {{and as she}} {{walked up and down}} the room, endeavouring to compose <b>herself,</b> <b>saw</b> such looks of inquiring {{surprise}} in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.|$|R
500|$|The Historian {{has been}} {{described}} as a combination of genres, including Gothic novel, adventure novel, detective fiction, travelogue, postmodern historical novel, epistolary epic, and historical thriller. Kostova was intent on writing a serious work of literature and <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as an inheritor of the Victorian style. Although based in part on Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Historian is not a horror novel, but rather an eerie tale. It is concerned with history's role in society and representation in books, as well as the nature of good and evil. As Kostova explains, [...] "Dracula is a metaphor for the evil that is so hard to undo in history." [...] The evils brought about by religious conflict are a particular theme, and the novel explores the relationship between the Christian West and the Islamic East.|$|E
500|$|Gilroy {{specifically}} {{wrote the}} role of Nina for his wife Rene Russo; this was because he felt that Nina could easily {{be reduced to a}} [...] "hard-nosed corporate bitch", but Russo would bring a sense of vulnerability to the character. Although Russo was unaware of Gilroy's intention while writing the script, she was interested in performing the role, as she had never portrayed a desperate woman in a film. Russo initially struggled with the character, because she never <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as the victim. In order to accurately portray the character, Russo had to recall memories of when she crossed moral boundaries in her life as a result of desperation and fear. In contrast to the preparations Gyllenhaal and Ahmed took for their roles, Russo did not consult news directors or journalists, as she believed that Nina could be in any business, {{and did not want to}} hinder her character to one profession.|$|E
500|$|Many of Shelley's {{stories are}} set in places or times far removed from early 19th-century Britain, such as Greece and the reign of Henry IV of France. Shelley was {{particularly}} interested in [...] "the fragility of individual identity" [...] and often depicted [...] "the way a person's {{role in the world}} can be cataclysmically altered either by an internal emotional upheaval, or by some supernatural occurrence that mirrors an internal schism". In her stories, female identity is tied to a woman's short-lived value in the marriage market while male identity can be sustained and transformed through the use of money. Although Mary Shelley wrote twenty-one short stories for the annuals between 1823 and 1839, she always <b>saw</b> <b>herself,</b> above all, as a novelist. She wrote to Leigh Hunt, [...] "I write bad articles which help to make me miserable—but I am going to plunge into a novel and hope that its clear water will wash off the mud of the magazines." ...|$|E
50|$|Takeo's father, who has {{a rather}} {{handsome}} appearance. He {{fell in love with}} Takeo's mother when he <b>saw</b> her put <b>herself</b> in harms way to protect someone else and decided he wanted {{to be the one to}} protect her.|$|R
60|$|To avoid further argument, she arose {{and went}} slowly upstairs. Through the doorway Mr. Gribble <b>saw</b> her helping <b>herself</b> {{up by the}} banisters, her left hand still at her throat. Then he heard her moving slowly about in the bedroom overhead.|$|R
5000|$|The heroines in McKinley's books reflect certain {{qualities that}} she <b>saw</b> in <b>herself</b> {{as a young}} woman: clumsiness, plainness, bookishness, and disinterest in the usual social games that involve flirting and dating. She has said, [...] "I didn't {{discover}} boys because they didn't discover me, and because their standards of discovery seemed to me too odd to be aspired to. They {{were the ones who}} got to have adventures, while we got to—well, not have adventures." ...|$|R
500|$|Angelou {{became more}} [...] "politicized" [...] in The Heart of Woman, and {{developed}} {{a new sense of}} Black identity. McPherson argued that even Angelou's decision to leave show business was political, and regarded this book as [...] "a social and cultural history of Black Americans" [...] during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Angelou <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as a historian of both the Civil Rights movement and the Black literary movement of the time. She became more attracted to the causes of Black militants, both in the U.S. and in Africa, to the point of entering into a relationship with South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make, and became more committed to activism. She became an active political protestor during this period, but she did not think of herself in that way. Instead, the focus was on herself, and she used the autobiographical form to demonstrate how the Civil Rights movement influenced one person involved in it. According to Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and effective.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{eventually}} {{learned to}} take care of herself and her siblings, and she turned to her paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly {{to take the place of}} their beloved mother. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Madonna commented that she <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody." [...] Terrified that her father, Tony Ciccone, could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him. Two years after her mother's death, her father married the family's housekeeper, Joan Gustafson. At this point, Madonna began to express unresolved feelings of anger towards her father that lasted for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude. She explained in the May 1989 issue of Interview magazine: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} 9 opener [...] "Avalon", Vala seeks out Daniel at Stargate Command. Needing his {{linguistic}} skills, she uses a Kor mak bracelet to bind them {{together for a}} treasure hunt on Earth. The discovery of an Ancient communication device transports Vala's and Daniel's minds to a village in a distant galaxy where the local villagers kill Vala in a trial by fire, but a Prior, a servant of a race named the Ori, resurrects her. After Vala's and Daniel's safe return to Earth, the removed bracelets cause temporary after-effects that prolong Vala's stay at Stargate Command. In an attempt to stop the Ori from invading the galaxy in [...] "Beachhead", Vala goes missing and appears to have died. Vala re-appears in the late season 9 episode [...] "Crusade" [...] and informs SG-1 via the communication device that {{she is in the}} Ori galaxy. The Ori have impregnated her against her will many months before, and Vala <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> forced to marry a local villager named Tomin to make the pregnancy plausible. When Vala tells SG-1 about the Ori army approaching, the communication link is severed. Vala is last seen onboard one of the invading Ori battlecruisers in the closing scene of the season 9 finale [...] "Camelot" [...] when she goes into labor.|$|E
60|$|The bawling and bellowing, the {{crackling}} of horns and pounding of hoofs, the dusty whirl of cattle, and the flying cowboys disconcerted Madeline and frightened her a little; {{but she was}} intensely interested and meant to stay there until she <b>saw</b> for <b>herself</b> what that strife of sound and action meant. When she tried {{to take in the}} whole scene she did not make out anything clearly and she determined to see it little by little.|$|R
6000|$|... "When he {{was gone}} I {{unlocked}} my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I <b>saw</b> Mary <b>herself</b> at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.|$|R

2500|$|After her death, {{her younger}} sister, Saw Thitmahti, became the chief queen of Kyawswa, (as {{well as that}} of Saw Hnit), and became known as Pwa <b>Saw</b> <b>herself.</b> The paper cites a 1302 {{inscription}} by Thitmathi, which mentions that her elder sister the queen had died before Kyawswa's dethronement [...]|$|E
2500|$|After the Ottoman conquest, however, this symbol {{also found}} its way to a [...] "new Constantinople" [...] (or Third Rome), i.e. Moscow. [...] Russia, deeply {{influenced}} by the Byzantine Empire, <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as its heir and adopted the double-headed eagle as its imperial symbol. It was also adopted by the Serbs, the Montenegrins, the Albanians and a number of Western rulers, most notably in Germany and Austria.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1984 {{interview}} with {{the journal of the}} Labour Committee on Ireland (LCI), when asked if she <b>saw</b> <b>herself</b> as Black British, Abbott replied [...] "No - I would self-define myself just as Black. Though I was born here in London, I couldn't identify as British and anyway most British people don't accept us as British. God! British people can be so racist".|$|E
6000|$|Fanny Assingham {{was there}} to explain away--of this she was duly conscious; for that at least had been true up to now. In the light, however, of Maggie's {{demonstration}} the quantity, even without her taking as yet a more exact measure, might well seem larger than ever. Besides which, with or without exactness, the effect of each successive minute in the place was to put her more in presence of what Maggie <b>herself</b> <b>saw.</b> Maggie <b>herself</b> <b>saw</b> the truth, and that was really, while they remained there together, enough for Mrs. Assingham's relation to it. There was a force in the Princess's mere manner about it that made the detail of what she knew a matter of minor importance. Fanny had in fact something like a momentary shame over her own need of asking for this detail. [...] "I don't pretend to repudiate," [...] she said after a little, [...] "my own impressions of the different times I suppose you speak of; any more," [...] she added, [...] "than I can forget what difficulties and, as it constantly seemed to me, what dangers, every course of action--whatever I should decide upon--made for me. I tried, I tried hard, to act for the best. And, you know," [...] she next pursued, while, {{at the sound of}} her own statement, a slow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came back to her--"and, you know, I believe it's what I shall turn out to have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her companion's interest, however, was all {{for what}} she <b>herself</b> <b>saw.</b> [...] "You mean she'll {{immediately}} speak?" [...] Mrs. Stringham gathered {{that this was what}} Milly meant, but it left still a question. [...] "How will it be against him that you know him?" ...|$|R
