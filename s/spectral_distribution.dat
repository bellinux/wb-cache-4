25|$|Brightness and colorfulness are {{absolute}} measures, {{which usually}} describe the <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> of light entering the eye, while lightness and chroma are measured relative to some white point, {{and are thus}} often used for descriptions of surface colors, remaining roughly constant even as brightness and colorfulness change with different illumination.

25|$|The {{spectrum}} of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp {{is the combination}} of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor, and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating. The spectral lines from the mercury emission and the phosphorescence effect give a combined <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> of light {{that is different from}} those produced by incandescent sources. The relative intensity of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source. Colored objects are perceived differently under light sources with differing spectral distributions. For example, some people find the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing. A healthy person can sometimes appear to have an unhealthy skin tone under fluorescent lighting. The extent to which this phenomenon occurs is related to the light's spectral composition, and may be gauged by its color rendering index (CRI).|$|E

In the cited articles, dynamic spectral behavior is nowhere mentioned in measure comparison considerations, but it is modestly present in some examples of brain connectivity modeling ‐ illustrating PDC applicability to the analysis focused on specific event ‐ details in [2, 3]; also, in [19] authors recently started using matrices of spectrogram distributions instead of matrix distributions as in Figure 1.

25|$|Planck's law {{describes}} the unique and characteristic <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> for electromagnetic radiation in thermodynamic equilibrium, {{when there is}} no net flow of matter or energy. Its physics is most easily understood by considering the radiation in a cavity with rigid opaque walls. Motion of the walls can affect the radiation. If the walls are not opaque, then the thermodynamic equilibrium is not isolated. It is of interest to explain how the thermodynamic equilibrium is attained. There are two main cases: (a) when the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium is in the presence of matter, when the walls of the cavity are imperfectly reflective for every wavelength or when the walls are perfectly reflective while the cavity contains a small black body (this was the main case considered by Planck); or (b) when the approach to equilibrium is in the absence of matter, when the walls are perfectly reflective for all wavelengths and the cavity contains no matter. For matter not enclosed in such a cavity, thermal radiation can be approximately explained by appropriate use of Planck's law.|$|E

2500|$|In {{this mode}} the diode is often reverse biased (with the cathode driven {{positive}} {{with respect to}} the anode). [...] This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction's capacitance.

40|$|AbstractWe study {{distributions}} which generalize {{the concept}} of spectral shift function, for pseudo-differential operators on Rd. We call such <b>distributions</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>distributions.</b> Relations between relative scattering determinants and <b>spectral</b> <b>distributions</b> are established; they lead {{to the definition of}} regularized scattering phase. These relations are analogous to the usual one for the standard spectral shift function. We give several asymptotic properties in the high energy and semiclassical limits where both nontrapping and trapping cases are considered. In particular, we prove Breit–Wigner formulae for the regularized scattering phases, for semiclassical Schrödinger operators with long-range potentials...|$|R

2500|$|Most {{wavelengths}} stimulate two or {{all three}} kinds of cone cell because the spectral sensitivity curves of the three kinds overlap. Certain tristimulus values are thus physically impossible, for example LMS tristimulus values that are non-zero for the M component and zero for both the L and S components. Furthermore, LMS tristimulus values for pure spectral colors would, in any normal trichromatic additive color space, e. g. the RGB color spaces, imply negative values {{for at least one}} of the three primaries because the chromaticity would be outside the color triangle defined by the primary colors. To avoid these negative RGB values, and to have one component that describes the perceived brightness, [...] "imaginary" [...] primary colors and corresponding color-matching functions were formulated. The CIE 1931 color space defines the resulting tristimulus values, in which they are denoted by [...] "X", [...] "Y", and [...] "Z". In XYZ space, all combinations of non-negative coordinates are meaningful, but many, such as the primary locations , , and , correspond to imaginary colors outside the space of possible LMS coordinates; imaginary colors do not correspond to any <b>spectral</b> <b>distribution</b> of wavelengths and therefore have no physical reality.|$|E
