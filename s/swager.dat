5000|$|Charles <b>Swagers</b> (1792-after 1849) was a French painter, {{primarily}} of historical subjects, {{active in the}} early 19th century. He studied under his father, Franz <b>Swagers,</b> a landscape and marine painter from Utrecht who had settled in Paris. [...] <b>Swagers</b> {{is best known for}} the grisaille he exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1833 titled The Tomb of Maria Christina of Austria, by Antonio Canova. A painting of St. Nicholas by <b>Swagers</b> is preserved in the church of Saint-Louis in Gien. In 1840 he was appointed professor of drawing and composition in Dieppe.|$|R
50|$|Born in Paris, <b>Swagers</b> was a pupil of Augustin Pajou, Adélaïde Labille-Guiard, and Jean-Baptiste Jacques Augustin. Her {{husband was}} the Utrecht-born painter Frans <b>Swagers,</b> {{sometimes}} Zwagers; the couple lived in Paris for a time. The couple's daughter, Caroline, {{also became a}} miniaturist after study with her mother. Élisabeth taught drawing at the Maison d’éducation de la Légion d’honneur at Écouen, and later set up drawing school of her own. Some drawings in chalk and miniatures are recorded, as {{are a handful of}} pastels. <b>Swagers</b> died in Paris.|$|R

50|$|<b>Swagers</b> {{was also}} {{active in the}} Esperanto movement. Together with Adolf Finet, he pushed the Esperanto course Esperanto.

50|$|A {{native of}} Sheridan Montana, <b>Swager</b> earned his B.S. in Chemistry from Montana State University, {{received}} a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology working with Robert H. Grubbs, and performed postdoctoral {{studies at the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology under Mark S. Wrighton. He began as an Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania in 1990 and returned to MIT in 1996 as a Full Professor. <b>Swager</b> {{is best known for}} advancing new chemical sensing concepts based on molecular electronic principles. He introduced the concepts of charge and energy transport through molecular and nanowires as a method to create amplified signals to chemical events.|$|E
50|$|The {{claim of}} several historians that the British {{won the battle}} is {{challenged}} by Christine <b>Swager</b> in her book The Valiant Died: The Battle of Eutaw Springs September 8, 1781. The book argues that, first, {{at the end of}} the battle, the British held the majority, but not the entirety, of the field where the main battle took place. Greene held part of the field where the initial skirmish spilled out of the woods into the clearings. <b>Swager</b> also argues that Greene meant to re-engage the enemy on the following day, but was prevented from doing so because the excessively wet weather conditions negated much of his firepower.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Swager</b> {{also has}} {{pioneering}} {{contributions to the}} areas of liquid crystals demonstrating how novel molecular shapes {{can be used to}} introduce intermolecular correlations in structures and alignment. [...] In the area of high strength materials, by creating interlocking structures with enhanced ductility and strength. [...] In carbon nanomaterials he has developed methods for functionalizing and/or dispersing graphenes and carbon nanotubes. [...] Also he has designed novel radical materials in collaboration with Robert G. Griffin (MIT) for dynamic nuclear polarization to enhance the signal to noise ratio in NMR experiments. [...] A number of these enhancement agents are commercially available from DyNuPol Corp. [...] <b>Swager</b> has published more than 400 peer reviewed manuscripts and has more than 70 issued patents.|$|E

50|$|Liberty Township {{was formed}} from the Connecticut Western Reserve. It was {{established}} as a township in 1806.

In 1860, coal was discovered on Alexander McCleery's farm becoming a major industry in the area for the next forty years.|$|E

A large bay window, the height of the entire floor, projects from the top story atop a column-supported overhang that covers an outdoors walking area {{on one side of the}} building.|$|E
50|$|The Fido {{explosives}} detector {{is created}} by ICx Technologies, Inc. {{and is based on}} a proprietary technology developed by MIT called amplifying fluorescent polymer (AFP). The AFP technology was invented by 2007 Lemelson-MIT Prize winner Professor Timothy M. <b>Swager</b> and adapted for use in the Fido explosives detector to detect trace levels of explosive materials. The product is so named because its level of detection is comparable to highly trained explosives detection dogs, the gold standard in explosives detection technology.|$|E
5000|$|Swaging is {{a method}} of wire rope {{termination}} that refers to the installation technique. The purpose of swaging wire rope fittings is to connect two wire rope ends together, or to otherwise terminate one end of wire rope to something else. A mechanical or hydraulic <b>swager</b> is used to compress and deform the fitting, creating a permanent connection. There are many types of swaged fittings. Threaded Studs, Ferrules, Sockets, and Sleeves are a few examples. [...] Swaging ropes with fibre cores is not recommended.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{comprehensive}} reviews {{have been published}} on PTs, the earliest dating from 1981. Schopf and Koßmehl published {{a comprehensive review of}} the literature published between 1990 and 1994. Roncali surveyed electrochemical synthesis in 1992, and the electronic properties of substituted PTs in 1997. McCullough's 1998 review focussed on chemical synthesis of conducting PTs. A general review of conjugated polymers from the 1990s was conducted by Reddinger and Reynolds in 1999. Finally, <b>Swager</b> et al. examined conjugated-polymer-based chemical sensors in 2000. These reviews are an excellent guide to the highlights of the primary PT literature from the last two decades.|$|E
