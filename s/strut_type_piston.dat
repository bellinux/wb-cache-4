40|$|Abstract>> As {{an initial}} step {{to develop a}} liquid {{hydrogen}} pump of <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> operated under cryogenic and high pressure, leakage and piston head shape for the piston pump were discussed with temperature and pressure. As the results, the leakage depended on correlation among density, viscosity, clearance area by the low temperature. In {{order to reduce the}} leakage, {{it was found that the}} air-tightness can be improved by minimizing contact surface between piston and cylinder, and also increasing pressure in-cylinder can reduce piston clearance. Among the proposed <b>piston</b> shapes, D <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> shape had the most air-tightness. D <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> had smaller contact surface than other piston shape and easier expansion of cup shape by pressure. The leakage of D <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> shape was found about 7 %, compared with A <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> shape. But it was required that analyze about vapor lock by friction and wear resistance. Key words: Liquid hydrogen(액체수소), Piston pump(피스톤펌프), Cryogenic and high pressure type(초저 온...|$|R

40|$|As water {{hydraulics}} is {{more and}} more highlighted in wide applications, many varieties of research on design, materials and manufacturing methods of water hydraulic components have been carried out. Especially, water hydraulic piston pump used to be the subject of study in relation to its relative sliding movement. In these relative sliding parts, the leakage and friction probably took place because of the characteristics of low viscosity and poor lubrication of water. In order to reduce the leakage and friction, the relative sliding parts are filled up nearly by using engineering plastic as an anti-wear material on sliding parts. Compared with an oil hydraulic system, a water hydraulic system has fundamental disadvantages of large friction, high leakage, high wear, corrosion, etc. A mechanism of rod <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> was considered to reduce friction of the piston's movement in a water hydraulic piston pump. Friction and leakage of the rod <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> was analyzed and compared with those properties of the conventional plunger <b>type</b> <b>piston.</b> An experimental device was set up to evaluate friction and leakage of those pistons. A PEEK piston was also tested as another alternative piston of a water hydraulic pump...|$|R
