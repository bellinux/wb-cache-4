60|$|The sun {{had already}} set {{an hour when}} Ronald Mervyn reached the hospital, but the moon had just risen, and the stars were <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly.</b>|$|E
60|$|Toward the {{afternoon}} the storm abated, and {{next morning the}} sun was <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly</b> and the waves had gone down sufficiently to enable the canoe to start on her voyage.|$|E

60|$|It struck ten as I left North Villa. The {{moonlight}} {{which was}} just beginning to <b>shine</b> <b>brilliantly</b> on my arrival there, now appeared but at rare intervals; for the clouds were spreading thicker and thicker over the whole surface of the sky, as the night advanced.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Boulder Canyon and Lake Meade, ca. 1935. The daunting, jagged rock walls {{stand in}} {{opposition}} over the calm water with flows {{down the center}} between them. The water reflects streaks of sunlight which <b>shine</b> <b>brilliantly</b> against the reflections of the dark rocks on either side. The lake flows out of sight as it winds through the canyon in the background...|$|R
60|$|At breakfast, {{where the}} guests were {{reasonably}} punctual, {{they were all}} able to observe, in the rapid succession in which they descended from their rooms, that it had stopped snowing {{and the sun was}} <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly.</b>|$|E
60|$|Suddenly she whirled {{from the}} window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly,</b> but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.|$|E
60|$|However, the sun {{which has}} such {{strength}} to kill noxious things, puts {{an end to}} ghosts more quickly even {{than it does to}} other evil vapours and emanations, and when I woke up to find it <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly</b> in a pure heaven, I laughed with much heartiness over the whole affair.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{the cooling}} system {{room for the}} San Fernando Heights Orange Association, August, 1936. Crates of oranges stand in {{opposing}} walls inside of a cooling room labeled " 3 ". A single light bulb hangs from the ceiling above them and <b>shines</b> <b>brilliantly</b> over the smooth, cement floor. What appear to be lines of bolts lie across {{the floor in the}} foreground...|$|R
40|$|We pioneer a new {{future in}} robotic dust {{collection}} by introducing passive dust-collecting robots that, unlike their predecessors, {{do not require}} locomotion to collect dust. While previous research has exclusively focused on active dust-collecting robots, we show that these robots fail with respect to practical and theoretical aspects, as well as human factors. By contrast, passive robots, through their unconstrained versatility, <b>shine</b> <b>brilliantly</b> in all three metrics. We present a mathematical formalism of both paradigms followed by a user study and field study. Comment: Submitted to SIGBOVI...|$|R

60|$|Before {{going to}} bed, Dick {{went up on}} deck for a few minutes. The topsails had been reefed down, but the Madras was rushing through the water at {{a high rate of}} speed. The sea was getting up, and the waves were crested with foam. Above, the stars were <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly.</b>|$|E
60|$|Each corps had its {{flags and}} its music, {{the day was}} fair and bright, and, as the {{flotilla}} swept on past the verdure-clad hills, with the sun <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly</b> down on the bright uniforms and gay flags, on the flash of oars and the glitter of weapons, a fairer sight was seldom witnessed.|$|E
6000|$|The foot conducts itself splendidly. We had a most {{enormous}} cram at Glasgow. Syme saw {{me again}} yesterday (before I left here for Glasgow), and repeated [...] "Gout!" [...] {{with the greatest}} indignation and contempt, several times. The aching is going off as the day goes on, if it be worth mentioning again. The ride from Glasgow was charming this morning; the sun <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly,</b> and the country looking beautiful.|$|E
50|$|Celia is the {{daughter}} of Duke Frederick. She has been portrayed as a foil to her cousin, Rosalind. She displays qualities of the head and heart similar to her cousin. Rosalind and Celia are intimate friends who have been bred and brought up together. It is the love for Rosalind that makes Celia choose a life of voluntary exile. In fact, Celia effects her own individuality so that her cousin may <b>shine</b> <b>brilliantly</b> all the more. 'Celia' literally means 'heavenly' and she is really divine. She may be called the 'moral heroine' of the play as Rosalind is its 'intellectual heroine'.|$|R
5000|$|The Hispano-Filipino theater {{lives and}} Liongson {{is one of}} its most solid pillars. Liongson is part of a {{planetary}} system in which stars <b>shine</b> <b>brilliantly</b> in no despicable magnitude. Some have already departed; others live if at all in slumber. But of those who live, the genuine militant goldsmith and forger who is pounding constantly on the anvil in proper timing is without doubt, Francisco Liongson. The theatrical production of Liongson, which covers the most varied themes as much as its quality and its dimensions, inspires respect and faith in the most non-believer with regard to the depth of the Spanish theater in the Philippines.|$|R
60|$|Monty Price {{had come}} to <b>shine</b> <b>brilliantly</b> as a storyteller. He was an atrocious liar, but this fact {{would not have been}} evident to his enthralled {{listeners}} if his cowboy comrades, in base jealousy, had not betrayed him. The truth about his remarkable fabrications, however, had not become known to Castleton, solely because of the Englishman's obtuseness. And there was another thing much stranger than this and quite as amusing. Dorothy Coombs knew Monty was a liar; but she was so fascinated by the glittering, basilisk eyes he riveted upon her, so taken in by his horrible tales of blood, that despite her knowledge she could not help believing them.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} with a sigh. The sun was <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly</b> outside. Through the half-open blinds its long shafts seemed to be searching {{the house for the}} lost guests, and making the hollow shell appear doubly empty. What a {{contrast}} to the dear dark days of mysterious seclusion and delicious security, lit by Lee's laughter and the sparkling hearth, which had passed so quickly! The forgotten outer world seemed to have returned to the house through those open windows and awakened its dwellers from a dream.|$|E
60|$|Mills {{departed}} {{to execute}} his commission. Philippa stood {{looking out of}} the window, across the lawn and shrubbery and down on to the beach. There was still a heavy sea, but it was merely the swell from the day before. The wind had dropped, {{and the sun was}} <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly.</b> Sir Henry, Helen, and Nora were strolling about the beach as though searching for something. About fifty yards out, the wrecked trawler was lying completely on its side, with the end of one funnel visible. Scattered groups of the villagers were examining it from the sands. In due course Mills returned.|$|E
6000|$|The company {{broke up}} with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken song. The bar was still crowded with revellers, {{and many of the}} brethren {{remained}} there. The little band who had been told off for duty passed out into the street, proceeding in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not to provoke attention. It was a bitterly cold night, with a half-moon <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly</b> in a frosty, star-spangled sky. The men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building. The words, [...] "Vermissa Herald" [...] were printed in gold lettering between the brightly lit windows. From within came the clanking of the printing press.|$|E
5000|$|The {{paintings}} {{were made on}} Gauguin's jute which with Van Gogh’s brushstroke made a finished tapestry-like texture. The high vantage point represented in the work resembled that of Gauguin's Vision After the Sermon. Creating a composition of a landscape viewed through the trunks of trees was something used previously by Bernard. Van Gogh used complementary, contrasting colors to intensify the effect of each color. The blue poplar trunks against the yellow path of leaves. Green used against red. Violet was paired with apricot. To his sister, Vincent wrote of selection and placement of colors [...] "which cause each other to <b>shine</b> <b>brilliantly,</b> which form a couple, which complete each other like man and woman." ...|$|R
5000|$|Terry then {{announces that}} he has to leave, and trying to comfort Rose, he reveals that he is [...] "almost an angel". Rose is understandably skeptical, but after Terry leaves, she checks his {{universal}} remote which he had left her as a keepsake, only to discover that it contains no batteries, and the cross nevertheless begins to <b>shine</b> <b>brilliantly</b> on its own. She runs after Terry and calls out to him. Distracted, Terry slips and falls right before a speeding truck and is about to be run over. Rose is shocked to witness that the truck passes right though him, proving he was really an angel all along. Having passed his angel's exam, Terry continues on his quest to do God's work (though not without promising to return), and Rose is left comforted at last.|$|R
40|$|Calibrated CCD {{images of}} the eastern X-ray knot in Puppis A, made in the {{forbidden}} red and green coronal Fe lines, are discussed. They show the high-temperature gas to have a rich morphology, with the scale of some features approaching the 2. 6 arcsec resolution of the data. The pictures have been compared with an Einstein HRI soft X-ray image; there is close correspondence in the position and size of structures seen in the optical forbidden lines and in the X-rays. Located near the shock front a cloud of about 0. 4 pc x 0. 9 pc dimension <b>shines</b> <b>brilliantly</b> in the 5303 A line. To test {{the hypothesis that the}} cloud might be evaporating into the remnant interior, the 5303 A and 6374 A intensity distributions expected for a steady state, one-fluid evaporatig model have been computed...|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} few miles the party galloped in silence. The moon was still <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly,</b> and {{they could see the}} white line of the road {{stretching}} out {{in front of them and}} winding away over the undulating veldt. To right and left spread a broad expanse of wiry grass stretching to the horizon, with low bushes and scrub scattered over it in patches. Here and there were groups of long-legged, unhealthy-looking sheep, who crashed through the bushes in wild terror as the riders swept by them. Their plaintive calls were the only sounds which broke the silence of the night, save the occasional dismal hooting of the veldt owl.|$|E
60|$|On {{making his}} way on deck, he found that {{overhead}} the sky was blue and bright, and the sun <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly.</b> The wind was blowing much harder than on the previous evening, and a heavy sea was running; but as the sun sparkled on the white crests of the waves, the scene was far less awe inspiring {{than it had been}} when he looked out before retiring to his berth. The ship, under closely-reefed main and fore-top sails, was tearing through the water at a high rate of speed, throwing clouds of spray from her bows, and occasionally taking a wave over them that sent a deluge of water along the deck.|$|E
60|$|On {{their way}} to Quebec, they had to sail up the Kennebec in a steamboat. As they were passing along, Marco and Forester sat upon the deck. It was a {{pleasant}} summer morning. They had been sailing all night upon the sea, on the route from Boston {{to the mouth of}} the Kennebec. They entered the mouth of the Kennebec very early in the morning, just before Forester and Marco got up. And thus it happened that when they came up upon the deck, they found that they were sailing in a river. The water was smooth and glassy, <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly</b> under the rays of the morning sun, which was just beginning to rise.|$|E
6000|$|It is now tinged by {{a moving}} mass of English and Allied infantry, [...] in retreat {{to a new}} {{position}} at Mont Saint-Jean. The sun <b>shines</b> [...] <b>brilliantly</b> upon the foreground as yet, but towards Waterloo and [...] the Forest of Soignes on the north horizon it is overcast with [...] black clouds which are steadily advancing up the sky.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Jasper {{is a dark}} man of some six-and-twenty, with thick, lustrous, well-arranged {{black hair}} and whiskers. He looks older than he is, as dark men often do. His voice is deep and good, his face and figure are good, his manner is a little sombre. His room is a little sombre, and may have had its {{influence}} in forming his manner. It is mostly in shadow. Even when the sun <b>shines</b> <b>brilliantly,</b> it seldom touches the grand piano in the recess, or the folio music-books on the stand, or the book-shelves on the wall, or the unfinished picture of a blooming schoolgirl hanging over the chimneypiece; her flowing brown hair tied with a blue riband, and her beauty remarkable for a quite childish, almost babyish, touch of saucy discontent, comically conscious of itself. (There is not the least artistic merit in this picture, which is a mere daub; {{but it is clear}} that the painter has made it humorously—one might almost say, revengefully—like the original.) ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a brief {{introduction to the}} basics of stars, galaxies and Quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). In stars, the central pressure and temperature must be high in order to halt the stellar gravitational collapse. High temperature leads to thermonuclear fusion in the stellar core, releasing thereby enormous amount of nuclear energy, making the star <b>shine</b> <b>brilliantly.</b> On the other hand, the QSOs are very bright nuclei lying in the centres of some galaxies. Many of these active galactic nuclei, which appear star-like when observed through a telescope and   whose power output are more than 10 11 {{times that of the}} Sun, exhibit rapid time variability in their X-ray emissions.   Rapid variability along with the existence of a maximum speed limit, c, provide a strong argument in favour of a compact central engine model for QSOs in which a thick disc of hot gas going around a supermassive blackhole is what makes a QSO appear like a bright point source. Hence, unlike stars, QSOs are powered by gravitational potential energy.    </p...|$|R
60|$|The sun was now <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly,</b> {{and when}} the {{beautiful}} islands of Japan came in sight Rob found that he had recovered his wonted cheerfulness. He moved along slowly, hovering with curious interest over the quaint and picturesque villages and watching the industrious Japanese patiently toiling at their tasks. Just before he reached Tokio {{he came to a}} military fort, and for nearly an hour watched the skilful maneuvers of a regiment of soldiers at their morning drill. They were not very big people, compared with other nations, but they seemed alert and well trained, and the boy decided it would require a brave enemy to face them on a field of battle.|$|E
60|$|The sun was <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly</b> {{and the sky}} was {{cloudless}} as Richard {{turned his}} automobile into the grounds of the Villa Mimosa, soon after nine o'clock on the following morning. The yellow-blossomed trees, slightly stirred by the west wind, formed a golden arch across the winding avenue. The air was sweet, almost faint with perfume. On the terrace, holding a pair of field-glasses in her hand and gazing intently out to sea, was Fedora. At the sound of the motor-horn she turned quickly. She looked at the visitor in surprise. A shade of pink was in her face. Lane brought the car to a standstill, jumped out and climbed the steps of the terrace.|$|E
60|$|The sun was <b>shining</b> <b>brilliantly</b> {{into his}} chamber, when he awoke, {{and the morning}} was far advanced. The gloom which had oppressed him on the {{previous}} night had disappeared with the dark shadows which shrouded the landscape, and his thoughts and feelings were as light and gay as the morning itself. After a hearty breakfast, the four gentlemen sallied forth to walk to Gravesend, followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box. They reached the town about one o'clock (their luggage they had directed to be forwarded to the city, from Rochester), and being fortunate enough to secure places {{on the outside of}} a coach, arrived in London in sound health and spirits, on that same afternoon.|$|E
500|$|Laura Claridge said, [...] "The American {{ideal that}} the {{painting}} is meant to encapsulate <b>shines</b> forth <b>brilliantly</b> {{for those who have}} canonized this work as among Rockwell's great pictures. For those who find the piece less successful, however, Rockwell's desire to give concrete form to an ideal produces a strained result. To such critics the people looking up at the speaker have stars in their eyes, their posture conveying celebrity worship, not a room full of respectful dissent." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{now to the}} eastward {{the stars}} are no longer innumerable, and the sky grows wan. Then a faint silvery mist appears above the housetops, and at last {{in the midst of}} this there comes a <b>brilliantly</b> <b>shining</b> line--the upper edge of the rising moon.|$|R
5000|$|Awarding {{the album}} five stars for New Release Tuesday, Kevin Davis says, [...] "This {{is truly a}} moving and prayerful worship experience." [...] Tony Cummings, giving the album a six out of ten review from Cross Rhythms, writes, [...] "though this is a {{reasonable}} enough debut, to me it never truly sounds deserving of its bestselling status." [...] Rating the album five stars at Louder Than the Music, Jono Davies describes, [...] "Put this album on when you're sad, put this album when you're happy, and let the emotion of the songs draw you in and take you on a quiet and reflective journey around the musical world of Steffany Gretzinger." [...] Logan Merrick, indicating in a 4.5 out of 5 review by Christian Music Review, states, [...] "This whole album features song after song of authentic, pure, lyrical content." [...] Signaling in a {{three and a half}} star review at 365 Days of Inspiring Media, Jonathan Andre writes, [...] "The Undoing is great, and ought to be enjoyed thoroughly". Jessica Morris, awarding the album nine and a half stars for Jesus Wired, says, [...] "Steffany Gretzinger's vocals are exquisite, and The Undoing allows them to <b>shine</b> <b>brilliantly,</b> largely due to the authentic and evocative worship created through the album." ...|$|R
