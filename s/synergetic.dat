500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} features of the Skylon's design is its powerplant, known as <b>Synergetic</b> Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE). The design of the SABRE engine has drawn heavily upon the STRICT/STERN experimental engines, sharing many features such as the propellant and the adoption of the trialled Expansion Deflection Nozzle, as well as building upon the wider field of liquid air cycle engines (LACE). The engines are designed to operate much like a conventional jet engine to around Mach5.5 (1,700m/s), [...] altitude, beyond which the air inlet closes and the engine operates as a highly efficient rocket to orbital speed. The proposed SABRE engine is not a scramjet, but a jet engine running combined cycles of a precooled jet engine, rocket engine and ramjet. Originally the key technology for this type of precooled jet engine did not exist, as it required a heat exchanger that was ten times lighter than the state of the art. Research conducted since then has achieved the necessary performance.|$|E
500|$|Of Human Feelings {{received}} considerable acclaim {{from contemporary}} critics. In a review for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark album from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, {{partly because of}} compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmuted conventional polyphony and {{would be the most}} challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and [...] "let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center". Giddins also highlighted the melody of [...] "Sleep Talk", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's <b>synergetic</b> approach displayed expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record [...] "a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau found the music heartfelt and sophisticated in its exchange of rhythms and simple pieces of melody, writing in The Village Voice, [...] "the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian." ...|$|E

2500|$|He assumed co-editorship of the School for Living's Brookville, Ohio-based Balanced Living {{magazine}} in 1962 and briefly returned to New York as {{associate editor of}} Ralph Ginzburg's quarterly fact: before leaving for Playboy, where he served as an associate editor from 1965 to 1971. According to Wilson, Playboy [...] "paid me a higher salary than any other magazine at which I had worked and never expected me to become a conformist or sell my soul in return. I enjoyed my years in the Bunny Empire. I only resigned when I reached 40 and felt I could not live with myself if I didn't {{make an effort to}} write full-time at last." [...] Along with frequent collaborator Robert Shea, Wilson edited the magazine's Playboy Forum (not to be confused with The Playboy Advisor). During this period, he covered Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert's Millbrook, New York-based Castalia Foundation at the instigation of Alan Watts in The Realist, cultivated important friendships with William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, and lectured at the Free University of New York on 'Anarchist and <b>Synergetic</b> Politics' in 1965.|$|E
