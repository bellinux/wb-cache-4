5|$|In the second, the Soviets {{started with}} a quick goal by Shadrin after 21 seconds. The last ten minutes saw two goals from the Soviets: Yakushev scoring his seventh of the series {{followed}} by Vasiliev on the power play to put the Soviets ahead 5–3 after two periods. White had countered for Canada midway through the period. It was one of few moments for Canada to cheer as the Soviets played an excellent period. The other was a goal-saving play by Esposito who stopped a shot by Yury Blinov who had faked goaltender Dryden out of position and had an empty net to shoot at. Blinov was denied by Esposito who stopped the puck with his stick on the goal line. Blinov and the crowd had prematurely celebrated the apparent goal, and Blinov <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> disbelief.|$|E
25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1951, the American diplomat Averell Harriman went to Iran to {{negotiate}} an Anglo-Iranian compromise, asking the Shah's help; his reply was that [...] "in {{the face of}} public opinion, {{there was no way}} he could say a word against nationalisation". Harriman held a press conference in Tehran, calling for reason and enthusiasm in confronting the [...] "nationalisation crisis". As soon as he spoke, a journalist rose and shouted: [...] "We and the Iranian people all support Premier Mosaddegh and oil nationalisation!" [...] Everyone present began cheering and then marched out of the room; the abandoned Harriman <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> dismay.|$|E
