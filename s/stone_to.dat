5|$|Allen {{acquired}} the stone quarries at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines. He used the unique honey-coloured Bath stone, {{used to build}} the Georgian city, {{and as a result}} made a second fortune. Allen built a railway line from his mine on Combe Down which carried the stone down the hill, now known as Ralph Allen Drive, which runs beside Prior Park, to a wharf he constructed at Bath Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal to transport <b>stone</b> <b>to</b> London. Following a failed bid to supply <b>stone</b> <b>to</b> buildings in London, Allen wanted a building which would show off the properties of Bath stone as a building material.|$|E
5|$|In recent centuries the Mendips, {{like the}} Cotswolds to the north, have been quarried for <b>stone</b> <b>to</b> build {{the cities of}} Bath and Bristol, as well as smaller towns in Somerset. The {{quarries}} are now major suppliers of road <b>stone</b> <b>to</b> southern England, among them producing around twelve million tonnes of limestone every year, employing over two thousand people, and turning over approximately £150million per annum.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{artisans}} used <b>stone</b> <b>to</b> carve {{statues and}} fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints {{were obtained from}} minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologically and ethnohistorically, Q'umarkaj is {{the best}} known of the Late Postclassic {{highland}} Maya capitals. The earliest reference to the site in Spanish occurs in Hernán Cortés' letters from Mexico. Although the site has been investigated, little reconstruction work has taken place. The surviving architecture, which includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt, temples and palaces, has been badly damaged by the looting of <b>stone</b> <b>to</b> build the nearby town of Santa Cruz del Quiché.|$|E
40|$|Network based intruders seldom attack {{directly}} {{from their own}} hosts but rather stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping <b>stones</b> ” <b>to</b> conceal their identity and origin. To track down and apprehend those perpetrators behind stepping stones, it is critically important {{to be able to}} correlate connections through stepping stones. Tracing intruders behind stepping stones and correlating intrusion connections through stepping stones are challenging due to various readily available evasive countermeasures by intruders: • Installing and using backdoor relays (i. e. netcat) at intermediate stepping <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> evade logging of normal logins. • Using different types of connections (i. e. TCP, UDP) at different portions of the connection chain through stepping <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> complicate connection matching. • Using encrypted connections (with different keys) across stepping <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> defeat any content based comparison. • Introducing timing perturbation at intermediate stepping <b>stones</b> <b>to</b> counteract timing based correlation of encrypted connections. In this dissertation, we address these challenges in detail and design solutions to them...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 17th century, {{possibly}} around 1600, a new hall was built in <b>stone</b> <b>to</b> replace the older timber-framed one; it was positioned to the south, replacing the earlier 15th-century extension. The new hall was slightly anachronistic, having only one floor, unlike most new halls from this period which had two storeys. The old hall was then probably adapted for use as a service area.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, The Guardian {{reported}} that British screenwriter Rupert Walters {{was writing a}} movie based on Riefenstahl's life which would star actress Jodie Foster. The project did not receive Riefenstahl's approval prior to her death, as Riefenstahl asked for a veto on any scenes to which she did not agree. Riefenstahl also wanted Sharon <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> play her rather than Foster, which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the project.|$|E
5|$|Several years later, {{according}} to a narration collected by historian Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad was involved with a well-known story about setting the Black Stone {{in place in the}} wall of the Kaaba in 605 CE. The Black Stone, a sacred object, was removed during renovations to the Kaaba. The Meccan leaders could not agree which clan should return the Black <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> its place. They decided to ask the next man who comes through the gate to make that decision; that man was the 35-year-old Muhammad. This event happened five years before the first revelation by Gabriel to him. He asked for a cloth and laid the Black Stone in its center. The clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and together carried the Black <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> the right spot, then Muhammad laid the stone, satisfying the honour of all.|$|E

Another gorge, cut by the Hazel Brook (which flows into the River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.|$|E

5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{iconographic}} forms of Shiva. It is found in more or less all temples and shrines dedicated to Shiva all over India and South-east Asia. There is ample evidence from texts and the multiple depictions of the Ardhanarishvara in <b>stone</b> <b>to</b> suggest that a cult centred around the deity may have existed. The cult may have had occasional followers, but was never aligned to any sect. This cult focusing on the joint worship of Shiva and the Goddess may even have had a high position in Hinduism, but when and how it faded away remains a mystery. Though a popular iconographic form, temples dedicated to the deity are few. A popular one is located in Thiruchengode, while five others are located in Kallakkurichi taluk, all of them in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.|$|E
5|$|By 1725, {{the castle}} had become ruinous. Early in the century, {{the remains of}} the castle was sold to the town of Weymouth, whose people reused some of the <b>stone</b> <b>to</b> {{construct}} their new town bridge. Local tradition in the 19th century maintained that several houses in Weymouth were also constructed using stone taken from the castle. In 1825, the carved stone Elizabethan arms of the castle were moved to All Saints Church in Wyke Regis. Captains continued to be formally appointed, however, and Gabriel Stewart held the post as late as 1795.|$|E
5|$|Charles I was a {{connoisseur}} of art, and paid {{greater attention to}} the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. Charles had the castle completely surveyed by a team including Inigo Jones in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. Nonetheless, Charles employed Nicholas <b>Stone</b> <b>to</b> improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In {{the final years of}} peace, Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward, intending to replace it with a classical statue.|$|E
