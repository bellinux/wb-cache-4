50|$|Pso o 1 {{is found}} in the gut and fecal pellets of the sheep <b>scab</b> <b>mite</b> Psoroptes ovis. Psoroptic mange in sheep is {{promoted}} by the cysteine protease activity of Pso o 1, which targets connective tissues and the molecules of the extracellular matrix. Although Psoroptes belongs to a different order from the house dust mite species, Pso o 1 is classified as a group 1 mite allergen alongside Der p 1, Der f 1, and Eur m 1.|$|E
50|$|The {{various forms}} of {{peptidase}} 1 pertaining to individual mite species comprise the group 1 mite allergens. Following the naming conventions of allergens, these peptidase 1 variants include Der p 1 of the European house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; Der f 1 of the American house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae; Eur m 1 of the Mayne's house dust mite Euroglyphus maynei; and Pso o 1 of the sheep <b>scab</b> <b>mite</b> Psoroptes ovis. The group 1 mite allergens, especially Der p 1 and Der f 1, are major sources of house dust mite (HDM) allergies in temperate climates.|$|E
5000|$|Sarcoptes is a genus of skin parasites, {{and part}} of the larger family of mites collectively known as [...] "scab mites". They are also related to the <b>scab</b> <b>mite</b> Psoroptes, also a mite that infests the skin of {{domestic}} animals. Sarcoptic mange affects domestic animals and similar infestations in domestic fowls causes the disease known as [...] "scaly leg". The effects of S. scabiei are the most well-known, causing [...] "scabies", or [...] "the itch". The adult female mite, having been fertilized, burrows into the skin (usually at the hands or wrists, but {{other parts of the body}} may also be affected), and lays its eggs.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, Italian {{biologist}} Diacinto Cestoni (1637–1718) {{described the}} mite now called Sarcoptes scabiei, variety hominis, {{as the cause}} of scabies. Sarcoptes is a genus of skin parasites and part of the larger family of mites collectively known as <b>scab</b> <b>mites.</b> These organisms have eight legs as adults, and are placed in the same phylogenetic class (Arachnida) as spiders and ticks.|$|R

40|$|Among {{arthropod}} pests, mites {{are responsible}} for considerable damage to crops, humans and other animals. However, detailed physiological data on these organisms remain sparse, mainly because of their small size but possibly also because of their extreme diversity. Focusing on intestinal proteases, we draw together information from three distinct mite species that all feed on skin but have separately adapted to a free-living, a strictly ecto-parasitic and a parasitic lifestyle. A wide range of studies involving immunohistology, molecular biology, X-ray crystallography and enzyme biochemistry of mite gut proteases suggests that these creatures have diverged considerably as house dust <b>mites,</b> sheep <b>scab</b> <b>mites</b> and scabies mites. Each species has evolved a particular variation of a presumably ancestral repertoire of digestive enzymes that have become specifically adapted to their individual environmental requirements...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Despite {{multiple}} {{attempts at}} eradication, many ectoparasites {{of humans and}} domestic livestock remain a persistent problem in the modern world. For many years, a range of pesticide drugs including organophosphates, organochlorides and synthetic pyrethroids provided effective control of these parasites; but intensive use of these drugs {{has led to the}} evolution of resistance in many target species. This paper aims to review the effectiveness of current control methods and discuss potential alternatives for the long term sustainable control of ectoparasites. Key Findings: Important medical ectoparasites such as scabies mites, head lice and bed bugs present a significant public health problem, and so adequate control methods are essential. Ectoparasites of domestic livestock and farmed fish (for example sheep <b>scab</b> <b>mites,</b> poultry mites and sea lice) are also of concern given the increasing strain on the world's food supply. These parasites have become resistant to several classes of pesticide, making control very difficult. Recently, an increasing amount of research has focussed on alternative control methods such as insect growth regulators, biological control using essential oils or fungi, as well as vaccine development against some ectoparasites of medical and veterinary importance. Summary: Drug resistance is prevalent in all of the ectoparasites discussed in this review. A wide variety of alternative control methods have been identified, however further research is necessary in order for these to be used to successfully control ectoparasitic diseases in the future...|$|R
40|$|Successful crop {{breeding}} program incorporating agronomic {{and consumer}} preferred traits {{can be achieved}} by recognizing the existence and degree of variability among sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas, (L.) Lam.) genotypes. Understanding genetic variability, genotypic and phenotypic correlation and inheritance among agronomic traits is fundamental to improvement of any crop. The study was carried out with the objective to estimate the genotypic variability and other yield related traits of highlands sweetpotato in Papua New Guinea in a polycross population. A total of 8 genotypes of sweetpotato derived from the polycross were considered in two cycles of replicated field experiments. Analysis of Variance was computed to contrast the variability within the selected genotypes based on high yielding β-carotene rich orange-fleshed sweetpotato. The results revealed significant differences among the genotypes. Genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV %) was lower than phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV %) for all traits studied. Relatively high genetic variance, along with high heritability and expected genetic advances were observed in NMTN and ABYield. Harvest index (HI), <b>scab</b> and gall <b>mite</b> damage scores had heritability of 67 %, 66 % and 37 % respectively. Marketable tuber yield (MTYield) and total tuber yield (TTYield) had lower genetic variance, low heritability and low genetic advance. There is need to investigate correlated inheritance among these traits. Selecting directly for yield improvement in polycross population may not be very efficient as indicated by the results. Therefore, it can be conclude that th...|$|R
40|$|The sheep <b>scab</b> <b>mite,</b> Psoroptes ovis, induces an {{intensely}} pruritic exudative dermatitis {{which is responsible}} for restlessness, loss of appetite and weight loss. Within the first 24 h of infection, there is a rapid inflammatory influx of eosinophils and apoptosis of the keratinocytes at the site of infection. The former cell type is capable of a sustained respiratory burst, toxic products of which may directly damage the mite and also contribute to lesion formation. Analysis of a P. ovis expressed sequence tag (EST) database identified a number of antioxidant enzyme-encoding sequences, including peroxiredoxin (thioredoxin peroxidase EC 1. 11. 1. 15), all of which may help the mite endure the potentially toxic skin environment. A full length sequence encoding Po-TPx, a protein of 206 amino acids which showed high homology to a peroxiredoxin from the salivary gland of the tick Ixodes scapularis, was amplified from P. ovis cDNA. Recombinant Po-TPx was expressed in bacteria and antiserum to this protein was used to localize native Po-TPx in mite sections. Peroxiredoxin was localized, amongst other sites, to a subpharyngeal region in mite sections. The recombinant protein was recognized by sera from sheep infested with the mite suggesting that it may be secreted or excreted by the mite and interact with the host immune response...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractThe sheep <b>scab</b> <b>mite,</b> Psoroptes ovis, is a {{major problem}} in the beef cattle industry, {{especially}} in Belgian Blue (BB) cattle. This breed is naturally more predisposed to psoroptic mange but reasons for this high susceptibility remain unknown. Different immune responses could be a potential cause; thus in this study, the cutaneous immune response and in vitro cellular immune response after antigen re-stimulation were examined in naturally infested BB. Cytokine production in the skin and in circulating re-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) demonstrated a mixed pro-inflammatory Th 2 /Th 17 profile, with transcription of IL- 4, IL- 13, IL- 6 and IL- 17. Strong IL- 17 up-regulation in the skin of BB was associated with an influx of eosinophils and other immune cells, potentially leading towards more severe symptoms. Virtually no changes in cutaneous IFN-γ transcription were detected, while there was substantial IFN-γ up-regulation in re-stimulated PBMC from infested and uninfested animals, potentially indicating a role of this pro-inflammatory cytokine in the innate immune response. In Holstein–Friesian (HF) cattle, generally more resistant to P. ovis infection, a largely similar immunologic response was observed. Differences between HF and BB were the lack of cutaneous IL- 17 response in infested HF and low transcription levels of IFN-γ and high IL- 10 transcription in re-stimulated PBMC from both infested and uninfested animals. Further research is needed to identify potential cell sources and biological functions for these cytokines and to fully unravel the basis of this different breed susceptibility to P. ovis...|$|E
40|$|Five Merino {{and five}} Dorper sheep were artificially infested with the sheep <b>scab</b> <b>mite</b> Psoroptes ovis {{and the effect}} of {{infestation}} on their haematology, serum protein levels and live mass recorded for a period of 14 weeks. The reaction of the Merino sheep to infestation was more severe than that of the Dorper sheep. Haematological values fluctuated within the normal range during the assessment period. The mean haemoglobin concentration of the Merino sheep declined until antiparasitic treatment was administered 10 weeks after infestation, after which it gradually increased. The lymphocyte counts of both breeds of sheep declined from 2 weeks to 10 weeks post-infestation, but increased after treatment, while the highest eosinophil counts were recorded in the Merino sheep {{at the height of the}} acute disease 8 - 10 weeks post-infestation. Serum albumin values for both breeds and serum globulin values for the Merino sheep were higher than normal during the entire 14 -week observation period. A decrease in serum albumin and an increase in serum globulin concentration occurred at the height of infestation in both breeds. The mean live mass of a second group of five infested Merino sheep decreased by 6. 4 kg over a 16 -week period compared to a gain of 4. 56 kg for five infested Dorper sheep.

40|$|These {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the possible role of {{certain aspects of the}} on-host ecology and off-host survival of the sheep <b>scab</b> <b>mite,</b> Psoroptes ovis, in the dissemination of infestation. All developmental stages of the mite occurred in the fleece both proximally or distal to the skin of infested Merino and Dorper sheep. A larger proportion of mites was present in the fleece of Dorper sheep distal to the skin in the late afternoon and early morning than at other times during the day. Immature and adult mites readily transferred to tufts of wool or hair placed on infested sheep of both breeds. No mites could be found on wool or hair rubbed off onto tree trunks or branches or other structures in enclosures housing heavily infested sheep, nor could any mites be collected from the soil of these enclosures, whereas more than 80 % of mites artificially seeded onto soil samples were recovered. The longest mean off-host survival times for larvae, nymphs, and male and ovigerous female mites were recorded at 10 ºC, and were 9. 25 days (RH= 90 %), 15 days (RH= 33 % and 75 %), 10. 5 days (RH= 75 % and 90 %) and 11. 25 days (RH= 90 %) respectively. Under natural climatic conditions ovigerous females in glass vials containing Merino wool survived for 17 days compared to 15 days for females in vials without wool; this difference was, however, not significant. The mean off-host pre-hatch period for eggs varied between 5. 9 days (T= 25 ºC and RH= 33 %) and 22. 1 days (T= 10 ºC and RH= 75 %), while the longest time individual eggs took to hatch at the latter temperature and RH was 31 days.
