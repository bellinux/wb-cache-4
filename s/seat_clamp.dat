40|$|AbstractAcceleration {{and strain}} {{responses}} of a BMX bicycle in common cycling situations {{and in a}} race simulation are investigated. A comprehensive set of data is acquired by a specifically developed measurement and analysis system. The data-acquisition and signal conditioning device is run by customised application software enabling a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz for simultaneous acquisition of 28 measurement channels; 24 channels for strain and 4 channels for acceleration. Comprehensive results of strains and accelerations are presented, with strains being measured on fork, handlebar, top tube, down tube, seat stays and chain stays and accelerations being obtained at both dropouts, the stem and the <b>seat</b> <b>clamp.</b> The data provides quantitative results on strain levels throughout the frame, and in local regions where failure is known to occur. Accelerations from - 25 g to 43 g and magnitudes of strain of up to 2750 μe are obtained. An estimate of maximum stress of 190 MPa generated within the frame is calculated. Shear strains which are up to 84 % higher than were obtained in static tests are generated in race simulations. The paper provides significant insight into {{the complexity of the}} dynamic loads a BMX bicycle – rider system is subjected to, providing the basis for future optimisations of BMX bicycle frames...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{gas valve}} using a microstructured silicon valve lid and a {{stainless}} steel valve <b>seat</b> <b>clamped</b> axially together in an aluminum cylinder is investigated. The difference in {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of these components makes the valve open and close on a temperature change. A simple model accounting for elastic deformation of the system’s components is proposed to facilitate design of the valve. By means of a helium leak detector, a typical increase in flow rate from 1. 0 × 10 − 8 to  1. 0 × 10 − 4 sccs gaseous helium under a pressure of up to 10  bars was observed upon the increase of temperature from 12 to around 98 [*]°C, after a single breaking-in. Plastic deformation of the valve seat as a consequence of an imprint of the microstructured valve lid and contaminating particles was studied. Microscopy confirmed a tolerance for particles of up to a few micrometers in diameter. Larger particles were found to be a possible cause of failure...|$|R

The WindWrap line of fairings has been expanded and improved upon, and is now available in Europe. WindWrap founder, Mark Mueller, said of the move: [...] "I am proud that Windwrap fairings are in use around the world. Now its time someone who can make these an even better product to take things from here. We've been working with TerraCycle for years and believe they {{will be a great}} company for this."

5000|$|The {{part that}} connects the rails to the seat post {{is known as the}} [...] "saddle clamp". It may be built into the top of the seat post, or the seat post may be {{essentially}} a pipe that provides a cylinder at the top (often ⅞ in / 22.2 mm) for a separate clamp to attach. The upper attachment point must be compatible with the rail configuration (though the two-rail 7 mm round configuration is very common), and the lower attachment point must match the diameter of the seat post if not built in. The shape of some unusual saddles also makes them physically incompatible with certain <b>seat</b> posts, <b>clamps,</b> or frames, due to bumping into other parts or blocking adjustment or attachment bolts.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006 Hicks {{discovered}} beach cruiser bike {{riding on}} Venice Beach while in Los Angeles {{on a business}} trip. After renting a beach cruiser for a scheduled one-hour ride, he brought the rental back 6 hours later and was hooked; relishing the simplicity, comfort and style of the bike {{and the fact that}} you could wear street clothes and look stylish riding. Two years later, Villy Custom was founded in 2008 and began as a brick and mortar retail store (selected by Daily Candy as “Sweetest Things” 2009) [...] specializing in sales of Felt Cruisers, Hawk Classic Cruiser bikes, specialty accessories and apparel. After experimenting with minor bike customization, Hicks soon realized he could infuse fashion, texture and unique color combinations to create a customizable luxury fashion bicycle company. The Icon of the Brand is the owner’s Bullmastiff dog, named DeVille. The Brand is known for its unexpected product features, such as powder coated handlebars, neck stems, seat post, <b>seat</b> post <b>clamps,</b> fender braces, <b>seat</b> hardware, and wheels in a multitude of colors.|$|R
30|$|It {{is helpful}} to insert the most distal pin of the {{proximal}} clamp first (Fig.  2). This can be done without the need of the template or rail but using X-ray {{as a guide to}} ensure central placement across the diameter of the bone and at right angles to the anatomical axis. I have found it useful to use the lesser trochanter as a landmark; insert this pin just distal to the ‘equator’ of the profile of the lesser trochanter. This location will ensure there is sufficient space for subsequent placement of another two pins in the proximal clamp in the third and fifth <b>seats</b> of the <b>clamp.</b>|$|R
25|$|In July 1995, the facelifted {{model was}} {{launched}} in Australia, although this differed to the update applied to the North American variants. The update brought a new grille, slight updates to the rear end, new hubcaps, a lighter interior colour scheme with a new range of fabrics, and the discontinuation of the Ultima trim. Equipment wise, a new security system was fitted with remote central locking, engine immobiliser and alarm. The CSi gained four-wheel disc brakes, and optional anti-lock brakes. <b>Seat</b> belt webbing <b>clamps</b> for the front seats were now fitted as was a lap-sash belt in the centre rear. Climate control air-conditioning for the CS-X, an improved stereo system, {{and the addition of}} cup holders also featured.|$|R
5000|$|Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-times {{gave it a}} zero stars rating, saying, [...] "It is a {{film with}} one clear purpose: To {{establish}} the commercial credentials of its director by showing his skill at depicting the brutal tracking, torture and mutilation of screaming young women ... I wanted {{to walk out of}} the theatre and ... keep on walking". The Seattle Times film critic Moira Macdonald said that Wolf Creek was the first film she ever walked out on. She called watching the film [...] "punishment" [...] and wondered how someone's real death inspired this [...] "entertainment". The Independent praised its departure from the generic rules of the horror film genre. Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw awarded it 4/5 stars. Time Out said [...] "by making us feel the pain, Greg McLean's ferocious, taboo-breaking film tells us so much more about how and why we watch horror movies". They admitted, however, that the film was not for everyone. The film magazines Empire and Total Film gave the film 4/5 stars, with Empire calling it [...] "a grimy gut-chiller that unsettles as much as it thrills, violently shunting you to the edge of your <b>seat</b> before <b>clamping</b> onto your memory like a rusty mantrap". Fangoria called it the scariest film of the year.|$|R
50|$|The Gyroxus {{comes out}} of the box {{assembled}} except for attaching the backrest, which simply slides into place, and the footrest, which is held in place with two bolts and knobs on each side. There is also a footrest, four feet in length, to give the Gyroxus a wider footprint and greater stability. The control arm is held in place by a bicycle <b>seat</b> style quick-release <b>clamp,</b> and is adjustable forward and backward in the bracket to accommodate for differing playing styles, or different sized people. The hand controller is also held onto the control arm in the same manner and is also adjustable. The backrest slides into one of the six slots {{at the rear of the}} seat. This adjustment allows for people of different sizes and weight distributions to find their center of gravity in the Gyroxus.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of three continence management devices and absorbent pads used by men with persistent urinary incontinence (> 1 year) after treatment for prostate cancer. Patients and Methods Randomised, controlled trial of 56 men with 1 -year follow-up. Three devices were tested for 3 weeks each: sheath drainage system, body-worn urinal (BWU) and penile clamp. Device and pad performance were assessed. Quality of life (QoL) was measured at baseline and follow-up with the King's Health Questionnaire. Stated (intended use) and revealed (actual use) preference for products were assessed. Value-for-money was gathered. Results Substantial and significant differences in performance were found. The sheath was rated as ‘good’ for extended use (e. g. golf and travel) when pad changing is difficult; for keeping skin dry, not leaking, not smelling and convenient for storage and travel. The BWU was generally rated worse than the sheath and was mainly used for similar activities but by men who could not use a sheath (e. g. retracted penis) and was not good for <b>seated</b> activities. The <b>clamp</b> was good for short vigorous activities like swimming/exercise; {{it was the most}} secure, least likely to leak, most discreet but almost all men described it as uncomfortable or painful. The pads were good for everyday activities and best for night-time use; most easy to use, comfortable when dry but most likely to leak and most uncomfortable when wet. There was a preference for having a mixture of products to meet daytime needs; around two-thirds of men were using a combination of pads and devices after testing compared with baseline. Conclusions This is the first trial to systematically compare different continence management devices for men. Pads and devices have different strengths, which make them particularly suited to certain circumstances and activities. Most men prefer to use pads at night but would choose a mixture of pads and devices during the day. Device limitations were important but may be overcome by better design...|$|R
40|$|Since {{more and}} more {{products}} are custom made the manufacturers are facing increasing demands requiring both time and cost efficiency. With conventional manufacturing methods it is often costly to produce custom made products in low volumes due to large initial onetime costs for machines, setup etcetera. Today {{it is possible to}} produce real, working products in metal materials with additive techniques such as laser sintering. Small grains of metal are melted or sintered together using a thin laser beam, creating precise geometries directly from a CAD-file. This thesis work was carried out at the CTSP department at Sandvik Coromant in Sandviken. The purpose is to show what kind of functional and design improvements can be achieved with the manufacturing technique as well as what limitations it implies. This is to be made by exemplifying a redevelopment of a Corocut insert holder for grooving operations. The aim is to successfully produce a functional insert holder conformal to the limitations of additive manufacturing. An analysis of the design process when designing for additive manufacturing should also be generated. The redeveloped insert holder had a decreased volume and a more slimmed design. Instead of a cooling channel with a diameter of 3 mm two channels with a diameter of 2 mm and 1 mm was added. The acute angles could be eliminated by using additive manufacturing, creating a better flow of the cutting fluid. The hinge was moved and more chip space could be generated. The insert holder was laser sintered in a machine from Concept laser. The additive process was made on top of a Capto coupling which had been sent to the manufacturer. Operations to create the insert <b>seat</b> and the <b>clamping</b> were made afterwards. Testes showed a well functional insert holder for grooving with a very gathered fluid jet from the 1 mm cooling channel and good chip breaks. The manufacturing technique is applicable for Sandvik Coromant products, although the exact product areas need to be analysed. Examples of potential areas are for products with high demands on the cooling channels, spare parts, or areas where having different materials in the same geometry can be an advantage. The manufacturing technique is most suited for custom made (special) products, though the profit opportunities have not been analysed. Although, manufacturing products with additive techniques give a lot of freedom to the designers and make it possible to produce products that have not been possible before. Unique design and functions in a product may very well compensate for the higher price the customer has to pay. Validerat; 20110124 (anonymous...|$|R
