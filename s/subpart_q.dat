50|$|Despite their {{importance}} for aviation safety, European flight time rules {{did not exist}} until recently. It is only since July 2008, that EU Member States must respect the “EU-OPS” Regulation’s <b>Subpart</b> <b>Q</b> (in Annex III) that regulates Flight Time Limitations (FTL) for air crew.|$|E
50|$|Also, <b>Subpart</b> <b>Q</b> {{does not}} cover key FTL aspects that are crucial for flight safety, such as “split duty”, {{augmented}} crew on long-haul flights, some forms of standby, etc. These areas are currently left to the national legislator, leading to different national legal provisions across Europe.|$|E
50|$|The code {{specifies}} {{who must}} be notified and {{the manner of the}} notification. One such provision is Subpart O, Consumer Confidence Reports. These reports are a summary of the water supplies sources and water quality testing results. The reports must be sent to all customers annually. <b>Subpart</b> <b>Q</b> regulates how violations must be reported.|$|E
40|$|Facilities owned or {{operated}} by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) handle and process radioactive materials in conjunction with their research, nuclear materials production, remediation, and waste disposal activities. During normal operations, some of these facilities {{have the potential to}} release small quantities of radionuclides to the environment. Radionuclide emissions to the atmosphere from DOE facilities are regulated by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the authority of Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. Subpart H of 40 CFR Part 61 of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) sets standards for public exposure to airborne radioactive materials (other than radon) released by DOE facilities, DOE radon emissions are regulated by NESHAPs in <b>Subparts</b> <b>Q</b> and T. <b>Subparts</b> <b>Q</b> and T apply specifically to DOE storage and disposal facilities for radium-containing material. Airborne radionuclide emissions are also regulated by the Department of Energy under the authority provided by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, as amended. This report summarizes air emissions subject to the EPA requirements and demonstrates that DOE facilities are in compliance with the required dose limits...|$|R
50|$|With this EU-OPS <b>Subpart</b> <b>Q,</b> the EU introduced, for {{the first}} time in history, a harmonized, legally binding minimum set of FTL safety rules aimed at {{preventing}} pilot fatigue across Europe. While individual EU countries can apply stricter FTL rules at national level, they are not allowed to go below the minimum set by EU-OPS, unless they apply for a specific derogation.|$|E
50|$|While {{setting a}} minimum safety level, <b>Subpart</b> <b>Q</b> {{is by no}} means ideal. Its main {{weakness}} is that it has never been subject to a scientific and medical evaluation. Hence, Subpart Q’s provisions are not based on sound scientific evidence as to their ability to prevent pilot fatigue. This is a major weakness, as it means that today’s rules do not ensure passengers can enjoy highest, scientifically supported safety levels when boarding a European airplane.|$|E
