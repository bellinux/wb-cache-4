5|$|The loss {{of teeth}} with age in Limusaurus {{is the most}} extreme case of tooth {{morphology}} changing with age among dinosaurs. In fact, Limusaurus {{is one of the}} only known jawed vertebrates where teeth are completely lost during ontogeny (the others are the red mullet and <b>striped</b> <b>red</b> <b>mullet,</b> several armored catfish, and the platypus). Its complicated pattern of losing teeth from both the front and the back is most {{similar to that of the}} avialan Jeholornis. The temporary halt in tooth replacement likely results from the replacement tooth buds regressing, as in the veiled chameleon. Combined with the retention of the developmental signal pathways necessary to induce tooth development in birds, the ontogenetic replacement of teeth by a beak in Limusaurus suggests that the development of beaks in other lineages of theropods, and indeed beaked animals in general, may be related to developmental changes that heterochronically alter the point at which tooth development halts.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{identifying}} the food web of the <b>red</b> <b>mullet,</b> Mullus barbatus {{in order to understand}} how it is affected by trawling disturbance. To achieve this objective: a) the main features of the <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> habitat were investigated; b) the food web of this habitat was studied in two no-trawl areas and in two areas open to trawling. The working hypothesis is that trawling affects the biochemistry of the sediment and the trophic structure of the benthic assemblage. It was predicted: a) less biomass, smaller size and higher production rate in the benthic assemblages of protected gulfs; b) higher average trophic level for both the <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> and its predators in protected gulfs; c) a diet shift driven by the mechanical disturbance of trawling. The results achieved confirmed our hypotheses and allowed us to characterize {{for the first time the}} trophic web structure in the <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> habitat in the study area. Results also allowed us to compare the trophic level of <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> of different sizes using two independent techniques, stable isotopes of nitrogen and gut contents. The average trophic level of the <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> was higher and the energy consumption per unit of biomass larger in the protected gulfs.

Since 2012, ICES has provided recommendations with regards to this stock. These recommendations are given for two years and are based on an approach adopted by ICES in 2012 in the case of insufficient data for an analytical evaluation (Data Limited Stocks, DLS). For 2013 and 2014, ICES advice consisted in a 20 % reduction in catches (average of the last 3 years:- 2009 - 2011) as a precautionary measure. Since that, no new advice has been formulated, the advice remains the same. Considering the impacts of such measurements on the French fishing fleet, improvement of the data available for stocks in the DLS category is therefore a priority.

40|$|Predicting the {{occurrence}} of economically important demersal fish in a multispecies marine environment can be of considerable value to fisheries management and protection of biodiversity. Here, 2 predictive modelling principles were utilised, artificial neural network (ANN) and discriminant function analysis (DFA), to develop presence/absence models for 3 species (anglerfish Lophius budegassa; hake Merluccius merluccius; <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> Mullus barbatus) in the Mediterranean Sea. ANN-based models of demersal fish distribution outperformed conventional models and attained better recognition and prediction performance. Results indicated the ability of ANN's to predict presence more accurately than DFA when tested against independent field data. More precisely, sensitivity values obtained using DFA were 62. 1 % for anglerfish, 5. 8 % for hake and 59. 8 % for <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> whereas using ANN were 75, 71 and 72. 9 % respectively. The accuracy of test data was 79. 6 % for anglerfish, 49. 5 % for hake and 83. 3 % for <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> using DFA and 83. 7, 83. 3 and 85. 6 % respectively using a back-propagation ANN.

40|$|International audienceStock {{identification}} is of primary importance for population structure assessment of economically important species. This study investigates stocks of <b>striped</b> <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> using three automatic methods of stock identification based on otolith shape and growth marks. Otolith shape {{is known to}} be a promising approach for stock identification but interpreting patterns of variance is a difficult problem. In this study, images in reflected and transmitted light were acquired from 800 otoliths sampled in the Northwest European seas from South Bay of Biscay to North Sea. The growth marks are pointed out manually by an expert. The external shape of otoliths was automatically extracted by computer vision process and then three automatic classification methods were compared, two classical state-of-the-art methods based on Fourier descriptors and principal component analysis (PCA), and a recently proposed method based on shape Geodesics. From a methodological point of view, results show that the shape geodesic approach significantly outperforms other classical methods. From a biological point of view, this study shows that the population of <b>striped</b> <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> in Northwest European seas can be divided in three geographical zones: the Bay of Biscay, a mixing zone composed of the Celtic Sea and the Western English Channel and a northern zone composed of the Eastern English Channel and the North Sea (67 % of correct classification rate using both shape and growth pattern information).

Since the abundance and biomass of polychaetes, which represent the main food source for <b>red</b> <b>mullet,</b> were found to be lower in trawled zones than in unfished ones, we suggest that differences in the muscle lipid levels between areas might be attributed to variation in prey abundance in relation to fishing impact.

Both have been reported to be overexploited and in need of management to preserve the continuity of their exploitation. Hake is exploited by trawlers and <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> by both trawlers and beach seiners in Saronikos Gulf (Greece). The MEFISTO bioeconomic simulation model is applied in order to test the interaction between trawlers and beach seiners through the age-specific fishing mortality applied by each fleet to the <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> stock. The effects of the withdrawal of some beach seiners in 2002 and the increase in trawl mesh size that has already been implemented (from 28 mm to 40 mm stretched mesh) are tested jointly with alternative management scenarios such as the complete withdrawal of beach seiners and effort reduction in trawler activity. The analysis of the simulation results is based on the evolution of biological and economic indicators through 15 -year stochastic projections. It is shown that limiting fishing effort and improving selectivity patterns of the trawl fleet would be beneficial for the recovery of the populations and for the profitability of the fishery. In addition to the increase in trawl mesh size, a further fishing effort reduction of 12 % is recommended for the trawling fleet. Conversely, limiting or completely removing the beach seiner fleet would protect <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> juveniles but would not significantly increase the profitability of the trawling fleet, and it would cause unemployment...|$|R
