40|$|To improve speech quality, {{disturbing}} {{background noise}} and acoustic echo are attenuated by using signal processing tech-niques prior to speech encoding. A different approach consists of embedding and performing noise reduction and/or echo can-cellation into the speech codec. This embedding decreases {{the complexity and}} allows integration of noise reduction and echo cancellation in the network without adding any delay or creating the so-called tandem effect. In this {{paper we propose a}} solution based on this principle. We introduce an innovative estimation of the <b>signal</b> to <b>echo</b> <b>ratio</b> based on a linear model of the fixed gain parameters of the speech codec.

A signal generator generates an exciting tone burst and subsequent tone bursts delayed in phase from the exciting tone burst.
