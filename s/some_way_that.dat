5|$|In 1902 an American {{newspaper}} {{published the}} allegation that Lord Arthur Somerset, having learned in <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance, and {{that he may have}} been identified as a visitor, he contrived to bring the Prince to the house on an innocent pretext {{in the hope that the}} police, seeing him cross the threshold, would be afraid to take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the Prince's fondness for buhl furniture: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which was in the house, and that the Prince remained there no more than five minutes.|$|E
25|$|Llywelyn {{was born}} about 1173, {{the son of}} Iorwerth ap Owain and the {{grandson}} of Owain Gwynedd, who had been ruler of Gwynedd {{until his death in}} 1170. Llywelyn was a descendant of the senior line of Rhodri Mawr and therefore a member of the princely house of Gwynedd. He was probably born at Dolwyddelan, though not in the present Dolwyddelan castle, which was built by Llywelyn himself. He may have been born in the old castle which occupied a rocky knoll on the valley floor. Little is known about his father, Iorwerth Drwyndwn, who died when Llywelyn was an infant. There is no record of Iorwerth having taken part in the power struggle between some of Owain Gwynedd's other sons following Owain's death, although he was the eldest surviving son. There is a tradition that he was disabled or disfigured in <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> excluded him from power.|$|E
500|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that the doctrine descends from Roman law. The Corpus Juris Civilis mentions a process that redirected money collected to celebrate a person's life in <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> violated law to a purpose within the law. It also gives a similar justification: [...] "t would be unjust that the amount which [...] has destined to that end should revert to the heirs. Therefore, let ... an investigation be made to ascertain how the trust may be employed so that the memory of the deceased may be preserved in some other and lawful manner." [...] The Byzantine Empire used a system similar to cy-près when dealing with piae causae, charitable corporations, whereby if the corporation fell its possessions were to be transferred to the Papal treasury and spent on a purpose {{as close as possible to}} that of the original corporation.|$|E

500|$|The episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] {{introduces}} the Kree alien {{race to the}} MCU, members of which {{play a significant role}} in Guardians of the Galaxy. This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying that it was something [...] "in the works" [...] for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be [...] "one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film." [...] The third season {{introduces the}} concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the [...] "writer and director [...] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> our Inhumans connect to that." [...] When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans. Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017. It is not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

2500|$|Back at the school, Dr. Harris {{successfully}} {{removes the}} harness from Mike's son, {{with the help}} of Anne, Dai and Lourdes. [...] Harris explains that he figured out why children always died in previous attempts to remove the harnesses: [...] they synthesize some sort of drug into the body, stimulating the brain's nerve receptors in <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> facilitates mind-control. [...] Whatever this drug is, suddenly being separated from it made children die of shock. [...] Harris theorized that while they didn't know exactly what the drug was, it must have vaguely similar effects as other drugs that stimulate the cognitive centers of the brain, such as morphine. [...] Injecting a child with a large dose of morphine before removing the harness would serve as a [...] "bridge" [...] to safely transition off of the alien drug without fatally shocking the brain, after which the child could be incrementally weaned off the morphine. [...] Using this procedure, Harris and Anne are able to successfully cut the harness off Mike's son without killing him. [...] However, Harris says {{that it is impossible to}} remove the tips of the needles that have fused into the child's spine: [...] the points of the needles seem to be some sort of nanotechnology that grows into the spine the longer it is present.|$|E
