5|$|The World Cruise of 1907–1909 {{tested the}} <b>seakeeping</b> of the U.S. designs. Even the earlier designs, {{including}} the Connecticut class with their higher freeboard, carried their secondary armament {{too close to}} the waterline.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the war, the main deck six-inch guns of the Devonshire-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve <b>seakeeping</b> and the four 3-pounder guns {{displaced}} by the transfer were landed.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1915, {{the main}} deck 6-inch guns of the Monmouth-class ships {{were moved to}} the upper deck and given gun shields; their casemates were plated over to improve the ships' <b>seakeeping.</b> The 12-pounder guns {{displaced}} by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At {{some point in the}} war, three 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{displacement}} of a dreadnought was {{taken up by the}} steel plating of the armour. Designers spent much time and effort to provide the best possible protection for their ships against the various weapons they would be faced with. Only so much weight could be devoted to protection, without compromising speed, firepower or <b>seakeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Magdeburg class {{introduced}} several {{significant improvements}} over earlier designs, including {{a more effective}} bow shape that improved <b>seakeeping</b> and a cut-down quarterdeck that allowed for more efficient handling of the ships' mines. Perhaps most importantly, a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive capabilities of the new ships. They also had much more powerful turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations.|$|E
5|$|The Mississippi ships had poor <b>seakeeping</b> qualities, {{making them}} poor gunnery {{platforms}} underway in Atlantic waters. Their motion was irregular, and their low length-to-beam ratio caused excessive rolling and pitching, {{which made it}} difficult to keep the guns on target. The reduced length, significantly cut away from the aft, {{made it difficult to}} keep the ships on a consistent course, even in smoother waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} HMS Glatton was also derived {{from that of}} Cerberus, {{although}} she exchanged one turret for heavier guns and armour. She was given a deeper draught for better <b>seakeeping</b> abilities, but retained the low freeboard of the older ships to make her a smaller target, {{making it difficult to}} weather head seas in heavy weather. Nominally intended for coast defence, she was designed to attack the defences of deep-water ports like Brest and Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|Though {{considered}} to be quick-firing, the propellant for 7-inch guns was loaded in bags, making them slower than contemporary 6-inch guns. The Navy considered these to be excellent for the intended role; however, in World War I North Atlantic convoy duty, the disadvantages in <b>seakeeping</b> outweighed the utility; they were removed from battleships remaining in US service in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or <b>seakeeping</b> reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|The Yorktown class gunboats—unofficially {{considered}} third-class cruisers—were {{the product}} of a United States Navy design attempt to produce compact ships with good <b>seakeeping</b> abilities and, yet, able to carry a heavy battery. Yorktown was authorized in the 1886 fiscal year, and the contract for her construction was awarded to the William Cramp and Sons shipyard of Philadelphia. The hull for Yorktown was designed by the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair while the mechanical design was left to the Cramp yard. Yorktowns keel was laid on 14 May 1887.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Type 34-class destroyers {{began in}} 1932, around the time that Weimar Germany renounced the {{armament}} limitations of the Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships {{more powerful than the}} French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Kriegsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well-thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' <b>seakeeping</b> ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of the design, the high-pressure boilers, were an over-complicated design that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, an {{explosion}} occurred {{on one of}} the ship's pinnaces killing seven crewmen and badly injuring the future Vizeadmiral Wilhelm Starke. Further training exercises lasted until 1 July, when the I Division began a voyage into the Atlantic Ocean. This operation had political motives; Germany had only been able to send a small contingent of vessels—the protected cruiser , the coastal defense ship , and the sailing frigate —to an international naval demonstration off the Moroccan coast at the same time. The main fleet could therefore provide moral support to the demonstration by steaming to Spanish waters. Rough weather again allowed Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and her sister ships to demonstrate their excellent <b>seakeeping.</b> The fleet departed Vigo and stopped in Queenstown, Ireland. Wilhelm II, aboard his yacht Hohenzollern, attended the Cowes Regatta {{while the rest of the}} fleet stayed off the Isle of Wight.|$|E
5|$|In October 1908, the Artillery Committee met to {{make its}} {{recommendations}} to the Junta Superior. The Committee concluded the SECN and Schneider proposals were superior to the Ansaldo version, but neither had a marked advantage over the other. The following month, the Naval Construction Committee met to evaluate the proposals. It recommended the SECN design first, followed by Schneider, with Ansaldo last. The Office of the Navy Controller also evaluated the proposals in November, and advised the Junta Superior that only the SECN bid met the design requirements without any legal, administrative, or cost problems. In February 1909, the Navy requested a revised design from SECN to incorporate several alterations, including an increased freeboard to improve <b>seakeeping,</b> an increased height and length of the main belt armor, {{and the addition of}} individual rangefinders for each gun turret. SECN agreed to make the changes on 20 March, and the company received the contract on 14 April. Due to the constraints imposed by the Spanish economy, the resulting design produced the smallest dreadnought-type battleships ever built. They were also obsolescent before completion due to rapid technological changemost significantly the rise of the superdreadnought battleshipsand lengthy delays in completion of the later units of the class.|$|E
25|$|To improve <b>seakeeping</b> and airflow {{over the}} forward {{end of the}} deck, Taihōs bow was plated up to flight deck level, giving her a similar {{appearance}} to British s.|$|E
25|$|The Marion Dufresne was {{designed}} for the very severe weather conditions of the Southern Ocean. She possesses exceptional <b>seakeeping</b> behavior — allowing full performance in the very rough seas found there.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{designed}} as a minelayer but was not particularly good at it due to its slow speed, bad <b>seakeeping</b> qualities and inadequate storage space. During peacetime, Louhi or M1 was used as depot ship with its storage rooms refitted as crew quarters.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} in the war, the main deck six-inch guns of the Devonshire-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve <b>seakeeping</b> and the four 3-pounder guns {{displaced}} by the transfer were landed.|$|E
25|$|As the Finnpusku {{system is}} {{designed}} to operate independently in the severe ice conditions of the Bothnian Sea, special {{attention has been paid}} to the hull form. The spoon-shaped bow has a low stem angle to reduce icebreaking resistance and the sides of the barge are flared to prevent the combination from becoming immobilized by ice ridges and compressive ice fields. When the pusher is coupled to the barge, the deep stern notch forms a streamlined aftship with <b>seakeeping</b> characteristics similar to those of conventional ships.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 {{white paper}} {{proposed}} that an existing OCV design be sourced as a short-term {{replacement for the}} Armidale class. Procurement project SEA 1179 is undertaking several studies towards {{the replacement of the}} Armidales. A design is yet to be selected as of 2015, but the replacement OCV will be larger than the Armidales, providing improved <b>seakeeping</b> and endurance. Construction is predicted to start in 2018, with entry into service from 2022. A hull remediation program was implemented to extend the lifespans of the patrol boats to this point.|$|E
25|$|The {{design changes}} {{included}} 5-inch guns, twin mounted in weatherproof, splinter-proof turrets, the transfer aft of torpedo tubes from {{forward of the}} bridge, a high, covered bridge and an improved power plant. The new positioning of the torpedo tubes enabled the extension aft of the forecastle and thus greatly improved the ships' <b>seakeeping.</b> Two types of turret were fitted. Type A, with 40° elevation were superseded by Type B with 75° elevation, but neither were satisfactory as anti-aircraft mountings. Anti-aircraft weaponry was otherwise inadequate and it was progressively strengthened during refits, with a final count of 22 25mm (1in) guns in some vessels. The Type 93 torpedo had proved itself and was installed in this and all subsequent classes.|$|E
25|$|The ship {{arrived in}} New Zealand in 1995 {{under the name}} Sealift, and was {{commissioned}} later that year as HMNZS Charles Upham, taking the name of dual Victoria Cross winner Charles Upham. After some modification, the ship made two voyages to test her capabilities and determine what further work was required to make her fully operational. Significant problems with stability and <b>seakeeping</b> were encountered during the second voyage, and the ship was removed from service on her return. The cost of fixing the stability problems and fitting Charles Upham out for troop and vehicle transport was prohibitive, and the work was postponed. In the meantime, the ship was chartered to Spanish company Contenemar SA in 1998 and used to transport citrus fruit around the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|All {{fourteen}} vessels {{were constructed}} by Austal Ships at Henderson, Western Australia. The first vessel, , was commissioned into the RAN in June 2005, and the last, , entering service in February 2008. The Armidale-class ships are {{operated by the}} Australian Patrol Boat Group, and based in Cairns and Darwin. They are primarily tasked with border protection, fisheries patrols, and the interception of unauthorised arrivals by sea. The Armidales are longer and heavier than their Fremantle-class predecessors, with improved <b>seakeeping</b> ability and increased range, allowing them to reach Australia's offshore territories. The ships are multi-crewed, with three ship's companies available for every two vessels, allowing the patrol boats {{to spend more time}} at sea without cutting into sailors' rest or training time.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull form}} of the SA-15 class ships, a result of {{intensive}} model tests in both open water and model ice, {{is very different from}} that of conventional merchant vessels, being more akin to polar icebreakers than traditional cargo ships. The bow design puts equal emphasis on both icebreaking and <b>seakeeping</b> characteristics, meaning that in addition to good icebreaking and manoeuvring capabilities in various ice conditions the vessel must be able to operate in open water without bottom slamming or shipping of green water occurring in rough seas. The sides are flared to prevent the ship from stopping or being damaged when operating in compressive ice fields. The aft part of the hull, while a compromise between good reversing qualities in the ice and low level of propeller-induced vibrations in the stern, is also designed to prevent pieces of ice from coming in contact with the propeller. The ships are also equipped with stern notches similar to those found in icebreakers, but instead of towing other ships they are meant to be used to allow safe assistance from icebreakers in particularly difficult ice conditions.|$|E
25|$|On completion, Cerberus was {{registered}} as a merchant vessel for the voyage to Australia. For the journey, {{the sides of}} the hull were built up to the height of the breastwork and {{along the length of the}} ship, to improve <b>seakeeping.</b> She first attempted to sail from Chatham for Melbourne on 29 October 1870, but returned within days because of gale conditions, which made the ship uncontrollable. After returning to British waters, Cerberus was fitted with temporary masts so she could be rigged as a three-masted barque; this was to provide redundancy to the steam engines, and maximise her range before recoaling was required. Cerberus departed for a second time on 7 November, and despite similar conditions, was able to persevere. The ship travelled via the Suez Canal (during which she flew the flag of Victoria instead of the Red Ensign so reduced transit rates for warships could be claimed), with frequent stops to refuel wherever possible because of her ten-day bunker capacity. Her flat bottom and shallow draught meant that the monitor could roll up to 40° from the centreline in bad weather. Her ship's company nearly mutinied on several occasions.|$|E
25|$|Integrated tug barge {{systems are}} {{generally}} {{divided into three}} generations {{by the type of}} coupling. In the first generation systems the tug is connected to the barge by wires or chains. However, because the two vessels are subject to different motion responses due to their shape, displacement and position on a wave, such operation is only possible in calm sea conditions — in rough weather the tug has to disconnect from the barge and continue the journey by towing it in a traditional way. The second generation systems are designed with a deeper stern notch and improved coupling devices to allow operation in heavier seas while still permitting relative motion between the two vessels. The third generation systems such as the Finnpusku system, equipped with rigid or articulated mechanical coupling, allow operation in all sea states and even in ice conditions as the pusher-barge combination behaves hydrodynamically like a conventional ship. However, in some cases the specialized hull form of the pusher, designed to form a streamlined hull when coupled to the barge, might lead to problems with stability and <b>seakeeping</b> when the pusher is operated independently.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all modern}} Finnish icebreakers, Kontio has a {{diesel-electric}} propulsion system. It utilizes the so-called power plant principle {{in which the}} main generators provide electricity for all shipboard consumers through a common busbar. Her main generators, four 16-cylinder Wärtsilä Vasa 16V32 four-stroke medium-speed diesel engines producing 5,460kW each and driving 7,540 kVA Kymi-Strömberg alternators, are located on the upper deck beneath the helicopter platform. In addition, she has two smaller Wärtsilä 4R22/26 generators with an output of 350kW for use in ports. The uncommon location of the engine room was chosen to improve the <b>seakeeping</b> characteristics of the icebreaker by moving {{the center of gravity}} higher to calm the ship's motions in heavy weather. In addition, the maintenance of the main engines is easier as the heavy engine components can be handled with the ship's main crane and the heavy fuel oil tanks could be placed amidships to reduce the probability of an oil spill in case of grounding. , Kontio and her sister ship Otso are the only Finnish icebreakers running on heavy fuel oil which, being the cheapest fuel available, reduces operational costs of the icebreaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{accepted}} view of {{the battle}} (based on German damage descriptions) is {{that the majority of}} Sydneys personnel were killed during the battle, with the rest dying when the cruiser sank. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation used Mearns' shipwreck footage for a technical analysis of the damage to Sydney, which showed it to be consistent with German accounts. The analysis predicted that up to 70% of those aboard were killed during the battle, either directly, from wounds, or by inhaling smoke and toxic gas. Mearns estimated that once the bow was lost, the rest of the cruiser's hull would have remained afloat for, at most, two minutes, and anyone still remaining aboard would have been killed as the ship sank. The Cole Report stated that Sydneys <b>seakeeping</b> ability would have rapidly deteriorated, hampering any evacuation efforts. Open watertight doors show that some attempt to abandon ship was made. However, the presence of all but two of the ship's boats in the nearby debris field, plus indications that the davits for the two missing boats were shot away during the battle, led Mearns to believe that evacuation was attempted after the bow snapped off, but there was not enough time or seaworthy boats to do so.|$|E
25|$|The British National Antarctic Expedition {{departed}} the UK {{less than}} {{five months after the}} Discovery was launched and only a week after the ship left Dundee. This left little time for the ship to undergo sea trials and the voyage to New Zealand was also the brand new vessel's shakedown cruise. Scott's first impression of the ship was poor, considering her slow and unresponsive while the shallow hull, built with no protuberances to work well in ice, provided minimal stability. Discovery rolled heavily once in the open sea (she was recorded rolling through 94 degrees - 47 degrees either side of vertical- in the Southern Ocean) and tended 'gripe' (wander to and fro along her course). Shackleton described the ship as a bad sailer, carrying too much sail aft and not enough forward while Scott also worried that the design of the ship's hull was unsuitable for work in pack ice. But once the expedition reached the Roaring Forties the ship proved to have excellent <b>seakeeping</b> and, because she was heavy and carried relatively little sail area for her size, she could make good progress in high winds and heavy seas without having to reef. The Discovery's unusual rounded, overhanging stern (one of the main changes from the original Bloodhound design) not only provided more protection for the rudder but also prevented all but the largest following seas breaking {{over the back of the}} ship and kept the decks dry, although the stern was prone to 'slamming' into waves, making the officer's accommodation and wardroom noisy.|$|E
500|$|The B-class {{boats were}} similar in design to the {{preceding}} A class and intended for coastal patrol work. The boats had a petrol engine for surface propulsion and batteries for underwater propulsion. The design was intended to overcome the limitations of speed, endurance and <b>seakeeping</b> that affected the boats of the A class, and the boats were substantially larger than the earlier class. The B-class submarines were [...] long overall. They had a beam of [...] and a draught of [...] They displaced [...] {{on the surface and}} [...] submerged. The boats were over [...] longer, slightly wider, and displaced more than [...] more than the older boats. Their additional size increased their buoyancy and made them far less liable to unexpectedly plunge beneath the surface in bad weather. The addition of a deck casing above the hull also improved their <b>seakeeping</b> abilities.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1915, {{the main}} deck six-inch guns of the Monmouth-class ships {{were moved to}} the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve <b>seakeeping.</b> The twelve-pounder guns {{displaced}} by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At {{some point in the}} war, a pair of three-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the upper deck.|$|E
500|$|The design {{limitations}} and poor <b>seakeeping</b> tendencies {{were not as}} critical in that strategic environment and the calmer seas of the Mediterranean. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Henry Morgenthau, Sr. wrote, [...] "Those battleships immediately took their places {{as the most powerful}} vessels of the Greek Navy, and the enthusiasm of the Greeks in obtaining them was unbounded." ...|$|E
500|$|Iéna was {{designed}} {{at the request}} of the Board of Construction (...) to follow the Charlemagne-class ships, whose <b>seakeeping</b> qualities were not entirely satisfactory. But Constructor Thibaudier just modified the Charlemagnes design with a heavier secondary battery and thicker armour, distributed in a slightly different manner. This increased her displacement by [...] in comparison to the older ships and she retained the pronounced tumblehome that was the cause of the stability problems.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the Royal Sovereign-class ships was derived {{from that of the}} [...] battleships, greatly {{enlarged}} to improve <b>seakeeping</b> and to provide space for a secondary armament as in the preceding [...] battleships. The ships displaced [...] at normal load and [...] at deep load. They had a length between perpendiculars of [...] and an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of [...] Their crew consisted of 670 officers and ratings.|$|E
500|$|The Kaiser Max-class {{ships were}} [...] long between perpendiculars; {{they had a}} beam of [...] and an average draft of [...] They {{displaced}} [...] Wooden hulled vessels, they proved to be very wet forward and had to have their bows rebuilt in 1867. Each ship originally had a bow figurehead, which was removed during the reconstruction. They were also very unstable ships, pitching badly and having very bad <b>seakeeping.</b> The ships had a crew of 386.|$|E

500|$|They {{were the}} last class of scout cruisers built for the Royal Navy as they were too slow to lead {{destroyer}}s in battle or to defend the fleet against enemy destroyer attacks. The Active class was a slightly improved version of the previous [...] scouts, with the main visible difference being the new 'plough' bow changed to improve their <b>seakeeping</b> abilities. Two of the three were ordered under the 1910–1911 Naval Programme and the last in the following naval programme.|$|E
