The project involved extensive work on the cantilever span and its approaches that included replacing the bridge's structural steel, rebuilding the piers that support the structure, and reconstructing the bridge deck. Because {{the city of}} Chicago required the Skyway to remain open during construction, engineers had to construct temporary bridge piers that would bear the load of the bridge and its traffic while new piers were built. The bridge was lifted up onto the temporary piers using 600 ton hydraulic jacks, the old piers were removed, and new ones were built. Crews also devised innovative methods for replacing the bridge's structural steel, replacing steel members one at a time. This process involved installing hydraulic chords around the component to be replaced. The bridge load was then transferred to the hydraulic chord, the <b>steel</b> <b>member</b> was removed and a new <b>steel</b> <b>member</b> was then installed.|$|E

In the analysis, the temperature increase of <b>steel</b> <b>members</b> for the columns (perimeter and core columns) and the floor trusses of the World Trade Center, when subjected to heating by hydrocarbon fire and standard fire, was calculated in case the <b>steel</b> <b>members</b> were adequately fire-protected and in case they were not fire-protected (or in case the fire protection was blown off). The fire resistance of these <b>steel</b> <b>members</b> was also verified by thermal deformation analysis. The analysis revealed that, compared with the columns (core columns) of heavy sections, the floor trusses composed of light-gauge <b>steel</b> <b>members,</b> even if fire-protected or not, experienced a temperature increase at a more rapid pace, that the increase in steel temperature posed restraint on thermal deformation, thereby causing the <b>steel</b> <b>members</b> to buckle and leading eventually to the failure of the floor trusses at a relatively low temperature, and that a larger restraint acted on the end connections. Based on the findings, this paper advances the following three suggestions: (i) Elaborate care should be exercised in using light-gauge <b>steel</b> <b>members</b> for skyscrapers.

50|$|Steel loses {{strength}} when heated sufficiently. The {{critical temperature}} of a <b>steel</b> <b>member</b> is the temperature {{at which it}} cannot safely support its load. Building codes and structural engineering standard practice defines different critical temperatures depending on the structural element type, configuration, orientation, and loading characteristics. The critical temperature is often considered the temperature at which its yield stress {{has been reduced to}} 60% of the room temperature yield stress. In order to determine the fire resistance rating of a <b>steel</b> <b>member,</b> accepted calculations practice can be used, or a fire test can be performed, the critical temperature of which is set by the standard accepted to the Authority Having Jurisdiction, such as a building code. In Japan, this is below 400 °C. In China, Europe and North America (e.g., ASTM E-119), this is approximately 1000-1300 °F (530-810 °C). The time it takes for the steel element that is being tested to reach the temperature set by the test standard determines the duration of the fire-resistance rating.Heat transfer to the steel can be slowed by the use of fireproofing materials, thus limiting steel temperature. Common fireproofing methods for structural steel include intumescent, endothermic, and plaster coatings as well as drywall, calcium silicate cladding, and mineral wool insulating blankets.|$|E
