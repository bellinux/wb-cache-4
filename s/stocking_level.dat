With seeding, foresters have control of genetic make up of the species and the source of the seed. Natural regeneration may be obtained because of the high numbers of annual seed crops (100,000-1 million/acre). Where annual seed production is low western red cedar can be direct seeded in the fall if the soil moisture is adequate. High numbers of seeds will be needed to reach desired <b>stocking</b> <b>level.</b> Containerized stocking also works well. In the coastal ranges, 2-year-old bare-root stock seems to be most efficient. Containerized stock plantings in the spring perform better than bare-root stock in the interior. Western hemlock has a good rate of survival {{on a wide range of}} conditions. This will allow for natural regeneration on sites that have good organic or mineral soil. If the site is not suitable for natural regeneration then the use of container-grown stock should be used. Hemlock doesn’t survive well with the bare-root stock method.Both western red cedar and western hemlock are able to reproduce by some form of vegetative reproduction. Western red cedar reproduces in three ways of vegetative form; layering, rooting of fallen branches, and branch development on fallen trees. In some areas of the Cascades this form of regeneration is the most successful. Another option for the establishment of red cedar is the use of stem cuttings. Western hemlock also has vegetative reproduction capabilities. Hemlock can be propagated by layering and from cuttings.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem is}} to {{determine}} a review period and stocking policy that are mutually bene®cial to a producer and a retailer. In our model, the retailer uses a periodic review, base stock policy for ordering the item from the producer's Distribution Center (DC). Excess customer demand {{is assumed to be}} lost. A make-to-order production system supplies to the DC. We show that given a review period, unless the manufacturer agrees to share the cost of carrying a fraction of the safety stocks at the retailer, the two will not agree upon the level of stocks to be carried in the store. We prove that there is an equilibrium value for this fraction, such that the retailer and the manufacturer are always in agreement with regard to the <b>stocking</b> <b>level.</b> We then show that complete coordination on the <b>stocking</b> <b>level</b> as well as the review period can be achieved solely through carrying out negotiations on credit terms. These theoretical results are used to construct an algorithm for calculating the optimal policy parameters for a supply chain.

The dynamic of this system will be modeled into linear time invariant state space.

40|$|The {{effects of}} 57 years of {{uneven-aged}} management {{on the structure}} and quality of old-growth northern hardwood forests were examined within a long-term Forest Service study in the Dukes Experimental Forest, Michigan. Treatments within the study included several differing stocking levels (30, 50, 70, and 90 ft 2 /acre) and cutting cycles (5, 10, 15, and 20 years) replicated across three blocks. Tree growth and quality, as well as stand structural attributes were examined within each treatment and compared to an unmanaged Research Natural Area (RNA). Comparisons of tree grade between treatments indicated that cutting cycle length and <b>stocking</b> <b>level</b> {{had no effect on}} tree quality. In contrast, average annual diameter growth was greatest in lower stocking treatments, and regression analyses of tree growth versus residual <b>stocking</b> <b>level</b> indicated that optimum levels of growth were achieved between residual basal areas of 50 and 70 ft 2 /acre. Comparisons of stand structure between treatment areas and the unmanaged RNA suggested that volumes of CWD in the high residual basal area treatments most closely approximated those found within unmanaged old-growth. Treatments with high residual basal areas and longer cutting cycles had significantly greater snag basal area and volume than other treatments and were closer in this respect to the RNA than other treatments. Analysis of diameter distributions over time indicated that cutting cycle had little effect on distribution shape over the course of this study. In contrast, treatments with lower residual basal areas developed from increasing q to concave or negative exponential distributions over time, while the 90 ft 2 /acre treatment displayed an increasing q distribution throughout the experiment. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} manipulation of stocking levels within northern hardwood stands is of greater importance than cutting cycle in controlling stand growth, as well as influencing the development of structural complexity...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2001. Arid and {{semi-arid}} regions {{have increasingly}} become {{the subject of}} much research and debate by scientists. By their very nature, these regions characteristically exhibit extremes which complicate the implementation of effective management strategies that ensure sustainable productivity and economic output. Namibia is one such region where low and highly variable rainfall conditions and fluctuating productivity pose a challenge to managers of commercial livestock enterprises, / who seek to optimise economic benefits while controlling the negative effect on herd production and income of unpredictable and unfavourable climatic events. Various management approaches are proposed as a means of exploiting periods of abundant productivity and so optimising income from herd production, while controlling for the effects of drought conditions. To analyse the effects of these various offtake strategies, a rainfall-driven plant-herbivore simulation model is used. The model comprises components simul~tihg vegetation and herbivore dynamics. The vegetation component incorporates soil moisture and nutrient allocation to plant parts. The herbivore dynamics sub-model comprises age and sex classes, population dynamics and animal energy requirements which govern accumulated fat reserves. The model is adapted to account for climatic and vegetation attributes specific to Namibia. An economic component including a seasonal monthly price structure is developed, and a dynamic feedback governing management decisions is incorporated. The much debated issue of whether to maintain a constant stocking rate or to track climatic variation by employing a variable <b>stocking</b> <b>level</b> is investigated, with the performance of management strategies incorporating these approaches ranked according to various factors, including annual returns, associated risk and annual stock mortality. The economic consequences of the timing of offtake are investigated, with the simulation of management strategies that implement destocking in the face of anticipated drought conditions. A dynamic projection of expected income allows the impact of forecasting potential economic gains on decision-making to be analysed. Results indicate that the performance of management strategies is not as dependent on climatic and seasonal price variability as was originally expected, with the application of a constant <b>stocking</b> <b>level</b> proving to be the most favourable strategy in terms of economic gain and variability of income. Tracking climatic variation by adapting stocking levels does not provide the improvement in economic returns from a livestock production system that was anticipated, although this approach is successful in effecting a significant reduction in annual stock mortality. Further results show the sensitivity of income to the long-term average <b>stocking</b> <b>level</b> characterising the management strategies investigated, {{as well as to the}} elasticity of the underlying price structure. The results of this study indicate that the implementation of management strategies designed to track climatic variation does not offer significant economic advantages over the application of a constant stocking approach...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} finding optimal stock levels for an inventory system with Poisson demands, arbitrary replacement time distribution, and emergency handling of shortages at a premium cost.

30|$|When an inter-temporal pricing {{strategy}} is introduced, {{it is reasonable}} to consider strategic customers, who rationally choose to buy at the period with highest utility. Su (2007) develops a model of dynamic pricing with endogenous intertemporal demand. At each point in time, customers may purchase the product at current prices or delay purchases and wait for sales. This paper demonstrates that heterogeneity in valuation and patience determines the structure of optimal prices and strategic customer behavior may actually benefit the seller. Su and Zhang (2008) study the impact of strategic customer behaviors on supply chain performance based on a newsvendor model facing forward-looking customers, and find that a seller’s <b>stocking</b> <b>level</b> is lower than that in the classic model without strategic customers. We follow the utility function of Su and Zhang (2008), and differing from the above papers, we incorporate two externalities into the utility function: A negative externality may motivate strategic customers to purchase early while a positive externality may make them wait.|$|E

Maximum basal area production is observed at medium levels of richness (between 18 and 25 species per ha) and density (between 15 and 30  m 2 per ha). Highest gross basal area productivity levels were sustained in forest parcels/plots with the highest basal area <b>stocking</b> <b>levels</b> (those with the highest basal area accumulation over the preceding period; Seydack 2000).

Uncertainty is quantified as the variation of the mortality rate of planted seedlings for the planting method, and as the prediction error for the seed-tree method. The objective of the forest landowner is assumed to maximize the expected net present value (NPV). Numerical simulations show that the owner should prefer the seed-tree method to the planting method for Scots pine stand. However, if the risk-free selection model is used, it overestimates the expected NPV by about 2 %. Sensitivity analysis shows that a less restrictive forest act could improve the expected net present value both for the planting method and the seed-tree method. Sensitivity analysis also shows that decreasing the level of variation of the mortality rate (or prediction error) increases the expected NPV. ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>stock</b> <b>level</b> in {{industrial}} companies is frequently subject of critical discussions. Material managers tend towards high <b>stock</b> <b>levels</b> to ensure delivery and operational readiness.

This decision conflict – based on lateral perception – can be modelled using an approach of game theory {{and it can be}} analysed in view of decision theory. This is the central object of this article. The consequences of decisions of the material manager and the controller in a company will be analysed if their actions result in different payoffs. Both the warehouseman and the controller each have two different alternatives to choose their own behaviour from with a specific probability. The material manager can select a low <b>stock</b> <b>level</b> at the risk of shortfalls or he can select a high <b>stock</b> <b>level</b> to ensurce delivery disposition. The controller can check the economic efficiency of the <b>stock</b> <b>level</b> on a low or a high audit level.

Following these actions the top management analyses how far the players have pursued the economic efficiency of the company and how far the company was damaged because of the choice of their actions. This damage can be exposed by the top management with a specific probability. Additionally, the analysis will provide the management with informations, how the payoffs should be specified {{in order to reduce the}} probability of bad stockkeeping and bad auditing. ...|$|R
