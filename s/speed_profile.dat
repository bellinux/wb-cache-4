Although the delay components can be measured by manually examining the <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> or derived time-space diagrams, identifying when vehicles begin to decelerate or stop accelerating is not always a straightforward task. In addition, a manual identification process may be laborious and time-consuming when handling a large network or numerous runs.

40|$|In railway systems, the {{evaluation}} of specific operating conditions {{and their impact on}} travel demand plays a key role both in planning and managing rail services. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of some energy saving strategies (ESSs) through the definition of energy-efficient <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> and estimate their effects on travel demand. In particular, <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> for ESSs need extra time for their implementation and hence entail a reduction in line performance. The definition of optimal <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> requires the use of optimisation procedures which can be formulated by considering motion parameters as control variables and energy consumption as the performance to be optimised (minimised), with respect to the available time.

We consider two cases: with and without energy recovery systems. Proposed models and methods are tested on a real suburban case.

50|$|Though {{acoustic}} propagation modelling generally predicts a constant received sound level, in practice there are both {{temporal and spatial}} fluctuations. These {{may be due to}} both small and large scale environmental phenomena. These can include sound <b>speed</b> <b>profile</b> fine structure and frontal zones as well as internal waves. Because in general there are multiple propagation paths between a source and receiver, small phase changes in the interference pattern between these paths can lead to large fluctuations in sound intensity.|$|E
50|$|The second {{mechanism}} involves {{wind shear}} {{forces on the}} water surface. John W. Miles suggested a surface wave generation mechanism which is initiated by turbulent wind shear flows based on the inviscid Orr-Sommerfeld equation in 1957. He found the energy transfer from wind to water surface {{is proportional to the}} curvature of the velocity profile of the wind {{at the point where the}} mean wind speed is equal to the wave speed. Since the wind <b>speed</b> <b>profile</b> is logarithmic to the water surface, the curvature has a negative sign at this point. This relation shows the wind flow transferring its kinetic energy to the water surface at their interface.|$|E
5000|$|Underwater {{acoustic}} propagation depends on many factors. The direction of sound propagation {{is determined by}} the sound speed gradients in the water.This is an important thing that happens in water, because the speed of sound travel in water with velocity regular. In the sea the vertical gradients are generally much larger than the horizontal ones. Combining this with a tendency towards increasing sound speed at increasing depth, due to the increasing pressure in the deep sea, causes a reversal of the sound speed gradient in the thermocline, creating an efficient waveguide at the depth, corresponding to the minimum sound speed. The sound <b>speed</b> <b>profile</b> may cause regions of low sound intensity called [...] "Shadow Zones", and regions of high intensity called [...] "Caustics". These may be found by ray tracing methods.|$|E

The application of ecodriving initiatives in lines equipped with ATO (Automatic Train Operation) systems can provide important savings with low investments. Previous studies carried out under ATO framework have not considered the main uncertainties in the traffic operation: the train load and {{delays in the}} line. This paper proposes a method to design robust and efficient <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> to be programmed in the ATO equipment of a metro line. First, the optimal Pareto front of robust ATO <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> to changes in train load is generated for two objectives, running time and energy consumption. A robust optimization technique and an alternative method based on the conservation of {{the shape of the}} <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> (pattern robustness) are compared. Both procedures make use of MOPSO (Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm. Then, the set of <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> to be programmed in the ATO equipment is selected from the robust Pareto front by means of an optimization model. This model is a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) to minimise the total energy consumption considering the statistical information about delays in the line. This procedure has been applied to a case study. The results showed that the pattern-robustness is more restrictive and meaningful than the robust optimization technique as it provides information about shapes that are more comfortable for passengers. And the use of statistical information about delays by the proposed selection model provides additional energy savings between 3 %and 14...|$|R

5000|$|From {{the shape}} of the sound <b>speed</b> <b>profile</b> in figure 1, one can see the effect of the order of {{importance}} of temperature and depth on sound speed. Near the surface, where temperatures are generally highest, the sound speed is often highest because the effect of temperature on sound speed dominates. Further down the water column, as temperature decreases in the ocean thermocline, sound speed also decreases. At a certain point, however, the effect of depth, i.e., pressure, begins to dominate, and the sound speed increases to the ocean floor. [...] Also visible in figure 1 is a common feature in sound speed profiles: the SOFAR channel. The axis of this channel is found at the depth of minimum sound speed. Sounds emitted at or near the axis of this channel propagate for very long horizontal distances, owing to the refraction of the sound back to the channel's center.|$|E
5000|$|Almost {{all packet}} types contain a {{parameter}} flagging whether its information is relevant for the [...] "nominal" [...] or [...] "reverse" [...] direction (or both). If a train sees balise 1 before balise 2 then it passes over {{the group in}} the nominal direction. Consequently, some packets may be dropped by the application software of the receiver {{if they are not}} designated for the relevant direction. The ERTMS header block of 50 bits contains the ETCS version, the current number and total count of balises within a balise group (up to 8 balises), a flag whether it is a copy (up to 4 copies) that increases chances for the receiver to see the telegram of the balise in a group, a serial number flagging whether the message has changed lately, a 10-bit country identifier along with the 14-bit balise group identifier allowing for a unique ID of every balise group. The linking information informs about the distance to the next balise group (one linking packet per direction) and the required train reaction if the next balise group is missed (e.g. train stop). The movement authority packet defines a maximum speed that may be used for a given maximum distance and maximum time - setting the maximum speed to zero will force the train to stop. The gradient profile may have a variable length based on the contained pairs of section length (scalar and number in the metric system) and section gradient (uphill/downhill flag and a number in %). Similarly the international static <b>speed</b> <b>profile</b> is given in a variable count of section parts with each part denoting the section length (number in meters - the scale is only given once {{at the start of the}} packet for all sections), the maximum speed (number * 5 km/h - allowed numbers are 0-120 i.e. some spare values are left over) and a flag if the speed restriction applies to the front or rear end of the train (possibly allowing for a delay). The trailer packet only contains its packet id with no parameters where 255 equals the state of all bits set in the 8-bit packet id field (11111111).|$|E
30|$|Another {{source of}} {{information}} to assist with the classification is the <b>speed</b> <b>profile</b> itself: the maximum speeds within a given profile can be compared against a database of maximum line speeds for routes within a network to help determine location.
