2500|$|Warspite, {{not aware}} of the Italian firing patterns, <b>split</b> her <b>guns</b> between the two ships. During the {{exchange}} one of Giulio Cesares rounds fell long and caused splinter damage to Warspites escorting destroyers [...] and , which had formed up {{on the far side of}} the action. At 15:54 Malaya started firing, well out of range, hoping to cause some confusion on the Italian ships. Meanwhile, the Italian heavy cruisers came into action and started firing on Warspite at 15:55 but had to break off as the Allied cruisers returned.|$|R
5000|$|Between 40 and 60 {{cartridge}} belts, each of 250 rounds (a {{total of}} [...] ), were carried; {{as well as}} 180 shells for the main <b>gun,</b> <b>split</b> 90:54:36 between canister, antitank, and explosive. These were the official figures — up to 300 rounds for the main gun were stowed for combat.|$|R
5000|$|Whilst touring in France with Gun, Gizzi came up {{with the}} name El Presidente and after <b>Gun</b> <b>split,</b> began working on his own songs. In 2002 he made a few demos, along with brother Jools, on a small sampler and Billy Sloan aired them on his Sunday night Radio Clyde show.|$|R
50|$|Using the {{conventional}} bracket or <b>split</b> trail, the <b>gun</b> could {{be moved by}} its own crew using drag ropes and wooden shafts much like a handcart. Two straight shafts were placed {{on each side of}} the cheek pieces facing forward, and two angled ones at the trail. The appearance of the shafts when fixed in place led to the nickname of Grasshopper.|$|R
5000|$|The 10.5 cm leFH 18 (leichte Feldhaubitze [...] "light field {{howitzer}}") was a German light howitzer used in World War II and {{the standard}} artillery piece of the Wehrmacht, adopted for service in 1935 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. A major advance on its predecessor the 10.5 cm leFH 16, the leFH 18 was superior in caliber to its early opponents in the war, with adequate range and firepower, but the modern <b>split</b> trail <b>gun</b> carriage that provided it with more stability and traverse also rendered it too heavy for a mobile role in the largely horse-drawn artillery battalions of the German army, particularly {{in the mud and}} snow of the Eastern Front.|$|R
50|$|Phobia {{continued}} to write new material and play live until, in 1986, they secured a management contract and eventually, in 1987, a recording contract with A&M Records. The band then changed their name to <b>Gun.</b> <b>Gun</b> <b>split</b> in 1997 but have since reformed in 2008, with Toby Jepson (ex Little angels) on vocals. The original Blind Allez line up also got back together {{to play some}} more gigs in 2006.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Asuka period, the Kokugunri system (Kokugunri-sei) and the Taihō Code were {{enacted in}} 701 and 702. These pieces of {{legislation}} split the regions of Japan into different areas, using terminology of the Tang dynasty due to Confucian influences in Japan. This {{led to the creation of}} Provinces (kuni), which were <b>split</b> into Districts (<b>gun,</b> kōri). Other than the area surrounding the capital Nara (Kinai), Japan was organised into large regions called circuits (dō).|$|R
50|$|The leFH 18 {{improved}} {{in most areas}} on its predecessor, the 10.5 cm leFH 16. A completely new three-point <b>split</b> trail <b>gun</b> carriage provided more stability and increased the traverse to 56 degrees. The sighting mechanism {{made it easier to}} fire at moving targets. The new gun carriage resulted in a major weight increase to over two tons. The heavier recoil of the higher muzzle velocity of 470 m/s was counteracted by a new pneumatic recuperator above the barrel, that provided compressed air and liquid in 55 °C to return the gun to firing position after firing. A barrel brake containing a water jacket and a fluid equalizer in the upper carriage also checked the recoil. The protective shield was a reinforced, tapered shield with flattened sides that could be folded down. The barrel was good for 10,000 to 12,000 shots. The howitzer could fire 28 different shell types. The main high explosive shell was nearly a kilogram lighter and contained a heavier explosive charge. The leFH proved an adaptable design, with a total of 28 different variants manufactured.|$|R
50|$|Ward Dotson {{founded the}} Pontiac Brothers after <b>splitting</b> with The <b>Gun</b> Club in 1983. Their debut, Big Black River, was issued in France in 1985, which {{eventually}} landed them a Stateside deal with Frontier Records. Doll Hut, their first release for Frontier, featured half the songs from Big Black River and several newly recorded songs. Guitarist Jon Wahl left {{the group in}} 1986, shortly before they issued Fiesta en la Biblioteca. After the release of Johnson in 1988, the band went on hiatus, returning in 1992 to release one final album and do {{a tour of the}} West Coast. Dotson later played in The Liquor Giants, and Wahl went on to form the group Claw Hammer.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{the capture}} of the Yugoslav Navy vessels in September, Croatia's coastal defences relied on {{captured}} coastal artillery on the mainland and the nearby islands. In central Dalmatia, these included three batteries on the mainland between Šibenik and <b>Split,</b> [...] <b>guns</b> on Žirje Island, a [...] battery near Zečevo and [...] guns on Smokvica Island near Primošten.

5|$|At 05:00 on 13 April Stopford {{gave the}} order for the inshore {{squadron}} to withdraw back to Gambier's fleet. Cochrane was again furious, and even suggested taking Imperieuse and Indefatigable on a desperate attack on the still-grounded Océan. Captain John Tremayne Rodd on the latter refused. Frustrated, Cochrane remained in the anchorage, joined by Pallas and the smaller vessels as the larger ships returned to more open waters. At 08:00 he ordered a renewed attack on the remaining grounded ships {{at the mouth of}} the Charente, and by 11:00 the small vessels were in position and opened fire on the French flagship. Although Aetnas <b>gun</b> <b>split,</b> forcing her withdrawal, the barrage otherwise continued throughout the day, although to little effect. It was not until 16:00 when the battered Océan and Régulus, most of their stores thrown overboard, were able to safely retreat towards the mouth of the Charente.|$|R
50|$|The {{guns are}} usually {{deployed}} in batteries {{of six to}} eight guns; promotional material claims that a battery can place more than 1 tonne of projectiles on a target in one minute. In Russian service, the gun is usually towed by a KrAZ-260 9 tonne 6x6 truck or by an artillery tractor, such as the AT-T, ATS-59, AT-S, or MT-T. When towed the carriage {{is supported by a}} four-wheel (two wheels on each side) walking beam suspension, permitting the gun to be towed over rough terrain at speeds up to 30 km/h (18.6 mp/h). In firing position the trail legs are <b>split</b> and the <b>gun</b> rests on a circular jack under the forward part of the carriage. This arrangement allows for gun traverse of 25 degrees to the left and right. Several types of trail spades are available to suit the season; the summer spades are larger to suit softer ground.|$|R
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 1603 recorded that Upnor Castle had 20 guns of various calibres, plus another 11 <b>guns</b> <b>split</b> between two sconces or outworks, known as Bay and Warham Sconces.

5000|$|Green Arrow is {{a master}} archer with his accomplishments {{standing}} as superhuman, although it is just due to natural talent and years of experience. He claims that {{he is able to}} shoot 29 arrows in under a minute when he corrected Black Canary for saying 26. He is also able to shoot arrows up to 95 mph. He has also demonstrated the ability to shoot an arrow down the barrel of a <b>gun,</b> <b>split</b> a drop of water while it slowly leaves the tap, and has made several accurate shots while simultaneously performing an acrobatic maneuver. In CW's television show, the Green Arrow is also depicted as able to accurately and rapidly shoot tennis balls as they are thrown up into the air. Although Green Arrow is capable of aiming and shooting at almost any area of the human body, he typically aims to only wound and only kills in the direst of situations. One of the core elements of his arsenal is his use of trick arrows; armed with explosive arrows, grappling arrows, and his famous boxing-glove arrow. In recent years, he has used these arrows in conjunction with regular arrows.|$|R

Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary <b>guns.</b> <b>Splitting</b> his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered some 150, while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged. Yakumo was not hit during the engagement, although she did hit the protected cruiser [...] one time with an eight-inch shell.|$|R
