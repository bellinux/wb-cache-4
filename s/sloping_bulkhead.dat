40|$|Pectin from cocoa peel was {{successfully}} prepared by extraction method in the bubble column reactor. The process could {{be carried out}} in batch and continuous, with co-current or counter current flow. Bubble pipe reactor with inclined baffle is expected to reduce the problem from gas flow patterns, jagged <b>sloping</b> <b>bulkhead</b> serves as a bubble breaker that could replace mechanical stirrer. In this study the reactor column <b>sloping</b> <b>bulkhead</b> was used as extractor to recover pectin in the cocoa peel by citric acid (1 N) solvent. Cocoa peel paste and citric acid were entered {{to the top of}} the column at 1 : 1 rate ratio by streamed using dosing pump. Nitrogen gas as a medium stirrer flowed counter current from the bottom of the column. Once extraction was completed, the liquid then precipitated by acid alcohol. Pectin solids were washed with alcohol (96 %). The temperature of extraction process is maintained at 70 ° C. The residence time in the column material was determined by feed flow rate (cocoa paste and citric acid), and the volume of suspension that remains in the reactor (V). Residence time equation obtained is: t = (7045. 86 G- 0. 1275) /L. The yield of yellowish white precipitate reached up to 5. 2973 % and methoxyl concentration reached 5, 21 % for 72 minutes. The experiment shows that the continuous extraction process of pectin in baffle columns is better than batch process...|$|E

25|$|This {{design is}} typical of modern sea kayaks and has a low rear deck for easy rolling, a white water cockpit, {{compartments}} that allow the kayaker to reach into them while at sea, and a <b>sloping</b> rear <b>bulkhead</b> that enables the kayak to be emptied by lifting the bow.|$|R
40|$|The {{aircraft}} {{under consideration}} in the following text is a swing wing, 50, 000 lb. (maximum weight), land based strike aircraft. The various roles of the aircraft are strike operations at a Mach number of 2. 0 and height 36, 000 feet or Mach number of 0. 9 at low level, interceptor operations at a Mach number of 2. 0 with a, dash at a Mach number of 2. 0 and search and patrol operations at a Mach number of 0. 76 and a height of 36, 000 feet (with wings unswept). Design of the aircraft was split into several sections each one being investigated by a different student. The section analysed in this report being the forward-centre fuselage. This lies between the rear <b>sloping</b> pressurised <b>bulkhead</b> of the cockpit to the aft bulkhead of number two fuel tank. Time did not allow {{for the design of}} all the structural parts but detailed studies were conducted on two different frames (one light fabricated and one heavy machined), the nose undercarriage bay, two sections of fuselage cross-section, and the variable geometry bullet including aerodynamic loading in the intake. A sample fatigue calculations were done on a fuel tank and nose undercarriage together with a complete weight breakdown for the forward-centre fuselage (several approximations being made 'for undersigned structure). From the loading calculations the critical cases defined that the structure in this section of the fuselage was designed on the manoeuvres and landing cases. Use of Concorde material (aluminium alloy) RR. 58 was used wherever possible because of temperature effects in the high speed configuration. However, for some of the view heavily loaded members steel had to be used (with the appropriate temperature reduction factor applied to the allowable stresses) to keep the volume of material to a minimum...|$|R
