40|$|The {{invitation}} {{to write this}} essay came from Alan Haydon and Jenny Lomax, curators of 'Kenneth Martin & Mary Martin: Constructed Works', a landmark exhibition that examines {{the development of these}} two major figures in the history of British abstract art. The curators asked Hugonin to explore parallels between his own paintings and Kenneth Martin’s late series ‘Chance, Order, Change. ’ His text, although short, was an important practice-led contribution to a catalogue that gave the views of contemporary artists priority over historical information. Haydon’s and Lomax’s idea was to juxtapose the constructivism of both artists (including Kenneth Martin’s kinetic mobile sculptures and Mary Martin’s relief sculptures and architectural maquettes) and Hugonin’s writing responded to the sense of occasion created by this joint exhibition of two influential artists. In his essay the researcher argues that Kenneth Martin was a particularly inventive user of number-oriented methods. Hugonin explores a favourite work ‘Chance, Order, Change 27 (Green) History Painting’ (1983) contrasting Martin’s approach with his own experience of the creative interaction of intuition and logic. The research embedded in the essay arises from a series of experiments that resulted in a major series of new paintings: Untitled XII (02 - 05), XIII (03 - 05), XIV (05), and XV (06 - 07). This last work is illustrated alongside Hugonin’s text. Hugonin is a visiting professor in the division of visual arts and his theoretical engagement with the nature of systems-based art practices has provided supervisory support for an AHRC funded doctoral project by Lavell entitled: ‘The Power of Naming: what happens when an artist incorporates forensic science methodology into his studio practice?’ This practice-led PhD contrasts, but also tries to reconcile, certain creative resemblances between systems art and obsessive <b>serial</b> <b>offence.</b> Hugonin is part of Lavell’s interdisciplinary supervision team which includes both criminologists and fine artists...|$|E

40|$|Representing {{the nexus}} of two core strands of Investigative Psychology research, the present work explores the {{relationships}} between the behavioural and spatial attributes of crime series committed by 101 prolific sex offenders. Five key behavioural styles of offending are identified, which closely map onto the five-fold typology of sex offending proposed by Canter and Heritage (1990). Differences between these groupings in terms of the spatial and geometrical patterning of offences are examined, and theoretical postulations as to the psychological processes underlying these spatio-behavioural patterns are offered. Theoretical and practical implications are considered in detail throughout, with particular reference to the use and value of geographical profiling as a decision support tool in <b>serial</b> sex <b>offence</b> investigations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{practice}} of criminal psychological profiling is frequently cited as being appli-cable to serial arson crimes. Despite this claim, {{there does not}} appear to be any empirical research that examines <b>serial</b> arson <b>offence</b> behaviors in the context of profiling. This study seeks to develop an empirical model of serial arsonist behaviors that can be systematically associated with probable offender characteristics. Analysis has produced a model of offence behaviors that identify four discrete behavior patterns, all of which share a constellation of common nondiscriminatory behaviors. The inherent behavioral themes of each of these pat-terns are exploredwith discussion of their broader implications for our understanding of serial arson and directions for future research. Criminal psychological profiling is the forensic technique of analyzing crime behaviors to construct a descriptive template of probable offenders (Wilson, Lin-coln, & Kocsis, 1997). The {{practice of}} and research into profiling has predomi-nantly been focussed on crimes of sexual violence such as murder and rape. Although comparatively little research has actually been developed, profiling is nonetheless frequently cited as also being applicable to the investigation of arson crimes (Holmes & Holmes, 1996; Rossmo, 1997; Vorpagel, 1982). Despite this reputation and acceptance of profiling by the law enforcement community, there exists a surprising dearth of rigorous empirical research on the topic of profiling (Kocsis, in press; Kocsis, Hayes & Irwin, 2002; Kocsis, Irwin, Hayes, & Nunn, 2000; Oleson, 1996). The objective of this study is to develop an empirical model for the criminal psychological profiling of <b>serial</b> arson <b>offences.</b> The majority of current social science research on arson is dominated by psy-chiatric or psychological studies that examine issues of mental status and/o...|$|R

40|$|Behavioural case linkage (BCL) is a {{procedure}} {{that can be used}} to identify linked crime series, which contain two or more crimes committed by the same person, thereby helping the police to detect and prosecute repeat offenders who are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime. However, despite the potential benefits of BCL, there are also damaging consequences if crimes are incorrectly linked. Consequently, research has started to test if and how this procedure can work in the most efficient and reliable way. But, the extant literature has a number of important limitations, particularly in terms of (1) generalisability (i. e., there have been few attempts to replicate findings across geographical locations and time periods), (2) ecological validity (i. e., the methodology used to test BCL is not representative of how the procedure is used in practice), and (3) methodology (i. e., there is a lack of research to systematically compare the various methodological/statistical approaches to BCL). The primary aim of this thesis was to address these three important limitations. In terms of generalisability, this thesis has tested the extent to which previous BCL research on residential burglary, commercial robbery, and car theft can be replicated in new geographical locations and time periods. In terms of ecological validity, a number of new methodologies have been developed and tested that reduce the gap between research and practice in BCL by allowing both non-serial and unsolved offences (as well as solved, <b>serial</b> <b>offences)</b> to be included when testing the principles of BCL, and also for these principles to be tested with crime series that contain several different types of offence. In terms of methodology, novel methodological approaches have been compared with the ‘traditional’, status quo methodology for researching the BCL principles, thereby ensuring that the findings reported in this thesis can be compared with previous work. This thesis, therefore, has important implications for theory, research, and practice and the findings are discussed in the context of these. Future research directions are also outlined...|$|R
40|$|Although {{distinct}} offence action patterns {{have been}} identified for different forms of sexual and violent crime, a generic psychological framework for this differentiation {{has yet to be}} advanced. An innovative framework derived from the emerging criminal narrative approach provides a significant contribution to the differentiation of offending styles. Canter (1994) argues that offenders’ empathy deficit leads them to assign a Victim, Object or Person role to their victims within their personal narratives. The evidence for this model is examined across 33 offence actions in 66 stranger rapes, 24 offence actions in 50 stalking offences and 39 offence actions in 50 <b>serial</b> murder <b>offences.</b> Hypothesised offence actions reflecting the Roles are found in distinct regions of Smallest Space Analysis (SSA-I) configurations for all three offence types. This evidence across diverse offence forms leads to the suggestion that the Roles assigned to victims within offenders’ narratives provide a generic framework for differentiating offending styles in all interpersonal crimes. The different Victim Roles articulate qualitatively different variants of the established control and empathy deficit components in sexual and violent offending, contributing to the debate about the operation of these components and having significant treatment implications...|$|R
40|$|Arson is a {{major problem}} nationwide, with local {{authorities}} investigating arson cases daily. To help combat this issue, a national study was conducted which focussed on the geographical distribution of arson offences in relation to the offender's home base. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the utility of Canter and Larkin's (1993) circle theory and home range hypothesis for predicting geographical patterning of <b>serial</b> arson <b>offences</b> in New Zealand. This was achieved by examining offence locations of 45 serial arsonists convicted between 1988 and 2003. Each offender's offence sites and home base were plotted on a scaled street map, replicating Canter and Larkin's (1993) geometric technique for constructing the criminal range circle. An initial test showed that a majority of offenders committed their offences within a distinct offence region. It was also found that the breakdown of commuter- and marauder-type offenders was different from Canter and Larkin's (1993) study of UK serial rapists, suggesting that the marauder model is not universally applicable to account for all types of serial offending. However, the home range hypothesis was supported in this study. Additionally, there was support for the existence of a safety zone around the offender's home base as proposed by Brantingham and Brantingham (1981). Lastly, the current study supports the hypothesis that offenders travel short distances to commit their arsons. Overall, Canter and Larkin's (1993) circle theory and home range hypothesis successfully describe the geographical patterning of <b>offences</b> by <b>serial</b> arsonists in New Zealand. Although the marauder model IS not universally applicable, it still offers potential benefits as part of an investigative tool for local authorities...|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{explored}} the sexual offence crime investigation and risk management domains' from two interacting perspectives. It considered both {{the role and}} behaviour of the offender and the role and decision making of the investigator. The common theme was how can policing create a more balanced view of risk using evidenced based decisions. From a data set of 154 serial sexual offenders three questions were asked: what are the pathways of offending?' Do sexual offenders escalate? Do they specialise? Four pathways were derived as escalation, oscillation, maintenance and de-escalation; escalation was found in 13 % of the offenders. The {{second part of the}} thesis then tested the decisions investigators made in a <b>serial</b> sexual <b>offence</b> scenario with an added stressor of time pressure. The results suggested that investigators did not make bad decision but omitted to make some important decisions. Furthermore, experience and intelligence acted as moderators of time pressure. The next part of the thesis considered a contemporary policing issue in terms of sexual offenders and resource decisions. What is the likelihood of an offender possessing indecent images of children (HOC) being a contact child sexual offender. The chapter compared a group of child sexual offenders who possessed HOC and a group of non-contact HOC possessing offenders. Contact and non-contact offenders could be discriminated by criminal convictions, access to children and the severity level of HOC possessed. More sadistic contact offenders possessed higher levels of HOC. The applications to policing knowledge bases were outlined. The findings were considered in terms of the contributions to psychological and criminological literature with two new models of decision making and sexual offending presented.

40|$|One of the {{assumptions}} that underlies the profiling process is that criminals are behaviourally consistent from one offence to another. To date, however, this is an assumption {{that has not been}} scientifically validated. The present study therefore tested the assumption of behavioural consistency in <b>serial</b> rape <b>offences.</b> The author collected dichotomous data on 30 behavioural variables for a total of 439 offences committed by 121 serial rapists in New Zealand. There were two main research aims of the study. The first aim was to test the behavioural consistency of a range of individual behaviours. It was hypothesised that higher consistency would be found for behaviours that reflected a degree of planning or that prioritised control of the victim and the offence environment, because these behaviours might be less affected by environmental factors. In contrast, many sexual behaviours arise directly out of offender-victim interactions and therefore are most affected by environmental factors such as victim resistance. It was therefore also hypothesised that sexual behaviours would display lower consistency. A consistency measure was used that compared behaviour in consecutive offences. Consistency for each behaviour was defined as present-present or absent-absent matches of that behaviour in consecutive offences. The degree of consistency for any behaviour will be reflected in the consistency score received by that variable {{based on the number of}} matches for that behaviour across the offence series. The consistency analysis found moderate to high levels of consistency for the majority of individual behaviours. As predicted, higher consistency was exhibited for behaviours that prioritised control of the victim and the offence environment, and lower consistency was exhibited for the sexual behaviours. The second research aim was that if behavioural consistency was found in the results of the consistency analysis, to explore whether there were any underlying patterns to the consistency of offending behaviour. A factor analysis of the consistency scores established that there are clear patterns to the behavioural consistency of offenders consistent with previous analysis of offence characteristics. The factor analysis resulted in three themes or domains to behaviour: hostility, involvement and control. These findings have theoretical implications for the assumption of behavioural consistency in serial rapists, for the concepts of modus operandi and signature in offence behaviour, and for the theoretical understanding of the profiling process. The findings also have practical implications for the practice of profiling and case linkage in New Zealand, and raise possibilities for future directions in research...|$|R
