5|$|Lucille La Verne as Evil Queen Grimhilde / Witch: The Queen is the {{stepmother}} of <b>Snow</b> <b>White.</b> Once her magic mirror {{tells her}} that <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> is fairer than she is, she immediately enlists Humbert the huntsman {{to kill her}} in the woods. After she discovers that <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> did not die, she disguises herself as an old hag and uses a poisoned apple to remove <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> from her path without killing her.|$|E
5|$|When Prince Alfred {{arrives in}} the kingdom and {{falls in love with}} <b>Snow</b> <b>White,</b> Elspeth is furious to {{discover}} that images of <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> are appearing in her mirrors, which means that her stepdaughter is the fairest of them all. Driven with jealousy, Elspeth orders Hector, a hunter, to take <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> into the forest and kill her, and then return with Snow White's heart for her to consume. In the meantime, Elspeth transforms Alfred into a bear. Unable to kill <b>Snow</b> <b>White,</b> Hector presents Elspeth with the heart of a wild boar instead. When she learns the truth, Elspeth kills Hector, imprisons John in her mirrors, and stifles <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> with an enchanted ribbon.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{traditional}} <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> folktale first recorded in 1812 by German folklorists, the Brothers Grimm, the film deviates from earlier {{interpretations of the}} story in several respects. Set in a fantasy kingdom, it {{tells the story of}} <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> (Kristin Kreuk), and the attempts of her malevolent stepmother, Queen Elspeth (Miranda Richardson), to eliminate her. Trying to escape Queen Elspeth's machinations, <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> flees to the forest, where she befriends Sunday (Michael J. Anderson), the leader of the seven dwarves, and together they plot the monarch's overthrow.|$|E

5|$|In reality, {{the cottage}} belongs to seven adult dwarfs, named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, {{who work in}} a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an {{intruder}} has invaded their home. The dwarfs find <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, {{and all of the}} dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after they learn she can cook and clean beautifully. <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.|$|E
5|$|Noted filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> and the Seven Dwarfs as {{a notable}} {{achievement}} in cinema; Eisenstein {{went so far}} as to call it the greatest film ever made. The film inspired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce its own fantasy film, The Wizard of Oz, in 1939. Another animation pioneer, Max Fleischer, decided to produce his animated feature film Gulliver's Travels in order to compete with <b>Snow</b> <b>White.</b> The 1943 Merrie Melodies short Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs, directed by Bob Clampett, parodies <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> and the Seven Dwarfs by presenting the story with an all-black cast singing a jazz score.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{however, the}} mirror tells her {{that there is}} a new fairest woman in the land, her 14-year-old stepdaughter, Princess <b>Snow</b> <b>White.</b> She became obsessively jealous of the princess' {{emerging}} beauty, therefore turning her into a scullery maid in her own home. After observing the handsome Prince from another kingdom singing a love song to <b>Snow</b> <b>White,</b> the proud Queen, in a jealous rage, commands her faithful Huntsman, Humbert, to take the princess deep into the forest and kill her. He is ordered to bring back her heart in a box to prove that he had done so. But Humbert cannot bear to kill the young princess upon realizing that she is impervious to harm, so he tells <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> of the Queen's plot and tells her to run away and never to come back. To escape the penalty, he comes back with a pig's heart and gives it to the Queen. When she questions her mirror, it again replies that <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> is the fairest in the land, and that she is living at the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, revealing that the box contains the heart of a pig. The Dwarfs are fearful of the Queen's black magic but decide to take in <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> anyway.|$|E

5|$|One day, the Magic Mirror {{informs the}} Queen that <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> {{is now the}} fairest in the land. The jealous Queen orders her Huntsman to take <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill <b>Snow</b> <b>White.</b> He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, {{revealing}} the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee {{into the woods and}} never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.|$|E
5|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> {{is saved}} by seven dwarfs, each {{named after the}} days of the week and {{possessing}} the power to transform into a rainbow to move {{from one place to another}} (but are only capable if all seven dwarfs are present). The eldest is Sunday, who is a victim of one of Elspeth's spells that has left half of him as a garden gnome. The dwarfs allow <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> to care for their home, though the dwarf Wednesday is initially suspicious. When Elspeth learns that <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> is still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Josephine, Snow White's deceased mother, with the magic mirror the Green-Eyed One gave her. Aided by Monday, who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth, disguised as Josephine, finds her and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills <b>Snow</b> <b>White.</b>|$|E

5|$|The dwarfs {{return to}} their cottage and find <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> {{seemingly}} dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her {{out of sight in}} the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince, who had previously met and fallen in love with <b>Snow</b> <b>White,</b> learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> to his castle.|$|E
5|$|As in the film, the Queen {{character}} is featured in 1979 <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> and the Seven Dwarfs musical version, played by Anne Francine. In the Disney on Ice reenactment {{of the movie}} in 1986-1987, and then in 1994–1997 and again in 2000–2001, she was voiced by Louise Chamis and played by various skaters beginning with Melanie Scott in 1986-1987, and including Elena Koteneva, who was substituted by Davina Lee-Gooding in 1995. Francine also played her in the 1980 stage play and television program <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> Live and Chamis voiced her in Disneyland's <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> – An Enchanting Musical in 2004 and 2006. The Evil Queen was also featured in Disney Live's Three Classic Fairy Tales in the section based on the film.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Disney also {{encouraged}} {{his staff to}} see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's Romeo and Juliet (1936)— to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> lies in her glass coffin— to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> and the Seven Dwarfs, {{as well as the}} two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu (1922) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.|$|E

5|$|Following {{successful}} exclusive runs at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and {{a theater}} in Miami in January 1938, RKO Radio Pictures put the film into general release on February 4. It {{became a major}} box-office success, making four times more money than any other motion picture released in 1938. In its original release, <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> and the Seven Dwarfs grossed $3.5 million in the United States and Canada, and by May 1939 its total international gross of $6.5 million made it the most successful sound film of all time, displacing Al Jolson's The Singing Fool (1928) (<b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> and the Seven Dwarfs was soon displaced from this position by Gone with the Wind in 1940). By {{the end of its}} original run, <b>Snow</b> <b>White</b> and the Seven Dwarfs had earned $7,846,000 in international box office receipts. This earned RKO a profit of $380,000.|$|E
