5|$|In February 1996, {{a single}} <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East weekday round trip was {{extended}} from Old Saybrook to New London. An additional round trip was extended in February 2010, and 3 more in May 2010 {{for a total}} of 5 daily round trips between New London and New Haven. Weekend <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East service between Old Saybrook and New Haven Union Station began in 2008, but no regular weekend trains ran to New London.|$|E

5|$|ConnDOT {{plans call}} for the Kawasaki M8 to replace {{most or all of}} the {{locomotives}} and coaches currently in service on <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East in 2018. ConnDOT has proposed to use up to 32 M8's in SLE service as far as Old Saybrook; the step-fitted diesel equipment will then be used on the Hartford Line and for New London / Mystic / Westerly service. Limited direct service from Grand Central Terminal to Old Saybrook may be added once the M8s are in service. Testing of M8 cars on the <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East route began in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 and 1997, then Gov. John Rowland {{proposed}} to replace <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East and the Waterbury Branch with bus service, citing a high subsidy of $18.70 per rider per trip, {{in order to}} decrease the unpopular gas tax. Lawmakers from the region called the proposals political and defended the line's ability to reduce congestion and pollution, while opponents of the line called it an example of government waste. The <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East Rider's Association and other groups lobbied to save both services each time, and after public hearings a small fare increase was enacted in late 1997 instead.|$|E

5|$|In July 2012, Governor Dannel Malloy {{announced}} that 5 weekend round trips would {{be extended to}} New London beginning in April 2013. However, the extension was dependent on ongoing negotiations with the marine industry over mandated closings of the Old Saybrook – Old Lyme bridge. Two weekday midday trips were added in May 2013, while weekend service began on June 1, 2013, after the application for additional bridge closings {{was approved by the}} state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Because <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East service to New London is limited, Amtrak honors monthly <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East passes on select intercity trains between New London and New Haven.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2007, reverse-peak {{and more}} midday service were introduced, which {{officials}} {{hailed as the}} beginning of <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East as a true bidirectional system. Several existing express trains also began to stop at Guilford.|$|E

5|$|The {{possibility}} of extending service eastward {{has also been}} considered. Several special trains operated to Mystic during the 2000 OpSail festival, the only such service to date. In a 2001 report examining commuter rail for Rhode Island, RIDOT considered an extension of <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East to Providence via Westerly (effectively restoring the Clamdigger service). Ultimately, MBTA Commuter Rail service, which already ran to Providence {{as part of the}} Providence/Stoughton Line, was extended southward instead (although only to Wickford Junction). However, both RIDOT and SLE have long-term plans to extend their services to meet at Westerly. Extending SLE service would require negotiations with the US Coast Guard, the Marine Trades Association, and other stakeholders for increased use of the Thames River Bridge and the Mystic River bridge. As part of Governor Malloy's thirty year transit plan, <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East would be extended to Westerly at a cost of $200 million. On February 1, 2016, the Connecticut Public Transportation Commission issued a report recommending extension of <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East rail service to Mystic and Westerly as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|The New Haven and New London Railroad was {{merged with}} the New London and Stonington in 1857 to form the New Haven, New London and Stonington Railroad. The line was leased by the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad (NYP) in 1859. The NYP bought the section east of Groton {{outright}} in 1864; the section from New London westward was spun off as the <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> Railway. In 1870, the <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> was leased by the New York and New Haven Railroad, which itself {{became part of the}} New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1872. At some point during this series of events, the 1852-built station was replaced by a larger, two-story structure, which was also used by some through trains from the north.|$|E
5|$|The {{northbound}} platform, {{currently a}} side platform, {{can serve as}} an island platform should passenger service return to the NECR track. The 2010 SCCOG report indicated that Amtrak wished <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East to move its operations to Track 6, freeing the mainline tracks for through trains. In 2013, most <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East trains began using Track 6. Most passengers use the low-level section of the platform south of State Street, but a short metal spur on the high-level platform provides handicapped accessible boarding for trains using the track. A low-level section of the northbound platform also remains north of the high-level section; {{it has not been}} used since the high-level section was constructed.|$|E

5|$|When {{started in}} 1990, <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East was {{intended}} to be a temporary service. Except at Old Saybrook and New Haven, which were already served by Amtrak, the state constructed new stations – consisting of little more than bare wooden decks – for minimal cost. Since the service was started two months before the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed, the platforms were not built to be handicapped accessible. After a decade of service, with <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East established as part of Connecticut's transportation system, the state began to upgrade the service. The basic stations have been rebuilt with high-level platforms to provide handicapped access and level boarding, parking lots have been expanded, and more trains {{have been added to the}} schedule.|$|E
5|$|After the {{previous}} depot was destroyed, the Central Vermont Railroad (which then leased the New London Northern) began making {{plans for a}} larger replacement station. The Central Vermont and the New Haven Railroad (which had bought the <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> in 1870) bought {{the east end of}} the Parade from New London for the unusually low price of $15,000, with the understanding that the railroads would build a structure more suitable for the bustling city.|$|E
5|$|New London Union Station is a {{historic}} regional rail station located in New London, Connecticut, United States. Located on the Northeast Corridor, the busiest railway in the United States, it is the primary railroad station in southeastern Connecticut. Union Station is a station stop for most of Amtrak's Northeast Regional trains and {{a small number of}} high-speed Acela Express trains. Certain CDOT <b>Shore</b> <b>Line</b> East commuter rail trains also stop at New London, making it the eastern terminus of commuter rail in Connecticut.|$|E
