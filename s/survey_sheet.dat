The data obtained from the study were treated as supplemental materials for the SPM. The 10 subjects were videotaped for the whole SPM process to create related audiovisual materials. The subjects engaged in six activities: sketching, being interviewed about their sketches, pre-learning about SPM research, implementing the SPM, filling out a <b>survey</b> <b>sheet</b> (the attached questionnaire) and undergoing an overall interview. The subjects were videoed sketching, but their faces were not shown for reasons of privacy. Crayons,colored pencils and ballpoint pens were supplied for implementation of the SPM.
