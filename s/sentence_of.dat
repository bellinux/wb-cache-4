5|$|Although the Act of Parliament {{defining}} {{high treason}} {{remains on the}} United Kingdom's statute books, during {{a long period of}} 19th-century legal reform the <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England in 1870. The death penalty for treason was abolished in 1998.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 {{a private}} {{security}} guard {{with a pistol}} pursued on foot two men whom he believed tried to steal scrap metal. The men climbed on a railway embankment and started throwing rocks down at the guard who thereafter shot ten rounds in their direction, mortally wounding {{one of them in}} the head. The guard was first convicted of murder by the Municipal Court in Prague and given a <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> 7 years imprisonment. The decision was changed by the High Court in Prague to conviction of intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter) and a <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> five years imprisonment. The guard was finally exonerated by the Supreme Court in Brno which considered his action legitimate self-defense, noting that defense must be clearly more intensive than attack in order to be successful, and that the stones and bricks being thrown presented grave danger to the man's life.|$|E

5|$|Following Thomas Williams's <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> one year's {{hard labor}} for {{publishing}} The Age of Reason in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when Richard Carlile included {{it in an}} edition of Paine's complete works.

Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of The Age of Reason in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.|$|E

Reagan determined that the 18-year sentence was excessive compared to what other political figures in similar circumstances had been receiving.|$|E
