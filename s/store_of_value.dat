25|$|To {{act as a}} <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> a money {{must be able to}} be {{reliably}} saved, stored, {{and retrieved}} – and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

25|$|A very {{profitable}} type of seignorage {{is from the}} international circulation of banknotes. While the cost of printing banknotes is minimal, the foreign entity must provide goods and services at the face value of the note to obtain it. The banknote is retained because the entity values it as a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> because of mistrust of the local currency.|$|E

These coins bear a face value, but are generally seen more as collector's items or <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> <b>value.</b> Notable {{among these are}} the so-called [...] "Bermuda triangles", which are pressed on special lobed triangular planchets, are minted in gold and silver, and come in denominations divisible by three.|$|R
25|$|Volume {{collections}} (Hoards): Collectors {{may have}} an interest in acquiring large volumes of a particular coins (e.g., as many pennies as they can store). These usually are not high-value coins, but the interest is in collecting a large volume of them either {{for the sake of the}} challenge, as a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> or in the hope that the intrinsic metal value will increase.|$|E
25|$|As {{a medium}} of exchange, money {{facilitates}} trade. It {{is essentially a}} measure of value and more importantly, a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with barter (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate double coincidence of wants {{as to what is}} exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1948, the Bank deutscher Länder ("Bank of German States") assumed responsibility, {{followed}} in 1957 by the Deutsche Bundesbank.

It became a source of national pride and an anchor for the country's economic prosperity, particularly during the years of the Wirtschaftswunder in the 1950s. In the 1990s, opinion polls showed a majority of Germans opposed to the adoption of the euro; polls today show a significant number would prefer to return to the mark.|$|E

50|$|The British {{did not use}} a {{standardized}} currency for over 250 years after settling in Canada.During that time, most trade was carried out through the practice of bartering. Eventually, traders began using various foreign coins as <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> <b>value.</b> In order to trade with Indians, the Hudson’s Bay Company standardized the unit of account as the Made Beaver, or one high quality beaver skin.|$|R

25|$|After depreciating {{during the}} last quarter of 2003/04, the afghani has been appreciating steadily, gaining 8 percent against the U.S. dollar between end-March 2004 and end-July 2004. This appreciation, at a time of {{increasing}} inflation, appears to reflect a greater willingness by the population to use the afghani as a medium of exchange and as a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value.</b> This trend appears to be attributable to the relative stability of the exchange rate since the introduction of the new currency, administrative measures aimed at promoting its use, such as the requirement that shopkeepers must price goods in afghani. Donors are increasingly making payments in afghani instead of U.S. dollars and this appears to be widely accepted.|$|E
25|$|These factors led to {{the shift}} of the <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold, {{and at one point}} there was bronze as well. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the {{individual}} taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new unit of account, which helped lead to banking. Archimedes' principle provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their fine weight of metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see Numismatics).|$|E

The Central Bank of Iran indicate that 70 percent of the Iranians own homes with huge amounts of idle money entering the housing market. However, if the stock market grows stronger, it will undoubtedly attract idle capital. In terms of investment, the domestic rival markets of the bourse are the Iranian real estate market, cars and gold (with gold {{being used as a}} <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> a hedging tool against hyperinflation and the devaluation of the Rial). According to Goldman Sachs, Iran is forecast to reach the highest economic growth between 2015 and 2025 and join the world's largest economies (world's 12th economy by 2025). Since 2012, TSE has served as a safe heaven against international sanctions and inflation.|$|E

25|$|The {{performance}} of gold bullion is often compared to stocks as different investment vehicles. Gold is regarded {{by some as}} a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> (without growth) whereas stocks are regarded as a return on value (i.e., growth from anticipated real price increase plus dividends). Stocks and bonds perform best in a stable political climate with strong property rights and little turmoil. The attached graph shows the value of Dow Jones Industrial Average divided by the price of an ounce of gold. Since 1800, stocks have consistently gained value in comparison to gold {{in part because of the}} stability of the American political system. This appreciation has been cyclical with long periods of stock outperformance followed by long periods of gold outperformance. The Dow Industrials bottomed out a ratio of 1:1 with gold during 1980 (the end of the 1970s bear market) and proceeded to post gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The gold price peak of 1980 also coincided with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the threat of the global expansion of communism. The ratio peaked on January 14, 2000 a value of 41.3 and has fallen sharply since.|$|E
500|$|In January 1791, at {{the request}} of Congress, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton issued a report on the currency. [...] At the time, there was no mint in the United States; foreign coins were used. Hamilton {{proposed}} a monetary system based on bimetallism, in which the new currency would be equal to a given amount of gold, or a larger amount of silver; at the time a given weight of gold was worth about 15 times as much as the same amount of silver. Although Hamilton understood that adjustment might be needed from time to time as precious metal prices fluctuated, he believed that if the nation's unit of value were defined only by one of the two precious metals used for coins, the other would descend to the status of mere merchandise, unusable as a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value.</b> He also proposed the establishment of a mint, at which citizens could present gold or silver, and receive it back, struck into money. On April 2, 1792, Congress passed the Mint Act of 1792. This legislation defined a unit of value for the new nation, to be known as a dollar. The new unit of currency was defined to be equal to [...] of gold, or alternatively, [...] of silver, establishing a ratio of value between gold and silver of 15:1. The legislation also established the Mint of the United States.|$|E

Consequently, some proponents of the intrinsic theory of value believe that the near-zero marginal cost of production of the current fiat dollar detracts from its attractiveness as a medium of exchange and <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> because a fiat currency without a marginal cost of production is easier to debase via overproduction and the subsequent inflation of the money supply.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the context}} of BoP and {{international}} monetary systems, [...] the reserve asset is the currency or other <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> that is primarily used by nations for their foreign reserves.

[...] In the Bretton Woods system, either gold or the U.S. dollar could serve as the reserve asset, though its smooth operation depended on countries apart from the US choosing to keep most of their holdings in dollars.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} many {{historical}} disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient {{to deal with them}} all. One of these arguments is that the role of money as a medium of exchange is in conflict with its role as a store of value: its role as a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> <b>value</b> requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate. [...] Others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time.
