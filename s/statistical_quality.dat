2500|$|The Deming Prize is [...] one of {{the highest}} awards on TQM (Total Quality Management) in the world that recognizes both {{individuals}} for their contributions to the field of Total Quality Management (TQM) and businesses that have successfully implemented TQM. [...] It was established in 1951 to honor W. Edwards Deming who contributed greatly to Japan’s proliferation of <b>statistical</b> <b>quality</b> control after World War II. His teachings helped Japan build its foundation by which the level of Japan’s product quality has been recognized as the highest in the world, was originally designed to reward Japanese companies for major advances in quality improvement. Over the years it has grown, under the guidance of the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) to where it is now also available to non-Japanese companies, albeit usually operating in Japan, and also to individuals recognized as having made major contributions to the advancement of quality. The awards ceremony is broadcast every year in Japan on national television.|$|E

40|$|Considering the {{recently}} established arbitrariness the Schrödinger equation {{has to be}} interpreted as an equation of motion for a statistical ensemble of particles. The <b>statistical</b> <b>qualities</b> of individual particles derive from the unknown intrinsic energy components, they depend on the physical environment by way of external potentials. Due to these <b>statistical</b> <b>qualities</b> and wave function normalization, non-locality is inherent to the fundamental relations of Planck, de Broglie and Schrödinger. A local formulation of these statements is introduced and briefly assessed, the modified and local Schrödinger equation is non-linear. Quantum measurements are analyzed in detail, the exact interplay between causal and statistical reasons in a measurement process can be accounted for. Examples of individual measurement effects in quantum theory are given, the treatment of diffraction experiments, neutron interferences, quantum erasers, the quantum Zeno effect, and interaction-free measurements can be described consistent with the suggested framework. The paper additionally provides a strictly local and deterministic calculation of interactions in a magnetic field. The results suggest that quantum theory is a statistical formalism which derives its validity in measurements from considering every possible measurement of a given system. It can equally be established, that the framework of quantum physics is theoretically incomplete, because a justification of ensemble qualities is not provided...|$|R

40|$|Maps are a {{frequently}} used tool {{to portray the}} Census Bureau’s data and highlight spatial patterns that provide context and significance for the characteristics displayed. Maps provide visually what tables and other graphics cannot: {{a picture of the}} data, their distribution over geographic areas, and a means for interpreting the data shown by color, symbology, or explanation provided as annotations or as part of the map legend. The value of maps in enhancing an understanding of census data is well established as demonstrated by their frequent use in the media following the release of census data products. Mapping census data is common throughout government, academia, and the private sector. Casual users of maps of statistical data may not look past what is interesting visually to analyze the underlying data that a map depicts. However, that does not absolve the mapmaker of the responsibility for informing users of the <b>statistical</b> <b>qualities</b> associated with the mapped values. The Census Bureau set new standards for communicating the <b>statistical</b> <b>qualities</b> of estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) by including information on the level of sampling error (specifically, margins of error) associated with every ACS estimate. Now, efforts are underway to develop an operational tool that will make it possible for geographic information systems (GIS) users to communicate this information through map products as well. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The Fisher {{information}} matrix (FIM) {{is a critical}} quantity in several aspects of system identification, including input selection and confidence region calculation. Analytical determination of the FIM in a general system identification setting may be difficult or almost impossible due to intractable modeling requirements and/or high-dimensional integration. A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation-based technique was introduced by the second author to address these difficulties [1]. This paper proposes {{an extension of the}} MC algorithm in order to enhance the <b>statistical</b> <b>qualities</b> of the estimator of the FIM. This modified MC algorithm is particularly useful in those cases where the FIM has a structure with some elements being analytically known from prior information and the others being unknown. The estimator of the FIM, obtained by using the proposed MC algorithm, simultaneously preserve...|$|R
