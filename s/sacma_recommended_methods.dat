40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to correct for the effects of coagulometers on the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) in a series of {{collaborative}} studies. Modified ISI were derived from the prothrombin time results with coagulometer systems using a range of calibrated plasmas. Two alternative approaches to correction of the ISI were evaluated. The first relied on the consensus orthogonal regression slopes of the prothrombin times for each coagulometer system plotted against the consensus manual results; the second depended on the local individual slope of the prothrombin times for each instrument. The two procedures were compared with the currently <b>recommended</b> <b>method</b> where International Normalised Ratios (INR) are derived from the manual ISI of the thromboplastin. The <b>recommended</b> <b>method</b> gave a significant bias from the manual results with most coagulometers. In contrast, the local correction procedure gave no significant biases, whereas the consensus method did so in a few instances. Both these correction procedures seem more reliable than the <b>recommended</b> <b>method</b> of INR derivation, but the local correction is more accurate and offers a more practical solution by allowing laboratories to determine their own corrected ISI on a range of calibrated plasmas...|$|R

40|$|Background: Birth is {{probably}} considered {{as the most}} highly dangerous event in every oneâ€™s life. Although a few percent of newborns may require resuscitation in this stage, wrong methods or failures would lead to death or leave some irreversible complications. That {{is why it is}} of great importance to learn the proper methods and become skilful in resuscitation. This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of conventional and <b>recommended</b> <b>methods</b> of teaching resuscitation to nursery students. Methods: The research is an interventionalâ€“semi experimental study. The samples were 46 nursery students of the third semester who were divided into two groups of 23 according to their place of residence. The resuscitation was taught through the conventional and <b>recommended</b> <b>methods.</b> The conventional method consists of teaching all the theoretical subjects by different instructors and performing the related team work. In <b>recommended</b> <b>method</b> the time specified to theoretical subjects is less, and most of the subjects are somehow included in practical work. A pretest was given in the two groups and after the training a final theoretical and practical test was held through the OSCE methods. The findings were analysed by using the SPSS software and some statistical tests as: Mann Whitney U-test, Independent sample t-test, Pearson correlation, paired t-test. Findings: The findings of this study show that there is {{no significant difference between the}} primary knowledge of the students in the two groups. The post-test scores are higher in both groups and the difference is significant which suggests that training has been efficient in both groups. Comparing the post-test scores (practical and theoretical) shows no significant difference. There is no significant difference between the increase in practical and theoretical scores of both groups either. Conclusions: considering less time (1 / 2) and lower costs (1 / 4) spent on training in the <b>recommended</b> <b>method,</b> there was no change in efficiency...|$|R
