5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{died at the}} Hasani palace on 5 April 902, at the age {{of either}} 40 or 47. There were rumours that he had been poisoned, but {{it is more likely that}} the rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, {{severely}} weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow the advice of his physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. He left behind him four sons and several daughters. Al-Mu'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried within the walls of Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid palace in the western part of the city, which was now used by the caliphs as a <b>secondary</b> <b>residence.</b>|$|E

25|$|Capital gains tax: MPs {{were able}} to {{designate}} a property as their second home with the parliamentary fees office so as to claim the cost of renovating it on expenses, {{but a number of}} MPs had concurrently described a property as their second home to claim expenses, and to the UK tax authority HM Revenue and Customs as their primary residence in order to sell it without capital gains tax. Some also designated a property as a primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>residence</b> for tax or expenses benefits which was apparently little if at all used by them in that role.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{in the number}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>residences</b> is a phenomenon which has affected the rural space of Romania after 1990, especially in the mountain area. In order to emphasize its impact, the present paper studies the case of villages in the Gilău-Muntele Mare Mountains. By studying the bibliography and the statistical data we got the general picture of this case and by interviewing regional and local authorities the real extent of the matter revealed. It resulted that in this area, <b>secondary</b> <b>residences</b> phenomena led to spatial and functional impact upon rural space and to social and economic consequences on local communities: <b>secondary</b> <b>residences</b> transform rural space into one with tourist characteristics: implantation of a suite of <b>secondary</b> <b>residences,</b> the local councils collect more taxes but also deal with overwhelmed facilities and pollution, while the native people copy a different lifestyle. In some cases, ownership transfer towards city residents or the small villages taken over by non-resident people speak of the extreme transformation of the rural space...|$|R
500|$|In 1351, Sir William Douglas {{gave the}} lands of Aberdour to his nephew, Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith, {{although}} he retained the castle for himself until his death two years later. The grant was confirmed by King David II in 1361. In 1386 Aberdour and Dalkeith were combined to form a single barony, with the principal seat at Dalkeith, near Edinburgh, and Aberdour as a <b>secondary</b> <b>residence.</b> James, fourth Lord Dalkeith, succeeded to the joint barony in 1456, and was created Earl of Morton in 1458, prior to his marriage to Joanna, the [...] daughter of James I. The newly created earl expanded the existing hall house, heightening and rebuilding the structure to suit his elevated status. The second earl carried out extensions to Aberdour Castle around 1500, building a new stair tower and south block.|$|E
2500|$|The White House in Washington, D.C. {{serves as}} the {{official}} place of residence for the president. As well as access to the White House staff, facilities available to the president include medical care, recreation, housekeeping, and security services. The government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food; the high food bill often amazes new residents. Camp David, officially titled Naval Support Facility Thurmont, is a mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, used as a country retreat and for high alert protection {{of the president and}} guests. Blair House, located next to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House Complex and Lafayette Park, is a complex of four connected townhouses exceeding [...] of floor space that {{serves as the}} president's official guest house and as a <b>secondary</b> <b>residence</b> for the president if needed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new owner}} was Francis Fane, a {{barrister}} and Member of Parliament. The Fanes completed the interior decoration {{of the state}} rooms, but other than this they are remarkable only for their various eccentricities rather than their structural alterations. Francis Fane lived at Brympton d'Evercy for 26 years before bequeathing it to his brother Thomas, who became the 8th Earl of Westmorland. Thus once again the house became a <b>secondary</b> <b>residence.</b> The house {{seems to have been}} left largely empty until the time of John 10th Earl. This amorous adventurer [...] had taken as his second wife Jane Saunders, so wildly eccentric that she was described by Charles Fox as :"...perhaps not mad, but nobody ever approached so near it with so much reason". The Countess decided to shock conventional society and leave her husband, taking her daughter Lady Georgiana Fane with her. This unconventional pair of ladies set up home at Brympton d'Evercy. The countess was responsible for installing the classical fireplaces which remain in situ today, and assembling the furniture and art collection which remained at Brympton until it was dispersed in a large sale in the late 1950s.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the top of}} he social {{structure}} of Paris was the nobility, led by the King and his court. [...] Both Louis XVIII and Charles X lived in the Tuileries Palace, and used the Chateau of Saint-Cloud as their main <b>secondary</b> <b>residence.</b> The ancient and decayed Tuileries was not a comfortable residence; [...] it had no basement or sewers, {{and the lack of}} modern plumbing made it foul-smelling; [...] one noblewoman, the Countess of Boigne, [...] reported that [...] "one is almost suffocated climbing the staircases of the Pavillon de Flore and crossing the corridors of the second floor." [...] The Kings did not carry on the elaborate social protocols and festivities of their predecessors; [...] both had lived many years in exile, and they were used to a simpler life. [...] The formal and grand ceremony of the King's waking up and going to bed was replaced by a simple ceremony each evening at nine clock, when the King gave {{the order of the day}} to the commander and captains of the King's guards. [...] The King had to live within a household budget, fixed at the beginning of each year; twenty five million livres for Louis XVIII and twenty million for Charles X.|$|E
