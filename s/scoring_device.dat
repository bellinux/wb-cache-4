The embedded detection models typically consist of <b>scoring</b> <b>devices</b> relating fraud indicators to some measure of suspicion of fraud. In practice these scoring models often focus on minimizing the error rate rather than on the cost of (mis) classification. We show that focusing on cost is a profitable approach.

The findings suggest that with claim amount information available at screening time detection rules can be accommodated to increase expected profits. Our results show the value of cost-sensitive claim fraud screening and provide guidance on how to render this strategy operational. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of HIV antiretroviral therapy into decentralized rural settings will increasingly require simple point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests {{that can be}} used without laboratory infrastructure and technical skills. New POC test devices are becoming available but decisions around which technologies to deploy may be biased without systematic assessment of their suitability for decentralized healthcare settings. To address this, we developed a standardized, quantitative scorecard tool to objectively evaluate the operational characteristics of POC diagnostic <b>devices.</b> The tool <b>scores</b> <b>devices</b> on a scale of 1 - 5 across 30 weighted characteristics such as ease of use, quality control, electrical requirements, shelf life, portability, cost and service, and provides a cumulative score that ranks products against a set of ideal POC characteristics.

A leading theory proposes that wartime exposures initiated prolonged production of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and central nervous system injury. The endogenous antioxidant L-carnosine (B-alanyl-L-histidine) is a potential treatment since it is a free radical scavenger in nervous tissue. To determine if nutritional supplementation with L-carnosine would significantly improve pain, cognition and fatigue in GWI, a randomized double blind placebo controlled 12 week dose escalation study involving 25 GWI subjects was employed. L-carnosine was given as 500, 1000, and 1500 mg increasing at 4 week intervals.

This paper describes measurement methodology and prototype design of a home-care sleep <b>scoring</b> <b>device.</b> The proposed solution is oriented towards lowcost equipment and easy-to-use data capture using contactless recording as far as possible. Unlike the regular laboratory systems, the quality of sleep is estimated from the video-recorded subject motion, audio-recorded acoustic effects and from the single-lead electrocardiogram being the only electrical signal recorded from the body surface. The presented prototype is built of consumer-grade devices working in a short-distance network and providing multimodal data. The information provided from different modes are partly redundant, giving opportunity for refinement of the accuracy, and partly complementary, widening the aspect of sleep analysis. ...|$|E

Cap arrangement tests (e. g. Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue, Farnsworth D- 15, L'Anthony D- 15 Desaturated, etc.) are among the most valid and reliable color vision tests to quantify color deficits currently available. However, these tests, particularly the FM 100, are time consuming to score and are highly susceptible to transcription errors. Researchers at the University of Missouri-St. Louis have developed the Automatic Cap Arrangement <b>Scoring</b> <b>Device</b> (ACASD) to significantly reduce testing time and improve measurement reliability of cap arrangement tests by electronically automating scoring and data entry. Once the patient places the caps in the test tray, the rest will be automatic [...] scoring, data entry and printing of results.

40|$|The {{prognosis}} of peritoneal carcinomatosis {{under the}} current standardized treatment regimens is poor concerning overall survival and {{is associated with a}} reduced quality of life. Recently, the development of new multimodal therapeutical concepts led to a prolonged overall survival and improved quality of life. However, all previously published clinical studies are based on hypothetical considerations and empirical data. Now various animal models have been developed to examine different aspects of this area of research. This study is establishing an animal model to investigate even complex multimodal therapeutic regimen for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis and is demonstrating a successful surgical tumour debulking in rats with peritoneal surface malignancy. To compare results and outcome, a <b>scoring</b> <b>device</b> to assess peritoneal tumour spread is necessary. In this study a scoring system, the experimental Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index, (ePCI) was developed and evaluated. Furthermore, it is shown that adjuvant treatment concepts can be implemented in an animal model in high technical quality and reliability. The different adjuvant intraoperative therapy regimens like HIPEC (Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy) with Mitomycin C, HIPEC with Gemcitabine, Taurolodin solution or photodynamic therapy in combination with surgical tumour debulking take significant influence on tumour load and ePCI compared to the control group without any treatment. Nevertheless, there is only in the HIPEC (Mitomycin C) treatment group a significant difference in tumour load at the end of experiment in comparison to the other treatment groups. No other significant differences between the other treatment groups in tumour load and ePCI were observed. Mortality and toxicity measured by cardiovascular ultrasound, animal behaviour and changes in body weight, haemoglobin level and leucocyte count is depending on the different treatments respectively the different applied substances. All criteria besides animal behaviour used for screening postoperative toxicity can be used for further studies to examine adverse effects.

40|$|This {{project and}} {{research}} {{has resulted in}} the development of a World Wide Web (WWW) based testing system. WEBassess can be accessed and used from any point in the world that has a connection to the WWW. The WEBassess system allows for the creation and completion of tests through the WWW interface. Scoring and feedback of submitted tests is completely automated, allowing students to see their test result immediately, including visual indicators for correct and incorrect answers. These test results may then be viewed by academic staff, showing complete test details, such as unit code, test title, score, percentage, date and time of test submission plus correct and incorrect answers. Through the logging of this information into the WEBassess database, profiles can be derived, indicating which students are having the most difficulty with certain questions. This information is stated against a student 2 ̆ 7 s identification number. The entire WEBassess system can be administered through a consistent WWW interface, including the addition, deletion and maintenance of pools of questions. User maintenance is also included in this administration module, allowing for the addition, deleting and alteration of Admin, Staff and Student level users. Security is implemented in the form of passwords linked to specific user identification details. A WEBassess user is presented with only the screens which their level of access allows, be it Administration (Admin), Staff or Student. The WEBassess system has been developed using a variety of software and hardware tools, the most crucial of these being an application called Lasso (Blueworld Inc, 1997) and the Filemaker Pro 3 (Claris Corporation, 1997) relational database. The Lasso application communicates with the Filemaker Pro database via a WWW server. The WEBassess system has been designed as a tool for student knowledge testing and feedback, rather than as a traditional assessment and <b>scoring</b> <b>device.</b> Features found in the WEBassess system have been created to comply with specific requirements for Edith Cowan University staff and students, whilst other features have been derived from similar testing systems currently in use on the WWW. The WEBassess system is presently at the level of preliminary user testing, from which initial changes to the system have already taken place. Several future developments for the system are envisaged, to be implemented after a prolonged period of end-user testing on the finalised program...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimenter}} {{had been}} long interested in attempting to find what correlation existed, if any, between self-concept and achievement. During {{his years as a}} teacher and counselor, he had continually been concerned with that student who had been classified as an underachiever, the one who seemed {{to have the ability to}} achieve, but for reasons personal to him was not able to utilize this ability constructively in the academic area of study. Therefor, the assignment of a thesis afforded this writer an opportunity as well as a challenge in working with this type of individual. Being a counselor in a junior high school, he decided to conduct the experimentation within this environment. The grade level selected was grade seven. He selected these seventh grade individuals since they were new to the junior high and therefore had not been previously exposed to any individuals known as counselors. They were also new to departmentalized instruction. This author felt that from the newness aspect, perhaps they would be more receptive to new methods useful in helping themselves to become better students. In attempting to devise a technique in which this experiment could be conducted, various research materials were researched. This author then attempted to identify with any research with which he was familiar. Following the research, group counseling was the technique selected around which the experimentation would be run. In setting up the guidelines for the thesis study, he decided to select only those students classified as underachievers. A questionairre was sent to each elementary principal of the five respective schools asking them to list those prospective seventh graders whom they felt could be classified as underachievers. In addition, a letter was also sent to the respective sixth grade teachers asking their opinions concerning the class of sixth graders they had taught the previous year. All principals and teachers cooperated extremely well by returning their letters with personal notations concerning several students. Having received these lists, the author then turned to the student files where he evaluated each student whose name had appeared on the list with his personal files. By doing so, he was able to eliminate several students who were not classified as underachievers. Having performed this task, he then narrowed the list of students down to sixteen, the number who were involved with the experimentation. Two groups were established with both groups being as homogeneous as this author was able to construct. The sixteen students, eight in each group, consisted of twelve males and four females. These students represented homogeneity of socio-economic status and race as well as academic ability. One group was the experimental group while the second was a control group. The experimental group members became involved in a group counseling program which met twice weekly for at least one hour each meeting. Group counseling offered the students the opportunity to interact with each other and to share those innermost feelings which they had personalized in the past. The group method also allowed the author, who served as group leader, the opportunity to more carefully observe each student and to acquaint himself more personally with the feelings of each member. It should be stated that this author had been involved with group counseling through several instructional classes and as a participant, both as a member and a group leader, thus he felt very capable of professionally running a group experience. The group counseling involved interaction as the most basic technique in attempting to gain insight into each individual's feelings. Sensory awareness techniques were used very minimally in an effort to insure more comfortable feelings with group interaction. The experimental group also took the Otis-Lennon Mental Ability Test, Form J, Intermediate and the California Test of Personality. These two testing devices we-re-selected after careful research into various testing instruments. The control group was active only as far as taking the two tests mentioned above. They were not involved in any group counseling whatsoever and received individual counseling only when they referred themselves. Following the conclusion of the group sessions and of the testing procedures, all tests were scored and evaluated. These test scores were assembled into an apporpriate order through which comparisons were discovered and calculated. The scores were set up as to measure the pretest and post test of the same test within the same group [...] This resulted in a score for one group alone. By using this device, four samples resulted; two samples for each group. From research and fro. : meetings with the writer's committee, it was decided to utilize the t-score for the measurement technique of the test results. This <b>scoring</b> <b>device</b> was utilized in most experiments researched. It was also determined to be the most valid and effective measure for this type of experimentation. In order to calculate the t-score on any sample, it was first necessary to extract the mean, the standard deviation, the deviation of the mean, the correlation, and the standard error of measurement. These various terms were explained in much detail within the body of the thesis. Thus, a t-score resulted within the following samples:(1) Experimental Group Otis Lennon Mental Ability(2) Experimental Group - California Test of Personality(3) Control Group - Otis Lennon Mental Ability Test(4) Control Group - California Test of PersonalityThe t-scores were tested at the. 05 level of significance to determine whether or not any significant findings had resulted. In each of the four samples no significance was found. In order to obtain a more accurate calculation, a pooled t-score was run on the post test results of the tests administered. Thus a t-score resulted from the following tests:(1) Otis Lennon Mental Ability Test: Experimental Group post test with Control Group post test(2) California Test of Personality: Experimental Group post test with Control Group post testThis t-score resulted in a nonsignificant reading at the. 05 level of significance. Even though the results of this hypothesis were not such as to allow this experimenter to show significant findings, neither was he able to discard that which had been performed. In the statistical data collected, the writer perceived several directional patterns which had developed. A few students in the study did not gain whatsoever in self concept or achievement according to test results. There were two students whose post test scores were less than their pretest scores which demonstrated a decrease in self-concept and achievement as measured by the two testing instruments. This demonstrated that even though the hypothesis had failed in gaining overall gains in the areas under study, it had succeeded in improving those stated qualities of a few students. This was a pleasing discovery and it did give hope to the experimenter that some positive signs of growth did accompany this thesis. Thus, in a few students there was a definite correlation between self-concept and achievement even though it was not significant in, the overall picture. From this experimentation additional group counseling sessions have begun with students classified as underachievers. These students are being tested in similar patterns as were the students in the thesis experiment. This author believes that by experimenting with various techniques within the group setting, by experimenting with various testing devices, and by performing additional research into this stated area of study, a correlation may be found and a significant method of attacking this dilemma may be discovered. This would allow this author to more validly work with the underachiever in assisting him to find his place in society by perceiving a greater sense of worth in himself. Although this thesis has not shown any significant pattern in the findings resulting from the study, it has laid the groundwork for a continuation of work within this area. It has created hope that the underachiever can be assisted in a valid manner in such a tray as to help him help himself to greater challenges and greater rewards in his personal future.

Little {{is known about the}} regional variability in the resulting mottled skin appearance on the sun-exposed parts of the body in the elderly. The relationship between these features and the dermal atrophy related to aging is also an area ripe for study. The aim {{of the present study was}} to objectively assess and compare such aspects of photoaging in older subjects. A computer-assisted video camera equipped with an internal ultraviolet-emitting unit (Visioscan) was used in combination with image analysis to quantify the infraclinical mottling of the skin on the forehead, neck and dorsal forearm. A Densi <b>Score</b> <b>device</b> served to assess the dermal atrophy by rating the skin folding capacity. A mottled subclinical melanoderma was disclosed on the three evaluation sites in all subjects irrespective of their phototypes. Three main patterns were identified corresponding to regular perifollicular dots, streaky macules along shallow wrinkles and unevenly shaped macules in the interfollicular area. The extent in melanoderma was larger on the forehead than on the neck and forearm. The age after 60 years did not influence the severity of mottled melanoderma, but clearly altered the skin folding capacity. The greatest inter-individual differences in mottled melanoderma were found in phototype II subjects. In conclusion, infraclinical mottled melanoderma is present in all individuals after 60 years of age. This type of epidermal photoaging does not appear to be influenced in older ages. By contrast, skin laxity due to dermal aging continues to progress beyond the age of 60 years. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|A final is {{included}} in most air pistol championships, although not in the World Junior Championships. The top eight shooters advance to the final. In case of a tie for eighth place, shooters with stronger ending were previously preferred. [...] The score zones are divided into tenths (by means of a special gauge, {{in the absence of}} automatic <b>scoring</b> <b>devices),</b> so that each hit can give up to 10.9 points. After a three-minute preparation time, during which the shooters are introduced to the audience, and a five-minute sighting shot period, separate commands are given for each competition shot with a time limit of 50 seconds per shot. Starting from 2013, the final consists of 2 strings of 3 shots, after which for every two additional shots, the lowest scoring finalist will be dropped. This continues until only two finalists left making the final two shots for the gold. Hence the last two men would have 20 shots in total. Due to this new rule, all pre-2013 finals record will be erased.The ISSF announced that all finals from 2017 onward will have an additional 2 shots per initial string for a total of 24 shots fired in the final.The current record of 2013 will be considered as provisional, until the end of 2013 which the ISSF will decide whether to scrap the final record altogether from then on, or keep them. The final score is added to the qualification score with the aggregate deciding the final ranking. Any post-final ties are broken by a single extra shot.|$|R
40|$|AbstractForty years ago, {{autologous}} fascial slings {{became the}} gold standard {{in the treatment of}} genuine stress incontinence. In 1996, a synthetic material sling was introduced to the urogynecological literature known as tension-free vaginal tape. Some years later, another synthetic tape was introduced through a novel trajectory: transobturator. Due the conception of most polypropylene synthetic tapes, <b>scores</b> of <b>devices,</b> applicators and tape designs evolved. Now, with reports surfacing in the urologic literature on the adverse events of synthetic tapes and their potentially fatal complications, it is prudent to endeavor once more the place of autologous pubovaginal sling. This review addresses the evolution of pubovaginal slings and milestones of its journey to its current position in surgery of incontinence...|$|R
