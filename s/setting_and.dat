30|$|The {{concepts}} of minimal open <b>sets</b> <b>and</b> maximal open <b>sets</b> in topological spaces are introduced and considered by Nakaoka and Oda in [1, 2, 3]. More precisely, in 2001, Nakaoka and Oda [2] characterized minimal open <b>sets</b> <b>and</b> proved that any subset of a minimal open set is pre-open. Also, as {{an application of}} a theory of minimal open sets, they obtained a sufficient condition for a locally finite space to be a pre-Hausdorff space. The authors in [3] obtained fundamental properties of maximal open sets such as decomposition theorem for a maximal open <b>set</b> <b>and</b> established basic properties of intersections of maximal open sets, such as the law of radical closure. By a dual concept of minimal open <b>sets</b> <b>and</b> maximal open <b>sets,</b> the authors in [1] introduced the {{concepts of}} minimal closed <b>sets</b> <b>and</b> maximal closed <b>sets,</b> <b>and</b> obtained some results easily by dualizing the known results regarding minimal open <b>sets</b> <b>and</b> maximal open <b>sets.</b>|$|R

5|$|After GoldenEye 007 was released, Rare began {{development}} of a spiritual successor titled Perfect Dark. Using an upgraded version of the GoldenEye 007 game engine, Perfect Dark was released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. Although the game features a <b>setting</b> <b>and</b> storyline unrelated to James Bond, it shares many gameplay features, including a similar control scheme, mission objectives that vary with the difficulty <b>setting,</b> <b>and</b> cheat options unlockable through quick level completions. While Perfect Dark was still in development, Martin Hollis left Rare {{to work as a}} consultant {{on the development of the}} GameCube at Nintendo of America. He would then form his own company, Zoonami, in 2000. Other members of the GoldenEye 007 team also left Rare to form Free Radical Design. The company would develop the TimeSplitters first-person shooters for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox. These games contain several references to GoldenEye 007, including the design of the health-HUD, the nature of the aiming system, and the dam setting of the opening level of TimeSplitters 2.|$|E
