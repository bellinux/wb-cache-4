5000|$|In {{the court}} of Travancore king Marthanda Varma (1706-1758) and his {{successor}} Dharma Raja Kartika Tirunal Rama Varma, there flourished a number of poets distinguished in several ways. Ramapurathu Warrier (1703-1753), the author of Kuchela Vrittam Vanchippattu, was one of them. The Vanchippattu or Boat song is a poetic form of folk origin composed entirely in the Dravidian metre nathonnata. Kunchan Nambiar (1705-1770), the founder of Thullal and its rich literature, is often considered as the master of Malayalam satirist poetry. Born in Killikkurussimangalam, he spent his boyhood at Kudamalur and youth at Ambalappuzha. 1748 he moved to {{the court of}} Marthanda Varma and later to the court of his successor Dharma Raja.

He used pure Malayalam as opposed to the stylised and Sanskritised Malayalam language of Chakkiyar Koothu.

There are three kinds of Tullal distinguished {{on the basis of the}} performer's costume and the style of rendering, viz., Ottan, Sitankan and Parayan.

50|$|An {{important}} component of maximizing height in a vertical jump is attributed {{to the use of}} counter-movements of the legs and arm swings prior to take off, as both of these actions have been shown to significantly increase the body’s center of mass rise. The counter-movement of the legs, a quick bend of the knees which lowers the center of mass prior to springing upwards, has been shown to improve jump height by 12% compared to jumping without the counter-movement. This is attributed to the stretch shortening cycle of the leg muscles enabling the muscles to create more contractile energy. Furthermore, jump height can be increased another 10% by executing arm swings during the take off phase of the jump compared to if no arm swings are utilized. This involves lowering the arms distally and posteriorly during the leg counter-movements, and powerfully thrusting the arms up and over the head as the leg extension phase begins. As the arms complete the <b>swinging</b> <b>movement</b> they pull up on the lower body causing the lower musculature to contract more rapidly, hence aiding in greater jump height.In order to maximize vertical jump height an athlete must be willing apply and develop the specific jump training principles of strength, power and reactiveness. Correctly prescribed and programmed vertical jump training protocols will optimize both the force producing and elastic properties of the musculotendinous system within the lower limbs.|$|E

40|$|Publisher横浜The frontal {{wielding}} exercise (Shomen Suburi) is {{an essential}} exercise for Kendo players to learn correct shinai maneuver and hitting movement. Here, {{by looking at the}} electric discharge map of the body muscles, we shall com-rare the two representative methods in the frontal wielding exercise. In Method A, a player finishes his <b>swinging</b> <b>movement</b> when his right fist reaches the right shoulder's height. In Method B, the right fist is to halt at the chest height, with shinai's tip (Kensen) {{at the height of the}} crown of the player's head, allowing maximum stability of he upper body and power at shinai's tip. The reacting time and the amount of muscular electric discharge, along with the speed of shinai's tip, show that for both beginning students and experienced players the Method B is a more preferable choice. Once the "left" fist is also given the due attention to fully complete its <b>swinging</b> <b>movement,</b> he body muscles can yield the most efficient striking power and the whole hitting movement becomes remarkably smooth. Because players can perform frontal wielding exercise casually without partners, and because it provides basic training for all Kendo players regardless of their experience, the teaching of the "correct" method is crucial. A study by Fukumoto et al. (1982) reports the most efficient, relaxed strikes are achieved after a rapid, hard exercise and brief rest. Our hope is that regular practice by the Method B will guide players to strike efficiently without excess energy. The fists must be positioned at the correct height at the end of wielding movement, and the chest height for the right fist is most appropriate. Method B is also the best in simulating the confrontation in real matches and we must necessarily conclude it is well suited for coaching in contemporary Kendo...|$|E

Cutaneous reflexes were evoked in ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle by stimulating (in random order) the sural nerve (SUR), the distal tibial nerve (TIB), and combined simultaneous stimulation of both nerves (TIB&SUR). Reflexes were evoked while participants performed rhythmic stepping and arm <b>swinging</b> <b>movement</b> with both arms and the leg contralateral to stimulation (ARM&LEG), with just arm movement (ARM) and with just contralateral leg movement (LEG).

Here we report the {{discovery}} of a new species that is also the largest onychophoran found so far, a 22 cm long female from the Caribbean coastal forest of Costa Rica. Specimens were examined with Scanning Electron Microscopy; Peripatus solorzanoi sp. nov., is diagnosed as follows: primary papillae convex and conical with rounded bases, with more than 18 scale ranks. Apical section large, spherical, with a basal diameter of at least 20 ranks. Apical piece with 6 - 7 scale ranks. Outer blade 1 principal tooth, 1 accessory tooth, 1 vestigial accessory tooth (formula: 1 / 1 / 1); inner blade 1 principal tooth, 1 accessory tooth, 1 rudimentary accessory tooth, 9 to 10 denticles (formula: 1 / 1 / 1 / 9 - 10). Accessory tooth blunt in both blades. Four pads in the fourth and fifth oncopods; 4 th. pad arched.

40|$|Functional {{electrical}} stimulation (FES) and robotic exoskeletons are two important technologies widely used for physical rehabilitation of paraplegic patients. We developed a hybrid rehabilitation system (FEXO Knee) that combined FES and an exoskeleton for <b>swinging</b> <b>movement</b> control of human knee joints. This study proposed a novel cooperative control strategy, which could realize arbitrary distribution of torque generated by FES and exoskeleton, and guarantee harmonic movements. The cooperative control adopted feedfoward control for FES and feedback control for exoskeleton. A parameter regulator {{was designed to}} update key parameters in real time to coordinate FES controller and exoskeleton controller. Two muscle groups (quadriceps and hamstrings) were stimulated to generate active torque for knee joint in synchronization with torque compensation from exoskeleton. The knee joint angle and the interactive torque between exoskeleton and shank were used as feedback signals for the control system. Central pattern generator (CPG) was adopted that acted as a phase predictor to deal with phase confliction of motor patterns, and realized synchronization between the two different bodies (shank and exoskeleton). Experimental evaluation of the hybrid FES-exoskeleton system was conducted on five healthy subjects and four paraplegic patients. Experimental results and statistical analysis showed good control performance of the cooperative control on torque distribution, trajectory tracking, and phase synchronization...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a quantitative {{description of the}} leg movement of a stick insect walking in three different situations, namely walking tethered on a treadwheel, on a slippery glass plate and walking free on a horizontal plane. These descriptions concern the trajectories {{of the end of}} the tibia and the changes of the femur-tibia joint (gamma), the coxa-trochanter joint (beta) and the movement of the thoracic-coral joint of all three pairs of legs. As the latter joint comprises a ball and socket joint, the changes of the position of the rotational axis of this joint have been measured. No simple rule could be found which allowed the control of more than one joint of a leg by a common control parameter. Co-ordination of the joints of one leg seems to be simpler during the swine than during the stance movement. Measurements of the forces at the end of the <b>swing</b> <b>movement</b> indicate that there is no information transfer between legs with respect to an expected height of the ground at the end of the <b>swing</b> <b>movement,</b> nor is there an internal ''expectation'' which may have led to a decrease of force before probable ground contact. ...|$|R
