Kemper showed {{particular}} disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders {{at the same time}} in Santa Cruz as Kemper. He described Mullin as [...] "just a cold-blooded killer... killing everybody he saw for no good reason". However, Kemper himself commented on his [...] "self-righteous talking like that , considering what [...] done". Despite this concession, Kemper still manipulated and physically intimidated the diminutive Mullin, who, standing at , was over a foot shorter than Kemper. Kemper stated that [...] " [...] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so I threw water on him to <b>shut</b> <b>him</b> <b>up.</b> Then, when he was a good boy, I'd give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective, because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That's called behavior modification treatment." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Earth Angel" [...] was {{recorded}} as a literal garage demo—it {{was recorded}} in a home garage at the Los Angeles home of Ted Brinson (a relative of Williams who had previously played bass for the Jimmie Lunceford and Andy Kirk bands). The home was located at 2190 West 30th Street in South Los Angeles. The garage {{was used as the}} primary recording space of Dootsie Williams for all of his Dootone artists, and had also been used to record demos for Jessie Mae Robinson. It was recorded on a single-track Ampex tape recorder, owned by big band veteran Ted Brinson, who performs bass guitar on the track. The drums were muffled with pillows so as to not overwhelm the vocals. A neighbor's pet dog stopped many takes by barking. [...] "Everytime the dog barked next door, I'd {{have to go out and}} <b>shut</b> <b>him</b> <b>up,</b> and then we'd do another take," [...] remembered Williams. Williams performs piano on the track, with Preston Epps on bongos (though this unconfirmed), as well as an unknown drummer. The song is composed in the key of E-flat major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 76 beats per minute. Duncan's vocal range spans from C4 to D5. The first five seconds of the intro are cut off of the recording by accident.|$|E

Unfortunately for Guybrush, at this point his rope snaps and he falls {{into a series of}} artificial tunnels. LeChuck confronts Guybrush, claiming to be the mighty pirate's brother, and stalks him through the tunnels, tormenting him with a voodoo doll. Running from LeChuck, Guybrush makes a number of surprising discoveries, including the skeletal remains of his parents in a medical examination room (beneath a large sign reading LOST PARENTS, with an arrow), an elevator to Mêlée Island, and the infrastructure for an amusement park.|$|E

I really only hit him twice, once on my feet, once on the ground. I didn't keep going. I didn't go after him after the ref tried to stop me, it was nothing like that.

2500|$|On 28 November 2000, {{opposition}} politician Oleksandr Moroz publicized secret tape recordings {{which he}} claimed implicated President Kuchma in Gongadze's murder. The recordings {{were said to}} be of discussions between Kuchma, presidential chief of staff Volodymyr Lytvyn, and Interior Minister Yuriy Kravchenko, and were claimed to have been provided by an unnamed SBU officer (later named as Major Mykola Mel'nychenko, Kuchma's bodyguard). The conversations included comments expressing annoyance at Gongadze's writings as well as discussions of ways to <b>shut</b> <b>him</b> <b>up,</b> such as deporting him and arranging from him to be kidnapped and taken to Chechnya. Killing him was, however, not mentioned and doubt was cast on the tapes' authenticity, as the quality of the recordings was poor. Moroz told the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada (parliament) that [...] "the professionally organized disappearance, a slow-moving investigation, disregard for the most essential elements of investigation and incoherent comments by police officials suggest that the case was put together." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That {{is the one thing}} we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can <b>shut</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E
