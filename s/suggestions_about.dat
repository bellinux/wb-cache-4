5|$|Declan McCullagh {{asserts that}} during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the {{prosecution}} significant latitude in making negative <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> Bell's character, and refused requests for a mistrial. McCullagh also asserts that he was subpoenaed by two Treasury Department agents {{to appear before the}} court, without being notified ahead of time as required by federal regulations regarding subpoenas involving the media. Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E
5|$|Ramachandran {{had dreamed}} of making his own film ever since he {{attended}} a screening of Frank Lloyd's historical drama, If I Were King (1938) starring Ronald Colman, in Calcutta. This occurred while he was playing a minor role in Maya Machhindra (1939). He wished {{to make a film}} that would express his political views and interests to the people of Tamil Nadu. To this end, he assembled a team of three people: R. M. Veerappan, V. Lakshmanan and S. K. T. Sami. He gave them <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> the outline of the story and urged them to watch If I Were King and two other films: The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), another Colman film, and Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata! (1952). After several brainstorming sessions, the team came up with a story loosely based on the three films and decided on the title Nadodi Mannan. The trio then helped make it look more Indian.|$|E

Following the vote, the bishops and the Pastoral Provision parishes sent a joint petition to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith requesting the establishment of an ordinariate in the United States and making some <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> how that could be done.|$|E
25|$|Since {{it is at}} {{the limit}} of (or beyond) current {{technology}} to observe individual gas particles (atoms or molecules), only theoretical calculations give <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> how they move, but their motion is different from Brownian motion because Brownian motion involves a smooth drag due to the frictional force of many gas molecules, punctuated by violent collisions of an individual (or several) gas molecule(s) with the particle. The particle (generally consisting of millions or billions of atoms) thus moves in a jagged course, yet not so jagged as would be expected if an individual gas molecule were examined.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{impact of}} Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his {{exposure to the}} opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in The Old Curiosity Shop), and made <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in Oliver Twist. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.|$|E

25|$|During {{this same}} year White and Stieglitz {{undertook}} an artistic experiment {{in which they}} jointly created a series of photographs of two models, Mabel Cramer and another known only as Miss Thompson. Stieglitz offered <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> posing the models, White focused the camera, and {{one or the other}} of them would snap the shutter. White also developed the negatives and printed the photographs. One of the intentions of the experiment was to try a variety of printing techniques and papers, including platinum, gelatin silver and gum bichromate prints. On a few signed of the prints they signed with a monogram that combined both of their initials. During this collaboration, White learned the Autochrome color process from Stieglitz, who had just returned from Europe with this technical knowledge. White and Stieglitz jointly created at least one Autochrome during this time, which they exhibited later in the year.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> a new larger border {{checkpoint}} {{to be built}} on the Norwegian side, as the current station has insufficient capacity to handle increased traffic, and the ground is not sufficiently stable to allow an expansion at the current site. Individual Norwegian police executives {{have called for a}} common {{border checkpoint}} located directly on the border line. This would allow for a more cost-effective and less time-consuming operation. However, Norwegian and Russian legislation, as well as the Schengen Agreement, prohibit such an operation. The Parliament of Norway's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has taken initiative to introduce a 24-hour-a-day opening time at the crossing; this has been rejected by the local police district, who stated that nearly all trans-border traffic is persons and that there is hardly any demand for a night service. Estimates show that border traffic may increase to 400,000 crossings by the mid- to late 2010s. The demand for a larger station remains as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Counseling at the Crossroads: The {{perspectives}} and promise {{of school counselors}} in American education, the largest survey {{of high school and}} middle school counselors in the United States (over 5,300 interviews), was released by the College Board's National Office for School Counselor Advocacy, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the American School Counselor Association. The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance to focus on what they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that school counselors can be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed. The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, Poised to Lead: How School Counselors Can Drive Career and College Readiness, challenging all schools to utilize school counselors for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work of school counselors K-12.|$|E

500|$|In {{the city}} of Cuzco in the late 17th century, the celebration of Corpus Cristi reached a height under Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo (1673–99), with processions through the city {{including}} Inca nobles in ceremonial regalia.

500|$|Hindoo's {{articles}} {{provided a}} comparison of safety matters between Indian and American railway systems, comparisons of management systems and styles and comparisons in train dispatching methods. A main contributor to the ongoing discussion was a reader using the pen name [...] "X", and several other readers also responded. In a response, X stated that the U.S. system was less expensive and more efficient compared to British and Indian methods, and posited whether another system could be used that is both cost effective and safe. Additional reader responses generally concurred with X's opinion, but did not provide solid <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> how to remedy such problems. One respondent stated {{that some of the}} comparisons were faulty as being based upon U.S. railway lines that did not use telegraphic dispatching. This discourse in Railroad Gazette during this time also covered various aspects of problems and flaws in the American railroad system, and potential reforms to remedy these problems.|$|E

500|$|There {{were several}} {{proposals}} made {{either to the}} NSR or by it, to merge or lease or sell the company to other railway companies. The first was in 1849 when the LNWR, using its financial strength, made <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> a merger. To avoid this the NSR had {{to agree to the}} running powers outlined above. A further attempt in 1851 got as far as a parliamentary bill being submitted for amalgamation until the select committee appointed to look at the bill reported against the idea. [...] The LNWR made a further attempt in 1855 which failed because of concerted opposition by the MR, MS and GWR. [...] Less than twenty years later, in 1870, these four companies all combined to look at taking over the NSR following a decision by the NSR board to sell or lease the company. The four rival companies were unable to agree on who would take what share of the NSR and the proposal floundered.|$|E
500|$|Determined to {{make her}} novels as {{accurate}} as possible, Heyer collected reference works and research materials to use while writing. At {{the time of her}} death she owned over 1,000 historical reference books, including Debrett's and an 1808 dictionary of the House of Lords. In addition to the standard historical works about the medieval and eighteenth-century periods, her library included histories of snuff boxes, sign posts, and costumes. She often clipped illustrations from magazine articles and jotted down interesting vocabulary or facts onto note cards, but rarely recorded where she found the information. Her notes were sorted into categories, such as Beauty, Colours, Dress, Hats, Household, Prices, and Shops; and even included details such as the cost of candles in a particular year. Other notebooks contained lists of phrases, covering such topics as [...] "Food and Crockery", [...] "Endearments", and [...] "Forms of Address." [...] One of her publishers, Max Reinhardt, once attempted to offer editorial <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> the language in one of her books but was promptly informed by a member of his staff that no one in England knew more about Regency language than Heyer.|$|E
500|$|Primarily a Broadway actress, Donna Murphy {{had never}} voiced an {{animated}} character prior to Tangled, {{and decided to}} audition for the role spontaneously. Because the film is a musical, all potential voice actors were required to audition a song of their choice; Murphy auditioned the song [...] "Children Will Listen" [...] from the musical Into the Woods. Menken said that Murphy, with whom the composer himself had previously worked on his musical Little Shop of Horrors, [...] "brought musical theater expertise" [...] to the song. Because of the actress' extensive Broadway and musical theatre background, Menken and the directors were open to her ideas and <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> Gothel's music, on one occasion suggesting an alternate arrangement of [...] "Mother Knows Best". Murphy envisioned her character as an entertainer, describing her as [...] "somebody who envisions herself periodically being hit with a spotlight", which ultimately influenced her performance on [...] "Mother Knows Best". The New York Post writer Lou Lumenick felt that, as songwriters, Menken and Slater had given the film's [...] "real showstopper" [...] to Murphy. The Korea Times reported {{that it was only}} after animator Jin Kim heard [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] {{for the first time that}} he conceived a [...] "1940s Hollywood screen siren motif" [...] for Gothel's appearance and personality.|$|E

500|$|With Black Ice, Brendan O'Brien {{tried to}} {{recapture}} the rock sound of AC/DC's early work on albums such as Highway to Hell and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. He thought the two previous studio albums, Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip, were blues-influenced. O'Brien {{tried to focus on}} the choruses, which he felt were {{the best part of the}} AC/DC songs, and encouraged the band to emphasise the [...] "hooky, melodic side" [...] of its song-writing, which Angus complimented, since he had [...] "never been great with harmonies". Mike Fraser said the band aimed [...] "towards The Razors Edge era, a little bit more up-tempo stuff." [...] O'Brien made <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> the band's performance, got Angus to play slide guitar on [...] "Stormy May Day", and told Johnson to swap some screaming for [...] "soul crooning" [...] as Johnson was a soul singer. Johnson was worried that the rest of the band would think this did not suit the band's style of hard rock and roll, but the band was quite receptive. Because of the highly demanding singing style, Johnson only recorded his vocals for one hour a day. The rhythm section continues the basic structure from other AC/DC records; Cliff Williams played bass lines of eighth notes, and Phil Rudd's drumming was a consistent 4/4 time, mostly on his snare, kick drum and hi-hat cymbal. Both musicians expressed contentment with their roles in the band; Rudd said, [...] "I'm not repressing skills. Most drummers are scared to try this", and Williams admitted he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part", but added [...] "n AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it".|$|E

[...] He commented and made <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> the actors' hair.|$|E
2500|$|A new approach, {{which is}} both {{historical}} and comparative, has recently been proposed by E.J. Michael Witzel. He compares collections of mythologies of various cultures, from Iceland and Egypt to the Mayas, and reconstructs increasingly older levels, parallel to but not necessarily dependent on language families (see above). The most prominent common feature is a story line that extends from {{the creation of the}} world and of humans to their end. This feature is found in the northern mythologies of Eurasia and the Americas ("Laurasia") while it is missing in the southern mythologies of Subsaharan Africa, New Guinea and Australia ("Gondwanaland"). The latter is the older one, going back to the dispersal of Homo sapiens out of Africa, some 65,000 years ago. Based on these two reconstructions he offers some <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> the tales of the (genetic) [...] "African Eve". Close attention is paid to the largely parallel developments in archaeology, paleontology, genetics and linguistics. He also makes some <b>suggestions</b> <b>about</b> the persistence of these Stone Age myths in current religions.|$|E
