5|$|<b>Street</b> <b>crime</b> was {{prevalent}} in Indianapolis during the war. The city government increased its police force, local merchants hired private security, and guards were posted at Union Station {{to deal with}} law-enforcement issues. Fights, robberies, gambling, prostitution, and drunkenness became significant problems. Prohibition of alcohol sales had to be established in the city. Because {{there was so much}} street violence, city police never bothered to discover who murdered an officer from Pennsylvania. The bodies of many deceased soldiers killed in the war were held at Indianapolis's Union Station, awaiting transport to their eventual burial spots.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the city's {{population}} {{increased with}} the arrival of new businesses and industries that offered additional employment opportunities, spurred real estate development, and ushered {{in the beginning of the}} city's urban, industrial development. In addition, <b>street</b> <b>crime</b> was prevalent, causing the city government to increase its police force and local merchants to hire private security. The era was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. In May 1863, in an incident sarcastically called the Battle of Pogue's Run, Union soldiers stopped and searched two departing trainloads of delegates to a statewide Democratic convention, many of whom tossed their personal weapons into a nearby creek. In July 1863 Indianapolis residents feared an attack from Confederate forces during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but the Confederates turned east toward Ohio and never came to the city.|$|E

In April 2031 Fargo, now Chief Judge of the United States, personally led his men into action, and over the next twenty years oversaw the growth of his new force. He insisted on the strictest standards of behaviour from his judges, including a rule of celibacy. When he himself broke this rule in 2051, he resigned and then shot himself.

Lisbon, the once great cosmopolitan city, was reduced to the rank of a provincial city with no influence among the higher Spanish nobility who governed from Madrid, their conservative and fundamentalist Catholic capital. Lisbon lost much of its population and its importance to the world economy as its mercantile activity shrank. With economic decline, unemployment and crime increased greatly, adding to the misery of the common people. The Spanish authorities were obliged to introduce a kind of auxiliary police force, the Quadrilheiros, whose members patrolled the streets to control <b>street</b> <b>crime,</b> fights, sorcery and gaming.|$|E

The terminology of <b>street</b> <b>crimes</b> is commonly referred to minor crimes such as vandalism, graffiti, theft, robberies, fights, but the usually open the <b>street</b> to heavier <b>crimes,</b> from drug dealing and prostitution and so on. From the second half of last century (Shaw, McKay) it is accepted that a poor town level, lack of services and maintenace, are good incentives to <b>street</b> <b>crimes.</b> In 1982 Kelling e Wilson wrote a famous paper about “broken windows” where they offer the theory that a broken window is an evidence of lack of interest for the neighborhoods thus inducing a criminal mind to act incorrectly. The solution is of course a town designed on the basis of crime prevention through environmental design, and on this direction are acting some towns, for a limited part of them, due to the costs of the intervention. The great problem is that in our cities a lot of unused buildings exist due to displacement of industries, offices, or simply because they are hold and their upgrade is economically not convenient.

25|$|In Maryland, {{large numbers}} of immigrants, largely Irish and German Catholics, had flooded into Baltimore during the Great Famine in Ireland and the 1848 Revolutions in Germany.

At the same time, planters were a strong force in the state; many Catholic and Episcopalian planters resided on the Eastern Shore, which continued as primarily agricultural. In 1853, the Maryland Know Nothing party was formed, initially from three nativist groups. Yet beginning in February, it took in {{large numbers of}} striking laborers from the ironwork's factory in Baltimore, whom the Democratic Party had refused to support. In opposing the pro-slavery Democrats, the Know Nothings became a powerful, but divisive, party in the state. They were pro-Union, pro-labor, anti-Catholic, and anti-immigrant.|$|E
