5000|$|When the First World War {{started in}} 1914 {{it was the}} habit of ground troops to fire on all aircraft, friend or foe, so {{that the need for}} some form of {{identification}} mark became evident. At first the Union Flag was painted under the wings and {{on the sides of the}} fuselage. It soon became obvious that at a distance the St George's Cross of the Union Flag was likely to be confused with the Iron Cross that was already being used to identify German aircraft. After the use of a Union Flag inside a shield was tried it was decided to follow the lead of the French who used a tricolour cockade (a roundel of red and white with a blue centre). The British reversed the colours and it became the <b>standard</b> <b>marking</b> on Royal Flying Corps aircraft from 11 December 1914, although it was well into 1915 before the new marking was used with complete consistency. The official order stated: All aeroplanes of the RFC to be marked on the underside and on the rudder with concentric circles similar to those on the French machines but with the colours reversed, that is with a red circle inside a blue ring. The circles to be as large as possible. In addition a Union Jack 2ft x 1½ft will be painted on the wing tips outside the circles.|$|E

40|$|Watson and Humphreys (1997) {{proposed}} that visual marking is a goal-directed process that enhances visual search through the inhibition of old objects. In {{addition to the}} <b>standard</b> <b>marking</b> case with targets at new locations, included in Experiment 1 was a set of trials with targets always at old locations, {{as well as a}} set of trials with targets varying between new and old locations. The participants’ performance when detecting the target at old locations was equivalent to their performance in the full-baseline condition when they knew the target would be at old locations, and was worse when the target appeared at old locations on 50 % of the trials. Marking was observed when the target appeared at new locations. In Experiment 2, an offset paradigm was used to eliminate the influence of the salient abrupt-onset feature of the new objects. No significant benefits were found for targets at new locations in the absence of onsets at new locations. The results suggest that visual marking may be an attentional selection mechanism that significantly benefits visual search when (1) the observer has an appropriate search goal, (2) the goal necessitates inhibition of old objects, and (3) the new objects include a salient perceptual feature...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new graph parameter, the hydra number, arising from the minimization problem for Horn formulas in propositional logic. The hydra number of a graph G=(V,E) is the minimal number of hyperarcs of the form u,v→ w required in a directed hypergraph H=(V,F), such that for every pair (u, v), the set of vertices reachable in H from {u, v} is the entire vertex set V if (u, v) ∈ E, and it is {u, v} otherwise. Here reachability is defined by forward chaining, a <b>standard</b> <b>marking</b> algorithm. Various bounds are given for the hydra number. We show that the hydra number of a graph can be upper bounded {{by the number of}} edges plus the path cover number of the line graph of a spanning subgraph, which is a sharp bound in several cases. On the other hand, we construct single-headed graphs for which that bound is off by a constant factor. Furthermore, we characterize trees with low hydra number, and give a lower bound for the hydra number of trees {{based on the number of}} vertices that are leaves in the tree obtained from T by deleting its leaves. This bound is sharp for some families of trees. We give bounds for the hydra number of complete binary trees and also discuss a related minimization problem. Comment: 17 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} examine aspects of human visual perception during approaches to a runway. The runway width illusion has commonly been reported {{to contribute to the}} dangerous tendency of pilots to fly low approaches to runways that are wide and high approaches to runways that are narrow. Attempts to prevent the runway width illusion have not attempted to identify the ideal location for an indicator of altitude. Thus the present experiment examined the effect of varying runway width and manipulated scenes in order to determine whether the runway width illusion was present and where participants were focusing their attention in the scenes. Thirty-two non-pilot participants and 3 pilots took part in the experiment and viewed static and dynamic scenes of runways that were narrow (30. 48 m), medium (60. 96 m) or wide (91. 44 m) at one of three viewing heights low (30. 48 m), medium (45. 72 m) or high (60. 96 m). After viewing scenes, participants were required to estimate their altitude and aim-point. The results of this experiment revealed that participants were fairly inaccurate at estimating altitude and were inclined to overestimate aim-point, however the data also indicated that there was a robust runway width illusion that was present across static and dynamic trials and in both altitude and aim-point data. The <b>standard</b> <b>marking</b> on the runway in an attempt to prevent the runway width illusion was not effective at preventing incorrect altitude estimations but did assist participants to estimate aim-point. It was also found that the objects that participants' most commonly reported using to estimate altitude in the visual scene were located in the lower segment of the scenes...|$|E
40|$|Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) {{was widely}} learned nowadays. As crucial parts of ADAS, lane {{markings}} detection, {{as well as}} other objects detection, have become more popular than before. However, most methods implemented in such areas cannot perfectly balance the performance of accuracy versus efficiency, and the mainstream methods (e. g. Machine Learning) suffer from several limitations which can hardly break the wall between partial autonomous and fully autonomous driving. This thesis proposed a real-time lane marking detection framework for ADAS, which included 4 -extreme points set descriptor and a rule-based cascade classifier. By analyzing the behavior of lane markings on the road surface, a characteristic of markings was discovered, i. e., standard markings can sustain their shape in the perpendicular plane of the driving direction. By employing this feature, a 4 -extreme points set descriptor was applied to describe the shape of each marking first. Specifically, after processing Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) and Hough transforms on a 2 -D image, several contours of interest are obtained. A bounding box, with borders parallel to the image coordinate, intersected with each contour at 4 points in the edge, which was named 4 -extreme points set. Afterward, to verify consistency of each contour and <b>standard</b> <b>marking,</b> some rules abstracted from construction manual are employed such as Area Filter, Colour Filter, Relative Location Filter, Convex Filter, etc. To reduce the errors caused by changes in driving direction, an enhanced module was then introduced. By tracking the vanishing point {{as well as other}} key points of the road net, a method for 3 -D reconstruction, with respect to the optical axis between vanishing point and camera center, is possible. The principle of such algorithm was exhibited, and a description about how to obtain the depth information from this model was also provided. Among all of these processes, a key-point based classification method is the main contribution of this paper because of its function in eliminating the deformation of the object caused by inverse perspective mapping. Several experiments were conducted in highway and urban roads in Ottawa. The detection rate of the markings by the proposed algorithm reached an average accuracy rate of 96. 77...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (English)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{research}} {{reported on}} in this thesis forms part of {{the foundation of a}} bigger research project in which an attempt is made to provide better, faster and more efficient feedback on student writing. The introduction presents the localised and international context of the study, and discusses some of the problems experienced with feedback practice in general. The introduction also gives a preview of the intended practical implementation of the research reported {{on in this}} thesis. From there on, the thesis is presented in article form with each article investigating and answering a part of two main guiding questions. These questions are: 1. Does feedback on student writing work? 2. How can feedback on student writing be implemented as effectively as possible? The abstracts for the five individual articles are as follows: Article 1 Article 1 presents a rubric for the evaluation of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) software based on international recommendations for effective CALL. The rubric is presented after a brief overview of the pedagogical and implementation fundamentals of CALL, and a discussion of what needs to be included in a needs analysis for CALL evaluation. It is then illustrated how the evaluation criteria in the rubric can be used in the design of a new CALL system. Article 2 Providing feedback on student writing is a much-debated topic. One group of researchers argues that it is ineffective and another group remains convinced that it is effective, while at ground level teachers and lecturers simply carry on “marking” texts. The author of this article contends that both arguments have valid contributions to make and uses the arguments both for and against feedback to create a checklist for effective feedback practice. Adhering to this checklist should counter most of the arguments against feedback while supporting and improving the positive arguments in favour of feedback. Article 3 This article reports on an experiment which tested how effectively standardised feedback could be used when marking L 2 student writing. The experiment was conducted using a custom-programmed software tool and a set of standardised feedback comments. The results of the experiment prove that standardised feedback can be used consistently and effectively to a degree, even though some refinements are still needed. Using standardised feedback in a <b>standard</b> <b>marking</b> environment can assist markers in raising their awareness of errors and in more accurately identifying where students lack knowledge. With some refinements, it may also be possible to speed up the marking process. Article 4 This article describes an experiment in which Boolean feedback (a kind of checklist) was used to provide feedback on the paragraph structures of first-year students in an academic literacy course. The major problems with feedback on L 2 writing are introduced and it is established why a focus on paragraph structures in particular is of importance. The experiment conducted was a two-draft assignment in which three different kinds of feedback (technique A: handwritten comments; technique B: consciousness raising through generalised Boolean feedback; and technique C: specific Boolean feedback) were presented to three different groups of students. The results indicate that specific Boolean feedback is more effective than the other two techniques, partly because a higher proportion of the instances of negative feedback on the first draft were corrected in the second draft (improvements), but more importantly because in the revision a much lower number of changes to the text resulted in negative feedback on the second draft (regressions). For non-specific feedback, almost as many regressions occurred as improvements. In combination with automatic analytical techniques made possible with software, the results from this study make a case for using such checklists to give feedback on student writing. Article 5 This article describes an experiment in which a series of statements, answerable simply with yes or no (labelled Boolean feedback), were used to provide feedback on the introductions, conclusions and paragraph structures of student texts. A write-rewrite assignment (the same structure as in article 4) was used {{and the quality of the}} student revisions was evaluated. The results indicate that the students who received Boolean feedback showed greater improvement and fewer regressions than students who received feedback using the traditional method. The conclusion provides a brief summary as well as a preview of the immense future research possibilities made possible by this project. Doctora...|$|E
