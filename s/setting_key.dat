5000|$|Mechanical Plastics Corp. is {{a company}} based in Norwalk, Connecticut that [...] "produces screw anchors and toggle bolts used in the {{construction}} industry." [...] These anchors, which range from light-duty to heavy-duty, are [...] "used to fasten objects to walls, ceilings, and floors made of concrete, brick, cement block, drywall, and fiberglass". Mechanical Plastics Corp. currently contains two main divisions, TOGGLER and Wej-It. According to The New York Times, Mechanical Plastics currently distributes its products to twenty-four countries internationally, and these products are then sold at retail stores such as Lowe's. TOGGLER anchor system, whose patents are owned by Mechanical Plastics Corp., {{is used in the}} area of home improvement, when driving [...] "a screw or nail directly into a framing member behind the wall surface" [...] is not possible and it is necessary to choose a fastener that is [...] "specifically designed for gripping in the hollow spaces between the studs and joists." [...] The Popular Mechanics journal, states that [...] "The basic Toggler is the screw anchor which can work in both solid-wall and hollow-wall applications. It consists of a polypropylene anchor and a small plastic <b>setting</b> <b>key.</b> All you do is drill a hole in your wall and slide the anchor in place. For solid walls, the anchor is just wedged into the hole, like a normal plastic anchor. If the wall is hollow, you simply slide the key setting pin into the anchor and push." [...] As such, these Toggle bolts are used to [...] "support items like mirrors, framed artwork, and towel racks." [...] Mechanical Plastics Corp. also manufactures the Wej-It expansion bolt, which [...] "is a one-piece all-steel anchor for attaching anything to concrete, brick, or stone." ...|$|E
