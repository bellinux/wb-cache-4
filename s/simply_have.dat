5|$|Although Pericles was a {{main source}} of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic {{literary}} style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style. This might, however, {{be the result of}} the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> used two different writing styles for two different purposes.|$|E
5|$|Both authors {{wrote that}} the macaws were the largest parrots of Guadeloupe, and {{stressed}} that the parrots of each Caribbean island were distinct, and could be differentiated both based on their morphology and their vocalizations.

Furthermore, the docile and amiable nature described by Du Tertre and Labat does not match the behavior of South American macaws.|$|E
5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation {{that there may have}} been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books that were in the cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.|$|E

5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} how England was settled with Anglo-Saxon people between c. 450 and 1066 AD, making {{the country a}} land of villages. Estate boundaries from this period survive in features such as sunken lanes and banks. The Scandinavian conquest of much of England from the late 9th century added more villages, though many with Scandinavian placename elements such as -by ('village') may <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> been renamed Saxon settlements.|$|E

5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide it <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> to select an intercept point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the intercept point is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful radar systems, and faster computers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Perseus at Pydna in 168BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly {{established}} autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia. The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before {{the establishment of the}} Roman province of Macedonia), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it may <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.|$|E

5|$|He {{appears to}} have {{believed}} himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted {{to him that he}} was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.|$|E
5|$|In the East, Diocletian {{engaged in}} {{diplomacy}} with desert tribes {{in the regions}} between Rome and Persia. He might have been attempting to persuade them to ally themselves with Rome, thus reviving the old, Rome-friendly, Palmyrene sphere of influence, or simply attempting to reduce the frequency of their incursions. No details survive for these events. Some of the princes of these states were Persian client kings, a disturbing fact in light of increasing tensions with the Sassanids. In the West, Maximian lost the fleet built in 288 and 289, probably {{in the early spring}} of 290. The panegyrist who refers to the loss suggests that its cause was a storm, but this might <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> been an attempt to conceal an embarrassing military defeat. Diocletian broke off his tour of the Eastern provinces soon thereafter. He returned with haste to the West, reaching Emesa by 10 May 290, and Sirmium on the Danube by 1 July 290.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, a major {{lesson for}} the Greeks was the {{potential}} of the hoplite phalanx. This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the hoplite phalanx had not been obvious. Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how devastating the hoplites could be in battle. The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the Battle of Plataea), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon. The Persians seem to have more-or-less disregarded the military lessons of Marathon. The composition of infantry for the second invasion seems to have been the same as during the first, despite the availability of hoplites and other heavy infantry in Persian-ruled lands. Having won battles against hoplites previously, the Persians may <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> regarded Marathon as an aberration.|$|E

5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E
5|$|This did {{not deter}} Margaret of York, Duchess of BurgundyEdward's sister and Elizabeth's auntand {{members of the}} de la Pole familychildren of Edward's sister and John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk from {{frequent}} attempts to destabilise Henry's regime. Henry imprisoned Margaret's nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick, the son of her brother George, in the Tower of London, but in 1487 Margaret financed a rebellion led by Lambert Simnel pretending to be Edward. John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, joined the revolt, probably anticipating that it would further his own ambitions to the throne, but {{he was killed in}} the suppression of the uprising at the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487. Warwick was implicated by two further failed invasions supported by Margaret using Perkin Warbeck pretending to be Edward IV's son Richard of Shrewsbury, and Warbeck's later planned escape for them both; Warwick was executed in 1499. Edward's execution may <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> been a precondition for the marriage of Arthur, Prince of Wales to Katherine of Aragon in 1501.|$|E
5|$|The Quarter Pony is {{recognized}} by several different breed registries that each have different requirements. The American Quarter Pony Association requires that, although parentage may be unknown, the pony must have conformation that is desirable for breeding and be easily recognizable as having Quarter Pony or Quarter Horse breeding. pinto, leopard complex (Appaloosa), and white horses {{are not eligible}} for registration, nor are gaited ponies. The National Quarter Pony Association requires that stallions be registered with the AQHA before they can be registered with the NQPA. Mares must have one parent registered with the AQHA, be registered with the AQHA themselves, or go through a special registration process. Geldings <b>simply</b> <b>have</b> to be of Quarter Horse type to be eligible for registration. Horses with Pinto or Appaloosa markings, or with excessive white, {{are not eligible for}} registration. The International Quarter Pony Association allows Pinto and Appaloosa markings, and simply requires that ponies be of Quarter-type conformation and good disposition for registry. Any type of pony meeting these requirements may be registered through the hardship registration program, which includes a special inspection. However, if ponies have a parent registered with an approved breed registry (approved breeds include the Quarter Pony, Quarter Horse, Paint horse, Appaloosa and Pony of the Americas), they are automatically eligible for registration, with no inspection required. Crosses with gaited breeds are not accepted for registration.|$|E
