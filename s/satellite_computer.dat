40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 14 - 16, 1978 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe {{combined}} {{performance of}} a multi-access communication channel under joint access control/modulation/coding procedures is examined. The multi-access channel serves as a shared information transmission medium in a data communication network, such as a <b>satellite,</b> <b>computer</b> or terrestrial radio communication network. The performance of the underlying modulation/coding scheme is {{expressed in terms of}} the corresponding bit-error probability vs. signal-to-noise ratio curve. The computational cutoff error rate is also used as a proper performance measure characterizing the joint modulation/coding scheme. The performance of the underlying access-control algorithm is described by the message-delay vs. network-throughput curve. Integrating these performance functions, the combined performance of the joint access-control/modulation/coding procedure is derived. In particular, under proper bandwidth and power limitations, one can then evaluate the total amount of information that can be transmitted through the channel, in a reliable and timely fashion, at prescribed bit-error-probability and message-delay values, under various communication link, transceiver, repeater and antenna conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A lung {{function}} information system (LFIS) {{was developed for}} the data analysis of pulmonary function tests at different locations. This system {{was connected to the}} hospital information system (HIS) for the retrieval of patient data and the storage of the {{lung function}} variables of patients to generate follow-up reports and to support financial and administrative management. The application programs were developed {{in such a way that}} high flexibility was obtained with respect to the patient-computer-technician interaction. The sampled data are stored on a disc to correct earlier decisions, perform recalculations and reanalyse the data for research purposes. When the measurements performed on a patient are authorized, the sampled data are deleted, except for when they are needed for future research. A distributed computer system was chosen to combine the benefits of a centralized system with those of several stand-alone systems. The main tasks of the central unit are to store collected data and computer programs, generate a final lung function report on laser printer and provide a connection to the HIS. In the <b>satellite</b> <b>computers,</b> which are located close to the lung function equipment, the signals and raw data are processed. Furthermore, the <b>satellite</b> <b>computers</b> were in use for program development and several research projects, and for the offline data processing of the lung function measurements from two other hospitals by means of a modem connection.

Radio waves are generated by radio transmitters and received by radio receivers.

40|$|A {{distributed}} {{guidance and}} control algorithm {{was developed for}} a constellation of satellites. The system repositions satellites as required, regulates satellites to desired orbits, and prevents collisions. 1. Optimal methods are used to compute nominal transfers from orbit to orbit. 2. Satellites are regulated to maintain the desired orbits once the transfers are complete. 3. A simulator is used to predict potential collisions or near-misses. 4. Each satellite computes perturbations to its controls so as to increase any unacceptable distances of nearest approach to other objects. a. The avoidance problem is recast in a distributed and locally-linear form {{to arrive at a}} tractable solution. b. Plant matrix values are approximated via simulation at each time step. c. The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) method is used to compute perturbations to the controls that will result in increased miss distances. 5. Once all danger is passed, the satellites return to their original orbits, all the while avoiding each other as above. 6. The delta-Vs are reasonable.
