25|$|Glass {{production}} involves {{two main}} methods – the {{float glass process}} that produces <b>sheet</b> <b>glass,</b> and glassblowing that produces bottles and other containers.|$|E
25|$|A {{new method}} of {{producing}} glass, {{known as the}} cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process {{was used by the}} Chance Brothers to create <b>sheet</b> <b>glass.</b> They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The Crystal Palace is the supreme example of the use of <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> in a new and innovative structure.|$|E

In the 2011 financial year, East received a total compensation of £1,187,500 from Arm, comprising {{a salary of}} £475,000 and a bonus of £712,500. East said in March 2013 that he would retire from Arm in May, with president Simon Segars taking over as CEO. In March 2014, former Rexam chairman Stuart Chambers succeeded John Buchanan as chairman.

25|$|The {{last major}} {{components}} {{to be put}} into place were the sixteen semi-circular ribs of the vaulted transept, which were also the only major structural parts that were made of wood. These were raised into position as eight pairs, and all were fixed into place within a week. Thanks to the simplicity of Paxton's design and the combined efficiency of the building contractor and their suppliers, the entire structure was assembled with extraordinary speed—the team of 80 glaziers could fix more than 18,000 panes of <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> in a week—and the building was complete and ready to receive exhibits in just five months.|$|E
500|$|Four of the chapel's {{windows were}} {{designed}} and crafted in {{the studios of}} Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848–1933). Tiffany and Hardenbergh were acquainted through their work with the Architectural League of New York. [...] According to the New Jersey Historic Trust, the windows are [...] "some of the first opalescent and multicolored <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> manufactured in America." [...] Opalescent glass, used often in Tiffany glass windows, is glass {{in which more than}} one colour is present and caused in the manufacture by fusing through two colors being laminated, or through a superficial application of metallic oxide solutions.|$|E
500|$|The chapel was {{designed}} in the High Victorian Gothic Revival style that was popular at {{the middle of the}} nineteenth century in the United States. Hardenbergh's design incorporated features common to fourteenth-century German and English Gothic churches. According to the New Jersey Historic Trust, the chapel’s stained glass windows feature [...] "some of the first opalescent and multicolored <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> manufactured in America." [...] Four of the chapel's windows were created by the studios of Louis Comfort Tiffany. Kirkpatrick Chapel was included on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on January 29, 1973, and on the National Register of Historic Places on July 2, 1973.|$|E

2500|$|In 1836, Paxton {{began the}} Great Conservatory, or Stove, a huge glasshouse, [...] long and [...] wide. The columns and beams {{were made of}} cast iron, and the arched {{elements}} of laminated wood. At the time, the conservatory was the largest glass building in the world.

The structure was heated by eight boilers using [...] of iron pipe and cost more than £30,000.

[...] Former employees of the glass works became the talent that established many of the region's glass factories, and many were company president or plant manager. [...] Perhaps the one former Hobbs employee that had the biggest influence on the industry was Michael Owens. [...] Owens revolutionized the glass bottle industry by inventing a machine that would make bottles at high speed and low cost with consistency in size and shape. [...] Not only did Owens' invention lower costs, it also opened new markets where low cost bottles with consistent size {{could be used as}} containers for products that previously had limited distribution. [...] Owens was also involved with improving a machine for producing window glass, which changed the way window glass was produced. [...] He was involved with the formation of the Toledo Glass Company, the Owens Bottle Machine Company, and the Libbey-Owens <b>Sheet</b> <b>Glass</b> Company.|$|E
60|$|These Venetian {{glasses were}} all small, {{because at that}} time <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> was blown by the mouth of man, like bottles, vases, etc., and {{therefore}} {{it was impossible to}} make them large. Two hundred years afterward, a Frenchman discovered a method of making <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> by machinery, which is called founding, and by this process it can be made of any size.|$|E

60|$|The work {{publicly}} provided {{would have}} to be toilsome, but not cruel or incapacitating. A choice of occupations would need to be afforded, occupations adapted to different types of training and capacity, with some residual employment of a purely laborious and mechanical sort for those who were incapable of doing the things that required intelligence. Necessarily this employment by the State would be a relief of economic pressure, but it would not be considered a charity done to the individual, but a public service. It need not pay, any more than the police need pay, but it could probably be done at a small margin of loss. There is a number of durable things bound finally to be useful that could be made and stored whenever the tide of more highly paid employment ebbed and labour sank to its minimum, bricks, iron from inferior ores, shaped and preserved timber, pins, nails, plain fabrics of cotton and linen, paper, <b>sheet</b> <b>glass,</b> artificial fuel, and so on; new roads could be made and public buildings reconstructed, inconveniences of all sorts removed, until under the stimulus of accumulating material, accumulating investments or other circumstances, the tide of private enterprise flowed again.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods for}} making hand-blown glass {{included}} blown plate glass, crown glass (introduced to England in the 17th century), {{polished plate glass}} and cylinder blown <b>sheet</b> <b>glass.</b> These methods of manufacture lasted {{at least until the}} end of the 19th century.

50|$|Broad <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> {{was first}} {{made in the}} UK in Sussex in 1226. This glass was of poor quality and fairly opaque.

50|$|Modern {{windows are}} usually glazed with one large <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> per sash, while {{windows in the}} past were glazed with {{multiple}} panes separated by glazing bars, or muntins, due to the unavailability of large <b>sheets</b> of <b>glass.</b> Today, glazing bars tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. Glazing bars are typically wooden, but occasionally lead glazing bars soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns.|$|R
50|$|PVB {{has gained}} {{acceptance}} among manufacturers of photovoltaic thin film solar modules. The photovoltaic circuit is formed on a <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> using thin film deposition and patterning techniques.

The lamination of this sandwich encapsulates the circuit, protecting it from the environment.

Another common laminant used in the solar industry is ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA).|$|R
