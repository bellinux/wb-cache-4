5|$|Penicillium moulds cause <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> such as of apples, while Aspergillus moulds create {{patches on}} the surface of old bread, yoghurt and many other foods. Yeasts spoil sugary foods such as plums and jams, fermenting the sugars to alcohol. Scientific {{understanding}} of spoilage began in the 19th century with works such as Louis Pasteur's 1879 Studies on Fermentation, which investigated the spoilage of beer.|$|E
25|$|In higher plants, P. aeruginosa induces <b>soft</b> <b>rot,</b> {{for example}} in Arabidopsis thaliana (Thale cress) and Lactuca sativa (lettuce). It is also {{pathogenic}} to invertebrate animals, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila and the moth Galleria mellonella. The associations of virulence factors are the same for plant and animal infections.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>rots</b> {{are those}} where the {{pathogen}} {{breaks down the}} host cell walls, resulting in the exudation of juices from the infected tissue. The organ becomes mushy or pulpy and a foul smell often develops due to colonization by secondary invaders. Many fungi and bacteria cause <b>soft</b> <b>rots</b> on several fruits and vegetables. Species of the fungus, Rhizopus and bacterium Erwinia are two such commonly found pathogens causing <b>soft</b> <b>rots.</b>|$|R

40|$|The in planta {{induction}} of anaerobic nitrate respiration by Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica {{in relation}} to the in situ oxygen status in <b>soft</b> <b>rotting</b> potato tubers has been investigated. In vitro experiments have shown that nitrate was required for the induction of respiratory nitrate reductase activity in E. carotovora. In addition, oxygen was found to repress this activity. Expression of respiratory nitrate reductase was found in E. carotovora cells extracted from <b>soft</b> <b>rotting</b> potato tuber tissue. However, the rate of nitrite production in these cells was approximately 70 -fold lower than the rate recorded in fully induced anaerobic cultures. Oxygen measurements in <b>soft</b> <b>rotting</b> potato tubers indicated that the invading bacteria encounter the lowest oxygen concentration at the interphase between healthy and macerated tissue. Consequently, growth of bacteria present in this specific zone will be stimulated by nitrate which is present in sufficient amounts in tuber tissue. A high nitrate content of the tuber will most likely facilitate the proliferation of E. carotovora in the tuber tissue...|$|R
500|$|I. badia fruit {{bodies are}} less {{affected}} by insects than other boletes. Orbatid mites such as Carabodes femoralis, Nothrus silvestris and Oribatula tibialis consume them, as do squirrels. Several microbial pathogens {{can damage the}} fruit bodies, and have {{had an effect on}} populations in China, including <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and black mould caused by [...] Mucor, Sepedonium, Paecilomyces, and Diasporangium species.|$|E
500|$|Another fungus which {{attacks the}} bulbs, causing {{narcissus}} smoulder, is Botrytis narcissicola (Sclerotinia narcissicola) {{and other species}} of Botrytis, including Botrytis cinerea, particularly if improperly stored. Copper sulfate is used to combat the disease, and infected bulbs are burned. Blue mould rot of bulbs {{may be caused by}} infection with species of Penicillium, if they have become damaged either through mechanical injury or infestation by mites (see below). Species of Rhizopus (e.g. [...] Rhizopus stolonifer, Rhizopus nigricans) cause bulb <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> and Sclerotinia bulborum, black slime disease. A combination of both Peyronellaea curtisii (Stagonosporopsis curtisii) and Botrytis narcissicola causes neck rot in the bulbs.|$|E
500|$|Parsnip canker is {{a serious}} disease of this crop. Black or orange-brown patches occur around the crown and {{shoulders}} of the root accompanied by cracking and hardening of the flesh. It {{is more likely to}} occur when seed is sown into cold, wet soil, the pH of the soil is too low, or the roots have already been damaged by carrot fly larvae. Several fungi are associated with canker, including Phoma complanata, Ilyonectria radicicola, Itersonilia pastinaceae, and I.perplexans. In Europe, Mycocentrospora acerina has been found to cause a black rot that [...] kills the plant early. Watery <b>soft</b> <b>rot,</b> caused by Sclerotinia minor and S.sclerotiorum, causes the taproot to become soft and watery. A white or buff-colored mold grows on the surface. The pathogen is most common in temperate and subtropical regions that have a cool wet season.|$|E

5000|$|Pectate lyase (...) is {{an enzyme}} {{involved}} in the maceration and <b>soft</b> <b>rotting</b> of plant tissue. Pectate lyase {{is responsible for the}} eliminative cleavage of pectate, yielding oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-α-D-mann-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends. The protein is maximally expressed late in pollen development. It has been suggested that the pollen expression of pectate lyase genes might relate to a requirement for pectin degradation during pollen tube growth.|$|R
5000|$|R. stolonifer is a {{problematic}} pathogen as it infects fresh wounds occurring during packing and shipping. There is limited {{data on the}} exact losses attributed to Rhizopus <b>soft</b> <b>rot.</b> A study conducted in the New York City retail market found {{that the majority of}} culls due to disease were caused by Rhizopus <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> (approximately 2% decay in survey).

50|$|Characteristic {{symptoms}} {{specific to}} the carrot include initial vein clearing and chlorosis, followed by production of many adventitious shoots, with the tops looking like a witches’-broom. The internodes of such shoots are short as are the leaf petioles. Young leaves are smaller and dry up while the petioles of older leaves twist and break off. Any remaining older leaves turn bronze or red late in the season. Floral parts are deformed and roots are smaller, abnormally shaped, and have woolly secondary roots. The carrot roots are predisposed to <b>soft</b> <b>rots</b> {{in the field and}} storage and taste unpleasant to the consumer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>rots</b> are {{characterized}} by their distinct maceration of hosts' cell walls with pectolytic enzymes, and subsequent digestion of the intracellular fluid as the bacteria grows. But {{little is known about}} the pathogen's interaction with its host at earlier stages when it is still attaching to, and growing within the host with no symptoms present. In fact, the bacteria may develop large populations within a plant before any symptoms can be seen. No one knows exactly why the bacteria have this dormant stage, or what factors influence the bacteria's virulence, but the research is being done.|$|R
50|$|Downy mildew {{refers to}} any of several types of oomycete {{microbes}} that are obligate parasites of plants. Downy mildews exclusively belong to Peronosporaceae. In commercial agriculture, they are a particular problem for growers of crucifers, grapes and vegetables that grow on vines. The prime example is Peronospora farinosa featured in NCBI-Taxonomy and HYP3. This pathogen does not produce survival structures in the northern states of the United States, and overwinters as live mildew colonies in Gulf Coast states. It progresses northward with cucurbit production each spring. Yield loss associated with downy mildew is most likely related to <b>soft</b> <b>rots</b> that occur after plant canopies collapse and sunburn occurs on fruit. Cucurbit downy mildew only affects leaves of cucurbit plants.|$|R

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Vegetables IPM Fact SheetPink eye is {{characterized}} by pink to brown blotches on the skin, usually around the eyes at the apical (bud) end of tubers. When the disease is severe, a shallow, reddish brown rot occurs beneath the discolored areas. Pink eye is often prevalent on varieties such as Kennebec and Superior, which are highly susceptible to verticillium wilt, and commonly occurs during and after a wet harvest season. As a rule, the disease is not commercially serious in tablestock or seed potatoes stored under cool, relatively dry conditions. Tuber appearance may be somewhat marred, but the affected skin and superficial rot usually dry up. However, {{in the case of}} chipstock held at warm temperatures and high relative humidity, pink eye often opens the door to secondary <b>soft</b> <b>rotting</b> bacteria, which frequently cause extremely heavy losses...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} 140 {{vineyards}} in different production areas of Spain was conducted from 1999 to 2001 to identify pathogenic grapevine wood fungi. Fungal infected vines showed esca and decline symptoms, consisting mainly of reduced growth of canes and shoots, yellowing and necrotic spotting of leaves, sectorial and central brown necrosis of the trunk, <b>soft</b> <b>rotted</b> tissues and discoloured xylem {{at the base}} of the vines. Several fungi were consistently found associated with these symptoms: Botryosphaeria obtusa (isolated from 61. 4 % of all vineyards studied), Phaeoacremonium aleophilum (26. 4 %), Cylindrocarpon spp. (20 %), Phaeomoniella chlamydospora (18. 6 %) and Fomitiporia punctata (15 %) were the main fungi found. Less frequently isolated species were: Botryosphaeria dothidea (6. 4 %), Eutypa lata (2. 1 %), and Stereum hirsutum (1. 4 %).

50|$|Rhizopus <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> is {{a disease}} of the sweet potato. It {{is one of the}} most common to affect the sweet potato, {{happening}} during packing and shipping. The disease causes a watery <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> of the internal portion of the storage root. Strategies to manage the disease include the development of resistant varieties, curing through the use of heat and humidity, and application of decay control products.|$|E
50|$|Bacterial <b>soft</b> <b>rots</b> {{are caused}} by several types of bacteria, but most {{commonly}} by species of gram-negative bacteria, Erwinia, Pectobacterium, and Pseudomonas. It is a destructive disease of fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals found worldwide, and effects genera from nearly all the plant families. The bacteria mainly attack the fleshy storage organs of their hosts (tubers, corms, bulbs, and rhizomes), but they also affect succulent buds, stems, and petiole tissues. With the aid of special enzymes, the plant is turned into a liquidy mush {{in order for the}} bacteria to consume the plant cell's nutrients. Disease spread can be caused by simple physical interaction between infected and healthy tissues during storage or transit. The disease can also be spread by insects. Control of the disease is not always very effective, but sanitary practices in production, storing, and processing are something that can be done in order to slow the spread of the disease and protect yields.|$|R
40|$|Although {{numerous}} {{workers have}} shown that gram-negative, non-spore-forming, lactose-fermenting, pectin-fermenting bacteria are widely distributed in nature, their sanitary significance remains uncertain. Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (1939) describes the tribe Erwineae as plant para-sites causing blights and <b>soft</b> <b>rots,</b> fermenting glucose and lactose with the forma-tion of acid, or acid and {{a small amount of}} visible gas, and usually attacking pectin. Since these organisms resemble closely the coli-aerogenes group, those which produce visible gas might be expected to pass through the completed test in the bacteriological examination of water, and give false tests. Whether this group of plant pathogens can be differentiated from coli-aerogenes organisms of intestinal origin by their ability to ferment pectin cannot be stated until the occurrence of pectin-fermenting coli-aerogenes organisms in the intestinal tract of man and animals has been investigated. This study has been undertaken in order to determine: (1) a suitable medium for the testing of the ability of organ-isms to ferment pectin; (2) the incidence of pectin-fermenting, lactose-fermenting...|$|R
40|$|The SmartHeat® thermal timber {{treatment}} {{is a new}} technology based on the process parameters being steered very precisely mainly due to the vacuum applied and heating system involved.

By means of Weibull distribution assessment it was possible to show that variability in biological durability of each treated beam is well controlled and that this variability is limited compared to natural durability of wood species. Lower treatment variability due to precise parameter control for each beam and limited deviations of process parameters within the treating vessel are considered the main contributing factors.

40|$|Introduction: Botrytis cinerea (teleomorph: Botryotinia fuckeliana) is an {{airborne}} {{plant pathogen}} with a necrotrophic lifestyle attacking over 200 crop hosts worldwide. Although there are fungicides for its control, many classes of fungicides have failed {{due to its}} genetic plasticity. It has become an important model for molecular study of necrotrophic fungi. Taxonomy: Kingdom: Fungi, phylum: Ascomycota, subphylum: Pezizomycotina, class: Leotiomycetes, order: Helotiales, family: Sclerotiniaceae, genus: Botryotinia. Host range and symptoms: Over 200 mainly dicotyledonous plant species, including important protein, oil, fibre and horticultural crops, are affected in temperate and subtropical regions. It can cause <b>soft</b> <b>rotting</b> of all aerial plant parts, and rotting of vegetables, fruits and flowers post-harvest to produce prolific grey conidiophores and (macro) conidia typical of the disease. Pathogenicity: B. cinerea produces a range of cell-wall-degrading enzymes, toxins and other low-molecular-weight compounds such as oxalic acid. New {{evidence suggests that the}} pathogen triggers the host to induce programmed cell death as an attack strategy. Resistance: There are few examples of robust genetic host resistance, but recent work has identified quantitative trait loci in tomato that offer new approaches for stable polygenic resistance in future...|$|R
