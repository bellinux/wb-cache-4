A divisible load is a load which can be easily divided into smaller parts, such as products that are shipped on pallets, automobiles or grains.

All states provide permits for non-divisible loads though the truck may have restricted routing. Some states allow tolerances for any over weight truck.

One central element in many new telecommunications tariffs is the implementation of data caps, which are a common tool to address several challenges telecommunications providers face in today’s markets. In this context the recent introduction of so-called “managed services”, or “all-you-can-app ” offers draws the attention of regulators. The term “managed service ” is coined by operators to describe online-services that have a special agreement with the network operator. These service providers agree to revenue-sharing agreements and in turn their customers are alleviated from counting the data traffic they cause against their monthly quota.

40|$|In {{much of the}} literature, the Nordic {{states are}} {{presented}} as models for womanfriendly and gender equality policy. Differences between the gendered dimensions among the Nordic countries are less frequently explored. From a historical perspective, Norway was a latecomer in supporting women working outside the home, yet the Norwegian welfare state pioneered support for motherhood and lone mothers. Norway {{is one of the}} few countries in the world with a <b>specific</b> <b>allowance</b> for lone mothers. Today, the need for special welfare benefits for lone mothers is in question. This article follows the rise and reduction of the Norwegian allowance for lone mothers throughout the 20 th century and into the early 21 st century. While a core reason for developing welfare benefits for lone mothers at the start of the 1900 s was to support women in their traditional, unpaid motherhood roles, this article shows how today’s dualearner and dual-career model and workforce policies exclude lone motherhood as a social category in need of particular support...|$|E
40|$|In Gosta Esping-Andersen’s {{paradigmatic}} {{analysis of}} welfare capitalism (1990), the French welfare state is {{classified in the}} conservative corporatist regime. 1 France is generally recognized as belonging to the Bismarckian family of welfare states because of the centrality of social insurance. In fact, most of benefits are earnings related and entitlement is conditional upon a contribution record. Social security contributions are paid by both employers and employees. However, in France, {{there is also a}} non-contributory element, a Beveridgean component. It refers to the tax-financed system and includes social assistance programs, minimum incomes and programs aimed at vocational training, and at integrating the young or long-term unemployed. These programs benefit those who {{do not have access to}} the social insurance system, such as the long-term unemployed or the young unemployed who have not contributed enough or have only a very short contribution period. Since the late 1970 s, several kinds of minimum incomes or social minima have been set up to compensate for the failures of the Bismarckian sector (the social insurance system). There are at least eight different minimum incomes: minimum income for old people over sixty-five years, allowance for disabled adults, integration <b>allowance,</b> <b>specific</b> solidarity <b>allowance,</b> lone parent allowance, minimum income for disabled people (for those who have small invalidity insurance benefits), widowhood allowance, and mini...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares {{two methods}} of {{assessing}} variability in simulation output. The methods make <b>specific</b> <b>allowance</b> for two sources of variation: that caused by uncertainty in estimating unknown input parameters (parameter uncertainty), and that {{caused by the}} inclusion of random variation within the simulation model itself (simulation uncertainty). The first method is based on classical statistical differential analysis; we show explicitly that, under general conditions, the two sources contribute separately to the total variation. In the classical approach, certain sensitivity coefficients have to be estimated. The effort needed to do this becomes progressively more expensive, increasing linearly {{with the number of}} unknown parameters. Moreover there is an additional difficulty of detecting spurious variation when the number of parameters is large. It is shown that a parametric form of bootstrap sampling provides an alternative method which does not suffer from either problem. For illustration, simulation of the operation of a small (4 -node) computer communication network is used to compare the accuracy of estimates using the two methods. A larger, more realistic, (30 -node) network is presented showing how the bootstrap method becomes competitive when the number of unknown parameters is large...|$|E
