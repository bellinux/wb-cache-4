5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to <b>Speaker</b> Designate <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|R

25|$|During 2000–2010, the Virginia League of Conservation Voters gave Hurt {{an average}} {{approval}} rating of 40%. However, in 2010, when Hurt was running against incumbent Tom Perriello, the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters released {{television and radio}} ads against Hurt, attacking him on an alleged conflict of interest regarding uranium mining. However, the ads were deemed to be false by independent fact checkers {{due to the fact}} Robert Hurt had no personal investment in uranium mining. Hurt strongly opposed House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi’s 2009 proposed “Cap-and Trade” climate control legislation. Hurt called on the Virginia Department of Interior secretary Ken Salazar to remove bans on off-shore drilling and development.|$|E
25|$|On January 12, 2007, he {{introduced}} H. J. Res. 14: Concerning {{the use of}} military force by the United States against Iran in the 110th congress. According to Jones on his web site, the resolution requires that – absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces – the President must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran. This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi (D–CA) on March 13, 2007.|$|E
25|$|On March 30, 2010 Obama {{signed the}} Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, 7 {{days after he}} had signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law. At the end of 2009, each house of Congress passed its own health care reform bill, but neither house passed the other bill. The Senate bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, became the most viable avenue to reform {{following}} the death of Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy and his replacement by Republican Scott Brown. Lacking a filibuster-proof super-majority in the Senate, the Obama administration and House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi began encouraging the House to pass the Senate bill, then pass a new bill to amend it using the reconciliation process.|$|E
25|$|As the longest-serving Democratic senator, Byrd {{served as}} President pro tempore four times when his party {{was in the}} majority: from 1989 until the Republicans won control of the Senate in 1995; for 17 days in early 2001, when the Senate was evenly split between parties and {{outgoing}} Vice President Al Gore broke the tie {{in favor of the}} Democrats; when the Democrats regained the majority in June 2001 after Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent; and again from 2007 to his death in 2010, {{as a result of the}} 2006 Senate elections. In this capacity, Byrd was third in the line of presidential succession at the time of his death, behind Vice President Joe Biden and House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi.|$|E
25|$|As {{the race}} {{continued}} to Pennsylvania, Indiana, and North Carolina, many observers concluded that Clinton had little chance to overcome Obama's lead in pledged delegates. Even {{if she were}} to succeed in changing the dynamics of the race, there would not be enough pledged delegates remaining for her to catch up under most realistic scenarios. Some analysts believed Clinton could still win the nomination by raising doubts about Obama's electability, fighting for Michigan and Florida delegates to be seated at the convention, and convincing superdelegates to support her despite her expected loss in the pledged delegate vote. However, the window of opportunity for re-votes in Michigan and Florida appeared to close in late March, and House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi, chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, said that it would be harmful to the party if superdelegates were to overturn the result of the pledged delegate vote.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{election}} meant Democrats {{could no}} longer break a filibuster in the Senate. In response, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argued that Democrats should scale back to a less ambitious bill; House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi pushed back, dismissing Emanuel's scaled-down approach as [...] "Kiddie Care".|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{denied any}} {{wrongdoing}} {{and asked the}} U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, {{commonly known as the}} House Ethics Committee, to determine if his use of Congressional letterhead while arranging meetings to solicit contributions for the Center had violated any House rules. [...] House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi agreed to Rangel's request.|$|E
500|$|As a {{candidate}} in 2007, Tsongas promised to withdraw troops and end the Iraq War. [...] The first bill she introduced aimed to do this by implementing a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq; however, the bill died in committee. In 2010, Tsongas along with other women in Congress, including House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi, visited Afghanistan to oversee the war effort. Upon returning, Tsongas spoke {{of the need for}} the involvement of women in rebuilding of government.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Gravel {{criticized the}} {{decision}} of House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi to not pursue the efforts to impeach George W. Bush and the attempted impeachment of Dick Cheney, saying also that Bush and Cheney has committed crimes and deserved [...] "to be prosecuted" [...] at The Hague. In 2013, Gravel expressed disdain for President Obama, calling him a [...] "a total fraud" [...] and saying that both Bush and Obama should be tried [...] "for the crimes and murders they've committed" [...] in the International Court of Justice. Gravel specifically condemned Obama for the drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|On July 22, 2010, a bipartisan, four-member investigative {{subcommittee}} of the House Ethics Committee indicated it had [...] "substantial reason to believe" [...] that Rangel had violated a range of ethics rules relating to the other charges. [...] The matter was referred to another, newly created, special subcommittee to rule on the findings. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the action indicated the [...] "process is working as it should, while Minority Leader John Boehner called the announcement [...] "a sad reminder" [...] of <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi's [...] "most glaring broken promise: to 'drain the swamp' in Washington." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{approval}} rating went below the 50percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004. Thereafter, his {{approval rating}}s and approval of {{his handling of}} {{domestic and foreign policy}} issues steadily dropped. Bush received heavy criticism for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies. There were calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action. The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq, and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions. Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment {{on the floor of the}} House of Representatives against Bush on June 9, 2008, but <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi (D-CA) declared that impeachment was [...] "off the table".|$|E
500|$|The pilot script {{included}} several political cultural references. Leslie compares herself to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi {{in describing the}} prevalence of women in government. Leslie invokes former U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon and George W. Bush as shining examples of democracy. The episode also features several references to sports figures. Ron has a poster of Bob Knight, the famous retired basketball coach, hanging in his office. The Bobby Knight image later {{had to be removed}} from the show for legal reasons. Leslie has an autographed photo of Indiana-born basketball player Larry Bird on her desk. It reads, [...] "To Lesly, Sink That Shot, Larry B." [...] This is a reference to a deleted scene in which Tom reveals he has tricked Leslie into believing he has brunch with Bird once a month. Tom himself actually faked the autograph, and deliberately misspelled her name [...] "Lesly" [...] as a joke.|$|E
500|$|Tierney, {{described}} as [...] "an unwavering liberal" [...] by CQ's Politics in America, has consistently high approval ratings from Democratic and liberal interest {{groups such as}} Americans for Democratic Action, and low approval ratings from conservative {{groups such as the}} American Conservative Union. His votes have been closely aligned with the other Democratic representatives from his state. Described as [...] "a favorite of the House Democratic leadership," [...] he maintains a close relationship with former House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi; her daughter Christine Pelosi served as his chief of staff from 2001 to 2005. Tierney was speculated as a candidate to succeed United States Senator Ted Kennedy in a special election after Kennedy's death in 2009, but he decided not to run. In 2010 Washington paper The Hill published a speculation that Tierney, with a $1.3 million war chest, was a likely candidate to run against Kennedy's successor Scott Brown in the 2012 election. Tierney later stated that he would not contest the Senate seat and would instead seek a ninth term as Congressman.|$|E
500|$|Brown's victory {{ended the}} 60-vote supermajority in the Senate that the Democrats had held since mid-2009, and {{appeared}} to spell the end {{for health care reform}} legislation. But Democrats rallied and passed the measure; <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi, who was instrumental in doing so, credited Kennedy's life work in her final remarks on the House floor before the final vote. Kennedy's widow Vicki attended the signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, at which both she and President Obama wore blue [...] "Tedstrong" [...] bracelets. Congressman Patrick Kennedy brought a copy of a national health insurance bill his father had introduced in 1970 as a gift for the president. Patrick Kennedy then laid a note on his father's grave that said, [...] "Dad, the unfinished business is done." [...] (Patrick's earlier decision not to seek re-election meant that in January 2011, a 64-year-long period in which a Kennedy held Federal elective office came to an end, but it resumed in January 2013 (due to the November 2012 election) with Ted's great-nephew, Joseph P. Kennedy III, becoming a member of the House. Democratic control of Kennedy's Senate seat was also regained following Brown's 2012 loss to Elizabeth Warren.) ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do have things I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Noam Chomsky {{has argued}} that forces {{opposing}} the development of such a world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore {{has argued that}} mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should {{take into account that}} if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The Committee on Conscience of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: [...] "When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet, and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice" [...] (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: [...] "The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world." [...] Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped the conscience of the world. [...] The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by conscience, who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people. In 2009, for example, along with Catherine Hamlin (obstetric fistula and see fistula foundation)), David Suzuki (promoting awareness of climate change) and Alyn Ware (nuclear disarmament), René Ngongo shared the Right Livelihood Award [...] "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo Basin's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use". Avaaz {{is one of the largest}} global on-line organizations launched in January 2007 to promote conscience-driven activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict, thus [...] "closing the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want".|$|E
2500|$|Media Matters {{pointed out}} that in an April 10, 2007, speech, Romney criticized House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi for her [...] "partisan" [...] trip to Syria, {{but he did not}} mention that a Republican was a member of her delegation, or that a {{separate}} Republican-led delegation had met with the Syrian President three days before Pelosi did.|$|E
2500|$|Sensenbrenner was {{the only}} Republican to join House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi's Congressional {{delegation}} to meet the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India during the March 2008 protests against China by Tibetans.
