During the 1894 maneuvers, which postulated a two-front war against France and Russia, Blitz remained in the Baltic to defend against the <b>simulated</b> Russian attack.

After the conclusion of the maneuvers, Blitz was withdrawn from active service. In 1903, she was used as a tender for the fleet.|$|E

We give the first efficient quantum algorithms for <b>simulating</b> Markovian quantum dynamics generated by Lindbladians that are not necessarily local. We introduce two approaches to <b>simulating</b> sparse Lindbladians. First, we show how to <b>simulate</b> Lindbladians that act within small invariant subspaces using a quantum algorithm to implement sparse Stinespring isometries. Second, we develop a method for <b>simulating</b> sparse Lindblad operators by concatenating a sequence of short-time evolutions.

Taxable <b>simulated</b> an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to create the illusion of a large fleet on coastal radar screens.

5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that <b>simulated</b> the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that <b>simulated</b> the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
