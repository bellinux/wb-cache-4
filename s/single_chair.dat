500|$|Management of the {{monument}} was transferred from the Forest Service to the NPS in 1933, and a six-story hotel, the Oregon Caves Chateau, was completed at the site in 1934. Gust Lium, a builder from Grants Pass, oversaw construction of the Chateau {{and some of the}} park's other buildings, which he designed in a rustic style. Mason Manufacturing of Los Angeles produced the Chateau's furniture in a style called Monterey, valued in the 21stcentury at up to $5,000 for a <b>single</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] During the 1930s and early 1940s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) installed water and telephone lines, improved trails, and worked on landscaping at the park. The Chalet was rebuilt in 1942 to include a third story and a larger dormitory for women.|$|E
500|$|Art {{director}} Randy McIlvain led the set re-creation for the Enterprise and K7, {{describing the}} excitement over {{working on the}} episode as [...] "contagious". McIlvain spent {{a fair amount of}} time getting the window angles correct on the sets. Mike Okuda re-created the graphics seen on the Enterprise sets using a computer, whilst others were re-drawn by artist Doug Drexler. Some sets were not re-created in full, such as the bridge, which required parts of it to be later added digitally. The captain's chair from the bridge re-creation was later one of the Star Trek items to be auctioned by Christie's. Set designer Laura Richarz watched [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] carefully looking for small details to replicate on the new sets, such as the legs of benches in the bar on K7. However, she said her biggest challenge was tracking down the chairs seen on the space station. She contacted John M. Dwyer, who had worked on the original episode. He explained to her that the company which created the original chairs had gone out of business. After searching shops selling retro furniture, the production team found a <b>single</b> <b>chair</b> that matched those seen in the original episode. It was purchased and a mold was made to create more chairs. The actors were impressed when they saw the resulting sets, with Terry Farrell exclaiming [...] "Wow, we're on the Enterprise!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Saint Optatus clearly {{believed}} in a [...] "Chair of Peter", {{calling it a}} gift of the Church and saying, as summarized by Henry Wace, that [...] "Parmenian must {{be aware that the}} episcopal chair was conferred from the beginning on Peter, the chief of the apostles, that unity might be preserved among the rest and no one apostle set up a rival." [...] "You cannot deny that you are aware that in the city of Rome the episcopal chair was given first to Peter; the chair in which Peter sat, the same who was head [...] that is why he is also called Cephas [...] of all the Apostles; the one chair in which unity is maintained by all. Neither do other Apostles proceed individually on their own; and anyone who would set up another chair in opposition to that <b>single</b> <b>chair</b> would, by that very fact, be a schismatic and a sinner".|$|E
2500|$|Early {{belief in}} the Church is that Jesus granted Peter {{jurisdiction}} over the Church. [...] In [...] "Who is the Rich man that is Saved", St. Clement of Alexandria [...] writes of [...] "the blessed Peter, the chosen, the pre-eminent, {{the first of the}} disciples, for whom alone and Himself the Saviour paid tribute, [...] quickly seized and comprehended the saying" [...] (...) , referring to Mk [...] Tertullian, while examining Scriptural teachings, legal precedents, and dogma surrounding monogamy and marriage (post AD 213), says of Peter, [...] "Monogamist I am led to presume him by consideration of the Church, which, built upon him..." [...] ("On Monogamy", Ch. 8): his certainty that the Church is built especially upon Peter is such that he simply refers to {{it in the context of}} another discussion. In a slightly later text (AD 220) [...] "On Modesty", Tertullian writes at length about the significance of Matthew , [...] "On this rock I will build my Church" [...] and similar, emphasizing the singular, not plural, right, and condemning [...] "wholly changing the manifest intention of the Lord, conferring (as that intention did) this (gift) personally upon Peter" [...] (Ch. 21). Origen (c. AD 232) wrote also of [...] "Peter, upon whom is built the Church of Christ" [...] (Jurgens §479a). St. Cyprian of Carthage [...] prepared an essay discussing, inter alia, Mt. 16:18-19, titled [...] "On the Unity of the Church" [...] (AD 251) in which he strongly associates primacy, unity, the authority of Jesus, and Peter: [...] "On him He builds the Church, and to him He gives the command to feed the sheep; and although He assigns a like power to all the Apostles, yet He founded a <b>single</b> <b>chair,</b> and He established by His own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity" [...] (Jurgens §555-6). Jurgens gives Cyprian as an example of [...] "Papal Primacy being 'implicit' in the early Church." ...|$|E

60|$|Hurriedly Robert {{struck a}} match and lit his lamp. His father's room was {{opposite}} his own, {{and the door}} was ajar. He pushed it open and looked about him. It was empty.

60|$|Nothing {{could have}} been simpler than the {{furniture}} of the room. It consisted of a low pallet, a small table, and a <b>single</b> <b>chair.</b> In a corner were a pair of saddlebags {{and two or three}} coloured blankets. A thick coat, lined with sheepskin, hung against the wall. In a corner was a brightly-coloured picture of a saint, with two sconces for candles by the side of it. The muleteer had crossed himself and bowed to it as he came in, and Terence doubted not that it was the picture of a saint who was supposed to take a special interest in muleteers.|$|E

There are breaches in the walls that you could throw a cat through. The bedrooms have no locks on the doors, no furniture but a <b>single</b> <b>chair</b> in each, and a bedstead without bedding--just a mattress. Even these meager accommodations you cannot be sure that you will have in monopoly; you must take your chance of being stowed in with a lot of others. Sir, it is a most abominable hotel.|$|E
60|$|And so I {{found myself}} within that little sanctum, inside which, as I {{afterwards}} learned, no other foot had {{for three years}} been set save that of the old servant who cleaned it out. It was a round room, conforming {{to the shape of}} the tower in which it was situated, with a low ceiling, a single narrow, ivy-wreathed window, and the simplest of furniture. An old carpet, a <b>single</b> <b>chair,</b> a deal table, and a small shelf of books made up the whole contents. On the table stood a full-length photograph of a woman--I took no particular notice of the features, but I remember, that a certain gracious gentleness was the prevailing impression. Beside it were a large black japanned box and one or two bundles of letters or papers fastened together with elastic bands.|$|E

60|$|Nettie gasped again, {{and once}} more shot a swift glance at him. Appleby was {{standing}} very still, and save for the weariness in it his face was expressionless. Then without a word she turned {{and went into the}} room, while Harper smiled softly when he heard the bolt shot home. The room, she found, was evidently a sleeping chamber, for there was a cheap iron bedstead in it, and articles of male attire were scattered about the floor. From the quantity of them, {{and the manner in which}} they were lying, it also appeared that somebody had been endeavoring to ascertain which would fit him. Then Nettie, remembering the rags the man wore, sat down somewhat limply with burning cheeks in the <b>single</b> <b>chair,</b> until a little burst of meaningless laughter that was tinged with hysteria shook her.|$|E
60|$|The {{attendance}} at the electrocution was a very small one. We {{four members of the}} committee were, of course, present with the executioner, who was to act under their orders. The others were the United States Marshal, the governor of the gaol, the chaplain, and three members of the press. The room was a small brick chamber, forming an out-house to the Central Electrical station. It had been used as a laundry, and had an oven and copper at one side, but no other furniture save a <b>single</b> <b>chair</b> for the condemned man. A metal plate for his feet was placed in front of it, to which ran a thick insulated wire. Above, another wire depended from the ceiling, which could be connected with a small metallic rod projecting from a cap which was to be placed upon his head. When this connection was established Duncan Warner's hour was come.|$|E
60|$|Seeing {{that several}} of the other {{students}} were smoking, Cuthbert filled and lighted his pipe, calmly placed the pictures on the easels without taking off the cloths in which they were wrapped, and then put his hands into the pockets of his velvet jacket and looked round the room. After his experience of some of the luxuriously arranged studios at St. John's Wood, the room looked bare and desolate. There was no carpet and not a <b>single</b> <b>chair</b> or lounge of any description. Some fifteen young fellows were painting. All wore workmen's blouses. All had mustaches, and most of them had long hair. They appeared intent on their work, but smiles and winks were furtively exchanged, and the careless nonchalance of this tall young Englishman evidently amused them. In four or five minutes M. Goudé turned round and walked towards the easels. Cuthbert stepped to them and removed the cloths. The master stopped abruptly, looked at them without speaking for a minute or two, then walked up and closely examined them.|$|E
50|$|Rafferty ran the Snow King ski {{operation}} on his own, {{as a part-time}} job, from 1939 until 1946. That year a new corporation, the Jackson Hole Winter Sports Association, was formed with its immediate purpose being {{to take advantage of}} the post-war boom in the ski industry nationwide by installing a chairlift to the top of Snow King. The association raised $40,000 from local investors, bought an old tramway which had been used in a gold mining operation in Colorado near Salida, and hired a Denver contractor to construct a lift from it. Included in the purchase were structural beams for the top and bottom terminals, bullwheels, cables, towers, and carriers. The ore buckets that originally hung from the carriers were replaced with <b>single</b> <b>chairs.</b> The lift was installed in 1946-1947 and was an instant sensation, carrying 200 chairs per hour; in its first full year of operation more than 8,500 rode the lift to the top of the mountain. Rafferty was hired as the association’s full-time director, and continued to manage the ski operations until his retirement in 1974.|$|R
50|$|Tan Vaughn's Barber Shop, an {{extremely}} small (less than 200 square feet) wooden structure that was {{located at the}} intersection of Main street and Railroad Avenue (South East corner). Tan's barbershop was in operation from the late 1940s until the early 1990s and contained a <b>single</b> barber <b>chair,</b> and two or three waiting chairs for customers.

60|$|As {{the light}} faded and the greys of evening deepened into darkness, Kate sat patiently in her bare little room. A coal fire {{sputtered}} and sparkled in the rusty grate, {{and there was}} a tin bucket full of coals beside the fender from which to replenish it. She was very cold, so she drew her <b>single</b> <b>chair</b> up to the blaze and held her hands over it. It was a lonesome and melancholy vigil, while the wind whistled through the branches of the trees and moaned drearily in the cracks and crannies of the old house. When were her friends coming? Perhaps something had occurred to detain them to-day. This morning such a thing would have appeared to her to be an impossibility, but now that the time had come when she had expected them, it appeared probable enough that something might have delayed them. To-morrow at latest they could not fail to come. She wondered what they would do if they did arrive. Would they come boldly up the avenue and claim her from the Girdlestones, or would they endeavour to communicate with her first? Whatever they decided upon would be sure to be for the best.|$|E
60|$|He {{found himself}} in a simply {{furnished}} man's sitting-room. An easel was standing close to the window. There were reams of drawing paper and several unfinished sketches leaning against the wall. There was a small oak table {{in the middle of the}} room; against the wall stood an exquisite chiffonier, on which were resting some cut-glass decanters and goblets. There was a Turkey carpet upon the floor which matched the curtains, but to his surprise there was not a <b>single</b> <b>chair</b> of any sort to be seen. The walls had been distempered and were hung with one or two engravings which, although he was no judge, he was quite sure were good. He wandered into the back room, where he found a stove, a tea-service upon a deal table, and several other cooking utensils, all spotlessly clean and of the most expensive description. The walls here were plainly whitewashed, and the floor was of hard stone. He then tried the door on the left, which led into the larger portion of the building--the shed in which the lifeboat had once been kept. Not only was the door locked, but he saw at once that the lock was modern, and the door itself was secured with heavy iron clamps. He returned to the sitting-room.|$|E

Was the fellow's name Presnovich? if not, who was he? By the rage of the general, who, I suppose, is {{the chief of the}} police, it was evident he was frightfully disappointed that I wasn't the man he was looking for. Was this Presnovich somebody that girl Katia knew and wanted to get safely away? or was she made a fool of just as I was? She looked a bright, jolly sort of girl; but that goes for nothing in Russia, all sorts of people get mixed up in plots. If she was concerned in getting him away I suppose she fixed on me because, being English and a new-comer here, it would be easy for me to prove that I {{had nothing to do with}} plots or anything of that sort, whereas if a Russian had been in my place he might have got into a frightful mess over it. Well, I suppose it will all come right in the end. It is lucky that the weather has got milder or I should have had a good chance of being frozen to death; it is cold enough as it is." ...|$|E
