5|$|Various stories emerged about Edward’s deathbed wishes; {{according}} to one tradition, he requested that his heart be carried to the Holy Land, along with an army to fight the infidels. A more dubious story tells of how he wished for his bones to be carried along on future expeditions against the Scots. Another account of his deathbed scene is more credible; {{according to}} one chronicle, Edward gathered around him the Earls of Lincoln and Warwick, Aymer de Valence, and Robert Clifford, and charged them with looking after his son Edward. In particular they <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that Piers Gaveston {{was not allowed to}} return to the country. This wish, however, the son ignored, and had his favourite recalled from exile almost immediately. The new king, EdwardII, remained in the north until August, but then abandoned the campaign and headed south. He was crowned king on 25February 1308.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} some {{problems}} using disc brakes with certain frame designs. Under hard braking, the front wheel can come out from the dropouts.

6000|$|It {{is vital}} in a {{discussion}} like this that we <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> we are going by meanings and not by mere words. It is not necessary in any argument to settle what a word means or ought to mean. But it is necessary in every argument to settle what we propose to mean by the word. So long as our opponent understands what is the thing {{of which we are}} talking, it does not matter to the argument whether the word is or is not the one he would have chosen. A soldier does not say [...] "We were ordered to go to Mechlin; but I would rather go to Malines." [...] He may discuss the etymology and archaeology of the difference on the march: {{but the point is that}} he knows where to go. So long as we know what a given word is to mean in a given discussion, it does not even matter if it means something else in some other and quite distinct discussion. We have a perfect right to say that the width of a window comes to four feet; even if we instantly and cheerfully change the subject to the larger mammals, and say that an elephant has four feet. The identity of the words does not matter, because there is no doubt at all about the meanings; because nobody is likely to think of an elephant as four feet long, or of a window as having tusks and a curly trunk.|$|E
