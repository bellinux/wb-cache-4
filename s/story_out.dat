25|$|The {{incomplete}} form {{in which}} the Satyricon survives has tantalized many readers, and between 1692 and the present several writers have attempted to round the <b>story</b> <b>out.</b> In certain cases, following a well-known conceit of historical fiction, these invented supplements have been claimed to derive from newly discovered manuscripts, a claim that may appear all the more plausible since the real fragments actually came from two different medieval sources and were only brought together by 16th and 17th century editors.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} badly {{wanted to}} get its <b>story</b> <b>out</b> {{to the rest of}} the world and so, as soon as they acquired a territorial base in Benghazi, foreign reporters were able to join them. These reporters were, to a large extent, free to travel wherever and to talk to whomever they wished within opposition-controlled areas. This proximity and relative freedom of access to the opposition side of events, combined with reporters' natural sympathies for what they see as genuine popular rebellions against despotic regimes, undoubtedly aided the opposition and hurt the Gaddafi-government in getting their respective messages out.|$|E

[...] Lucas Foster during production of the film stated in an interview: [...] "The ideas got so large, that they really couldn't fit into, you know, one or two movies, they needed to evolve over at least three movies.

[...] Hawley plotted this <b>story</b> <b>out</b> to take only [...] "eight hours", which is why he asked FX for a shorter first season of eight episodes. Hawley noted that the characters' conflict is a metaphor for an internal struggle, given the Shadow King's position as a parasite within Haller's mind. He was also more interested in setting up a longer-running rivalry than having the antagonist be a [...] "villain-of-the-year", and so the season leaves the character to be an external threat to Haller in the second season.|$|E

[...] The Time Out Film Guide described Laserblast as a rip-off of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and said Billy's reign of destruction seemed random and senseless rather than driven by plot or characterization. The review called the film [...] "the epitome of what Frank Zappa once hymned as 'cheapness. The Globe and Mail writer Robert Martin called the script inept, said Steve Neill's make-up effects were [...] "frightful rather than frightening", and said Cheryl Smith could [...] "barely talk, let alone act".

500|$|Stephen Crane {{published}} his first novel, , in March 1893 {{at the age}} of 22. Maggie was not a success, either financially or critically. Most critics thought the unsentimental Bowery tale crude or vulgar, and Crane chose to publish the work privately after it was repeatedly rejected for publication. Crane found inspiration for his next novel while spending hours lounging in a friend's studio in the early summer of 1893. There, he became fascinated with issues of Century Magazine that were largely devoted to famous battles and military leaders from the Civil War.

Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled [...] "Facts vs. Fiction, A Correction of Falsehoods Contained in the May 6, 1991, Issues of Time Magazine", and [...] "The Story That Time Couldn't Tell". Prior to the advertising campaign, Scientologists distributed 88-page bound booklets which disputed points from Behar's article. The [...] "Fact vs. Fiction" [...] piece was a [...] booklet, which criticized Behar's article and asserted [...] "Behar's article omits {{the information on the}} dozens of community service programs conducted by Scientologists... which have been acknowledged by community officials". One of the advertisements in USA Today accused Time of promoting Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, and featured a 1936 issue of Time which had Hitler's picture on the front cover. The Church of Scientology sent out a news release condemning Time [...] "horrible history of supporting fascism", and said that the article was written because Time had been pressured by [...] "vested interests". When asked by the St. Petersburg Times whether this was the case, Time Executive Editor Richard Duncan responded [...] "Good Lord, no". Heber Jentzsch, at the time president of Church of Scientology International, issued a four-page news release which stated [...] "Advertising is the only way the church could be assured of getting its message and its side of the <b>story</b> <b>out</b> to the public without the same vested interests behind the Time article distorting it".|$|E

Their relationship comes under scrutiny from Chloe and Lex in [...] "Blue", with Chloe seeing it as a reason for co-workers to doubt Lois's true ability as a journalist, and Lex believing it will jeopardize the secret of Grant's true identity. In [...] "Gemini", the two finally agree to part ways. In the season eight premiere, Lois believes that Lex is responsible for Chloe's arrest by the Department of Domestic Security, and goes to his mansion to search his files for her location.

Her feelings for Clark become stronger as the season progresses, admitting in the episode [...] "Committed" [...] that she is in love with Clark, and stating to Oliver in the episode [...] "Bride" [...] that she has never felt this way about someone before. In the same episode, she almost shares a kiss with Clark before being interrupted by the arrival of Clark's ex-girlfriend Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk).

500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this <b>story</b> <b>out</b> it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Elaborating on the series' costumes, Carol Case, {{who also}} served as costume {{designer}} on Fargo, explained that she [...] "didn’t want anyone to be too locked into that 60s feel, because we were ultimately going for a ‘no period’ look." [...] Case took the series' color palette from [...] "60s rock bands—the golds and yellows and oranges and greens ... Noah said {{he wanted it to}} look like David was rescued by The Kinks". She then assigned colors from that palette to each lead character: Barrett wears orange and black; Carry and Kerry Loudermilk wear mostly navy and tan; Melanie Bird wear beige and pastel colors to [...] "convey her role as a caretaker"; and Haller wears different blues and greys, though his palette was [...] "more open than others’, given that his character {{is a bit of a}} work in progress." [...] Case sourced clothing from various vintage stores, but created other pieces from scratch, including all of the costumes worn by Katie Aselton which [...] "are more deeply rooted in the Swinging Sixties aesthetic than others." [...] The pink beanies worn by members of Division 3 were knitted by Case's sister and her friends for the series. Case deliberately avoided referencing any costumes from the comics [...] "to take this <b>story</b> <b>out</b> of where people think it sits". For the patients of Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, Case initially used [...] "a bunch of space-age-y looks that didn’t feel right", before settling on tracksuits with exaggerated collars to give them a [...] "futuristic feel". The orange tracksuits include colored stripes to indicate the seriousness of each patient's diagnosis, ranging from white stripes for Barrett ("which puts her in the ‘least crazy’ category"), to yellow stripes for [...] "moderate" [...] Haller, and red stripes for Busker which [...] "basically means she’s never getting out of there." [...] Busker's costumes evolve throughout the series to reflect her changing role, going from the orange and red focus to black and [...] "businessy" [...] clothes to show that [...] "She’s got a job to do, and she’s determined to do it." [...] Her design then become [...] "unhinged"; eventually she wears a twizzler as a collar bar, after being seen eating them throughout the season.|$|E
