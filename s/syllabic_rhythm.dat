Indian native languages are actually syllable-timed languages, like Latin and French. Indian-English speakers usually speak with a <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Further, in some Indian languages, stress {{is associated with a}} low pitch, whereas in most English dialects, stressed syllables are generally pronounced with a higher pitch. Thus, when some Indian speakers speak, they appear to put the stress accents at the wrong syllables, or accentuate all the syllables of a long English word. Certain Indian accents are of a [...] "sing-song" [...] nature, a feature seen in a few English dialects in Britain, such as Scouse and Welsh English.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecent {{advances}} in neuroscience {{have brought a}} great focus on how the auditory cortex tracks speech at certain time scales corresponding to pre-lexical speech units {{in order to achieve}} comprehension. In particular, it has been claimed that it is the <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm</b> to which slow neural oscillations in the auditory cortex entrain in order to chunk the speech stream into smaller informational units. However, the terms “syllable” and “rhythm” have been treated quite loosely in the current literature. We revisit classic approaches to show that both concepts do not necessarily have an acoustic or phonetic counterpart, which could be directly extracted by neural processes. We would like to suggest that the <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm</b> could emerge at the intersection of acoustic–phonetic and motor knowledge of speech. We furthermore propose that nesting of cortical oscillations might be the key mechanism to understand the timing constraints that lead to the emergence of the syllable...|$|E
40|$|Brain {{oscillations}} {{have been}} shown to track the slow amplitude fluctuations in speech during comprehension. Moreover, there is evidence that these stimulus-induced cortical rhythms may persist even after the driving stimulus has ceased. However, how exactly this neural entrainment shapes speech perception remains debated. This behavioral study investigated whether and how the frequency and phase of an entrained rhythm would influence the temporal sampling of subsequent speech. In two behavioral experiments, participants were presented with slow and fast isochronous tone sequences, followed by Dutch target words ambiguous between as /ɑs/ “ash” (with a short vowel) and aas /a:s/ “bait” (with a long vowel). Target words were presented at various phases of the entrained rhythm. Both experiments revealed effects of the frequency of the tone sequence on target word perception: fast sequences biased listeners to more long /a:s/ responses. However, no evidence for phase effects could be discerned. These findings show that an entrained rhythm’s frequency, but not phase, influences the temporal sampling of subsequent speech. These outcomes are compatible with theories suggesting that sensory timing is evaluated relative to entrained frequency. Furthermore, they suggest that phase tracking of (<b>syllabic)</b> <b>rhythms</b> by theta oscillations plays a limited role in speech parsing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} new {{experimental}} paradigm {{to explore the}} discriminability of languages, a question which {{is crucial to the}} child born in a bilingual environment. This paradigm employs the speech resynthesis technique, enabling the experimenter to preserve or degrade acoustic cues such as phonotactics, <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm,</b> or intonation from natural utterances. English and Japanese sentences were resynthesized, preserving broad phonotactics, rhythm, and intonation (condition 1), rhythm and intonation (condition 2), intonation only (condition 3), or rhythm only (condition 4). The findings support the notion that <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm</b> is a necessary and sufficient cue for French adult subjects to discriminate English from Japanese sentences. The results are consistent with previous research using low-pass filtered speech, as well as with phonological theories predicting rhythmic differences between languages. Thus, the new methodology proposed appears to be well suited to study language discrimination.

40|$|Recent {{hypotheses}} on {{the potential}} role of neuronal oscillations in speech perception propose that speech is processed on multi-scale temporal analysis windows formed by a cascade of neuronal oscillators locked to the input pseudo-rhythm. In particular, Ghitza (2011) proposed that the oscillators are in the theta, beta and gamma frequency bands with the theta oscillator the master, tracking the input <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm</b> and setting a time-varying, hierarchical window structure synchronized with the input. In the study described here the hypothesized role of theta was examined by measuring the intelligibility of speech with a manipulated modulation spectrum. Each critical-band signal was manipulated by controlling the degree of temporal-envelope flatness. Intelligibility of speech with critical-band envelopes that are flat is poor; inserting extra information, restricted to the input <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm,</b> markedly improves intelligibility. It is concluded that flattening the critical-band envelopes prevents the theta oscillator from tracking the input rhythm, hence the disruption of the hierarchical window structure that controls the decoding process. Reinstating the input-rhythm information revives the tracking capability, hence restoring the synchronization between the window structure and the input, resulting in the extraction of additional information from the flat modulation spectrum...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the idea}} that pulse in music {{may be related to}} human pulse is ancient and has {{recently}} been promoted by researchers (Parncutt, 2006; Snowdon & Teie, 2010), there has been no ordered delineation of the characteristics of music that are based on the sounds of the womb. I describe features of music that are based on sounds that are present in the womb: tempo of pulse (pulse is understood as the regular, underlying beat that defines the meter), amplitude contour of pulse, meter, musical notes, melodic frequency range, continuity, <b>syllabic</b> contour, melodic <b>rhythm,</b> melodic accents, phrase length, and phrase contour. There are a number of features of prenatal development that allow for the formation of long-term memories of the sounds of the womb in the areas of the brain that are responsible for emotions. Taken together, these features and the similarities between the sounds of the womb and the elemental building blocks of music allow for a postulation that the fetal acoustic environment may provide the bases for the fundamental musical elements that are found in the music of all cultures. This hypothesis is supported by a one-to-one matching of the universal features of music with the sounds of the womb: 1) all of the regularly heard sounds that are present in the fetal environment are represented in the music of every culture, and 2) all of the features of music that are present in the music of all cultures {{can be traced to the}} fetal environment...|$|R

Some of them have been {{announced}} his poems as beholder of modernism and mentioned some instances of exiting rhythm in his poems and composing in prosodic style and <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm</b> which are the most important aspects of that new poetry. He understood the local rhythm of the poem before Russian, French and Turkish poem. As some believed, he inspired of them to innovate the Persian poem. His early poems are like those of his father's, Mirza Ahmad e Elhami. But after his immigration to Tehran he experienced the new contraptions around poems. He excogitated content more than surface "Vafaye Beahd" (It's composed in 1288 Sh contemporary, Yad Ar ze Shame e Mordeh by Dehkhoda) is one his first experience from his 50 pieces as "Langroodi's 20 pieces and according Bashiri's commutation in 28 Ghete e has composed in <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Although these are not as well as other his poems but they're important for <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Kordish poem is one of Irainan's poem which influenced old syllabic rhythms in Kordish poem has 10 - 8 - 6 rhythm. There is pause and short silence in middle of hemistich. It is the main feature, this short pause has occurred in poems with 10 rhythms after fifth and in poems with 8 rhythms after forth and in poems with 6 rhythms after third rhythm. Lahoty has influenced Kordish poems; here are two types combined and noncombined rhythms: 1) Noncombined (single rhythm) poems that is composed with one <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm.</b> They have been classified into 3 rhythms: 10 rhythmic, 8 rhythmic, and 7 rhythmic poems. Lahoty has composed in these rhythms. 2) Combined rhythm: he applied 2 or 3 syllabic rhythms and the hemistiches equals to rimes this feature compensate deficiency from combination of 2 different rhythms. In most of these rhythms 10 syllabic ones are formed by combination to other syllables which could be counted by their frequency in Lahooti’s Divan. He has applied twice 9 syllabics and once 11, with the most common 10, 8, 7 syllabics. It should be noticed that all rhythms aren’t rhythmical. But have differed in number of syllables and arrangement in Lahooti's Divan. Combination of 7 & 10  Combination of 10 & 9 Combination of 10 & 5 They're beautiful rhythms. It appears that Lahooti feels more nostalgic to his hometown and his mother tongue, the rhythms prove this claim, because 9 and 11 rhyme (have been used 3 times) are most common. So, he can be known the genius of his period. As {{he has a lot of}} experiences in composition of Kordish poems, he could have used the rhythm possibilities of Kordish poems in Persian poetry...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{perception}} of duration-based <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm</b> was examined within a metrical framework. Par-ticipants assessed the duration patterns of four-syllable phrases set within the stress structure XxxX (an Aber-crombian trisyllabic foot). Using on-screen sliders, partic-ipants created percussive sequences that imitated speech rhythms and analogous non-speech monotone rhythms. There was {{a tendency to}} equalize the interval durations for speech stimuli but not for non-speech. Despite the percep-tual regularization of syllable durations, different speech phrases were conceived in various rhythmic configurations, pointing to a diversity of perceived meters in speech. In addition, imitations of speech stimuli showed more vari-ability than those of non-speech. Rhythmically skilled lis-teners exhibited lower variability and were more consistent with vowel-centric estimates when assessing speech stim-uli. These findings enable new connections between meter-and duration-based models of speech rhythm perception...|$|E

Short term memory functionality might facilitate Hebbian learning through LTP by holding a new pattern while synaptic potentiation occurs.

40|$|Many {{environmental}} stimuli {{present a}} quasi-rhythmic structure at different timescales {{that the brain}} needs to decompose and integrate.

Yet their causal role in such a process has never been demonstrated. Here, we used a neural microcircuit model to address whether coupled theta-gamma oscillations, as observed in human auditory cortex, could underpin the multiscale sensory analysis of speech. We show that, in continuous speech, theta oscillations can flexibly track the <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm</b> and temporally organize the phoneme-level response of gamma neurons into a code that enables syllable identification. The tracking of slow speech fluctuations by theta oscillations, and its coupling to gamma-spiking activity both appeared as critical features for accurate speech encoding.

The results provide further evidence that listeners' segmentation of spoken words relies on procedures determined by the characteristic phonology of their native language...|$|E

40|$|Syllables are {{considered}} as basic supra-segmental units, used mainly in prosodic modelling. It {{has long been}} thought that efficient syllabification algorithms may also provide valuable cues for improved segmental (acoustic) modelling.

In this paper we introduce a new method for detection of syllable boundaries based on a model of speech parsing into syl-lables by neural oscillations in human auditory cortex. Neural oscillations automatically lock to speech slow fluctuations that convey the <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Similarly as humans encode speech incrementally, i. e., not considering future temporal context, the proposed method works incrementally as well. In addition, it is highly robust to noise. Syllabification performance for En-glish and different noise conditions was compared to the exist-ing Mermelstein and group delay algorithms. While the perfor-mance of the existing methods depend {{on the type of}} noise and signal to noise ratio, the performance of the proposed method is constant under all noise conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to use {{functional}} imaging to compare cortical activations involved in reading Hindi and English that differ markedly in terms of their orthographies by a group of late bilinguals, more fluent in Hindi (L 1) than English (L 2). English is alphabetic and linear, in that vowels and consonants are arranged sequentially. In contrast, Hindi, written in Devanagari, is an alphasyllabary and non-linear writing system wherein vowels are placed around consonants making it a visually complex script. Additionally, the grapheme to phoneme mapping in English is opaque while Devanagari is transparent. Effects of reading fluency were seen in significantly slower reading times and direct English-Hindi comparison showed left putamen activation for the less fluent language (English). Direct Hindi-English orthography comparisons revealed activation in the temporal pole and caudate nucleus of the right hemisphere, cortical areas known to be involved in semantic and visual processing.

40|$|Auditory {{cortical}} {{activity is}} entrained to the temporal envelope of speech, which {{corresponds to the}} <b>syllabic</b> <b>rhythm</b> of speech. Such entrained cortical activity can be measured from subjects naturally listening to sentences or spoken passages, and provides a reliable neural maker of online speech processing. A central question still remains to be answered about whether cortical entrainment is {{more closely related to}} speech perception or non-speech-specific auditory encoding. Here, we review a few hypotheses about the functional roles of cortical entrainment, e. g., encoding acoustic features, parsing syllabic boundaries, and selecting sensory information in complex listening environments. It is likely that speech entrainment is not a homogeneous response and these hypotheses work for speech entrainment generated from different neural sources. The relationship between cortical entrainment and speech intelligibility is also discussed. A tentative conclusion is that theta-band entrainment (4 - 8 Hz) encodes speech features that are critical for intelligibility while delta-band entrainment (1 - 4 Hz) is related to the perceived, non-speech-specific acoustic rhythm. To further understand the functional properties of speech entrainment, a splitter’s approach will be needed to investigate (1) not just the temporal envelope but what specific acoustic features are encoded and (2) not just speech intelligibility but what specific psycholinguistic processes are encoded by entrained cortical activity. Similarly, the anatomical and spectro-temporal details of speech entrainment need {{to be taken into account}} when investigating its functional properties...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} drawn from a larger study of Bob Dylan’s vocal style from 1960 to 1966. In that six-year span, I found that four {{distinctive}} sub-styles could be delineated. 1 The last of these, beginning in 1965 and continuing until Dylan’s motorcycle accident in July 1966, is probably his most well-known sub-style. This sub-style seems to lie in a middle ground between song and speech, {{with a great deal}} of sliding pitch and rhythmically free text declamation. This is also the time period when Dylan had his greatest commercial and critical success, peaking with the release in July 1965 of “Like A Rolling Stone. ” In addition to the song’s commercial success, a number of commentators have pointed to it as an artistic peak, many of them citing “Like A Rolling Stone ” as the most important single performance of Dylan’s 44 -year (at the time of writing) recording career. My intention here is to analyze a recorded performance of a single verse of one of Dylan’s most popular songs, observing the ways in which intonation details relate to lyrics and performance. The analysis is used as source material for a close reading of the semantic, affective, and “playful” meanings of the performance.

It is also shown that, overall, Maori speakers use {{a higher percentage of}} High Rising Terminals than Pakeha speakers. The results relating to pitch suggest that Maori English pitch is becoming higher over time, with young Maori speakers producing a significantly higher mean pitch than young Pakeha speakers. Secondly, a Perception Experiment using 107 listeners is carried out to investigate the role of suprasegmental information in the identification of Maori English and Pakeha English. The ability of listeners to identify the two dialects based on prosodic cues only is tested in seven different speech conditions. The various conditions aim to isolate the precise suprasegmental features participants may use to identify speaker ethnicity. The results reveal that listeners are aware of the differing rhythmic properties of Maori English and Pakeha English, and are capable of tuning into the rhythmic characteristics of a speaker {{to use it as a}} cue in dialect identification, with some level of accuracy. The perceptual relevance of other prosodic cues is also discussed and the results indicate that, based on certain stereotypes, Maori English speech is assumed to be low-pitched, monotonous, hesitant and slow in pace. It is also shown that listeners who have had greater exposure to Maori English perform significantly better in a dialect identification task than those who are not integrated into Maori social networks, proving that the linguistic experience of the listener is a key indicator of his or her performance in ethnic dialect identification...|$|E
