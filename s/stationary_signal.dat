In addition, a determination of the relative processing gain between the 1 - 1 / 2 D sub ips method and the spectrogram is made for <b>stationary</b> <b>signals</b> in noise. The results of this thesis show that 1 - 1 / 2 Dips has a processing gain advantage over that of the spectrogram {{for a range of}} input SNR that depends upon the size of the data window. Under some conditions, the bispectrum can detect both harmonic coupling and phase coupling between the components of multi-component signals. IHOMS' ability to detect linear chirps in noise is limited to chirps having different slew rates, and the method has a significantly greater computational cost than both the spectrogram and 1 - 1 / 2 Dips.

40|$|In many {{applications}} in signal processing, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) plays {{a significant role}} in analyzing characteristics of <b>stationary</b> <b>signals</b> in the frequency domain. The DFT can be implemented in a very efficient way using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. However, many actual signals by their nature are non [...] <b>stationary</b> <b>signals</b> which make the choice of the DFT to deal with such signals not appropriate. Alternative tools for analyzing non [...] <b>stationary</b> <b>signals</b> come with the development of time [...] frequency distributions (TFD). The Wigner [...] Ville distribution is a time [...] frequency distribution that represents linear chirps in an ideal way, but it has the problem of cross [...] terms which makes the analysis of such tools unacceptable for multi [...] component signals. In this dissertation, we develop three definitions of linear chirp transforms which are: the continuous linear chirp transform (CLCT), the discrete linear chirp transform (DLCT), and the discrete cosine chirp transform (DCCT). Most of this work focuses on the discrete linear chirp transform (DLCT) which can be considered a generalization of the DFT to analyze non [...] <b>stationary</b> <b>signals.</b> The DLCT is a joint frequency chirp [...] rate transformation, capable of locally representing signals in terms of linear chirps.

Since this novel transform can be implemented in a fast and efficient way, this would make the proposed transform a candidate to be used for {{many applications}}, including chirp rate estimation, signal compression, filtering, signal separation, elimination of the cross [...] terms in the Wigner [...] Ville distribution, and in communication systems. In this dissertation, we will explore some of these applications...|$|R
