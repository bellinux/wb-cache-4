40|$|ABSTRACT: a 76 -year-old female patient {{complained of}} {{progressive}} episodes of chest and left arm pain and numbness, {{accompanied by a}} burning sensation in the left breast. The symptoms were nitroglycerine responsive and consistent with her prior angina. Cardiac history included an initial percutaneous coronary intervention and 4 subsequent occurrences of restenosis in a <b>stented</b> <b>area</b> of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Following a fifth re-stenosis of the LAD, the Novoste Beta-Cath Brachytherapy System was employed following balloon dilatation of the persistent recurrence. At 10 months post-brachytherapy, angiography revealed a patent LAD with no evidence of in-stent restenosis...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} in vivo the arterial wall temperature after coronary stent implantation in pigs. METHODS: We performed cardiac catheterization in 20 pigs with normal coronary arteries. Arterial wall temperature was studied with a thermography system that uses a 4 -thermistor sensor tip. A segment was selected in the proximal right coronary artery. Temperature was mapped in this segment by means of a continuous catheter pullback. A stent was then implanted in the middle of this area, and the temperature scan was repeated. Pigs were randomized in two groups (10 + 10 pigs) for arterial temperature scanning: group A to be re-scanned after 5 days and then sacrificed, and group B to be re-scanned after 8 days and then sacrificed. RESULTS: The temperature of the arterial wall before stent implantation was equal to the adjacent areas. Immediately after stent implantation, the <b>stented</b> <b>area</b> had lower temperature than the adjacent areas (p < 0. 001). Five days after implantation, the <b>stented</b> <b>area</b> was significantly warmer than the adjacent areas (p < 0. 001); histopathology showed the highest macrophage population at the place of the stent. Eight days after implantation, the temperature differences were reduced to non-significant levels (p = NS) and the macrophage population was significantly lower. CONCLUSION: Stent implantation results in an immediate temperature decrease at the stented arterial segment, followed by a significant temperature increase around day 5 after stent implantation. These findings can be correlated with the peri-strut inflammation that follows the stent implantation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Aims In many countries, {{drug-eluting}} stent implantation is {{the dominant}} interventional strategy. We evaluated the clinical, angiographic, procedural, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) predictors of angiographic restenosis after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation. Methods and results SES implantation was successfully performed in 550 patients with 670 native coronary lesions. Six-month follow-up angiography was performed in 449 patients (81. 6 %) with 543 lesions (81. 1 %). Clinical, angiographic, procedural, and IVUS predictors of restenosis were determined. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, the only independent predictors of angiographic reste-nosis were post-procedural final minimum <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> by IVUS [odds ratio (OR) 0. 586, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 387 – 0. 888, P 0. 012] and IVUS-measured stent length (OR 1. 029, 95 % CI 1. 002 – 1. 056, P 0. 035). Final minimum <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> by IVUS and IVUS-measured stent length that best separated restenosis from non-restenosis were 5. 5 mm 2 and 40 mm, respectively. Lesions with final minimum <b>stent</b> <b>area,</b> 5. 5 mm 2 and stent length. 40 mm had {{the highest rate of}} angiographic restenosis [17. 7 % (11 / 62) ], P, 0. 001 compared with other groups.

40|$|SummaryVery late stent {{thrombosis}} (VLST) after implantation of a drug-eluting stent (DES) {{is a rare}} but catastrophic complication and {{the mechanisms}} are not completely understood. We describe a 76 -year-old patient with recurrent VLST of DES that developed at 13 and 23 months after the initial catheter procedure of DES implantation under the cessation of dual antiplatelet therapy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) observation revealed small <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> of a DES. Based on the OCT findings, balloon angioplasty for expansion of the DES was performed and angiographic Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction grade 3 flow was subsequently obtained. Small <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> is considered {{a significant factor in}} acute or subacute stent thrombosis according to previous reports. The present report shows that small <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> of DES may be regarded as a key factor in recurrent VLST as well as cessation of dual antiplatelet therapy...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe report {{intravascular}} ultrasound (IVUS) findings after crush-stenting of bifurcation lesions. BackgroundPreliminary {{results with}} the crush-stent technique are encouraging; however, isolated reports suggest that restenosis {{at the side}} branch (SB) ostium {{continues to be a}} problem. MethodsForty patients with bifurcation lesions underwent crush-stenting with the sirolimus-eluting stent. Postintervention IVUS was performed in both branches in 25 lesions and only the main vessel (MV) in 15 lesions; IVUS analysis included five distinct locations: MV proximal <b>stent,</b> crush <b>area,</b> distal <b>stent,</b> SB ostium, and SB distal stent. ResultsOverall, the MV minimum <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> was larger than the SB (6. 7 ± 1. 7 mm 2 vs. 4. 4 ± 1. 4 mm 2, p 60 % of non-left main lesions.

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{clinical}} studies and their meta-analysis suggest that developed collateral {{vessels in the}} heart correlate to {{an increased risk of}} in-stent restenosis. The possible physiological interaction between the collateral development and in-stent restenosis is investigated in this study. Based on existing publications, a hypothesis is suggested that the increased risk of in-stent restenosis is caused by a decrease in flow speed in the <b>stented</b> <b>area,</b> which lowers the wall shear stress there and causes a more severe tissue growth. For testing this hypothesis, an analytical model based on the hydro-electrical analogy is used. From this model, flow through the ischemic region is obtained for varying severity of stenosis and collateral flow indexes. The results suggest that even rather low collateral flow index has a considerable effect on the flow through restenosed artery for physiologically significant stenosis. This change in flow can indeed affect the wall shear stress and change the growth dynamics, so it might be necessary to account for it in models of in-stent restenosis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{visualization}} of spinal cord feeding arteries {{in patients with}} complex thoracic aortic pathology undergoing endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) using an optimized protocol for multislice computed tomographic angiography (MSCTA). Methods: Eighteen consecutive patients (13 men; mean age 63 years, range 45 – 79) with aortic type B dissections (n 55), chronic expanding aortic dissections (n 55), thoracic aortic aneurysms (n 56), or penetrating aortic ulcers (n 52) underwent 16 -slice CTA before and after (mean interval 9 days) EVAR. Pulse rate and neurological status were documented. Quantitative density measurements were taken at regions of interest (ROI) in the ascending thoracic aorta and {{at the level of}} the diaphragm. Two experienced radiologists qualitatively assessed the posterior intercostal arteries (PIA; fully visible, partially visible, non-visible), dorsal branches (DB; visible/non-visible), and artery of Adamkiewicz (AKA; visible/non-visible) on multiplanar reformations and maximum intensity projection reconstructions. Results: MSCTA was performed successfully in 17 / 18 patients before and after EVAR (1 patient was excluded after EVAR owing to rising creatinine levels).

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{compared}} intravascular ultrasound {{findings of}} drug-eluting stent (DES) –treated lesions that developed thrombosis versus in-stent restenosis (ISR). BackgroundStent underexpansion is {{a predictor of}} both DES thrombosis and ISR. However, all underexpanded DES may not be equal. MethodsIntravascular ultrasound findings from 20 definite DES thrombosis patients (representing all definite thromboses from 1, 407 consecutive DES patients undergoing intravascular ultrasound imaging) were compared with 50 risk-factor-balanced ISR patients with no evidence of stent thrombosis and 50 risk-factor-balanced “no-event” patients with neither thrombosis nor ISR. ResultsMinimum <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> (3. 9 ± 1. 0 mm 2 vs. 5. 0 ± 1. 7 mm 2, p = 0. 008), mean <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> (5. 3 ± 1. 0 mm 2 vs. 7. 2 ± 2. 0 mm 2, p = 0. 001), and both focal (55. 4 ± 13. 2 % vs. 74. 9 ± 19. 9 %, p < 0. 001) and diffuse stent expansion (77. 4 ± 19. 3 % vs. 109. 5 ± 23. 1 %, p < 0. 001) were significantly smaller in the stent thrombosis group versus ISR and in both groups versus the “no-event” group. Minimum <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> < 4. 0 mm 2 (65 % vs. 32 %, p = 0. 01) or < 5. 0 mm 2 (85 % vs. 52 %, p = 0. 01) was {{more common in the}} stent thrombosis versus the ISR group and in both groups vs. “no-event” patients; and the relative length of the <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> < 5 mm 2 was greatest in the stent thrombosis group (36. 6 ± 37. 7 %), intermediate in the ISR group (22. 8 ± 35. 6 %), and least in the “no-event” group (10. 9 ± 26. 4 %), p = 0. 04. In the stent thrombosis group, the minimum <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> site occurred in the proximal stent segment in 50 % versus 24 % in the ISR group (p = 0. 03). There were no differences in edge dissection, stent fracture, or stent-vessel-wall malapposition among the groups.

40|$|Drug-eluting stent (DES) {{thrombosis}} (ST) can be devastating. The study aim was {{to evaluate}} intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) predictors for DES thrombosis by comparing IVUS studies after implantation in 13 patients with 14 DES thrombosis lesions {{with a group of}} controls (30 lesions in 27 patients) matched for history of chronic renal failure and type of DES. Five patients (38 %) discontinued dual antiplatelet therapy at the time of ST. There were 3 in-stent restenosis lesions (21 %) treated using DESs in the ST group compared with 0 in the control group (p < 0. 05). Compared with the control group, IVUS studies in the ST group showed a smaller minimum <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> (4. 6 +/- 1. 1 vs 5. 6 +/- 1. 7 mm(2), p = 0. 0489). In the ST group, 11 of 14 stents had a minimum <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> < or = 5. 0 mm(2) compared with 12 of 30 in the control group (p = 0. 0392). Minimum <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> in patients who stopped clopidogrel therapy and developed ST (5. 30 +/- 1. 15 mm(2)) tended to be larger compared with that in patients who developed ST while using clopidogrel (4. 24 +/- 0. 96 mm(2), p = 0. 091). Within the 5 -mm-long proximal and distal reference segments analyzed, the ST group had larger proximal reference maximum plaque burdens and smaller minimum lumen areas, along with a tendency toward similar findings in the distal reference segments.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess whether the newer stent {{delivery}} systems provide a <b>stented</b> lumen cross-sectional <b>area</b> (CSA) that is equal to the delivery balloon nominal dimensions. BACKGROUNDFirst generation stents were often not adequately expanded with their delivery system and frequently required higher pressure or a larger balloon after deployment. Newer stents were designed to optimize expansion with noncompliant, high-pressure balloons provided as the delivery systems. METHODSIntravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was used to evaluate 38 stents in 32 patients after deployment at 14 to 16 atm with their delivery balloon system. Minimum stent lumen CSA and stent minimum lumen diameter (MLD) were measured by IVUS imaging. The manufacturer’s expected stent diameter was defined as the balloon diameter measured by the company at the maximum pressure used. The manufacturer’s expected <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> was calculated based on the manufacturer’s expected stent diameter. RESULTSThe MLD (2. 5 ± 0. 5 mm) and minimum stent CSA (6. 0 ± 1. 7 mm 2) by IVUS were significantly smaller than the manufacturer’s expected stent diameter (3. 5 ± 0. 4 mm) and area (9. 5 ± 1. 9 mm 2) (p < 0. 0001, respectively). The mean MLD by IVUS was 72 ± 8 % of the expected stent diameter, and the mean minimum stent CSA by IVUS was 62 ± 10 % of the expected <b>stent</b> <b>area.</b> CONCLUSIONSDespite moderately high-pressure inflations, the mean minimum stent CSA actually achieved was, on average, only 62 % of the manufacturer’s expected <b>stent</b> <b>area.</b> To optimize <b>stent</b> deployment, these IVUS observations should be considered during coronary artery stenting...|$|R

A bioresorbable stent that scaffolds the airway lumen and dissolves after the remodeling process is completed has advantages over metallic and silicone stents. We designed and fabricated a new mesh-type bioresorbable stent with a backbone of polycaprolactone (PCL), and evaluated its safety and biocompatibility in a rabbit trachea model. MethodsThe PCL stent was fabricated by a laboratory-made microinjection molding machine. In vitro mechanical {{strength of the}} PCL stents was tested and {{compared to that of}} commercial silicone stents. The bioresorbable stents were surgically implanted into the cervical trachea of New Zealand white rabbits (n =  6). Animals received bronchoscopic examination at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. Histological examination was completed to evaluate the biocompatibility of the stents. ResultsNo animals died during the period of study. Distal stent migration was noted in 1 rabbit. In-stent secretion accumulation was found in 2 rabbits. Histological examination showed intact ciliated epithelium and marked leukocyte infiltration in the submucosa of the <b>stented</b> <b>area</b> at 10 and 28 weeks. Stent degradation was minimal, and the mechanical strength was well preserved at the end of 33 weeks.

Design a single centre, prospective study. Materials and methods between March 1997 and August 1999, 139 consecutive lower extremities with chronic iliac venous obstruction (61 limbs with primary disease [MTS] and 78 with post-thrombotic disease [PTS]) were treated by balloon dilation and stenting. History, clinical examination, procedure and follow-up data were recorded. Results mortality was zero. Non-thrombotic complication rate was only 3 %. Postoperative (8 %, 6 / 78) and late occlusion (3 %, 2 / 69) occurred only in post-thrombotic limbs. Primary, primary-assisted and secondary cumulative patency rates of the <b>stented</b> <b>area</b> at 2 years were 52 %, 88 % and 90 %, respectively, in the PTS group as compared to 60 %, 100 % and 100 % in the MTS group. Clinical improvement in pain and swelling was significant in both groups. Half of active venous ulcers healed after the procedure. Conclusions chronic iliac vein obstruction {{appears to be a}} symptomatic lesion that can be treated safely and effectively by endovascular surgery regardless of aetiology. Generous use of IVUS is suggested in both diagnosis and treatment since phlebography is unreliable. The clinical improvement was significant in both groups; however, more excessive neointimal hyperplasia and a higher early and late occlusion rate were observed in post-thrombotic disease. Stenting after balloon dilation is advised in all venoplasties; stents should be inserted well into the IVC when treating iliocaval junction stenosis. A wide-diameter (16 mm) stent is recommended. The stent should cover the entire lesion as outlined by the IVUS...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) {{guidelines}} {{recommend the}} use of bare-metal stents (BMS) in non-complex lesions with a low risk of restenosis (diameter >/= 3 mm and lesion length 15 mm). However, the guidelines were created based on studies evaluating BMS and DES only. We performed an analysis of patients undergoing non-urgent percutaneous coronary intervention with the novel endothelial cell capturing stent (ECS). The ECS is coated with CD 34 (+) antibodies that attract circulating endothelial progenitor cells to the stent surface, thereby accelerating the endothelialization of the <b>stented</b> <b>area.</b> We analyzed all patients enrolled in the worldwide e-HEALING registry that met the NICE criteria for either low-risk or high-risk lesions and were treated with >/= 1 ECS. The main study outcome was target vessel failure (TVF) at 12 -month follow-up, defined as the composite of cardiac death or MI and target vessel revascularization (TVR). A total of 4, 241 patients were assessed in the current analysis. At 12 -month follow-up, TVF occurred in 7. 0 % of the patients with low-risk lesions and in 8. 8 % of the patients with high-risk lesions (p = 0. 045). When evaluating the diabetic patients versus the non-diabetic patients per risk group, {{no significant differences were}} found in TVF, MI or TVR in either risk group. The ECS shows good clinical outcomes in lesions carrying either a high or a low risk of restenosis according to the NICE guidelines with comparable rates of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis. The TVF rate with ECS was slightly higher in patients with high-risk lesions, driven by higher clinically driven TLR. The risk of restenosis with ECS in patients carrying high-risk lesions needs to be carefully considered relative to other risks associated with DES. Furthermore, the presence of diabetes mellitus did not influence the incidence of TVF in either risk group...|$|E

Importantly, 55 % of lumen enlargement after repeat PTCA {{was the result of}} additional stent expansion and 45 % was the result of extrusion of tissue through the <b>stent</b> (decreased IH <b>area</b> within the <b>stent).</b> There was no evidence of compression of neointimal tissue post-PTCA (no change in overall plaque area).

40|$|The {{persistence}} of thrombus inside stent struts {{is a frequent}} event in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and this phenomenon might be {{associated with an increased}} risk of stent thrombosis. We sought to quantify by means of optical coherence tomography (OCT) the presence of in-stent thrombus after achievement of an optimal angiographic result in patients with ACS undergoing PCI. In addition, we evaluated the feasibility and safety of an OCT-guided strategy of in-stent thrombus removal. Eighty consecutive patients with ACS undergoing PCI were treated with two different strategies equally divided into two groups: angio-guided PCI, and OCT-guided PCI, in which additional OCT-driven in-stent balloon dilatation was adopted to reduce thrombus encroachment of the lumen. Overall in-stent thrombus area was 4. 3 % with a maximal thrombus encroachment of 16. 7 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intracoronary polymer-based stent {{delivery}} of paclitaxel {{has been shown}} to be effective in reducing restenosis in simple coronary lesions, but the evidence base for contemporary use in longer, more complex coronary stenoses is lacking. METHODS AND RESULTS: TAXUS VI is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial assessing clinical and angiographic outcomes of the TAXUS Moderate Release paclitaxel-eluting stent in the treatment of long, complex coronary artery lesions. Four hundred forty-eight patients at 44 sites were randomized (1 : 1) between a drug-eluting TAXUS Express 2 and an uncoated Express 2 control stent. Per protocol, the 9 -month follow-up included an angiographic reevaluation in all patients. The primary end point was the rate of target-vessel revascularization 9 months after the study procedure; secondary end points included the rate of target-lesion revascularization and binary restenosis at follow-up. Mean lesion length in the study was 20. 6 mm, with a mean stent-covered length of 33. 4 mm. Of all lesions, 55. 6 % were classified as complex lesions (type C of the AHA/ACC classification). At 9 months, target-vessel revascularization was 9. 1 % in the TAXUS group and 19. 4 % in the control group (P= 0. 0027; relative reduction, 53 %). Target-lesion revascularization was reduced from 18. 9 % to 6. 8 %, respectively (P= 0. 0001). The incidence of major adverse cardiac events was similar in the 2 groups, 16. 4 % and 22. 5 % in TAXUS and control, respectively (P= 0. 12), including comparable rates for acute myocardial infarction.

40|$|AIMS: To {{provide insight}} on the {{patients}} with long lesions that received multiple, overlapping stents by reporting clinical outcomes, {{together with a}} detailed angiographic and intravascular ultrasound analysis of the overlap zone. METHODS AND RESULTS: TAXUS VI is a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, trial, specifically designed to assess outcomes of paclitaxel-eluting stents in longer lesions by randomising 446 patients (1 : 1) between a drug-eluting TAXUS Express 2 Moderate Release (MR) and an uncoated Express 2 control stent. Multiple overlapping stents were implanted in 124 patients (27. 8 %) and {{are the subject of}} this report. Clinical, angiographic and IVUS outcomes at nine months were compared in the overlap group for patients receiving the TAXUS Express 2 MR stent and the uncoated Express 2 stent. In the overlap group, mean lesion length was 25. 1 mm with a mean stent length of 43. 6 mm. At nine months, TVR was reduced by 94 % from 25. 0 % to 1. 6 % in the TAXUS patients compared with control (p=< 0. 0001); TLR was reduced by 93 % from 23. 3 % to 1. 6 % (p= 0. 0002). Binary restenosis in the <b>stented</b> <b>area</b> was reduced by 89 % from 45. 5 % in the control patients to 4. 8 % in the TAXUS patients (p< 0. 0001). There was a trend towards a higher 30 -day myocardial infarction rate in the TAXUS group (7. 9 % vs. 1. 6 %; p= 0. 21), but by nine months, MACE was significantly reduced by 62. 0 %, from 25. 0 % to 9. 5 % in favour of the TAXUS patients (p= 0. 0305). Late acquired incomplete apposition on IVUS was infrequent in either group and was not located in the overlap zone, nor was the finding associated with late MACE. No stent thrombosis occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of multiple overlapping TAXUS MR stents appears safe and effective in the treatment of long complex coronary artery lesions...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} {{the impact of}} previous infection with cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori on neointimal proliferation after coronary angioplasty with stent implantation.  DESIGN—The study population {{was made up of}} 180  patients who had stent implantation in a native coronary artery with systematic angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) follow up at six months. Quantitative coronary angiography was used to assess the late lumen loss. The mean area of neointimal tissue within the stent and the ratio of neointimal tissue to <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> were assessed from IVUS images. Previous cytomegalovirus, C pneumoniae, and H pylori infection was identified by IgG antibody determination.  RESULTS—Previous cytomegalovirus infection was detected in 50 % of the population, previous C pneumoniae in 18 %, and previous H pylori in 33 %. Mean (SD) reference diameter was 2. 94  (0. 48)  mm and mean minimum lumen diameter after stent implantation was 2. 45  (0. 42) mm. At six months, the mean late loss was 0. 74  (0. 50)  mm, the mean neointimal tissue area was 3. 8  (1. 7)  mm 2, and the average ratio of neointimal tissue <b>area</b> to <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> was 45  (18) %. None of these variables of restenosis was linked to any of the three infectious agents. By multivariate analysis, lesion length was the variable best correlated with mean neointimal tissue area, the ratio of neointimal tissue to <b>stent</b> <b>area,</b> and late loss, explaining respectively 31 %, 39 %, and 8 % of their variability.  CONCLUSIONS—Previous infection with cytomegalovirus, C pneumoniae, or H pylori was not a contributing factor in the process of restenosis after stent implantation.    Keywords: restenosis; stent; ultrasonics; angiography; infectio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to study {{negative and positive}} arterial remodeling processes within self-expanding carotid stents, their interaction, and the resulting changes in hemodynamics over 2 years, with duplex ultrasound scanning. Subjects and methodsOne hundred twelve consecutive patients with 121 successfully stented carotid arteries were examined with color-coded duplex ultrasound scanning {{the day after the}} stent procedure and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up. The stent diameters at the proximal, middle, and distal regions, and the maximal neointimal thickness (B-mode) and hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Pre-interventional plaques were assigned to three types: soft, fibrous, and largely calcified. ResultsThe diameters of the self-expanding stents steadily increased over 2 years (positive arterial remodeling), from (mean ± SD) 5. 80 ± 0. 89 mm to 6. 77 ± 0. 98 mm in the proximal <b>stent</b> <b>area,</b> from 3. 51 ± 0. 76 mm to 4. 92 ± 0. 89 mm in the middle <b>stent</b> <b>area,</b> and from 3. 7 ± 0. 5 mm to 4. 68 ± 0. 61 mm in the distal <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> (P <. 001). Stent expansion was most marked in the middle <b>stent</b> <b>area,</b> {{depending on the type of}} pre-interventional plaque. The extent in stent expansion was more in soft than in fibrous and calcified plaques (P <. 001). Neointimal thickness increased up to 12 months, and stabilized thereafter. The mean (± SD) neointimal thickness at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months was 0. 61 ± 0. 28 mm, 0. 97 ± 0. 39 mm, 1. 06 ± 0. 36 mm, and 1. 12 ± 0. 38 mm, respectively. These complex interactions resulted in the dominance of negative remodeling secondary to neointimal proliferation, with an increased flow ratio during the first year, from 1. 16 ± 0. 37 at day 1 to 1. 23 ± 0. 46 at 3 months, 1. 67 ± 1. 37 at 6 months, and 1. 57 ± 0. 70 at 12 months (P <. 001), followed by a tendency to decrease as a result of stent expansion thereafter (flow ratio at 24 months, 1. 49 ± 0. 70). Two of 121 stents (1. 6 %) had recurrent stenosis that required a secondary procedure. ConclusionsNeointimal proliferation or negative arterial remodeling prevails up to 12 months, and may give rise to rare stent recurrent stenosis. Stent expansion reduces this effect in the first year, and dominates in the second year. This might contribute to the good mid-term outcome of carotid stenting. Poor stent expansion in heavily calcified plaques calls for primary surgical management...|$|R

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} {{a leading cause of}} {{mortality}} throughout the world and over one million stents are deployed annually to treat this pathology. Unfortunately, 30 % of patients experience persistent narrowing of the stented region (restenosis) within six months due to neointimal hyperplasia (NH). Rates of restenosis vary with stent design and stent geometry has been identified as an important predictor of NH. Vascular geometry influences local wall shear stress (WSS) distributions as branching and curvature threaten the preferential flow environment of intravascular cells and correlate with sites of NH. Stent deployment also causes vascular damage and recent data indicates that WSS mediates the rate and location of cellular proliferation after vascular injury. Therefore, this investigation tested the hypothesis that alterations in distributions of WSS unique to the geometry of the stented portion of a vessel correlate with NH using a chronic model of stent implantation in vivo and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. The iliac artery blood flow environment 14 and 21 days after stent implantation was obtained by 3 D microfocal x-ray computed tomography imaging and reconstruction of rabbit iliac arteries, and WSS determined using CFD. NH was localized to the stented region as revealed by histology. Indices of WSS were inversely related to NH. Lowest values of WSS localized to the <b>stented</b> <b>area</b> of a theoretical artery after acute implantation were incrementally increased after 14 and 21 days as NH formed within this region. Additional CFD models demonstrated that stent properties including deployment diameter, flexibility, length, stent-induced vascular deformation and strut number, width and thickness also adversely influenced indices of WSS. These results indicate that stent implantation introduces spatial and temporal alterations in WSS unique to the geometry of an implanted stent in vivo. Identifying perturbations in vascular geometry and WSS after stent placement may help delineate mechanisms associated with NH, stimulate the development of new stent designs and novel drug coatings, enhance overall stent performance and ultimately contribute to a lower rate of restenosis...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectivesIt {{has been}} {{reported}} that the overlap of sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs) is associated with greater in-stent late lumen loss and more angiographic restenosis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate whether the site of such overlap shows increased or decreased late lumen loss as assessed by quantitative coronary angiogram. Methods and resultsWe compared 7 -month angiographic late lumen loss at the site of overlap in patients with multiple overlapping stents (overlap SES group, n= 48) to that in patients with single stents (single SES group, n= 144). With regard to baseline angiographic characteristics and procedural results, there were significant differences between the overlap SES group and the single SES group in lesion complexity, lesion length and reference diameter, minimal lumen diameter, and mean stent length. In-stent late lumen loss at the 7 -month follow-up did not differ significantly between the two groups (overlap SES 0. 25 ± 0. 61 mm vs. single SES 0. 10 ± 0. 55 mm, p= 0. 11). Furthermore, the site of overlap in the overlap SES group did not show greater late lumen loss compared to the <b>stented</b> <b>area</b> in the single SES group (0. 17 ± 0. 55 mm vs. 0. 10 ± 0. 55 mm, p= 0. 43). The overlap SES group tended to be associated with an increase in binary restenosis compared with the single SES group (22. 8 % vs. 12. 8 %, p= 0. 08), while this value was 4. 2 % at the site of overlap. There were no significant differences in death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, or stent thrombosis between the two groups. In addition, stent length was the most independent factor of late lumen loss in the overlap SES group by multivariate logistic analysis, whereas it was not an independent factor of late lumen loss of the SES overlap segment. ConclusionsThe site of overlap of overlapping SES dose not associate with greater late lumen loss or a higher in-stent binary restenosis rate compared to single SES implantation. The overlapping of SES by itself did not increase in-stent late lumen loss...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{assess the}} {{influence}} of stent application on in-stent hemodynamics under standardized conditions. MethodsOvine common carotid arteries before and after stent (6 × 40 mm, sinus-Carotid-RXt, combined open-closed cell design; Optimed, Ettlingen, Germany) application were used. Plastic tubes, 10 mm in length, simulating stenosis {{were placed in the}} middle of the applied stent to induce different degrees of stenosis (moderate 57. 8 % and severe 76. 4 %). Flow velocity and dynamic compliance were, respectively, measured with ultrasound and laser scan; proximal, in-stent, and distal to the stented arterial segment (1 cm proximal and distal) in a pulsatile ex vivo circulation system. ResultsStent insertion caused the in-stent peak systolic velocity to increase 22 % without stenosis, 31 % with moderate stenosis, and 23 % with severe stenosis. Stent insertion without stenosis caused no significant increase in in-stent end-diastolic velocity (EDV) but a 17 % increase with moderate stenosis. In severe stenosis, EDV was increased 56 % proximal to the stenosis. Compliance was reduced threefold {{in the middle of the}} stented arterial segment where flow velocity was significantly increased. ConclusionsWith or without stenosis, stent introduction caused the in-stent peak systolic velocity to become significantly elevated compared with a nonstented area. EDV was also increased by stent insertion in the case of moderate stenosis. The stent-induced compliance reduction may be causal for the increase in flow velocity since the stent-induced flow velocity elevation appeared in the <b>stented</b> <b>area</b> with low compliance. Because of altered hemodynamics caused by stent introduction when measured by duplex ultrasound, caution is prudent in concluding that carotid artery stenting is associated with a higher restenosis rate than carotid endarterectomy. Mistakenly upgrading moderate to severe restenosis could result in unnecessary reintervention. Clinical RelevanceClinical experience and prior studies support the supposition that restenosis after carotid artery stenting in carotid lesions displays erroneously elevated velocity when evaluated by duplex ultrasound (DUS), thus contributing to misleading interpretation of the degree of stenosis. This study, in contrast to studies of other groups, employs exactly the same conditions to measure flow with DUS in an unstented and then stented section of the carotid artery. Since DUS is the first-choice tool for carotid artery evaluation, knowledge about inexactness of the method is essential to avoid errors in treatment or follow-up decisions...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesIntravascular {{ultrasound}} (IVUS) {{was performed}} to investigate the impact of kissing balloon inflation (KBI) on the main vessel (MV) <b>stent</b> volume, <b>area,</b> and symmetry after side-branch (SB) dilation in patients with coronary bifurcation lesions (CBL). BackgroundIt remains controversial whether KBI would restore the MV <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> and symmetry loss after SB dilation. MethodsA total of 88 serial IVUS examinations of the MV were performed after MV angioplasty, MV stenting, SB dilation, and KBI in 22 patients with CBL. The MV stent was divided into proximal, bifurcation, and distal segments; the stent volume index (SVI), minimal <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> (MSA), <b>stent</b> symmetry index (SSI), and external elastic membrane (EEM) volume index were measured in 198 stent segments and compared after MV stenting, SB dilation, and KBI. ResultsIn the bifurcation segment, SVI, MSA, and SSI were significantly smaller after SB dilation than after MV stenting and KBI (SVI was 6. 10 ± 1. 50 mm 3 /mm vs. 6. 68 ± 1. 60 mm 3 /mm and 6. 57 ± 1. 60 mm 3 /mm, respectively, p < 0. 05; MSA was 5. 15 ± 1. 30 mm 2 vs. 6. 08 ± 1. 40 mm 2 and 5. 86 ± 1. 50 mm 2, respectively, p < 0. 05; and SSI was 0. 78 ± 0. 02 mm 2 vs. 0. 87 ± 0. 03 mm 2 and 0. 84 ± 0. 03 mm 2, respectively, p <  0. 05). KBI restored the MV SVI, MSA, and SSI after SB dilation. In the proximal segment, SVI, MSA, and EEM volume index were significantly larger, but SSI was smaller after KBI than after MV stenting and SB dilation. In the distal segment, neither SB dilation nor KBI {{had a significant impact}} on the MV stent volume or symmetry. ConclusionsThis is the first comprehensive volumetric IVUS analysis of CBL, to our knowledge, demonstrating that KBI restores the MV <b>stent</b> volume, <b>area,</b> and symmetry loss after SB dilation in the bifurcation segment, and induces asymmetric stent expansion in the proximal segment...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundArterial stenting across joints is not {{recommended}} because of increased risk of in-stent focal neointimal hyperplasia and compression or fracture of the stent by joint motion with decreased long-term patency. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the risk of placing stents in the venous system across the inguinal ligament. Materials and MethodsFrom 1997 to 2006, 177 limbs with chronic non-malignant obstructive lesions had stents placed in the iliofemoral venous outflow across the inguinal ligament into the common femoral vein. Transfemoral venograms and duplex ultrasound scans to assess cumulative patency rates, cumulative rates, site of in-stent restenosis (ISR), and structural integrity of the stents were performed during follow-up. The results were compared to the findings in 316 limbs with stents terminating cephalad to the inguinal ligament. ResultsOverall cumulative secondary patency (CSP) rate at 54 months was greater in the limbs with cephalad than in those caudad stent termination in relation to the inguinal ligament (95 % and 86 %, respectively; P =. 0001). Although CSP of limbs with non-thrombotic obstruction was 100 % regardless of the site of stent termination, that of the limbs stented for thrombotic obstruction was greater for stents terminating cephalad than for those caudad to the ligament (90 % and 84 %, respectively; P =. 0378). However, a comparison of CSP rates between limbs treated for thrombotic occlusion and those with thrombotic non-occlusive obstruction at 32 months revealed no difference whether or not the stent was placed across the inguinal ligament (occlusion 77 % and 77 %, P =. 7540, non-occlusive obstruction 96 % and 95 %, P =. 7437). Severe ISR (≥ 50 %) were rare, 5 %. The cumulative rate was, however, not significantly different in limbs stented cephalad and caudad to the inguinal ligament (7 % and 11 %, respectively, P =. 6393). Focal in-stent recurrent stenosis at the site of the inguinal ligament occurred in only 7 % of limbs (all < 50 %). None of the braided stainless steel stents were compressed or fractured. ConclusionContrary to arterial stenting, braided stainless stents can be safely placed in the venous system across the inguinal crease with no risk of stent fractures, narrowing due to external compression, focal development of severe in-stent restenosis, and no effect on long-term patency. The patency rate is not related to the length of <b>stented</b> <b>area</b> or the placement of the stent across the inguinal ligament, but is dependent upon the etiology and whether the treated postthrombotic obstruction is occlusive or non-occlusive...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In animal models, {{increased}} tissue receptor {{for advanced}} glycation end products and its ligands, including N-epsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), are critically implicated in postprocedural intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury. In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions with stenting, we investigated whether plasma levels of CML and the soluble form of receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) changed during poststenting follow-up. METHODS: We studied 81 patients with {{coronary artery disease}} who underwent successful percutaneous coronary interventions. Plasma levels of CML and sRAGE were measured before intervention, and at 1 day and 180 days of follow-up. RESULTS: CML levels increased significantly at day 1 after stenting and persisted at an elevated level at 180 days (P= 0. 013), whereas sRAGE levels increased significantly at 180 days (P= 0. 011). CML levels were significantly higher in multivessel-treated patients than in single-vessel-treated patients both at 1 day and 180 days of follow-up. In addition, CML values were positively associated with the extent of <b>stent</b> <b>area</b> at 1 day and 180 days of follow-up (r= 0. 278, P= 0. 022 and r= 0. 315, P= 0. 012, respectively).

CONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis that increased circulating levels of CML occurred {{in the presence of}} vascular injury. This persistent rise of CML could amplify an inflammatory phenomenon triggered by stent placement and thus contributes to coronary artery disease progression...|$|R
