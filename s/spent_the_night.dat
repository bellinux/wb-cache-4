5|$|By early afternoon, the strong-point {{guarding}} the D-1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy. But without enough {{force on the}} ground to mop up the remaining defenders, the exit could not be opened. Traffic was eventually able to use this route by nightfall, and the surviving tanks of the 743rd tank battalion <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> near Vierville.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 3–4 February, there were tanks {{on the street in}} Cairo as many of the protesters again <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> in Tahrir Square. Pro-government protesters were active and {{small-scale}} clashes happened in the early hours. Ahmad Mohamed Mahmoud of Al-Ta'awun became the first journalist to die covering the protests, from gunshot wounds sustained on 28January.|$|E
50|$|The family {{constructed}} {{by day and}} rehearsed on <b>the</b> stage at <b>night.</b> There {{was no place for}} the cast and crew to stay, so they <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> in sleeping bags and tents. The Larsens had to work quickly as they were scheduled to open their first show in August, two-and-a-half months after construction began.|$|R
50|$|President and Mrs. Grover Cleveland <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> first <b>night</b> {{of their}} honeymoon in Deer Park, June 3, 1886.|$|R

"Come all you young men, {{with your}} wicked ways; [...] Sow your wild, wild oats in your {{youthful}} days; [...] That we may live happy when we grow old-- [...] Happy, and happy, when we grow old: [...] The day is far <b>spent,</b> <b>the</b> <b>night's</b> coming on; [...] So {{give us your}} arm, and we'll joggle along--joggle [...] and joggle and joggle along." ...|$|R
5|$|Montcalm, wary of a British counterattack, and {{concerned}} about the fatigue of his troops {{after a long day}} of battle, had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines. The troops <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> alternating between sleeping and working on the defenses in anticipation of a renewed attack.|$|E
5|$|During the night, he {{was joined}} by his relatives, {{including}} Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists burst onto the Capitol and in a skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of Isis and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> in safety {{with one of his}} father's supporters, Cornelius Primus.|$|E
5|$|Financing of {{the airport}} at Gardermoen would be done through a state loan issued to a limited company owned by the Civil Airport Administration. This company would build and operate Gardermoen, but from 1 January 1997 it also took over {{operation}} of Fornebu. After the last aircraft took off from Fornebu on 7 October 1998, 300 people <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> transporting 500 truckloads of equipment from Fornebu to Gardermoen. The new airport opened {{on the morning of}} 8 October 1998.|$|E
60|$|The {{spectacle}} {{of a young}} man doing his duty and enduring considerable discomforts while doing it is painful; but there is such uplift in it, it affords so excellent a moral picture, that I cannot omit a short description of the manner in which Rupert Baxter had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> which had elapsed since his meeting with Ashe in the small hours in the hall.|$|R
60|$|Not {{far from}} here we {{caught a glimpse of}} the ruins of Niddrie Castle, where Mary <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> first <b>night</b> after her escape from Lochleven.|$|R
50|$|When Buddy {{ran away}} he went {{straight}} to 56 Croxley Street. In <b>the</b> book he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> first <b>night</b> in a bus shelter out in the countryside.|$|R
5|$|It {{was early}} {{afternoon}} {{by the time}} Ike and Tom had seen doctors for their head wounds. The day was chilly, with snow still {{on the ground in}} some places. Both Tom and Ike had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from head beatings, and at least Ike was still drunk.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 1909 two {{visitors}} were left stranded {{at the top}} of the tower as the final lift car of the night descended without them. The woman and twelve-year-old child were not noticed during the final round of inspection and so, without a way to communicate with anyone on the ground, they <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> on the tower until 10am the following morning. They did not appear too concerned by the ordeal and left without giving their names to officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{first night}} {{following}} the murder, Beauchamp {{stayed at the}} home of a relative in Bloomfield. The next day, he traveled to Bardstown, where he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> He lodged with his brother-in-law in Bowling Green on the night of November 9 before returning to his home in Glasgow on November 10. He and Anna had planned to flee to Missouri, but before nightfall, a posse had arrived from Frankfort to arrest him.|$|E
60|$|Dane {{smiled a}} trifle grimly. He had toiled for twelve hours daily under burning heat and then <b>spent</b> half <b>the</b> <b>night</b> poring over plans, not long ago.|$|R
50|$|Following {{clues that}} pointed toward Michoacán, they hiked the {{mountains}} {{by day and}} <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> in <b>the</b> Winnebago. Finally on January 2, 1975, they found a summit called Cerro Pelón where the trees and even the ground were covered with millions of resting butterflies. Trail was 25 at the time. On January 9 they called the Urquharts to report their find. In early 1976 the Urquharts themselves came to visit the site they had sought for decades.|$|R

5|$|By then, Farnese, unwilling {{of having}} {{for a longer}} time his troops close to Antwerp's cannons, made drums and {{trumpets}} to call for withdrawal and gathered his men at Borgerhout. Meanwhile, people from Antwerp sallied to carry the wounded French, British and Walloon officers and soldiers into the city to receive treatment. The Spanish soldiery, once the fire of Borgerhout was finished, looted the basements of the burned buildings and had a meal before praying to thank God. After that, the Spanish Army marched across the roads of Lier and Herentals to Turnhout, where Farnese wanted to arrive the next day. Fearing a new attack, Antwerp's civic guards <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> at their posts.|$|E
5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at Salamis. The Allied navy was thus able to prepare {{properly}} for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, why or how this decision was made, {{but it is clear that}} they did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|In London in 2012, college {{students}} Krish and Radha meet after Krish breaks {{up with his}} girlfriend, Meera (Neha Sharma), on his birthday. After a misunderstanding between Krish and Radha is cleared, they become friends and spend time {{getting to know each}} other. When Meera learns that Krish is with Radha, she angrily uploads embarrassing photos of him to Facebook that go viral. Radha learns that Krish <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> with her on his birthday only two hours after he broke up with Meera, but when she tries to talk to him, he is too busy retaliating against Meera. Frustrated and heartbroken, Radha leaves.|$|E
5000|$|The {{really great}} {{occasion}} was Domhnach Chrom Dubh {{and the people}} of Clare and of Aran <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>night</b> at <b>the</b> well. This caused some surprise to a Clare reporter: ...|$|R
60|$|Religion soon {{tempered}} the ruder {{pleasures of}} the backwoods, but the dancing ceased before the drinking. Camp meetings were frolics of a soberer sort, where whole neighborhoods gathered and dwelt in tents for days in the beautiful autumn weather, and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> in prayer and song. Little log churches were built at the crossroads, and these served the purpose of schoolhouses on week days. But there was more religion than learning in the backwoods, and the preacher came before the teacher.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Christians <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>night</b> {{in prayer}} in the {{converted}} temple. As {{a result of this}} action, the local authorities had 300 Christians, including Mamertin and Mamertin's son, burned to death.|$|R
5|$|It {{was only}} by nightfall, when John the Armenian with his {{men and the}} 600 Huns rejoined his army, that Belisarius {{realized}} {{the extent of his}} victory. The cavalry <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> at the battlefield. In the next morning, as the infantry (and Antonina) caught up, the whole army made for Carthage, where it arrived as night was falling. The Carthaginians had thrown open the gates and illuminated the city in celebration, but Belisarius, fearing a possible ambush in the darkness and wishing to keep his soldiers under tight control, refrained from entering the city, and encamped before it.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus and {{the three}} prisoners in his group posing as Lithuanians– Tim Walenn, Henri Picard and Gordon Brettell– managed to reach a train heading towards Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland). Most likely, they {{intended}} to travel to East Prussia, cross the Lithuanian border, and somehow cross the Baltic Sea to neutral Sweden. However, officials at the Stalag had discovered the escape and began manhunts. Marcinkus and his group travelled further {{than most of the}} escapees, but were captured by the Gestapo near Schneidemühl on 26 March. Marcinkus and his associates were brought to Stalag XXB and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> there. On the following day they were handed over to the Danzig Gestapo.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on Hill 677 the Canadians had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of 23/24 April {{in their}} pits {{listening}} {{to the sounds of}} the fighting on the Australian front. However, by early morning Chinese activity increased and, with the situation deteriorating on the Patricia's right flank, Stone withdrew B Company from their position forward of the feature's summit to strengthen this flank if the Australians were forced to withdraw. Under the command of Major Vince Lilley the company subsequently moved to occupy positions east of Battalion Headquarters on the high ground overlooking the valley road.|$|E
50|$|Knight invited {{students}} {{into his home}} and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>night</b> negotiating <b>the</b> terms of their demands. Knight faced criticism from the Board of Trustees over his “permissiveness,” but weathered the storm.|$|R
5000|$|... “I have <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>night</b> {{standing}} here {{listening to your}} melodious kirtans. Still I feel like listening to more.” Premanand Swami was deeply moved to hear Maharaj paying compliments to him.|$|R
50|$|As soon as {{the fire}} was declared, they AP-7 and N-II were closed to traffic along with several county roads and the AVE line to la Jonquera. Due to the fire, the {{electricity}} company, Endesa estimated that more than 3,000 people in 21 towns remained without power. The authorities required a curfew for {{the entire population of}} Alt Empordà from the afternoon of 22nd which was slowly revoked in later days. Some 1,300 people <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> of 22nd and 23rd in emergency shelters in the region.|$|R
5|$|Rumours {{began to}} {{circulate}} among the Hopleys' servants, suggesting that Hopley's wife had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> {{prior to the}} body's discovery cleaning up evidence of her husband's murder of the boy. Reginald's older brother, Reverend John Henry Cancellor, Jr. (1834–1900), arrived in Eastbourne from Send, Surrey, on 25April. He noticed discrepancies in the reports of his brother's death and requested an autopsy. Hopley asked prominent physician Sir Charles Locock, an acquaintance of the Cancellor family and an obstetrician to the Queen, to examine the body and verify death by natural causes; Locock believed that Hopley {{was responsible for the}} death.|$|E
5|$|Shooting of {{the film}} began on May 13, 1957, with the newly created choreography. Presley's {{characteristic}} hairstyle and sideburns were covered with a wig and makeup for the scenes in musical number and those set in the jail. During the performance, one of Presley's dental caps fell out and became lodged in his lung. He {{was taken to the}} Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, where he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> after the cap was removed. Shooting was resumed the next day. Throughout the film, Presley mimed the songs, which had been previously recorded in the studio and were added to the finished scenes.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} record the band staged an eventful world tour. While touring in Barcelona in 2000, Oasis {{were forced to}} cancel a gig when an attack of {{tendinitis}} caused Alan White's arm to seize up, and the band <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> drinking instead. After a row between the two brothers, Noel declared he was quitting touring overseas altogether, and Oasis were supposed to finish the tour without him. Noel eventually returned for the Irish and British legs of the tour, which included two major shows at Wembley Stadium. A live album of the first show, called Familiar to Millions, was released in late 2000 to mixed reviews.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had gone}} supperless to bed, and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> long <b>night</b> asking, 'What shall I do?' and, {{receiving}} no reply but {{that which is}} so hard for eager youth to accept, 'Wait and trust.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{death of}} one of his close friends (aged 16) in a car {{accident}} made Richard think seriously about the meaning of life. At the same time, following the example of some of his peers, Richard plunged into the hippie counterculture. Keen to understand the deeper meaning of life, he grew long hair and started smoking marijuana. In the summer of 1968, a sense of adventure led Richard to make a hitchhiking journey to California. There, he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> on <b>the</b> beaches and visited the then hippie mecca - Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco.|$|R
