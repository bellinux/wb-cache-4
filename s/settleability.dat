40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comprehensive study of}} sludge floc characteristics {{and their impact on}} compressibility and <b>settleability</b> of activated sludge in full scale wastewater treatment processes. The sludge flocs were characterised by morphological (floc size distribution, fractal dimension, filament index), physical (flocculating ability, viscosity, hydrophobicity and surface charge) and chemical (polymeric constituents and metal content) parameters. Compressibility and <b>settleability</b> were defined in terms of the sludge volume index (SVI) and zone settling velocity (ZSV). The floc morphological and physical properties had important influence on the sludge compressibility and <b>settleability.</b> Sludges containing large flocs and high quantities of filaments, corresponding to lower values of fractal dimension (D-f), demonstrated poor compressibility and <b>settleability.</b> Sludge flocs with high flocculating ability had lower SVI and higher ZSV, whereas high values of hydrophobicity, negative surface charge and viscosity of the sludge flocs correlated to high SVI and low ZSV. The quantity of the polymeric compounds protein. humic substances and carbohydrate in the sludge and the extracted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) had significant positive correlations with SVI. The ZSV was quantitatively independent of the polymeric constituents. High concentrations of the extracted EPS were related to poor compressibility and <b>settleability.</b> The cationic ions Ca, Mg, Al and Fe in the sludge improved significantly the sludge compressibility and <b>settleability.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{activated}} sludge wastewater treatment {{process is the}} most common technology used today and solids separation is a critical and often problematic component of this technology. This leads to requirements for larger clarifiers, increased pumping costs of the diluted settled solids stream, and increased costs for solids treatment. For the past thirty years, the majority of the research in secondary settling problems has focused on the role of filamentous bacteria, and also factors such as floc size and shape. The effects of variable biomass density on <b>settleability</b> of biosolids produced in full scale {{activated sludge}} wastewater treatment systems has been recently been demonstrated, and seasonal variability in biomass <b>settleability</b> is known to occur at many wastewater treatment plants. The role of density in such temporal variations has not been previously studied. Research evaluating temporal variation in biomass density and filamentous bacteria content and the roles these parameters play in solids separation was performed. Three different filamentous bacteria quantification methods were employed and comparison of these methods was evaluated. Additionally, the effects of metal coagulant addition for phosphorus removal on biomass density and <b>settleability</b> were evaluated. The objectives of this research were to (1) evaluate whether biomass density varies on a seasonal basis in full scale wastewater treatment systems, and if this contributes to seasonal variations in <b>settleability,</b> (2) evaluate if biomass density varies on a shorter timescale (weekly), and whether this is correlated with changes in <b>settleability,</b> (3) compare various methods of filamentous bacteria quantification, (4) investigate how precipitant addition effects biomass density and <b>settleability.</b> Seasonal variation in biomass density was observed in four activated sludge plants, with high density occurring during warm weather and low density occurring during cold weather. Biomass density and filament content were both determined to influence <b>settleability,</b> and non-volatile solids content was strongly correlated with biomass density. Weekly variations in biomass density were not observed in selector equipped wastewater plants under stable operating conditions; however, significant variation in biomass density, <b>settleability,</b> and polyphosphate content were observed during process start-up and process upset events at a single full scale wastewater plant designed to perform nitrification, denitrification, and enhanced biological phosphorus removal. Methods of quantifying filament content based on microscopic imaging were compared, including the Filament Index ranking, automated image analysis, and manual tracing methods. The filament length/floc area ratio determined by automated and manual methods is a measure that is reliant only on information in microscope images. Filament length/dry solids were determined using a hemacytometer slide and manual tracing, which allows quantification of filaments within a known volume. The relationships between these three methods of measurements were determined, which may aid in comparisons of filament content presented in other studies, both past and future. Precipitant addition using aluminum and iron salts was positively correlated with biomass density; however, counter to the study hypothesis, <b>settleability</b> degraded rather than improved. This result {{may be due to the}} development of large precipitate structures that, although of relatively high density, inhibited compaction of the biomass.

40|$|High biomass {{productivity}} and efficient harvesting are currently recognised challenges in microbial biofuel applications that were addressed by this research using ecological engineering principles and an integrated systems approach. Microbial (microalgal-bacterial) biomass was grown in laboratory reactors using municipal wastewaters from the Christchurch Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWTP) in New Zealand. Reactors were inoculated with native microbes, fed with {{primary and secondary}} treated wastewaters, and subjected to various hydraulic and solids retention times (i. e., 1. 4 - to 9 -d HRT and 4 - to 80 -d SRT, respectively) under cold, warm, and ambient climate conditions. Biomass <b>settleability</b> and productivity (i. e., settleable productivity) were sequentially improved {{over the course of}} experiments to optimise settleable productivity at 21 g/m 2 /d on average using primary treated wastewater, 2 -d HRT, 12 -d SRT, and warm climatic conditions. Secondary treated wastewater was a poor substrate most likely because of low C, elevated pH, and supersaturated oxygen levels limiting growth. Biomass recycling generally improved settleable productivity of primary treated wastewater cultures since productivity increased at short HRT and <b>settleability</b> increased at longer SRT. No overriding trends were found relating productivity or <b>settleability</b> to biomass ecology or biochemistry. Growth rate modelling of warm climate cultures indicated that heterotrophy was mostly C limited at long (≥ 4 -d) HRT and DO limited at short (≤ 2 -d) HRT of primary treated wastewater while photoautotrophy was probably always light limited. Nevertheless, almost 50 % greater C fixation was achieved using these systems compared to conventional activated sludge systems. Cold climate cultures, with up to 66 % less biomass than warm climate cultures, were limited by lower light and/or temperature (i. e., 13 °C mean water temperature with 410 μmol/m 2 /s photosynthetically active radiation [PAR] for 9. 6 h/d vs. 21 °C mean water temperature with 925 μmol/m 2 /s PAR for 14. 7 h/d). Biomass <b>settleability</b> was facilitated by microbial aggregation into stable, compact flocs over time and also by bioflocculation during 1 -h sedimentation periods. These mechanisms were largely influenced by wastewater loading and microbial growth rate, but also to a lesser extent by monitoring methods (i. e., light, duration, and sedimentation container). <b>Settleability</b> of primary treated wastewater cultures was mainly greater than 70 % and more consistent when operated at longer SRT and shorter HRT compared to only 22 % on average for secondary treated wastewater cultures. Symbiotic growth of native microalgae and bacteria promoted efficient O 2 /CO 2 exchange to improve {{productivity and}} enhanced natural floc formation to improve <b>settleability</b> while requiring low energy inputs and providing some wastewater treatment. These capabilities greatly increased the biomass’ sustainability for biofuel production compared to other feedstocks. This research demonstrated the value of biomass recycling to concurrently achieve greatest productivity and <b>settleability</b> to maximise harvestable yield since the overall growth rate of more total biomass was reduced at longer SRT which thereby facilitated excellent floc formation and sedimentation at shorter HRT. The resulting biomass was best suited for biofuel conversion pathways such as anaerobic digestion or thermochemical liquefaction. Potential other uses included animal feed and fertiliser since biomass was harvested without additional chemicals...|$|E
40|$|This {{preliminary}} research examined microbial biomass {{growth in}} sequence batch reactors fed primary treated wastewater from Christchurch Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWTP), New Zealand. Reactors were inoculated with indigenous microalgae (and bacteria) from oxidation ponds at CWTP. Microalgal-bacterial flocs {{were developed by}} systematically discarding the non-settleable material (supernatant) and retaining settleable solids within the reactors. Treated ammonia concentrations averaged 5. 5 mg/L (as N) with a 9 -day hydraulic retention time, representing a reduction of feed water concentrations by 46 - 100 %. This ability is of significance to municipal wastewater treatment plants who struggle to remove ammonia. Activated sludge was then added to improve biomass <b>settleability,</b> but resulting anaerobic conditions caused a loss of aerobic bacterial activity. Bacterial community analysis using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing confirmed the dominance of anaerobic genera within the settleable biomass. Highly reducing conditions within the reactors inhibited nitrification, the pH (i. e., typically < 8. 0) prevented N 2 volatilisation, and some ammonification occurred, so ammonia levels decreased slowly. Activated sludge addition also caused a decrease in microalgae growth and diversity possibly due to ammonia toxicity, higher organic loading, and/or shading by excess bacteria hindering photosynthesis. Despite these effects, <b>settleability</b> improved with activated sludge addition.

Results showed that the SRF and SVI values decreased by 86. 0 % and 80. 0 %, respectively after photocatalysis treatment for 18 h. The changes of LB-EPS/TB-EPS and morphology of WAS indicated that WAS was degraded in a stepwise and mild manner, in which the sludge pellets were possibly converted into TB-EPS and then LB-EPS.

This improvement was linked to the progressive disappearance of bacterial filaments as shown by rheological measurements (appearance of a hysteresis phenomenon) and image analysis (reduction in the number of filaments).

40|$|Abstract Aerobic {{granular}} sludge (AGS) {{technology has}} been extensively studied recently to improve sludge settling and behaviour in activated sludge systems. The main advantage is that aerobic granular sludge (AGS) can settle very fast in a reactor or clarifier because AGS is compact and has strong structure. It also has good <b>settleability</b> and a high capacity for biomass retention. Several experimental works have been conducted in this study to observe the settling behaviours of AGS. The study thus has two aims: (1) to compare the settling profile of AGS with other sludge flocs and (2) to observe the influence of mechanical mixing and design of the reactor to the <b>settleability</b> of AGS. The first experimental outcome shows that AGS settles after less than 5 min in a depth of 0. 4 m compared to other sludge flocs (from sequencing batch reactor, conventional activated sludge and extended aeration) which takes more than 30 min. This study also shows that the turbulence from the mixing mechanism and shear in the reactor provides an insignificant effect on the AGS settling velocity.

40|$|Cet article présente les résultats d'une étude menée sur le {{traitement}} d'effluents fortement chargés (DCO > 1, 5 kg. m- 3) par un procédé à boues activées. L'objectif principal de ce travail est de montrer qu'une alimentation séquentielle d'un réacteur parfaitement agité avec maintien permanent du recyclage des boues et de l'oxygénation permet d'obtenir une bonne épuration tant du point de vue de l'élimination de la pollution carbonée que de la maîtrise de la décantabilité des flocs microbiens. Les essais sont menés sur un pilote de laboratoire constitué d'une colonne à bulles et d'un décanteur, alimenté avec un substrat synthétique. Contrairement à une alimentation continue, {{la mise en place}} de cycles d'alimentation permet d'obtenir des flocs de bonne décantabilité de manière constante dans le temps. Ainsi une concentration élevée en biomasse peut être maintenue dans le réacteur. De plus, le suivi d'un cycle 1 h/ 1 h confirme que la mise en œuvre d'un cycle court n'entraîne pas de variations importantes des performances d'épuration. Par ailleurs, le suivi d'un long cycle (24 h/ 24 h) montre des variations significatives des concentrations en DCO, polysaccharides dans la phase liquide et exopolysaccharides dans les flocs microbiens. Ceci semble indiquer que des produits microbiens sont relargués des flocs vers la phase liquide pendant l'arrêt de l'alimentation et que des exopolysaccharides sont produits dans les flocs pendant l'alimentation. The {{overall efficiency}} of an activated sludge {{wastewater treatment system}} depends both on the ability of the activated sludge culture to remove the soluble organic pollution and on the efficiency of the separation of the treated water from the biomass. In the treatment of a high-strength wastewater (COD > 1. 5 kg. m- 3), ultrafiltration or crossflow filtration systems can sometimes substitute for the final clarifier, the separation of the sludge from the effluent water being very good regardless of changes in sludge <b>settleability.</b> Because of the high pollutant concentrations, the biomass must be more concentrated in the bioreactor than in the usual aerobic processes (10 to 20 kg. m- 3 rather than 4 kg. m- 3), whatever the separation system (settler or filtration system). Thus, with this biomass concentration, the volumetric loading rate can be increased while the organic loading rate is maintained at a low level. The use of a clarifier is preferable because it is cheaper than ultrafiltration or crossflow filtration systems, which have very high investment and operation costs, on the other hand, and some fouling problems, on the other hand. However, its use requires a very good biomass <b>settleability.</b> Results from the literature show that there is no general relation between sludge <b>settleability</b> and such wastewater treatment operating parameters as dissolved oxygen concentration in the aeration basin, organic loading rates, pH, or low relative influent nitrogen and phosphorus contents. On the other hand, the separation ability of the clarifier depends on the hydraulic configuration of the aerated reactor: biomass <b>settleability</b> can be controlled by completely stirred reactors in series, plug-flow reactors or intermittently-fed systems. Indeed, this spatial or temporal staggering should allow microorganisms to consume their accumulated substrate and thus restore their accumulation capacity. In the case of high-strength wastewater treatment, temporal staggering is better than spatial staggering. Indeed, higher organic loading rates require a higher number of reactors. Thus, the COD concentration significantly increases in the first reactors of the cascade and some toxic or inhibitory problems could appear. For this reason, a temporal staggering was chosen. Biomass <b>settleability</b> is linked to the extracellular polymers that are the third component of the sludge flocs, after the cells and the water. These polymers are composed largely of microbial exopolysaccharides. Measurements of exopolysaccharides could be used to characterize sludge <b>settleability.</b> A too low level of exopolysaccharides indicates a sludge defloculation problem, whereas a too high level of exopolysaccharides means that sludge <b>settleability</b> could be hindered because of an excessive growth of filamentous organisms. The purpose of the present work is to show that the use of only one completely stirred reactor, fed in a cyclic way with permanent oxygenation and return sludge flow, leads to good sludge <b>settleability</b> and effluent quality. The experiments have been performed with a laboratory pilot-plant composed of a 11. 3 litre bubble column, which is a completely stirred reactor, and a secondary settling tank of 14. 8 litres. The reactor is fed with an equilibrated synthetic substrate consisting mainly of meat extract, saccharose and ethanol (COD:N:P= 100 : 5 : 1 and 1 kg COD= 1 kg meat extract + 0. 444 kg saccharose + 0. 2 kg ethanol). The feeding cycle is a set of consecutive periods of feeding and starvation. For example, during a 1 h/ 2 h feeding cycle, the substrate feeding is continuous during 1 hour and stopped during 2 hours. The sludge comes from the Nancy-Maxéville wastewater treatment plant and its acclimation to the synthetic substrate begins with an aeration without feeding during 12 hours. Afterwards, the experimental system is fed during 1 hour every 2 hours with the substrate (first concentration of COD= 0. 1 kg. m- 3). Then, the inlet COD is increased by steps of 0. 1 kg. m- 3 every day until the required concentration is reached. Once the biomass is acclimated to the influent and sufficiently concentrated, the experiment can begin. In order to show the positive influence of cyclic feeding on wastewater treatment quality, we have carried out one experiment with continuous feeding and two experiments with cyclic feeding (see Table 1). For these experiments, the volumetric loading rate is about 4 kg COD. m- 3. d- 1. With an appropriate feeding cycle, the <b>settleability</b> of the sludge and the effluent quality remain good: the diluted sludge volume index is 56 cm 3. g- 1 and 96 % of the inlet COD is removed. Thus, the biomass concentration remains high in the reactor (19 kg. m- 3). This is not the case with a continuous feeding where the biomass <b>settleability</b> rapidly deteriorates. The principal advantage of sequential feeding is the maintenance of good sludge <b>settleability</b> and a high biomass concentration in the aeration basin. Moreover, during the short feeding cycles, the variations of the concentrations of COD, polysaccharides in the bulk phase and extracellular polysaccharides in the microbial aggregates are very low. This augurs well for system stability. In contrast, monitoring of a long cycle (24 h of feeding and 24 h of starvation) shows great variations in the concentrations of COD, polysaccharides and extracellular polysaccharides in the system. When the feeding is stopped, the COD and polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk phase increase whereas the exopolysaccharide concentration in sludge flocs decreases. Reciprocally, after the feeding is begun, the COD and polysaccharide concentrations in the bulk phase decrease, and then remain constant, whereas the exopolysaccharide concentration increases. As 1 kg of measured polysaccharides represents 0. 9 kg COD, and as in the bulk phase the COD concentration is equivalent to 4 times the polysaccharide concentration, it seems that microbial products other than polysaccharides are released in the bulk phase during starvation, these products being slowly biodegradable. Extracellular polysaccharides in the microbial aggregates are formed during the feeding phase...|$|E

To explore the effect of DO control strategies on the <b>settleability</b> of activated sludge, different DO control strategies were carried out in a step-feed anoxic/oxic reactor treating domestic wastewater. The result shows that low DO concentration is not the single reason to filamentous bulking. To achieve long-term system stabilization and avoid serious filamentous bulking, feedforward-feedback DO control strategy may be a feasible and good choice...|$|E

Filamentous bulking, {{which causes}} {{deterioration}} in sludge <b>settleability</b> has been shown, in two nation-wide surveys to {{be a problem}} of considerable proportions. Poor sludge <b>settleability</b> in the secondary clarifier limits the daily flow and load that can be treated in activated sludge wastewater treatment plants. Controlling sludge <b>settleability</b> to relatively low levels i. e. Diluted Sludge Volume Index (DSVI < 100 rnl/g) by controlling filamentous organism proliferation would allow increased daily flow and loads by up to 100 on existing activated sludge wastewater treatment plants. From the two surveys, Blackbeard et al. (1986, 1988) found that mainly six filamentous organisms tended to dominate in activated sludges in N and N&P removal plants i. e. types 0092, 0041, 0675, 1851, 0914 and Microthrix parvicella. Four of these six filaments are classified by Jenkins et al (1984) as low Food/Micro-organism (low F/M) filaments. At the University of Cape Town and in a 4 year research programme (1986 to 1989) Gabb et al (1989 a) investigated specific methods to control low F /M filament proliferation. Traditionally the promoted specific bulking control method was inclusion of either an anoxic or aerobic selector {{at the head of the}} wastewater treatment plant. Gabb et al (1989 a) found that selectors did not control low F/M filament proliferation but that continuous aeration did. They concluded that the presence of anoxic and aerobic zones in a treatment plant was an important factor in low F/M filament proliferation. In 1989 a second research programme was initiated at the University of Cape Town to identify the factors that influence low F/M filament proliferation. Completed research thus far has established inter alia that fully anoxic and fully aerobic conditions successfully control low F/M filament proliferation but that alternating anoxic-aerobic conditions in single reactor intermittent aeration systems promoted proliferation. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the interchange between anoxic and aerobic conditions in nitrogen removal systems and its effect on low F/M filament proliferation...|$|E

40|$|Aerobic {{granules}} can be {{used for}} the treatment of industrial or municipal wastewater, but high aeration rate is required for the stable operation of the granular sludge system. Therefore, the aim of this research was to reduce aeration rate greatly to decrease the energy consumption for the technology of aerobic granules. Based on the characteristics of sequencing batch reactor with distinct feast and famine periods, aeration rate was reduced from 1. 66 to 0. 55 cm s? 1 in the famine period after granules were formed. It was found that the <b>settleability</b> of aerobic granules in reactor R 1 with reduced aeration was {{the same as that of}} aerobic granules in reactor R 2 with constant aeration rate of 1. 66 cm s? 1. However, the outer morphology of aerobic granules gradually changed from round shape to long shape, and minor population showed certain shift after aeration rate was reduced in the famine period. Since good <b>settleability</b> is the most essential feature of aerobic granules, it can be said that reducing aeration rate in famine period did not influence the stable operation of aerobic granular sludge system. Furthermore, the experimental results indicated that aeration rate in feast period was much more important to the stable operation of aerobic granules than that in famine period...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a new and}} {{innovative}} technique, glow discharge plasma, is introduced {{for the treatment of}} activated sludge, whereby its effect on sludge solubilization, <b>settleability,</b> floc structure and biomass activity for carbon removal and nitrification is investigated. The obtained results are compared to the use of ultrasound for activated sludge treatment, a technique known for its potential to enhancing biomass activity. Results indicate that ultrasound is up to 9 times more efficient in solubilizing activated sludge and disrupting the sludge floc. However, ultrasound has a detrimental effect on sludge settling, even the lowest treatment intensity of 180 kJ/kgMLSS induced a 12 % increase in sludge volume index (SVI). Glow discharge plasma on the other hand, improved <b>settleability</b> up to 51 %. Glow discharge plasma and ultrasound both positively affect the carbon removal rate. On the long term, extreme conditions even gave rise to a maximum improvement in respiration by 58. 6 % and 176. 5 % for a glow discharge plasma and ultrasound treatment. Nitrification, however, was never positively influenced by either of the treatments. Starting from 8297 kJ/kgMLSS for glow discharge plasma and 9000 kJ/kgMLSS for ultrasound, a negative effect on the nitrification rate was found. status: publishe...|$|E

In various {{attempts}} at producing metal sulphide particles from synthetic solutions, prodigious quantities of nuclei which grow only to colloidal dimensions have been frequently reported.
