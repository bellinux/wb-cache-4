25|$|The British Maritime and Coastguard Agency had {{the last}} known radio contact with the vessel as it was passing through the Strait of Dover on July 28. Nothing {{extraordinary}} was detected during the communication, though authorities believe that the crew was coerced not to raise an alarm by the hijackers. The ship continued to <b>send</b> Automatic <b>Identification</b> System <b>signals</b> until July 30. A press-secretary of the Swedish Police Authority confirmed {{that one of its}} investigators had a phone contact with a crew member on July 31, but refused to disclose its nature. No communication occurred after that; the ship failed to come to Béjaïa on its scheduled arrival date, August 5. Coastal tracking radar last picked up the ship's signal near Brest, France; it was later reported being observed by a patrol aircraft near the Portuguese coast. The vessel was never seen passing through the Strait of Gibraltar. A hijack alert was issued by Interpol on August 3.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the previously mentioned navigational signals, the localizer provides for ILS facility identification by periodically transmitting a 1,020 Hz Morse code <b>identification</b> <b>signal.</b> For example, the ILS for runway 4R at John F.

40|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>identification</b> is an {{umbrella}} term for signal processing techniques {{designed for the}} identification of the transmission parameters of unknown or partially known communication signals. Initially a key technology for military applications such as signal interception, radio surveillance and electronic warfare, <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> techniques recently found applications in commercial wireless communications as an enabling technology for cognitive receivers. With the advance and rapid adoption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems in the last decade, extension of <b>signal</b> <b>identification</b> methods to include this transmission paradigm has become a priority and focus of intensive research efforts.

40|$|The {{testing and}} {{implementation}} of traffic signal performance measures at a local government agency revolves around three main performance measures: <b>signal</b> detector anomaly <b>identification,</b> <b>signal</b> split failures reports and red light running <b>identification.</b> <b>Signal</b> detector anomaly <b>identification</b> used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare current and past detector operation and was shown {{to be effective in}} identification of anomalies. Three different types of split failure reports were utilized to determine operational issues on signal systems. Long-term longitudinal, corridor scale, and single intersection split failure reports were implemented on active signal systems and found to be effective in determining and correcting problems. A statistical analysis using the logit model found there was a correlation between split failures on an intersection phase and vehicle crashes. A red light running index algorithm and report was described, including strategies to use the report to improve safety through signal system changes. Case studies of these performance measures being used effectively on signal systems in Elkhart County and the City of Mishawaka, both in Indiana, are presented as a guide to practitioners. Implementation strategies for local government agencies are described, including: {{the pros and cons of}} local funding and federal-aid funding, identification of funding sources and sample funding applications.

40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) {{is now in}} operation, {{and many}} {{improvements}} to its performance are being sought. One such improvement is Differential GPS (DGPS), where known errors in the GPS broadcast are identified and the corrections broadcast to the end user [12]. One implementation of DGPS being considered {{is the use of}} coastal marine radio direction finding (RDF) radiobeacons in the 285 - 325 kHz band as transmitters for the DGPS broadcast. The normal RDF beacon signal consists of a continuous carrier on a one kilohertz boundary plus a Morse-code <b>identification</b> <b>signal</b> 1025 Hz above the carrier. In the DGPS/radiobeacon implementation proposed for the US coastal regions, the the differential data link signal uses minimum shift keying (MSK) at a data rate of 25, 60, 100, 200, or 400 baud (the exact baud rate has not yet been decided). This MSK signal is centered between the RDF beacon carrier and <b>identification</b> <b>signal.</b> At the frequencies that these radiobeacons are operated, the prevailing atmospheric noise is both non-Gaussian and very strong. This noise characteristic makes the design of a long-range data link difficult. One solution that has been proposed is the use of forward error correction (FEC) coding of the data. The performance of FEC decoders can be improved by the use of a soft decision receiver, which delivers both bit decisions and information about the validity of the bit decisions [15]...|$|R
