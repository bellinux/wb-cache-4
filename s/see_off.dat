5|$|Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at {{the start}} of the second innings, {{bringing}} his tormentor Edrich to the crease. Lindwall did not bounce Edrich, but Miller did, earning the ire of the crowd. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes. This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook. Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six, but was immediately run out by Morris with a direct hit. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped <b>see</b> <b>off</b> the new ball, as England reached 174/3 at the close, with Washbrook unbeaten on 85.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January 1952, despite {{advice from}} {{those close to}} him, the King went to London Airport to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> Princess Elizabeth, who was going on her tour of Australia via Kenya. On the morning of 6 February, George VI {{was found dead in}} bed at Sandringham House in Norfolk. He had died from a {{coronary}} thrombosis in his sleep at the age of 56. His daughter flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
5|$|Spain's first {{match of}} UEFA Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} was against Liechtenstein on 3 September 2010, Villa scored the second {{goal of the}} match which eventually ended 4–0. It was believed that this goal meant that he had equalled Raúl's record 44-goal tally, however after many debates about whether he or Dariusz Dudka scored the first goal in Spain's 6–0 win over Poland, FIFA eventually decided that the goal was indeed an own goal by Dudka, meaning Villa's goal tally would remain at 43. On 12 October 2010, he finally equalled Raúl's record, scoring a penalty against Scotland and helping Spain <b>see</b> <b>off</b> the Scots in a 3–2 victory at Hampden Park.|$|E

5|$|After Zaragoza's {{triumph in}} the Copa del Rey, they were granted {{a place in}} the 2004–05 UEFA Cup; this was Villa's first time playing in a European competition. In the team's opening group game, against Utrecht, Villa netted a brace in the dying minutes of the game, which ended 2–0 in Zaragoza's favour. In the round of 16, Zaragoza faced Austria Wien. The first leg ended 1–1, while Villa scored in the second leg in an {{eventual}} 2–2 draw; Austria Wien progressed on the away goals rule. Meanwhile, in La Liga, Villa excited Zaragoza fans on 23 September 2004 by putting the team 1–0 up against Barcelona at the Camp Nou, although Barcelona came back to win the game 4–1. On 17 April 2005, Villa scored a brace which helped <b>see</b> <b>off</b> Sevilla in a 3–0 victory.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the fourth day, England set about extending their lead. Early in the innings, the capacity crowd encroached substantially onto the ground and the umpires spent eight minutes trying to force them back {{to the edge of the}} official playing area, but they again spilled over. Initially, Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> the new ball before trying to lift the run rate. Lindwall's first two overs were maidens, but Hutton and Washbrook scored 21 runs from his next five overs, while taking only five from Miller's six overs. The English batsmen attacked the bowling and reinforced their aggressive strokeplay with quick running. England reached lunch at 72/0 with Hutton on 40 and Washbrook on 28. Washbrook was particularly confident and Bradman decided to not risk Johnson in the morning session.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at {{the start}} of the second innings, {{bringing}} his tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing that it would be interpreted as retaliation and lead to a negative media and crowd reaction. However, Miller did retaliate with a series of bouncers, earning the ire of the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and order him to stop. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes. This was aided by the Australian fielders, who twice dropped Washbrook at long leg and once in the slips cordon. Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six, but was immediately run out by Morris, who threw down the stumps from cover. Toshack removed Compton for a duck, leaving England at 125/3. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped <b>see</b> <b>off</b> the new ball, as England reached 174 at the close without further loss, with Washbrook unbeaten on 85.|$|E

5|$|Toshack then removed Compton for a duck, {{caught in}} the slips by Miller, leaving England three wickets down with the score still on 125. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped <b>see</b> <b>off</b> the new ball, {{stopping}} Australia's fightback as England reached 174 by the close without further loss. Washbrook was unbeaten on 85 and Crapp 19. England were 316 runs in front with two days of play remaining and seven wickets in hand. Their position was aided by the Australian fielders, who dropped Washbrook twice more. The Lancastrian was on 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by Hassett. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman to signify his need for protection from the ball, much to the amusement of the crowd. After adding two more runs, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack. At {{the end of the}} day's play, Washbrook purchased a drink for Hassett in gratitude for the dropped catches.|$|E
25|$|The 2015 season saw Kilkenny claim {{both the}} Leinster and All-Ireland title once again. Kilkenny {{pulled off a}} fantastic second half {{performance}} in the All-Ireland Final to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> Galway. It was Kilkenny's 36th All-Ireland win and the 11th under manager Brian Cody. The achievement was even more significant following a number of high-profile retirements {{at the end of}} the previous season.|$|E

25|$|Early 626, the Tujue {{attacked}} {{the frontier of}} the Tang empire. At Li Jiancheng's recommendation, Li Yuanji was commissioned for a military campaign against these hostile forces, thus Li Shimin's best generals and crack troops were transferred to Li Yuanji. Thereafter, Li Shimin received word from his men that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji had taken preparations to assassinate him when he would <b>see</b> <b>off</b> Li Yuanji as was the custom during the onset of a military campaign.|$|E
25|$|A {{new year}} and a new competition, and Leicestershire picked up their best form to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> Lancashire, before losing to Durham. Next up were Yorkshire and in a high scoring encounter, with both sides {{notching}} up over 200, the Foxes won by 10 runs, with Darren Maddy battering 111 off just 60 balls, smashing eight 4s and six 6s. Nixon had hit 3, 0 and 9 in these first three matches, but made up for this in the next game against Nottinghamshire with a crucial 23, including a 4 and a 6 to see his side to a 40 run win.|$|E
25|$|The {{second test}} was the Boxing Day Test played at Melbourne. Australia won the toss and chose to bat. The first two wickets fell quickly and Australia were 2–28, but Michael Slater and Mark Waugh took them past 120, before Waugh fell. The {{rest of the}} Australian middle order also contributed, notably Ponting and Gilchrist, and Australia reached 405. The Indian openers failed to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> even the first ten overs and India were 2–11. The rest of the batting {{followed}} suit, only Sachin Tendulkar standing amongst the ruins as India were dismissed for 238. Sachin Tendulkar scored 116.|$|E

25|$|The {{last game}} in August saw League Two Hereford United visit St Andrew's {{in the second}} round of the League Cup. Two first half goals from Garry O'Connor and Gary McSheffrey saw Blues lead at half time, only for Hereford to fight back in the second half to score through Theo Robinson. But it was too little too late from the Herefordshire side as Blues dumped them out of the cup. Blues' {{exploits}} in the League Cup came to an undramatic end as they bowed out to Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Goals from David Bentley, Matt Derbyshire and Roque Santa Cruz were enough to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> a much weakened Blues team.|$|E
25|$|England won the toss and {{confidently}} {{sent the}} tourists in to bat on what looked a lively pitch, in fact {{as the day}} wore on, batting became easier and easier. Australia retained their new opening partnership of Geoff Marsh and Mark Taylor who was playing in just his third Test and had so far failed to cement {{his place in the}} order. The first session saw the pair nervously trying to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> the new ball, and England's decision to bowl looked a good one when the opening stand was broken for 44, Marsh out for 16. The second wicket only added 13, with Australian stalwart David Boon caught behind for 9 and Australia teetering.|$|E
25|$|The arch's {{imminent}} demolition {{sparked a}} preservation protest in which Woodrow Wyatt, John Betjeman and Nikolaus Pevsner were prominent figures, and a wider {{debate about the}} modernisation of central London. There was public disquiet over how a local authority with a good track record for architecture and town planning such as the LCC, and the BTC, an important public service operator, could allow the demolition of such an important monument. Figures such as Sir Charles Wheeler, the President of the Royal Academy, backed by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, the Georgian Group and the London Society, lobbied in vain for the arch's preservation. Arguments which had been successfully employed to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> the previous attempted demolition in 1938 failed to sway the BTC which {{said that it was}} unable to afford the costs of reconstruction.|$|E

25|$|The final {{began with}} eerie resemblances to same fixture {{earlier in the}} tournament when England bowled out Pakistan for a paltry 74, as Derek Pringle {{dismissed}} both Pakistani openers at 24. However, Imran Khan and Javed Miandad settled down to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> the new ball. A crucial moment occurred when Imran Khan was dropped by Graham Gooch at 9 runs. He later went on to score a match-winning 72. At the 25 over mark, Pakistan had only scored 70, but accelerated the score to 139 by the 31st over as Javed Miandad summoned a runner, and he and Imran Khan built a steady partnership. During his innings, Imran hit a huge six off Richard Illingworth that landed far back into the members section. Imran played a captain's innings, getting a score of 72 and Miandad 58 to steady the innings, expectedly followed by an onslaught from Inzamam (42) and Wasim Akram (33) enabling Pakistan to give England a fighting target of 250.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September Birmingham {{travelled}} to the Riverside Stadium {{to take on}} Middlesbrough. Two {{first half}} goals from David Wheater and Stewart Downing were enough to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> the Blues, who rarely threatened the Middlesbrough goal. The next game saw Bolton Wanderers visit St Andrew's. A free kick from Queudrue was flicked on for Kapo to secure his second goal of the season, and more importantly, Blues' first three points at home. A difficult trip to Liverpool followed, where the Blues were able to secure a valuable point in a 0–0 draw. The downside to the game was a 13th-minute injury to Borja Oubiña that would see him injured {{until the end of}} the season. The final game of the month saw the side take on Manchester United. Although the Blues bossed large parts of the game, it was the Manchester side that finished with the points. Bad play from the Blues defence allowed Manchester United to score the only goal of the game from Cristiano Ronaldo.|$|E
25|$|After {{defeating}} the Red Stick Creeks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, {{there was a}} migration of refugees to Spanish West Florida. The presence of the Creek refugees had motivated British Captain George Woodbine of the Royal Marines to travel to Pensacola in July 1814. Woodbine's liaisons with the refugees and the Spanish governor of Pensacola would subsequently lead to the British having a military presence at Pensacola from August 23, 1814, initially occupying Fort San Miguel. and the town itself. The potency of the British force, and its perceived ability to <b>see</b> <b>off</b> any American forces were leveraged by Edward Nicolls in his negotiations with the Spanish. The measure of perceived potency, however, was somewhat reduced {{in the aftermath of}} the failed attack on Fort Bowyer in September 1814. Just prior to the arrival of the Americans, as relations with the Spanish governor deteriorated, the British force left the town and was consolidated in the outlying Fort San Carlos, and at the Santa Rosa Punta de Siguenza battery (later rebuilt as Fort Pickens).|$|E
