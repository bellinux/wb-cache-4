30|$|<b>Self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> {{of small}} sizes are {{commonly}} used in wood furniture and panel products {{on the assembly line}} or for do-it-yourself products applications. <b>Self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> usually provide good holding ability and operation efficiency in wood working projects. In recent years, <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws,</b> especially medium and large sizes, have drawn attention in timber engineering for connection application in Europe.

Certain requirements for current structure design and construction details need to be verified in the interest of safety. Most <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> can be laid out with small spacing and edge distance without the risk of splitting wood, which often happens with bolted connections. Uibel and Blaß [1] tried to identify suitable spacing and distance for <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> with corresponding minimum timber thickness. They further modeled a moving load during the screw-in process with factors of wood density, screw-in speed, angle between screw axis and growth ring tangent.

5000|$|A <b>{{self-tapping}}</b> <b>screw</b> is a screw {{that can}} tap its own hole {{as it is}} driven into the material. For hard [...] such as metal or hard plastics, the self-tapping ability is often created by cutting {{a gap in the}} continuity of the thread on the screw, generating a [...] and cutting edge similar to those on a tap. Thus, whereas a regular machine screw cannot tap its own hole in a metal substrate, a self-tapping one can (within reasonable limits of substrate hardness and depth). For softer substrates such as wood or soft plastics, the self-tapping ability can come simply from a tip that tapers to a gimlet point (in which no flute is needed). Like the tip of a nail or gimlet, such a point forms the hole by displacement of the surrounding material rather than any chip-forming drilling/cutting/evacuating action.|$|E

Main principles of the investigation methodology including description of  technological scheme of <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> electro-arc machining and specimens applied while executing the experiments and hardware measuring tools used for fixation of torque which has been applied to the <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> during its twisting-in in the specimen  and its twisting-out process have been presented in the paper. It has been established that the <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> electro-arc machining initiates formation of dimples (holes) which have solidified metal flows along their edges. The flows give a cutting ability to the screw and so they exert an influence on the conditions of screw’s interaction with the specimen during its twisting-in and twisting-out processes. The paper presents results of experimental investigations that demonstrate an impact of <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> electro-arc machining on its twisting-in in the specimens made of various materials and twisting-out procedure.

And, the screws with both double-threaded sections and fully threaded shanks were higher than those of single-threaded screws. An improvement on the initial stiffness of a connection was found when the number of <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> increased. The connections assembled with the toe-nailing approach from the beam’s bottom surface provided higher maximum loading capacity, medium initial stiffness, and a larger ductility factor, resulting in higher dissipated energy with less fragile failure.

In general, the maximum load capacity of a connection fastened with 12 <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> was 11.7  % higher than that with 8 screws. Findings further showed the maximum load capacity of a connection fastened with a half-threaded shank and <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> had significant improvement when increasing from 8 to 12 screws, i.e., 38.6 and 63.3  % for 8 and 10  mm screws (F 8 - 260 - 12 and F 10 - 260 - 12), respectively. However, no further improvement in the maximum load capacity was found for the double-threaded and fully threaded screws as assembled from 8 to 12 screws. Some specimens fastened with 12 screws failed with a split along the glue line where screws were arranged during the assembly. It might limit the improvement of a connection through increasing number of fasteners. In the case of initial stiffness of a beam–girder connection, an improvement of 50.4  % was found when the number of <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> used to assemble the glulam structure was increased from 8 to 12.

40|$|The {{principle}} of the thread fastenings have been known and used for decades {{with the purpose of}} joining one component to another. Threaded fastenings are popular because they permit easy disassembly for maintenance, repair, relocation and recycling. Screw insertions are typically carried out manually. It is a difficult problem to automat. As a result there is very little published research on automating threaded fastenings, and most research on automated assembly focus on the peg-in-hole assembly problem. This paper investigates the problem of automated monitoring of the screw insertion process. The monitoring problem deals with predicting integrity of a threaded insertion, based on the torque vs. insertion depth curve generated during the insertions. The authors have developed an analytical model to predict the torque signature signals during <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> insertions. However, the model requires parameters on the screw dimensions and plate material properties are difficult to measure. This paper presents a study on on-line identification during screw fastenings.

40|$|Study Design: The pullout {{strength}} of a typical pedicle screw was evaluated experimentally for different screw insertion techniques. Objective: To conclude whether the self-tapping insertion technique is indeed the optimum one for self-tapping screws, {{with respect to the}} pullout strength. Summary of Background Data: It is reported in the literature that the size of the pilot-hole significantly influences the pullout {{strength of}} a <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw.</b> In addition it is accepted that an optimum value of the diameter of the pilot-hole exists. For non <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> insertion it is reported that undertapping of the pilot-hole can increase its pullout strength. Finally it is known that in some cases orthopedic surgeons open the threaded holes, using another screw instead of a tap. Methods: A typical commercial self-tapping pedicle screw was inserted into blocks of Solid Rigid Polyurethane Foam (simulating osteoporotic cancellous bone), following different insertion techniques. The pullout force was measured according to the ASTM-F 543 - 02 standard. The screw was inserted into previously prepared holes of different sizes, either threaded or cylindrical, to conclude whether an optimum size of the pilot-hole exists and whether tapping can increase the pullout strength. The case where the tapping is performed using another screw was also studied. Results: For screw insertion with tapping, decreasing the outer radius of the threaded hole from 1. 00 to 0. 87 of the screw's outer radius increased the pullout force 9 %. For insertion without tapping, decreasing the pilot-hole's diameter from 0. 87 to 0. 47 of the screw's outer diameter increased its pullout force 75 %. Finally, tapping using another screw instead of a tap, gave results similar to those of conventional tapping. Conclusion: Undertapping of a pilot-hole either using a tap or another screw can increase the pullout strength of self-tapping pedicle screws. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|E
30|$|The {{structural}} glulam members fabricated with rapid-grown Japanese cedar plantation timber {{were constructed}} into a beam–girder structure with self-tapping screws to evaluate characteristic strength {{properties of the}} connection {{for the purpose of}} wood-framed construction application. It is suggested that self-tapping screws with 10  mm diameter showed better joint performance in maximum load capacity and dissipated energy than did 8  mm screw connections. Self-tapping screws with fully threaded shanks showed better initial stiffness on the joint than did half-threaded screw connections, but also showed less ductility. Further, both fully threaded and double-threaded sections also provided the joint with higher maximum load and better dissipated energy than did connections using screws with half-threaded shank. The nailing approach of using self-tapping screws is a key to influencing the structural performance of a joint. The results indicated that toe-nailing approach is superior to the face-nailing approach in the maximum load capacity, initial stiffness, and dissipated energy of a beam–girder connection. A <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw</b> connection with derived allowable loading capacity for Japanese cedar glulam structure could compete as a viable bolt connection for use in wood-framed construction.|$|E

30|$|Two major nailing approaches, i.e., face nailing and toe nailing, using <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> to {{assemble}} the glulam beam–girder connections were compared. The toe-nailing approach had two screw arrangements (TU and TB) on the connection during the assembly. The maximum load capacities of the connections fastened using TU and TB toe-nailing approaches were 41.3 and 98.8  %, respectively, higher than those the using face-nailing approach. In {{the case of the}} face-nailing approach, <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> sustained a shearing force, and wood members resisted with both the compressive force and tensile force perpendicular to the grain at the interface of connections. Consequently, the shear force caused the dowel-type fastener to bend. Moreover, both the compressive force and tensile force perpendicular to the grain are weak strength properties of wood, which cause a split or cleavage failure on the glulam member [16, 17]. In the case of the toe-nailing approach, <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screws</b> strained axially in tension, and the withdrawal strength might contribute to the load-bearing capacity of a connection. Further, the withdrawal strength can be the same when the penetration angles between the screw axis and wood grain range from 30 ° to 90 °, as suggested by Hübner et al. [2]. They proposed a bilinear model which is constant withdrawal strength between 30 ° and 90 ° and then decreases from 30 ° to 0 ° to 70  % of 5  %-percentile at 30 °.

ANIMALS: 18 European shorthair cats. PROCEDURES: All cats underwent clinical examination including orthopedic and neurologic examination and assessment of lameness and pain before and immediately after surgery and 6 and 16 weeks after surgery. All sacroiliac luxations were stabilized with a single positional 2. 4 -mm cortical titanium <b>self-tapping</b> <b>screw.</b> The pelvic floor was also repaired in selected cats. Screw entry points and angles determined in a prior study of cadavers were used. Radiographs were taken before surgery and during follow-up evaluations to assess postoperative sacroiliac luxation reduction, implant placement, and repair stability. RESULTS: All implants were placed correctly. Iatrogenic sciatic nerve injuries occurred in 2 cats. Median time to ambulation was 1. 5 days for cats with sacroiliac luxation as the sole injury. Radiographic outcome of sacroiliac luxation repair was excellent in 15 of 17 repairs, good in 1 of 17 repairs, and poor in 1 of 17 repairs. Clinical outcome was excellent in 11 of 15 cats and good in 4 of 15 cats.

Recently, the thread fastenings are a common assembly method, which is widely used and popularly applied.

The monitoring problem deals with predicting the integrity of the self-tapping Threaded Fastening process, based on the torque vs. insertion angle curves generated during the insertions. A technique for estimating three unknown parameters during a general self-tapping Threaded Fastening is presented.
