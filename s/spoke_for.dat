5|$|Openly gay Mattachine Society {{president}} Hal Call, Mattachine {{executive secretary}} Donald Lucas and Mattachine treasurer Les Fisher <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> gay men.

5|$|Muhammad {{expelled}} from Medina the Banu Qaynuqa, {{one of three}} main Jewish tribes, but some historians contend that the expulsion happened after Muhammad's death. According to al-Waqidi, after Abd-Allah ibn Ubaiy <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> them, Muhammad refrained from executing them and commanded that they be exiled from Medina. Following the Battle of Badr, Muhammad also made mutual-aid alliances {{with a number of}} Bedouin tribes to protect his community from attacks from the northern part of Hejaz.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1960, Dutton {{was named}} {{president}} of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede on a two-year term. He had been a Stampede director for ten-years previous to his appointment. As head of the exhibition, he also <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> the Stampeders hockey team of the Western Hockey League, and was its chief negotiator. Through his work and community spirit, Dutton {{played a major role}} in helping Calgary and the surrounding area shed its rural image in the 25 years following World War II.|$|E
5|$|Brinkley <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> {{hours on}} end each day on the radio, {{primarily}} promoting his goat gland treatments. He variously cajoled, shamed and appealed to men's (and women's) egos, and to their desire to be more sexually active. In between Brinkley's own advertisements, his new station featured a variety of entertainment including military bands, French lessons, astrological forecasts, storytelling and exotica such as native Hawaiian songs, and American roots music including old-time string band, gospel and early country.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} featured manual retractable landing gear. The wheels used flexible <b>spokes</b> <b>for</b> shock absorption. When {{viewed from}} the side, the wing supports formed a letter [...] "K" [...] shape. The fuselage was all wood with plywood and fabric covering. The aircraft featured air tanks, and electrical power for flightsuit heating.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{conventional}} bicycle wheels now use 32 or 36 spokes {{front and}} rear, although the asymmetry {{of the rear}} wheel (to allow for the cluster of sprockets), and the additional weight it carries, means it benefits from having more spokes than the front. Commonly used models vary from 18 <b>spokes</b> <b>for</b> racing bikes to 36 for cross-country touring bikes to 48 spokes on tandems and heavily abused BMX bikes. The minimum number of <b>spokes</b> allowed <b>for</b> competition is 12. Some lowrider bicycles use as many as 144 brightly chromed spokes per wheel, although these are not meant for serious riding.|$|R
5|$|Following Spies' speech, {{the crowd}} was {{addressed}} by Parsons, the Alabama-born editor of the radical English-language weekly The Alarm. The crowd was so calm that Mayor Carter Harrison Sr., who had stopped by to watch, walked home early. Parsons <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> almost an hour before standing down {{in favor of the}} last speaker of the evening, the British socialist Samuel Fielden, who delivered a brief ten-minute address. Many of the crowd had already left as the weather was deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, Greeley met Albany editor Thurlow Weed. Weed <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> {{a liberal}} {{faction of the}} Whigs in his {{newspaper}} the Albany Evening Journal. He hired Greeley {{as editor of the}} state Whig newspaper for the upcoming campaign. The newspaper, the Jeffersonian, premiered in February 1838 and helped elect the Whig candidate for governor, William H. Seward. In 1839, Greeley worked for several journals, and took a month-long break to go as far west as Detroit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} year of World War I, Macmillan <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> the peace-seeking women of the United Kingdom at the International Congress of Women, a peace {{congress}} convened at The Hague. Afterward, she met with world leaders such as President Woodrow Wilson, whose countries were still neutral, to present the proposals formulated at The Hague. Wilson subsequently used these proposals as some of his Fourteen Points, his justification for making war to forge a lasting peace. At war's end, Macmillan served as a delegate at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, and helped encourage the founding of the League of Nations. Macmillan tried but did not succeed in getting the League to establish nationality for women independent of the nationality of their husbands.|$|E

5|$|On November 3, 1835, Texas {{declared}} {{itself an}} independent state, and a provisional government was formed with Henry Smith of Brazoria elected provisional governor. Austin requested to be relieved of his {{command of the}} army, and Sam Houston was named army chief. Edward Burleson was chosen as temporary commander of the troops in San Antonio. Bowie appeared before the council at some point and <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> an hour, asking for a commission. The council refused Bowie's request, likely because of lingering animosity over his land dealings.|$|E
5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|At the season-opening Daytona 500, Robinson {{qualified}} in 36th place {{making her}} the second woman {{to start the}} race; she finished 24th despite spinning into the track's infield, and avoided a pit road collision with Bobby Labonte. After the event, Sharp left BAM Racing, and car chief Teddy Brown became Robinson's new crew chief. She struggled during her rookie season, {{and was unable to}} attend most races due to sponsorship issues along with her team hiring new drivers which limited her on track experience. Her rival competitors said it was due to Robinson driving an noncompetitive car rather than her driving skill. Robinson made no further appearances for BAM Racing after the second race at Daytona International Speedway, and was later released by the team. She ended the season 52nd in the Drivers' Championship, and was fourth in the Rookie of the Year standings. Outside racing, Robinson <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> Women in Sports, and attended meetings of several associations and business groups while taking the time to be with her children. She separated from Jeff Clark in early 2002, but both remained on good terms.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Merrill <b>spoke</b> thickly, <b>for</b> {{the sight}} of his wife's tears wrung his heart.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her and saw that she <b>spoke</b> truth, <b>for</b> she was quite outworn.|$|R
5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> {{an hour and}} 45 minutes, setting a record for verbosity that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent}} that President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son Fletcher to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.|$|E
25|$|Later in December Ford <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> a women's {{group on}} strike or {{worked in a}} {{sweatshop}} in New York. She was in fact in suffrage meetings with Alva Belmont.|$|E
25|$|Conservative Member of Parliament Tom Lukiwski {{is known}} for his ability to stall Parliamentary Committee {{business}} by filibustering. One such example occurred October 26, 2006, when he <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> almost 120 minutes to prevent the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development from studying a private member's bill to implement the Kyoto Accord. He also <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> about 6 hours during the February 5, 2008 and February 7, 2008 at the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs meetings to block inquiry into allegations that the Conservative Party spent over the maximum allowable campaign limits during the 2006 election.|$|E

25|$|In the 1560s, {{when the}} ideas of Calvin gained in influence, Laurentius {{published}} several texts where he <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> Lutheranism. It {{has been suggested that}} {{it was the first time}} the Swedish Church defined its Lutheran character.|$|E
25|$|Bentham {{said that}} it was the placing of women in a legally {{inferior}} position that made him choose, at the age of eleven, the career of a reformist. Bentham <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> a complete equality between sexes.|$|E
25|$|While the Social Credit {{party was}} founded {{to promote the}} social credit {{theories}} of monetary reform, these could not be implemented at the provincial level, as the Alberta Social Credit Party had learned in the 1930s. Bennett quickly converted the provincial party into a populist conservative party, {{and it became a}} vehicle for those who sought to keep the CCF out of power. However, as leader of the Social Credit Party of Canada's second most powerful provincial branch, he <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> the party in federal election campaigns. During the 1957 election, he <b>spoke</b> <b>for</b> the party at a rally in Regina, Saskatchewan. In the 1965 election, Bennett and his cabinet ministers toured BC to encourage voters to elect Social Credit MPs to promote BC's interests.|$|E
