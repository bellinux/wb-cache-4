This paper explores the promise of <b>social</b> <b>labeling</b> {{in the context of}} its four oft-noted objectives: child labor employment, consumer information, welfare, and trade linkages, when competition between the North and South is based both on comparative cost advantage, and the use of child labor as a hidden product attribute. We show that (i) <b>social</b> <b>labeling</b> benefits consumers and Southern producers, whereas children and Northern producers are worse off; (ii) trade sanctions on unlabeled products deteriorates Southern terms of trade, but leaves the incidence of child labor strictly unaffected; and (iii) a threat to sanction imports of unlabeled Southern products discourages the South from maintaining a credible <b>social</b> <b>labeling</b> program. We also explore the question of whether <b>social</b> <b>labeling</b> should be viewed as a transitory or a permanent institution in developing economies.

The <b>social</b> <b>label</b> of being classified into one or the other sex is necessary for the medical stamp on birth certificates. Gender is a term used to exemplify the attributes that a society or culture constitutes as [...] "masculine" [...] or [...] "feminine". Although a person's sex as male or female stands as a biological fact that is identical in any culture, what that specific sex means in reference to a person's gender role as a woman or a man in society varies cross culturally according to what things are considered to be masculine or feminine. These roles are learned from various, intersecting sources such as parental influences, the socialization a child receives in school, and what is portrayed in the local media. It is also important to note that learning gender roles starts from birth and includes seemingly simple things like what color outfits a baby is clothed in or what toys they are given to play with. The cultural traits typically coupled to a particular sex finalize the {{assignment of}} gender and the biological differences which play a role in classifying either sex as interchangeable with the definition of gender within the social context.|$|E
5000|$|When he {{came back}} to Georgia, he {{propagated}} the Marxist ideas among the workers of Tbilisi, and in the 1890s he became a leader of the first legal Marxist organization in Georgia, called the Mesame Dasi (the Third Group). In late December 1892, Noe Zhordania emerged on the political scene. He attended the Marxian meetings at the Aleksandre Pushkin House in Kvirila, and eventually {{became a member of the}} first Marxist group. Other famous members were: Nikolay Chkheidze, Eugene Vatsadze, Mikha Tskhakaia, Joseph Kakabadze, Razhden Kaladze, Dmitry Kalandarishvili, Isidore Ramishvili, Arsen Tsitlidze, Isidore Kvitsaridze and Silibistro Jibladze. The group ultimately failed to reach an agreement on certain issues and thus, Noe Zhordania, with Kibladze and Egnate Ninoshvili, were left in charge of creating action program for the group. They outlined importance of the working class in overthrowing the old society, and added the national question in their programme. [...] The programme was adopted and then, in 1894, published in the journal [...] "Moambe". It was based on the following provisions: 1.The person's physical well-being 2. Freedom of the individual and state 3. National identity of the people, based on <b>social</b> <b>label.</b> Later on, the group got the name Mesame Dasi. In May 1893, fearing of possible arrest, Zhordania traveled to Europe from Batumi. When the order of his arrest was released in Lanchkhuti, he was already in Geneva. There he met other Marxist group members: Georgi Plekhanov, Lev Deichi, and Vera Zasulichi. There he read Marxist literature and explored the Swiss workers and peasants' life, writing down and then sending his notes to the journal Kvali (კვალი). In 1894, he was tried by the Russian authorities for his participation in the [...] "League of Freedom of Georgia". In 1895, he went to Paris and studied at the Bibliothèque nationale de France for 3 months, became acquainted with Jules Guesde, Paul Lafargue and other French socialists in the meantime. He remained in Paris for four months before going back to Geneva and, from there he headed to Germany, the birthplace of Marxist ideologies. He settled in Stuttgart for two reasons: first, there he met Karl Kautsky, and second, there was not a single Georgian or Russian in Stuttgart who could prevent Zhordania from learning the German language. In order to familiarize himself with the political economy of the bourgeoisie, Zhordania moved to Munich. There he enrolled at the university and followed the course of Professor Franz Brentano. At the beginning of 1896 Zhordania left Munich and traveled to Berlin, where he attended the lectures of Richard Wagner. While living in Germany Zhordania wrote the following articles for [...] "Kvali": [...] "Friedrich Engels" [...] (1895) (ფრიდრიხ ენგელსი), [...] "the village and agricultural growing in Germany" [...] (1985)(სოფელი და სასოფლო შკოლა გერმანიაში), [...] "Political parties in Germany" [...] (1897)(პოლიტიკური პარტიები გერმანიაში), [...] "Bismarck" [...] (1898)(ბისმარკი).|$|E

This paper analyzes which factors determine {{the probability of a}} child to work in the carpet industry, and examines the influence of non governmental organizations (NGOs) like Rugmark which are engaged in the <b>social</b> <b>labeling</b> process. Data was obtained from interviews with 417 households in North India. Based on their calorie intake, the households were dissected into two groups, one very poor group below and another one above the subsistence level. The econometric analysis shows that a child living in a very poor household is more likely to work when his/her calorie intake increases (nutritional efficiency wage argument), while the opposite is true for a child from the above-subsistence household group. In addition, it has been found that <b>social</b> <b>labeling</b> has no significant influence on the very poor households.

Results indicated that social labeling is more successful when cognitive resources are distracted, either at the moment of processing the label, or at the moment of making decisions related to the content of the label.

40|$|The {{theory of}} <b>social</b> <b>labelling</b> has radically revaluated several propositions {{previously}} widely {{accepted in the}} sociology of deviations and in criminology. It is mostly {{a question of the}} departure from the deterministic approach giving preference to the etiology analysis of deviational and criminal phenomena combined with a stress on the role of social control understood as a factor being at the bottom of social order. The theory has also criticized discriminating deviational and criminal phenomena from other social facts on the grounds of their objective and qualitative differences, The proposition of "distinctness" of deviated persons or criminals from other people, which was in addition to account for deviational behaviour, was pronouncedly dismissed. A new way of defining the deviational phenomena was developed in the <b>social</b> <b>labelling</b> theory upon application of the behavioral criterion of reaction to a given type of behaviour in place of the previous formal criterion of a norm contravention. Simultaneously a, stress was laid on the role of an intragroup interaction in forming judgements and interpretations of other persons behaviour and in considering it to be deviated. Reflections on the negative effect of the institution of social control were extended by introducing a notion of the secondary deivation. Consequently it was suggested in the new trend to reevaluate the previous treatment of deviational and criminal phenomena and replacing the "correctional" attitude with the one of "understanding". That would imply a substantial change in methods and ways of treating phenomena of deviation and deviated persons themselves. To sum up: irrespective of the disputability of its several propositions, the <b>social</b> <b>labelling</b> theory can be considered as a particularly original attempt at creating a complimentary approach to the subject in relation to the previous theories of deviation and crime.
