25|$|The primary {{signalling}} {{system is a}} fixed-block cab {{signalling system}} called HKT which transmits data to the trains through low-bandwidth audio frequency induction loops between the rails. Different frequency combinations encode different target speeds; when a train enters a block with a lower target speed than its current speed it will initiate <b>service</b> <b>braking</b> until the two match. This allows blocks to be much shorter than the full-speed braking distance, but as the braking profile is encoded in the transmitted target speed it only works where all trains have similar braking characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> concurrently with the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes,</b> resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the relay valve for remote <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> application.|$|R

25|$|In normal {{operation}} for locomotive/carriage trains, on descending and level running, {{the train is}} normally braked (<b>service</b> <b>braking)</b> using the locomotive. This uses compression braking – the energy is absorbed by using the cylinders as pumps, then dumping the pressure, similar to a Jake brake – on steam locomotives, hydraulic braking on the diesel locomotives. The diesel-electric railcars were service braked using hydraulic brakes and dynamic braking, during which power was dissipated in roof-mounted resistors, creating a distinct heat shimmer when the vehicles were descending and shortly afterwards. The hand brakes are used to bring a train to a complete stand from low speed, and as a parking brake.|$|E

2500|$|Westinghouse {{developed}} the XD-323 rotary accelerator for motor control with 99 points; it {{was installed in}} the first PRCo car, #100, and minor modifications allowed use in the last PCCs produced in North America for San Francisco in 1952. [...] Prior streetcar control, existing from the 1890s, required a standing operator at a three foot high vertical [...] "switch stand" [...] to rotate a handle to one of six brass points mounted within the stand to provide traction motor control and acceleration. The PCC had its accelerator under the floor where the pedal activated linkage to resistance ribbons were mounted to each PCC point around the outside edge of the accelerator. [...] An arm rotating in the center had rollers on either end which cut out resistance alternately as it rotated approximately 180 degrees. [...] This same accelerator was also used for dynamic braking; when the power pedal was released the accelerator sought optimum braking for the speed, which prevented a lag when the brake pedal was depressed. [...] General Electric Developed a control system for PCC cars that mirrored the Westinghouse scheme in function, although not in simplicity or maintainability.

50|$|With a <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{relay valve}} installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers, and quickly applies the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes.</b> The pressure delivered to the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers.|$|R
50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|R

50|$|Unlike the original, the new {{funicular}} {{used two}} separate haulage systems (one for each car), {{with the two}} systems connected to each other, the drive motor, and the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> by a gear train; it was the failure of this gear train that was the immediate cause of the accident since it effectively disconnected Sinai both from Olivet’s balancing load and from the <b>service</b> <b>brake.</b> There were emergency brakes that acted {{on the rim of}} each haulage drum, but due to inadequate maintenance, the emergency brakes for both cars were inoperative, which left Sinai without any brakes once its physical connection to the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> was lost. Contrary to what might be expected, the new funicular was constructed with neither safety cable nor track brakes, either of which would have prevented the accident; the NTSB was unable to identify another funicular worldwide that operated without either of these safety features.|$|R
