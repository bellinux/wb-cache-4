40|$|<b>Stabilised</b> soil {{products}} such as <b>stabilised</b> soil blocks, rammed earth and <b>stabilised</b> adobe are being used for building construction since the last 6 - 7 decades. Major advantages of <b>stabilised</b> soil products include low embodied carbon, use of local materials, decentralized production, and easy to adjust the strength, texture, size and shape. Portland cement and lime represent {{the most commonly used}} stabilisers for <b>stabilised</b> soil products. The mechanism of strength development in cement and lime <b>stabilised</b> soils is distinctly different. The paper presents results of scientific investigations pertaining to the status of clay minerals in the 28 day cured cement and lime <b>stabilised</b> soil compacts. XRD, SEM imaging, grain size distribution and Atterberg's limits of the ground <b>stabilised</b> soil products and the natural soil were determined. Results reveal that clay minerals can be retrieved from cement <b>stabilised</b> soil products, whereas in lime <b>stabilised</b> soil products clay minerals get consumed in the lime-clay reactions and negligible percentage of clay minerals are left in the <b>stabilised</b> soil compacts. The results of the present investigation clearly demonstrate that cement stabilisation is superior to lime stabilisation in retrieving the clay minerals from the <b>stabilised</b> soil compacts.

5|$|Alvarado {{despatched}} his lieutenant Baltasar Guerra {{to pacify}} the rebel Chiapanecas and Zoques, and the victorious conquistadores in turn demanded encomiendas. The general instability continued, but the Mazariegos family managed {{to establish a}} power base in the local colonial institutions. In 1535, the Mazariegos faction succeeded in having San Cristóbal de los Llanos declared a city, with the new name of Ciudad Real. They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to <b>stabilise</b> the colony, such as an edict that specified that the governor of Chiapa must govern in person and not through a delegated representative. In practise, the quick turnover of encomiendas continued, since few Spaniards had legal Spanish wives and legitimate children who could inherit. This situation would not <b>stabilise</b> until the 1540s, when the dire shortage of Spanish women in the colony was alleviated by an influx of new colonists. At around the same time, the Audiencia de los Confines intervened, appointing judges to exert greater control over the allocation of encomiendas.|$|E

5|$|In 1531, Pedro de Alvarado {{finally took}} up the post of {{governor}} of Chiapa. He immediately reinstated the old name of San Cristóbal de los Llanos upon Villa Real. Once again, the encomiendas of Chiapa were transferred to new owners. The Spanish launched an expedition against Puyumatlan; it was not successful in terms of conquest, but enabled the Spanish to seize more slaves to trade for weapons and horses. The newly acquired supplies would then be used in further expeditions to conquer and pacify still-independent regions, leading to a cycle of slave raids, trade for supplies, followed by further conquests and slave raids. The Mazariegos family managed to establish a power base in the local colonial institutions and, in 1535, they succeeded in having San Cristóbal de los Llanos declared a city, with the new name of Ciudad Real. They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to <b>stabilise</b> the colony, such as an edict that specified that the governor of Chiapa must govern in person and not through a delegated representative.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the compressive strength of lateritic bricks <b>stabilised</b> with cement, lime and termite-hill, moulded with CINVA-Ram. The engineering characteristics and classification of the lateritic soil sample were determined, also the characteristic compressive strength of <b>stabilised</b> bricks {{as well as}} the unstabilised bricks were investigated after 7, 14 and 28 days of curing. The total number of bricks moulded was ninety and they were 290 mm x 140 mm x 90 mm in size. Each of the three stabilisers were added in varying proportions of 8 %, 10 % and 12 % by weight of the lateritic soil for producing the bricks. Compressive strength test conducted after 28 days curing revealed that the cement <b>stabilised</b> bricks developed a rapid increase in strength than the lime <b>stabilised</b> and termite-hill stablised bricks. In all, the compressive strength increased with increasing proportion of the stabilisers. However, the unstabilised bricks developed strength which was more than the 10 % termite-hill <b>stabilised</b> bricks after 28 days.
