40|$|In {{pulse power}} systems, series-resonant {{topology}} under high working frequency has realized fast energy conversion from initial energy-storage devices to pulsed energy-storage devices {{and has also}} improved the stability of output pulse. Usually linear increase of the voltage across load-capacitor is a typical characteristic {{of this kind of}} converter. On the other hand, continual increase of charging-power in each separate charging-period is a major shortcoming. However, these two characteristics seem dominant in the first <b>stage</b> of <b>charging</b> but disappear in the second <b>stage</b> of <b>charging.</b> Numerical analysis is carried out in this paper to explain these inherent laws based on detailed derivations for transient operation under ideal condition that on-state voltages of switches and diodes, as well as the presence of non-ideal transformer are not taken into account. Moreover, approximate generalized expressions of voltages across resonant capacitor and loadcapacitor, maximum resonant current as well as numbers of charging periods in both stages have been derived. Also, some relations based on these expressions have been depicted...|$|R
25|$|The Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet {{had also}} {{emphasised}} speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. In practice drills, cordite {{could not be}} supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant in good time to load for the next broadside, many safety doors were kept open {{that should have been}} shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of cordite were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. By <b>staging</b> <b>charges</b> in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable to chain reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions. This 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices. Furthermore, the doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships' magazines, cordite was stored in insecure places.|$|R

40|$|Charging {{performance}} {{affects the}} commercial application of electric vehicles (EVs) significantly. This paper presents an optimal charging strategy for Li-ion batteries {{based on the}} voltage-based multistage constant current (VMCC) charging strategy. In order to satisfy the different charging demands of the EV users for charging time, charged capacity and energy loss, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is employed and the influences of <b>charging</b> <b>stage</b> number, <b>charging</b> cut-off voltage and weight factors of different charging goals are analyzed. Comparison experiments of the proposed charging strategy and the traditional normal and fast charging strategies are carried out. The experimental results demonstrate that the traditional normal and fast charging strategies can only satisfy a small range of EV users’ charging demand well while the proposed charging strategy can satisfy {{the whole range of}} the charging demand well. The relative increase in charging performance of the proposed charging strategy can reach more than 80 % when compared to the normal and fast charging dependently...|$|R

40|$|Read out {{integrated}} circuit (ROIC) design for quantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) array requires large charge handling capacity, low readout noise, minimum detector bias voltage variations, and minimum power dissipation. ROIC design for such applications is challenging due to complex requirements and often needs iterative fabrications {{to meet all}} requirements. In this letter, we propose a decision matrix-based optimization method for large dynamic range ROIC implementation. The optimization method is based on trade off analysis, design, and simulation of identified ROIC parameters. This methodology {{has been applied to}} an actual case, and the optimum ROIC topology was selected using the optimization method described in this letter. The critical specifications are charge handling capacity of greater than 5 Me and low readout noise of less than 600 electrons, in 180 -nm CMOS process. The large dynamic range ROIC consists of a <b>charge</b> integration <b>stage,</b> <b>charge</b> to voltage converters, correlated double samplers, sample and holds, column amplifiers, analog multiplexer, and a buffer amplifier stage.

40|$|CMOS {{is used to}} {{construct}} the integrated circuits with {{a low level of}} static leakage. With this low-level leakage, we are designing all the transistor circuits in CMOS logic. To control this static leakage in the circuits, the supply voltage is a major concern. Here the step-up converters with charge pump and the level for maintaining its threshold voltage (VT) are to be analyzed and proposed. Here we are going to propose the novel approach as body bias effect and sub-threshold logic. This will be applied to the step-up converters for energy harvesting applications. The backward control is to be processed for control the internal voltage when the charge transfer switch could be in activation. When the supply voltage is to be raised from the fixed voltage level, it will be the turn OFF the transistor. The maximum level of the converters circuits contains the branch A and branch B which could be contained all p-MOS and n-MOS combinations. The oscillator circuit also designed and applied to the proposed six <b>stage</b> <b>charge</b> pump circuit to reduce the power consumption.

Individual chromosomes are then manually cut, paired, pasted and a karyotype is made. This whole procedure is time consuming, labour intensive and expensive.
