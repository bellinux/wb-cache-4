5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E

500|$|Flagg’s {{character}} has its detractors. In his essay [...] "The Glass-Eyed Dragon", author L. Sprague de Camp criticizes Flagg in Eyes of the Dragon, {{saying that he}} is one of the least-believable characters in the book and too evil to be credible. According to de Camp, absolute evil is hard to envision; whereas Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin believed they were improving the world, Flagg only enjoys causing destruction and chaos. De Camp notes that Flagg fails to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no advantage to his actions.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his early}} optimism, Noades soon {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that a League club in Milton Keynes would not draw crowds much higher than those Wimbledon already attracted in south London. [...] "I couldn't really see us getting any bigger gates than what Northampton Town were currently getting at that time, and, in fact, are still getting," [...] he recalled in 2001. [...] "I really couldn't see any future in it. I can't actually <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a means of drawing large attendances to Milton Keynes." [...] Abandoning his interest in MK City, Noades sold Wimbledon to Hammam in 1981 for £40,000. Later that year Noades bought nearby Crystal Palace and briefly explored merging that club with Wimbledon.|$|E
500|$|In a twist from expectation, Eliot's poem {{suggests}} that old men {{should go out}} and explore. He warns that people should trade wisdom for pointless experience and argues that men should explore human experience itself. This concept is hinted of in The Waste Land and draws from the ideas within Dante's Convivio. Dante argues that old men are supposed to return to God and describes the process in a way similar to the travels of Odysseus. Unlike Homer's hero, Dante argues that men should not travel in the material world but in the spiritual world. Both Dante and Eliot put forth a similar view to St. Augustine when they focus on internal travels. Through these travels, mankind is able to have faith in salvation and able to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more to the world than darkness. Eliot explains within the poem {{that we are all}} interconnected through time and that we must realize this. Only through this realization is mankind able to understand the truth of the universe. This, in turn, would allow humanity to break free from the burden of time. As Russel Kirk explains: [...] "That end, for those who apprehend a reality superior to 'birth, copulation, and death'—a reality transcending the rhythms of physical nature—is to know God and enjoy Him forever." ...|$|E

For example, consider the sphere [...] Pick open sets [...] and [...] where n and s denote {{the north and south}} poles respectively. Then we have the property that A, B and A ∩ B are open path connected sets.
