25|$|This <b>shielding</b> <b>can</b> {{be applied}} to {{individual}} pairs or quads, or to the collection of pairs. Individual pairs are foiled, while overall cable may use braided screen, foil, or braiding with foil.|$|E
25|$|Sensitive {{electronic}} equipment {{are vulnerable to}} interference and unauthorized surveillance. These products also require protection from high voltages. Radio frequency (RF) <b>shielding</b> <b>can</b> address these issues by reducing the transmission of electric or magnetic fields from one space to another.|$|E
25|$|In {{the studio}} and on stage, pop-screens and foam <b>shields</b> <b>can</b> be useful for reasons of hygiene, and {{protecting}} microphones from spittle and sweat. They can also be useful coloured idents. On location the basket <b>shield</b> <b>can</b> contain a suspension system to isolate the microphone from shock and handling noise.|$|R
50|$|Arduino and Arduino-compatible boards use {{printed circuit}} {{expansion}} boards called shields, which plug into the normally supplied Arduino pin headers. <b>Shields</b> <b>can</b> provide motor controls for 3D printing and other applications, Global Positioning System (GPS), Ethernet, {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD), or breadboarding (prototyping). Several <b>shields</b> <b>can</b> also be made do it yourself (DIY).|$|R

25|$|Since the {{magnetic}} signals emitted by the brain {{are on the}} order of a few femtoteslas, shielding from external magnetic signals, including the Earth's magnetic field, is necessary. Appropriate magnetic <b>shielding</b> <b>can</b> be obtained by constructing rooms made of aluminium and mu-metal for reducing high-frequency and low-frequency noise, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{resonant}} frequency of Tesla coils {{is in the}} low radio frequency (RF) range, usually between 50kHz and 1MHz. However, because of the impulsive nature of the spark they produce broadband radio noise, and without <b>shielding</b> <b>can</b> be {{a significant source of}} RFI, interfering with nearby radio and television reception.|$|E
25|$|Under some circumstances, {{the signal}} {{radiated}} from the electron guns, scanning circuitry, and associated wiring of a CRT can be captured remotely {{and used to}} reconstruct what is shown on the CRT using a process called Van Eck phreaking. Special TEMPEST <b>shielding</b> <b>can</b> mitigate this effect. Such radiation of a potentially exploitable signal, however, occurs also with other display technologies and with electronics in general.|$|E
50|$|A {{good idea}} of the {{effectiveness}} of a Faraday <b>shield</b> <b>can</b> be obtained from considerations of skin depth. With skin depth, the current flowing is mostly in the surface, and decays exponentially with depth through the material. Because a Faraday shield has finite thickness, this determines how well the shield works; a thicker <b>shield</b> <b>can</b> attenuate electromagnetic fields better, and to a lower frequency.|$|R
25|$|A <b>shield</b> <b>can</b> be {{effective}} against {{one type of}} electromagnetic field but not against another. For example, a copper foil or screen RF shield will be minimally effective against power frequency magnetic fields. A power frequency magnetic shield could offer little reduction of radio frequency fields. The {{same is true for}} different RF frequencies. A simple large-mesh screen <b>shield</b> <b>can</b> work well for lower frequencies, but can be ineffective for microwaves.|$|R

2500|$|Asteroid mining {{will also}} be a key player in space colonization. Water and {{materials}} to make structures and <b>shielding</b> <b>can</b> be easily found in asteroids. Instead of resupplying on Earth, mining and fuel stations need to be established on asteroids to facilitate better space travel. Optical mining is the term NASA uses to describe extracting materials from asteroids. NASA believes by using propellant derived from asteroids for exploration to the moon, Mars, and beyond will save $100 billion. If funding and technology come sooner than estimated, asteroid mining might be possible within a decade.|$|E
2500|$|The {{higher the}} energy of the gamma rays, the thicker the {{shielding}} made from the same shielding material is required. Materials for shielding gamma rays are typically measured by the thickness required to reduce the intensity of the gamma rays by one half (the half value layer or HVL). For example, gamma rays that require [...] (0.4″) of lead to reduce their intensity by 50% will also have their intensity reduced in half by [...] of granite rock, 6cm (2½″) of concrete, or 9cm (3½″) of packed soil. However, the mass of this much concrete or soil is only 20–30% greater than that of lead with the same absorption capability. Depleted uranium is used for shielding in portable gamma ray sources, but here the savings in weight over lead are larger, as portable sources' shape resembles a sphere to some extent, and the volume of a sphere is dependent on the cube of the radius; so a source with its radius cut in half will have its volume reduced by a factor of eight, which will more than compensate uranium's greater density (as well as reducing bulk). In a nuclear power plant, <b>shielding</b> <b>can</b> be provided by steel and concrete in the pressure and particle containment vessel, while water provides a radiation shielding of fuel rods during storage or transport into the reactor core. The loss of water or removal of a [...] "hot" [...] fuel assembly into the air would result in much higher radiation levels than when kept under water.|$|E

5000|$|Gaps in the <b>shielding</b> <b>can</b> {{be blocked}} using {{containers}} of water. While water {{has a much}} lower density than that of lead, it is still able to shield some gamma rays.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason that}} these {{instruments}} are so sensitive {{is that they}} are often housed in low background counting chambers. Typically this is a small room with very thick walls made of low-background steel (~20 cm) and sometimes lined with a thin layer of lead (~1 cm).
