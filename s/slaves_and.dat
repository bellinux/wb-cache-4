5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1860s, Henschel's {{houses of}} Recife and Salvador were already making portraits of people of African origin, <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> free, differing from other photographers by portraying them freely and with dignity as people and not as objects.|$|E
5|$|According to the 9th-century Book of Roads and Kingdoms by ibn Khordadbeh, China was a {{destination}} for Radhanite Jews buying boys, female <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> eunuchs from Europe. During the subsequent Song period {{there was also a}} community of Kaifeng Jews in China. The Spaniard, Benjamin of Tudela (from Navarre) was a 12th century Jewish traveler whose Travels of Benjamin recorded vivid descriptions of Europe, Asia, and Africa, preceding those of Marco Polo by a hundred years.|$|E

5|$|African {{slaves were}} {{originally}} excluded from United States citizenship. In 1857, the United States Supreme Court held in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slaves, former <b>slaves,</b> <b>and</b> their descendants were not eligible under the Constitution to be citizens. Additionally, American Indians were not originally recognized as citizens, since Indian tribes {{were considered to}} be outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|Before World War One men {{generally}} had longer {{hair and}} beards. However, short hair on men {{was introduced in}} World War One for soldiers. <b>Slaves</b> <b>and</b> defeated armies were often required to shave their heads. The trench warfare in 1914 to 1918 exposed men to flea and lice infestations, which prompted the order to cut short hair, establishing a military tradition, and it expanded among civilians by imitation.|$|E
5|$|By 1861, Leslie {{had built}} up a prosperous estate and added a plot of land in Texas to his {{holdings}} in Kentucky. In December of that year, he and his eldest son traveled to the property with 26 <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> {{a large part of}} the family's possessions. After establishing his household, Leslie returned to Kentucky and left the Texas estate in the care of his son.|$|E

25|$|Labor {{performed}} by both <b>slave</b> <b>and</b> freed women was largely divided between domestic {{work and the}} market scene, which was much larger in urban cities like Salvador and Rio de Janeiro. The domestic work women performed for owners was traditional, consisting of cooking, cleaning, laundry, fetching water, and childcare. In the 1870s, 87–90% of slave women in Rio worked as domestic servants, and an estimated 34,000 <b>slave</b> <b>and</b> free women labored as domestics. Thus, Brazilian women in urban centers often blurred the lines that separated the work and lives of the <b>slave</b> <b>and</b> the free.|$|R
5|$|Emily Shelby – Arthur Shelby's wife. She is {{a deeply}} {{religious}} woman who strives {{to be a kind}} and moral influence upon her <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> is appalled when her husband sells his slaves with a slave trader. As a woman, she has no legal way to stop this, as all property belongs to her husband.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{theory can}} also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a {{critique}} of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> not amalgamation into American society.|$|E
5|$|First, he shunned the states' rights viewpoint, {{stressing}} {{instead the}} need for a strong interdependence between the states. Second, he {{called for an end to}} slavery. Third, he emphasized the importance of education. Though they agreed on this last point, Breckinridge's father had ardently opposed emancipation of <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> favored states' rights. Historian James C. Klotter opines that Louis Marshall and Robert's mother Mary may have influenced his positions.|$|E

5|$|Following the First Seminole War and {{a treaty}} with Spain, Florida became a U.S. {{territory}} in 1821. Under pressure from US settlers, Seminole and Black Seminoles began to migrate into {{central and southern}} Florida. In the early nineteenth century, African-American <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> Black Seminoles escaped to the Bahamas from Cape Florida, including hundreds in the 1820s, to evade American slavers.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union {{victory in}} 1865, three {{amendments}} {{were added to}} the U.S. Constitution: the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment provided citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been <b>slaves,</b> <b>and</b> the Fifteenth Amendment ensured that they had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves.|$|E
5|$|In 135 BC, Tang Meng led the {{earliest}} Han expedition against Dian, establishing the Jianwei commandery in southwestern China. The Dian tribes {{were involved in}} the trade of livestock, horses, fruit, and <b>slaves,</b> <b>and</b> was attractive to the Han because of their resources and metalworking expertise. Trade routes between Dian {{and the rest of the}} Han empire were opened up by Han soldiers. The Han continued their expansion northward, and annexed the territory near Shu.|$|E

5|$|Lacks {{was buried}} in an unmarked grave in the family {{cemetery}} {{in a place called}} Lackstown in Halifax County, Virginia. Lackstown is the name that was given to the land in Clover, Virginia that was originally owned by white, land- and slave-owning members of the Lacks family before the Civil War. Later generations gave the land to the many black members of the Lacks family who were descendants of African <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> their white owners.|$|E

They would also have been responsible for caring for ill household members, supervising <b>slaves,</b> <b>and</b> ensuring that the household had sufficient food.|$|E
5|$|Most slaves {{worked as}} {{plantation}} laborers. Relatively few Brazilians owned <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> most {{small and medium-sized}} farms employed free workers. Slaves could be found scattered throughout society in other capacities: some were used as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners and in many other roles. Many emancipated slaves went on to acquire <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> there were even cases of slaves who had their own slaves. While slaves were usually black or mulatto there were reported cases of slaves {{who appeared to be}} of European descent—the product of generations of inter-ethnic sexual relations between male slave owners and their female mulatto slaves. Even the harshest slave owners adhered to a long-established practice of selling slaves along with their families, taking care not to separate individuals. Slaves were regarded by law as properties. The ones who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteed—the only exception being that, until 1881, freed slaves were barred from voting in elections, although their children and descendants could vote.|$|E
