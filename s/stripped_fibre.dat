40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study into the tensile strength and fatigue properties of uncoated optical glass fibres containing Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The protective polymer coating of the optical fibres {{must be removed}} by chemical or mechanical stripping methods to produce the Bragg gratings in the fibre core. This paper investigates the effects of chemical or mechanical stripping on the sensor integrity, operating life and damage mechanisms of the fibres when {{they have not been}} recoated after producing the Bragg gratings. The fatigue properties of the chemically or mechanically <b>stripped</b> <b>fibre</b> sensors were evaluated under cyclic tension¿tension loading when externally bonded to carbon fibre-epoxy substrates representative of aircraft composite structures. The tensile strength of the mechanically <b>stripped</b> <b>fibre</b> was lower than the chemically <b>stripped</b> <b>fibre</b> because larger surface flaws were created during removal of the polymer coating. Tension fatigue life (S¿N) curves of the chemically and mechanically stripped fibres were measured, and the fatigue life and signal quality of the FBG sensors decreased rapidly with increasing maximum fatigue strain. The signal quality of the FBG sensors degraded with increasing number of load cycles due to the formation of sub-critical cracks within the fibre by stress-corrosion. The fatigue life and sensor performance under cyclic loading was superior for the chemically stripped sensors. The S¿N curves exhibit a fatigue endurance limit (at 106 load cycles), below which chemically and mechanically stripped fibres have an infinite fatigue life and there is no degradation to the FBG sensor signal quality...|$|E

Canadian Geotechnical JournalPrevious {{research on}} random fibre reinforced granular materials {{has shown that}} the relative dimensions of the grains and fibres significantly affect the macro-mechanical behaviour of the mixture. However, quantitative data are scarce and most previous work has focused on fine to medium sands, leaving uncertainties regarding the applicability of current knowledge to larger size aggregates such as railway ballast. In this paper, triaxial test data on 1 / 3 and 1 / 5 scale railway ballast are used to develop scaling relationships for the size and quantity of fibres needed to achieve the same reinforcing effect in granular materials of differing grain size. It is shown that, to maintain consistency across scales, fibre content should be quantified as a numerical (i. e. number of fibres per grain) rather than a volumetric ratio. It is further shown that increasing the fibre length increases the resistance of the mixture to deviator stress if the fibres are wide enough; and that provided an allowance is made for the effect of fibre tension, the changes in the stress-strain-strength behaviour of the granular matrix resulting from the changes in void ratio associated with the addition of the fibres are consistent with conventional soil mechanics theory across scales. </span...|$|R

Various types of anode systems (conductive asphalt, conductive mortars, carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>strips,</b> since the early 1980 s titanium mesh) were deployed and placed upon or cast into a conventional concrete overlay.

In order to determine precisely how glucose uptake is controlled in various ruminant muscles, particularly by insulin, {{this study was designed}} to investigate in vitro glucose transport and insulin-regulatable glucose-transporter protein (GLUT 4) in muscle from calf and goat. Our data demonstrate that glucose transport is the rate-limiting step for glucose uptake in bovine <b>fibre</b> <b>strips,</b> as in rat muscle. Insulin increases the rate of in vitro glucose transport in bovine muscle, but to a lower extent than in rat muscle. A GLUT 4 -like protein was detected by immunoblot assay in all insulin-responsive tissues from calf and goat (heart, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue) but not in liver, brain, erythrocytes and intestine. Unlike the rat, bovine and goat GLUT 4 content is higher in glycolytic and oxido-glycolytic muscles than in oxidative muscles. In conclusion, using both a functional test (insulin stimulation of glucose transport) and an immunological approach, this study demonstrates that ruminant muscles express GLUT 4 protein. Our data also suggest that, in ruminants, glucose is the main energy-yielding substrate for glycolytic but not for oxidative muscles, and that insulin responsiveness may be lower in oxidative than in other skeletal muscles...|$|R
