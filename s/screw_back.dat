50|$|Side error:This {{occurs when}} the horizon glass/mirror is not {{perpendicular}} to {{the plane of the}} instrument. To test for this, first zero the index arm then observe a star through the sextant. Then rotate the tangent <b>screw</b> <b>back</b> and forth so that the reflected image passes alternately above and below the direct view. If in changing from one position to another the reflected image passes directly over the unreflected image, no side error exists. If it passes to one side, side error exists. The user can hold the sextant on its side and observe the horizon to check the sextant during the day. If there are two horizons there is side error; adjust the horizon glass/mirror until the stars merge into one image or the horizons are merged into one. Side error is generally inconsequential for observations and can be ignored or reduced to a level that is merely inconvenient.|$|E
40|$|Proximal humerus {{fractures}} {{are among}} the most common fractures. Intramedullary nailing is a valuable treatment option for displaced fractures. The treatment aim is anatomic reduction and stable fixation allowing an early functional after treatment. In this study, we describe the technique of third-generation nailing, characterized by: straight nail, multiple angular stable proximal fixation options (aimed at the area of optimal bone quality), calcar screw, multiplanar (angular stable) distal fixation. Of the 35 fractures (7, two-fragment fractures; 16, three-fragment fractures; and 12, four-fragment fractures), we observed 2 losses of reduction, 3 screw penetrations, and 1 calcar <b>screw</b> <b>back</b> out. In 4 patients, this led to a second operation (1 reversed shoulder prosthesis, 3 removals of 1 screw). We conclude that third-generation is a valuable option in the treatment of 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -part fractures of the proximal humerus. status: publishe...|$|E

Lag screw back-out occurred in three patients of this group. In one case, it was the superior, and in two cases, the inferior <b>screws</b> <b>backed</b> out 3 – 4  months postoperatively.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, UCAR {{fabricated}} a snowfall simulator {{that they have}} used to test deicing fluids for aircraft, among other applications. Ice cores are actuated by a stepper motor and travel along a linear guide rail feeding it into an auger bit. This bit shaves the ice core, creating conditions that simulate snowfall. Currently, the simulator is in satisfactory operating condition, however upgrades have been proposed to make the simulator more user friendly. When one ice core has been exhausted, the motor controlling the carriage must be actuated in reverse to move the mount along a lead <b>screw</b> <b>back</b> to reloading position, which can take upwards of three minutes. The purpose of this project is to retrofit the simulator with a quick release system that allows for the user to manually unlock the carriage and quickly pull {{it back into the}} reloading position, decreasing turn around time in the testing process. The final design is a symmetric 2 -clamp system that is installed directly onto the ice core mount. The two clamps engage the lead screw from the left and the right. To reload the ice cores, the user must simply lift the Destaco clamps on each side and pull the entire carriage back to the original position {{at the front of the}} simulator...|$|E
40|$|Background : Cervical spondylotic {{myelopathy}} (CSM) {{is serious}} consequence of cervical intervertebral disk degeneration. Morbidity ranges from chronic neck pain, radicular pain, headache, myelopathy leading to weakness, and impaired fine motor coordination to quadriparesis and/or sphincter dysfunction. Surgical treatment remains {{the mainstay of}} treatment once myelopathy develops. Compared to more conventional surgical techniques for spinal cord decompression, such as anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, laminectomy, and laminoplasty, patients treated with corpectomy have better neurological recovery, less axial neck pain, and lower incidences of postoperative loss of sagittal plane alignment. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the outcome of corpectomy in cervical spondylotic myelopathy, to assess their improvement of symptoms, and to highlight complications of the procedure. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four patients underwent cervical corpectomy for cervical spondylotic myelopathy during June 1999 to July 2005. The anterior approach was used. Each patient was graded according to the Nuricks Grade (1972) and the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) Scale (1991), and the recovery rate was calculated. Results: Preoperative patients had a mean Nurick&#x 2032;s grade of 3. 83, which was 1. 67 postoperatively. Preoperative patients had a mean mJOA score of 9. 67, whereas postoperatively it was 14. 50. The mean recovery rate of patients postoperatively was 62. 35 &#x 0025; at a mean follow-up of 1 year (range, 8 months to 5 years). The complications included one case (4. 17 &#x 0025;) of radiculopathy, two cases (8. 33 &#x 0025;) of graft displacement, and two cases (8. 33 &#x 0025;) of <b>screw</b> <b>back</b> out/failure. Conclusions: Cervical corpectomy is a reliable and rewarding procedure for CSM, with functional improvement in most patients...|$|E

30|$|Two biomechanical {{studies that}} {{directly}} compared {{the stability of}} single and dual lag screw implants used for treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures have shown favorable results for implants with dual lag screws. Kubiak et al. [25] in the first {{study found that the}} two implants showed equivalent rigidity and stability and that the dual lag screw implant had a significantly stronger fixation than the single lag screw one when loaded to failure in an unstable intertrochanteric hip fracture model. In the second study, [26] the fixation strength of the Endovis dual lag screw construct was found to be significantly greater than the classic SHS when multidirectional dynamic forces were used for loading. Additionally, double-proximal-screw cephalomedullary nails demonstrated significantly less rotation compared to the SHS. These findings support Ingman`s assumption that the increased rotational stability of the femoral head fixation established by two proximal screws would decrease femoral head cutout [27]. However, in the clinical setting, these biomechanical advantages are not associated with a decrease in complication rates [28, 29]. Our results similarly show no significant difference in cutout between the two implants. There were 5 cases of proximal screw cutout for the SHS group and 3 cases for the cephalomedullary nails; these were all unstable fractures. Moreover, the presence of dual lag screws has introduced a new type of complication, the so-called “Z-effect” and reverse “Z-effect” phenomena [30, 31]. These are axial migrations of the lag screws forward or backward, one at a time or simultaneously and following the same or, more often, the opposite directions. Characteristic screw migration patterns have been described in the literature as the Z-effect involves the lateral migration of the inferior screw, varus collapse of the fracture, and perforation of the femoral head by the superior screw. The reverse Z-effect involves the lateral migration of the superior screw accompanied by the medial migration of the inferior screw. However, in practice, sometimes only one screw actually migrates during the postoperative weight-bearing period. On reviewing the 3 migrations in this series, it was noted these were not typical Z-effect phenomena. In one case, the superior <b>screw</b> <b>backed</b> out 3  weeks postoperatively, and in the other 2 cases, only the inferior <b>screw</b> <b>backed</b> out 3  months after operation. All these 3 patients had unstable trochanteric fractures with comminution of the medial cortex. The reasons for screw migration observed in some types of fractures are still pending and require further investigation [30]. To prevent the so-called Z or reversed Z effects, Lin [32] emphasized the importance of inserting the inferior lag screw as close as possible to, or even right on, the inferior cortex of the femoral neck in order to achieve better anchoring of the screws to a bony area of increased density, thus preventing screw cutout.|$|R
