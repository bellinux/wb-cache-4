In three test diets exogenous Alquerzim (1 g/kg), Roxazyme-G (0. 01 g/kg) and Feedzyme (0. 05 g/kg) were supplemented to control diet to observe whether addition exogenous enzyme improves efficiency of broiler production. The growth rate, feed intake, feed conversion, dressing yield and profitability were increased by addition of exogenous enzymes. The addition of enzyme is effective to overcome antinutritive effect of NSP on broiler performances. Enzyme {{had no effect}} on survivability.

Two feed management systems, extruded starter (Ruter) with possible early weaning and ground <b>starter</b> (<b>control),</b> were evaluated in thirty-two Holstein calves (16 females and 16 males).

Animal performance, clinical condition and stomach compartment weight did not differ between the treatments (P> 0. 05), despite weaning weight of animals receiving extruded starter being 5. 68 % higher than the control animals. Extruded starter stimulated cell proliferation of the ruminal epithelium (P < 0. 05), but did not affect the dimensions of the papillary rumen and omasum mitotic index (MI).

40|$|In this work, the {{microbiological}} and physicochemical {{differences of}} {{three types of}} low fat set yoghurts were studied, {{as well as the}} changes taking place during storage at 4 °C for 28 days. The first yoghurt was produced with yoghurt starters and exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis CCUG 52486 (CCUGY), the second with yoghurt starters and Bifidobacterium infantis NCIMB 702205 (NCIMBY) and the third with just yoghurt <b>starters</b> (<b>control</b> yoghurt). No significant differences were observed in terms of cell concentrations; for all three yoghurts, similar final cell concentrations were obtained for the yoghurt starter cultures (7. 5 log cfu g− 1) and the Bifidobacterium strains (7. 8 log cfu g− 1). Both Bifidobacterium survived well during storage, as in both cases the cell viability decreased by less than 0. 5 log cfu g− 1 after 28 days of storage. A decrease in pH followed by an increase in lactic acid was observed during storage for all three yoghurts, which was mostly attributed to the activity of the yoghurt starter cultures. The two yoghurts with the EPS producing Bifidobacterium strains exhibited lower syneresis than the control yoghurt. The lowest was shown by CCUGY, which also exhibited the highest storage modulus and firmness, and a well defined porous web-like structure in cryo-SEM. Examination of the micro-structure of the yoghurts using cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) indicated that the above observations were due to the interaction between the EPS and the milk proteins. Overall, the results indicated that the EPS producing Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis CCUG 52486 is the most promising strain, and can be used with yoghurt starter cultures to manufacture low fat set yoghurt with probiotic activities {{and at the same time}} enhanced physicochemical and rheological properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of Minulet, a new low-dose oral contraceptive on mood in two groups and to compare the effect with a control group of women not taking oral contraceptives (OC). The women participating were between 16 and 45 years of age. They completed the Amsterdam Mood Questionnaire (AMQ) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) three times. They were filled in before treatment started, after taking Minulet for one month and then again after three months. The questionnaires were filled in by a group of 200 women who had not taken OC before (starters), and by a second group of 370 women who were already taking OC (switchers). A group of 140 women who did not use any OC during the study served as a control group. These women also filled in the same questionnaires, both at the start, and after one and three months. As far as the AMQ was concerned, the switchers appeared in the initial measurement to have significantly higher scores (that is to say, a worse mood) for "tiredness", "depression", "moodiness", "anxiety" and "anger", than those of the <b>starters</b> and the <b>control</b> group. Moreover, the switchers had reduced scores (that is to say, an improved mood) on the AMQ-scales during their use of Minulet compared to their initial use of oral contraceptives. The scores of the <b>starters</b> and the <b>control</b> group on the AMQ-scales remained unchanged on all three measurements. It can be concluded from this that these groups felt as well as they did before. With regard to the SIP: in the initial measurement, the switchers appeared to have less favourable scores in the SIP categories "emotional behaviour", "social interaction", and "alertness" than the control group. Also, at baseline the switchers appeared to score less favourably than the starters with regard to "social interactions" only. The switchers scored more favourably on all mentioned SIP categories during their use of Minulet than at baseline. The <b>starters</b> and the <b>control</b> group continued to feel the same on all three measurements for the SIP. The results of the SIP were in accordance with the results of the AMQ. Based on this study, it was concluded that women who had not been taking OC and who started taking Minulet, continued to feel the same as they did before. Secondly, it was concluded that women who switched over from their usual OC to Minulet felt that their mood improved. © 1992...|$|R

Probiotic fermented sausages {{are safe and}} healthy meat products, which receive high commercial interest and growing market shares. Material and Methods: The physico–chemical characteristics (Protein, Moisture, Fat, Ash, Lactic acid value and pH), microbiological features (total aerobic, total mold and yeast and lactic acid bacteria count) and sensory evaluation (color, flavor, texture and overall acceptability) were analyzed after 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 45 days of refrigerated storage at 4 °C. Results and Conclusion: There {{was a significant difference}} (p≤ 0. 05) in moisture content, which decreased in all samples during the period of refrigerated storage. However, all other parameters such as protein, fat and ash increased. The lactic acid produced during the fermentation by lactic acid bacteria resulted in a decrease in the pH value of all samples, and improved sensory evaluation of the fermented sausage inoculated with Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus paracasei during the storage period. The best results were obtained in the fermented sausage inoculated with Lactobacillus paracasei in physico-chemical, microbial and sensory characteristics.
