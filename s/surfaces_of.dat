5|$|The {{high volume}} of {{visitors}} ascending the Borobudur's narrow stairs, {{has caused a}} severe wear out on the stone of the stairs, eroding the stones surface and made them thinner and smoother. Overall, Borobudur has 2,033 <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> stone stairs, spread over four cardinal directions; including the west side, the east, south and north. There are around 1,028 <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> them, or about 49.15 percent are severely worn out.|$|E
5|$|The skin of E. rabborum was {{granular}} in {{texture and}} predominantly a mottled brown. The upper <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the limbs was also mottled brown while the rear <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the thighs were a pale yellow. The chin and upper chest was distinctively brown, though {{the rest of}} the underside of the body was mostly white speckled with irregular brown spots. The eyelids and upper <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the limbs and back were studded with green flecks, the appearance and positions of which could be changed by the animal voluntarily (metachrosis). The irises of the eyes was uniformly reddish brown.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} it was known that the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing. This led to the use of very short-span, very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the control <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> many missiles, or in aircraft like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the bad}} weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> the plane, and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 16:30. The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E

The film of flowing water would theoretically prevent contaminants from settling into cracks and crevices.|$|E
