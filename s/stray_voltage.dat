25|$|<b>Stray</b> <b>voltage</b> is {{a result}} of the design of a 4 wire {{distribution}} system and as such has existed as long as such systems have been used. <b>Stray</b> <b>voltage</b> became a problem for the dairy industry some time after electric milking machines were introduced, and large numbers of animals were simultaneously in contact with metal objects grounded to the electric distribution system and the earth. Numerous studies document the causes, physiological effects, and prevention, of <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> in the farm environment. Today, <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> on farms is regulated by state governments and controlled by the design of equipotential planes in areas where livestock eat, drink or give milk. Commercially available neutral isolators also prevent elevated potentials on the utility system neutral from raising the voltage of farm neutral or ground wires.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, Californian Simona Wilson won a $4 million {{lawsuit against}} her power company after <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> from a {{substation}} near her house repeatedly shocked her {{and members of}} her family whenever they were in the shower.|$|E
25|$|In Boston, NSTAR Electric (formerly Boston Edison) {{has also}} had {{problems}} with hazardous stray voltages, which have killed several dogs during the 1990s. As a result, the City of Boston government started a program to detect, report on, and repair <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> hazards.|$|E
50|$|An Earth-leakage {{circuit breaker}} (ELCB) is a safety device used in {{electrical}} installations with high Earth impedance to prevent shock. It detects small <b>stray</b> <b>voltages</b> {{on the metal}} enclosures of electrical equipment, and interrupts the circuit if a dangerous voltage is detected. Once widely used, more recent installations instead use residual current circuit breakers which instead detect leakage current directly.|$|R
25|$|In any {{situation}} where energized equipment is in intimate electrical {{contact with a}} person or animal (such as swimming pools, surgery, electric milking machines, car washes, laundries, and many others), particular attention must be paid to elimination of <b>stray</b> <b>voltages.</b> Dry intact skin has a higher resistance than wet skin or a wound, so voltages {{that would otherwise be}} unnoticed become significant for a wet or surgical situation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stray</b> <b>voltages</b> {{created in}} {{grounding}} (earthing) conductors by currents flowing {{in the supply}} utility neutral conductors can be troublesome. For example, special measures may be required in barns used for milking dairy cattle. Very small voltages, not usually perceptible to humans, may cause low milk yield, or even mastitis (inflammation of the udder).So-called [...] "tingle voltage filters" [...] may be required in the electrical distribution system for a milking parlour.|$|R
25|$|In {{metropolitan}} areas, <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> {{issues have}} become a major concern. Many of these areas have large amounts of aging underground and aboveground electrical distribution equipment in crowded public spaces. Even a low rate of insulation failures or current leakage can result in hazardous exposure of the general public.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Navy's {{court of}} inquiry listed as one {{possibility}} the inadvertent activation of a battery-powered Mark 37 torpedo by <b>stray</b> <b>voltage.</b> This acoustic homing torpedo, in a fully ready condition and without a propeller guard, is believed by some to have started running within the tube. Released from the tube, the torpedo then somehow became fully armed and successfully engaged its nearest target: Scorpion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stray</b> <b>voltage</b> is the {{occurrence}} of electrical potential between two objects that ideally should not have any voltage difference between them. Small voltages often exist between two grounded objects in separate locations, due to normal current flow in the power system. Large voltages can appear on the enclosures of electrical equipment due to a fault in the electrical power system, such as a failure of insulation.|$|E
2500|$|Stray {{electrical}} currents {{caused by}} <b>stray</b> <b>voltages</b> can dissipate {{significant amounts of}} electrical power on a continuous basis. [...] This wasted power usually appears as heat, which can further degrade insulating materials, or even start electrical fires. [...] In rainy or damp conditions, the emission of visible steam from an electrical utility box, lighting pole, or manhole {{could be due to}} an electrical fault, and should be reported to the power utility company for investigation.|$|R
50|$|Small <b>stray</b> <b>voltages</b> {{may never}} be noticed and may only be {{detected}} with a voltmeter. Larger voltages may {{have a range of}} effects, from barely perceptible to dangerous electric shocks, or unintended electrical heating resulting in fires. Normally, metal electrical equipment cases are bonded to ground to prevent a shock hazard if energized conductors accidentally contact the case. Where this bonding is not provided or has failed, a severe hazard of electric shock or electrocution is presented when circuit conductors contact the case.|$|R
5000|$|A typical [...] "capacitive discharge" [...] {{blasting}} machine works by charging a capacitor from a battery, then discharging the capacitor through an external circuit, called the firing line, {{to fire the}} blasting cap. While the machine is idle, an [...] "internal shunt" [...] is connected across the output terminals so that any <b>stray</b> <b>voltages</b> induced in the external circuit, for example by nearby radio transmitters, are harmlessly short-circuited without triggering the blasting cap. The machines also typically include an [...] "abort" [...] feature to discharge the internal capacitor without firing the cap.|$|R
25|$|Equipment used {{to detect}} <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> varies, but common devices are {{electrical}} tester pens or electric field detectors, with follow-up testing using a low-impedance voltmeter. Electrical tester pens are hand-held devices which detect a potential difference between the user's hand and the object being tested. They generally indicate on contact with an energized object, if the potential difference is above the sensitivity threshold of the device. Reliability of the test can be affected if the user is at an elevated potential him/herself, or if the user is not making firm contact with a bare hand on the reference terminal of the tester.|$|E
2500|$|Consolidated Edison in New York City has had {{frequent}} {{incidents of}} <b>stray</b> <b>voltage,</b> including the electrocution death of Jodie S. Lane in 2004, while walking her dog in Manhattan. [...] In 2009, the Jodie S. Lane Public Safety Foundation [...] announced a publicly accessible website with maps showing thousands of reported <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> locations in New York City. [...] In addition, the Foundation sponsors the [...] "Jodie S. Lane <b>Stray</b> <b>Voltage</b> Detection, Mitigation & Prevention Conference", an annual meeting attended by power utilities and regulators {{from around the}} country to discuss <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> detection programs. [...] The Foundation also initiated and advocates regular mobile scanning by utility companies for <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> hazards.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stray</b> <b>voltage</b> is {{generally}} discovered during routine electrical work, or {{as a result}} of a customer complaint or shock incident. [...] A growing number of utilities in urban areas now conduct routine periodic and systematic active tests for <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> (or more specifically, contact voltage) for public safety reasons. [...] Some incipient electrical faults may also be discovered during routine work or inspection programs which are not specifically focused on <b>stray</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The drop is then {{connected}} to the house where a ground block protects the system from <b>stray</b> <b>voltages.</b> Depending {{on the design of}} the network, the signal can then be passed through a splitter to multiple TVs. If too many splitters are used to connect multiple TVs, the signal levels will decrease, and picture quality on analog channels of TVs past those splitters will go down requiring the use of a [...] "drop" [...] or [...] "house" [...] amplifier, or more crudely, multiple drops to the same building.|$|R
2500|$|For {{measurement}} purposes, the Earth {{serves as}} a (reasonably) constant potential reference against which other potentials can be measured. An electrical ground system should have an appropriate current-carrying capability {{to serve as an}} adequate zero-voltage reference level. In electronic circuit theory, a [...] "ground" [...] is usually idealized as an infinite source or sink for charge, which can absorb an unlimited amount of current without changing its potential. Where a real ground connection has a significant resistance, the approximation of zero potential is no longer valid. <b>Stray</b> <b>voltages</b> or earth potential rise effects will occur, which may create noise in signals or if large enough will produce an electric shock hazard.|$|R
25|$|The X-axis of {{the system}} was fed by a time base {{generator}} that pulled the beam {{from left to right}} across the screen. Normally a time base is triggered to start its sweep as soon as the signal from the transmitter is seen, but as noted above, this would not provide the accuracy required for this role. Instead, the time base was set to span the screen at a much faster rate, representing only a portion of the signal's overall flight time. Triggering the time base was accomplished using a very accurate oil-filled potentiometer which exponentially increased the charge in a capacitor bank until it reached a trigger value. A very complex grounding system was needed to ensure the accuracy of the voltages leaving the potentiometer system, as any <b>stray</b> <b>voltages</b> could overwhelm the signal.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) convened Working Group 1695 in {{an attempt}} to lay down {{definitions}} and guidelines for mitigating the various phenomena referred to as <b>stray</b> <b>voltage.</b> The working group attempted to distinguish between the terms <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> and contact voltage as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stray</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is defined}} as [...] "A voltage {{resulting}} from the normal delivery and/or use of [...] electricity (usually smaller than 10 volts) that may be present between two conductive surfaces that can be simultaneously contacted {{by members of the}} general public and/or their animals. <b>Stray</b> <b>voltage</b> is caused by primary and/or [...] secondary return current, and power system induced currents, as these currents flow through the impedance of the intended return pathway, its parallel conductive pathways, and conductive loops in close proximity to the power system. <b>Stray</b> <b>voltage</b> is not related to power system faults, and is generally not considered hazardous." ...|$|E

The <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> problem had claimed the lives of two dogs in the previous few months.|$|E

The voltage distribution studies during non-conduction and conduction modes of surge arrester are made. This study analyses effect of stray capacitance on non-uniformity in the voltage distribution and utilization factor. As the voltage distribution during non-conduction mode {{is important for the}} insulation design, the capacitance distribution for higher rated arrester is studied. The role of stray capacitance during conduction mode is also analysed by computing the residual voltage of arrester for current surges of different front times. The effect of steepness of current surges on voltage distribution is also discussed. Index Terms — surge arrester, <b>stray</b> capacitance, <b>voltage</b> distribution, FEM, utilization factor.

50|$|In any {{situation}} where energized equipment is in intimate electrical {{contact with a}} person or animal (such as swimming pools, surgery, electric milking machines, car washes, laundries, and many others), particular attention must be paid to elimination of <b>stray</b> <b>voltages.</b> Dry intact skin has a higher resistance than wet skin or a wound, so voltages {{that would otherwise be}} unnoticed become significant for a wet or surgical situation.Potential differences between pool water and railings, or shower facilities and grounded drain pipes are not uncommon as a result of neutral to earth voltages (NEV), and can be a major nuisance, but are usually not life-threatening. However, contact voltage resulting from damaged insulation on a current carrying conductor can be very dangerous, and can lead to shock or electrocution. Such a condition can arise spontaneously from mechanical, thermal, or chemical stress on insulation materials, or from unintentional damage from digging activity, freeze-frost seizing, corrosion and collapse of conduit, or even workmanship issues.|$|R
50|$|The {{nuances of}} the SP log are still being researched. In theory, almost all porous rocks contain water. Some pores are {{completely}} filled with water. Others have {{a thin layer of}} water molecules wetting the surface of the rock, with gas or oil filling the rest of the pore. In sandstones and porous limestones there is a continuous layer of water throughout the formation. If there is even a little permeability to water, ions can move through the rock and decrease the voltage difference with the mud nearby. Shales do not allow water or ion movement. Although they may have a large water content, it is bound {{to the surface of the}} flat clay crystals comprising the shale. Thus mud opposite shale sections maintains its voltage difference with the surrounding rock. As the SP logging tool is drawn up the hole it measures the voltage difference between the reference stake and the mud opposite shale and sandstone or limestone sections. The resulting log curve reflects the permeability of the rocks and, indirectly, their lithology. SP curves degrade over time, as the ions diffuse up and down the mud column. It also can suffer from <b>stray</b> <b>voltages</b> caused by other logging tools that are run with it. Older, simpler logs often have better SP curves than more modern logs for this reason. With experience in an area, a good SP curve can even allow a skilled interpreter to infer sedimentary environments such as deltas, point bars or offshore tidal deposits.|$|R
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the above definitions, the term <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> {{continues}} {{to be used by}} both utility workers and the general public for all occurrences of unwanted excess electricity. For example, at the annual [...] "Jodie S. Lane <b>Stray</b> <b>Voltage</b> Detection, Mitigation & Prevention Conference", held at the Con Edison headquarters in New York City in April 2009, which attracted the presidents of most major utilities from throughout the United States and Canada, the utility leaders continued to use <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> for all occurrences of unwanted excess electricity. The term contact voltage was used only once, possibly because [...] "contact voltage" [...] is generally the fault of the supply, network or installation company. Few companies are willing to openly discuss faults of theirs, let alone ones as life-threatening. It would seem that <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> is now the common term for all unwanted voltage leakage as it categorises the fault as part of normal operation, therein limiting liability.|$|E

2500|$|In New York City, a {{woman named}} Jodie S. Lane was {{electrocuted}} by a five-foot by eight-foot road utility vault plate energized by an [...] "improperly insulated wire" [...] in January 2004. In {{the coverage of the}} growing concern regarding the role of public utilities in electrical safety in the urban environment that her death triggered, both the media and the New York state regulatory agency used <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> was for neutral-to-earth voltage (NEV), but conceded that the notoriety of the Jodie S. Lane incident had caused <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> to be a term that is well recognized by the public. At that point, the regulator used <b>stray</b> <b>voltage</b> for any “"voltage conditions on electric facilities that should not ordinarily exist. These conditions may be due to one or more factors, including, but not limited to, damaged cables, deteriorated, frayed or missing insulation, improper maintenance, or improper installation."

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a robust current control {{strategy}} is proposed for a grid connected three phase inverter. Current controllers based on proportional-integral (PI) control {{may not always}} offer the superior tracking performance and harmonic rejection ability of robust controllers. Robust control design offers the ability to design a controller that is robust to modeled uncertainties in the plant. A typical inverter may experience fluctuations in its input DC voltage due to uncertainties in the DC power source. In {{the case of a}} solar-inverter, large fluctuations in the input DC voltage typically occur due to (i) varying irradiance levels and (ii) phase and ground faults. An inverter is usually designed to disconnect from service in case its DC <b>voltage</b> <b>strays</b> outside a pre-defined operating range. With a current controller that 2 ̆ 7 s robust with respect to fluctuations in the input DC voltage, the inverter 2 ̆ 7 s operating range could be widened, giving the user more flexibility when designing their system. A common step in the PI based current controller operation is the transformation of three phase signals to their direct-quadrature equivalent. With the use of the repetitive control strategy, the transformation step is no longer required. The repetitive control strategy is chosen because it can reject a large number of harmonics simultaneously, while providing a clean sinusoidal current waveform to the grid, even in the presence of grid load and/or voltage distortions. The repetitive control strategy is implemented via the internal model principle. Mu-synthesis based control is chosen to attain robust reference tracking in the presence of plant uncertainties. Uncertainty in the inverter input DC voltage is considered and expressed as a static uncertainty. By applying mu-synthesis principles, a feedback controller that simultaneously achieves robust stability and robust tracking performance is obtained...|$|R
