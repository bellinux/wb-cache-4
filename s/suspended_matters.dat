We examined the part of Escherichia coli (E. coli) associated with <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> in natural river water samples, using a combination of 5 -microm filtration and beta-D-glucuronidase (GLUase) assay to estimate the E. coli abundance and attachment. We observed that the fraction of particle-associated E. coli was positively correlated with <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> concentration. The settling rate of particle-associated E. coli was found to be positively correlated with <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> concentration for samples with <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> content lower than 50 mg/L. For samples with higher <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> concentration, the settling rate was quite constant (0. 066 m/h, on average).

Concentrations of SS and turbidity is low at the upstream and is becoming high around the midstream and downstream. The flow at the bottom layer affects the temporal changes of SS.

40|$|The {{flocculation}} mechanism {{dominates the}} fate of <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> in the estuarine environment. As it modifies the texture of <b>suspended</b> <b>matter,</b> flocculation thus affects <b>suspended</b> <b>matter's</b> transport and deposition. In {{order to understand the}} complexity of the flocculation mechanism, a case study was performed on two intertidal mudflats in the Scheldt estuary, a freshwater and a brackish water one. A one-year biweekly survey investigated the seasonal variation of flocculation, physical properties of <b>suspended</b> <b>matter,</b> organic <b>matter</b> content and <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> deposition in the intertidal area. The flocculation study includes floc’s shape, sphericity and microfabric, which properties are believed to be significant in the <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> transport processes in the estuary. This study shows that floc size as well as floc sphericity positively correlates with the change of organic matter. Moreover, it reveals that with increasing organic matter floc expands in a three-dimensional way. It is observed that relatively dense, small and elongated flocs appear in winter and spring periods, while loose, large and spherical flocs occur in summer time. The study also reveals that <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> transported as dense and fine-to-medium sand-sized flocs have a greater effect on its short-term deposition than loose and medium-to-coarse sand-sized flocs. As the measured <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> deposition is much higher in winter-spring than in summer time, it is deducted here that highly concentrated and relatively dense flocs contribute to fast deposition during winter and spring periods resulting in a compact layer, while loosely formed flocs likely lead to an easier erodible layer in summer time. This study concludes that floc density is a more determining parameter in <b>suspended</b> <b>matter’s</b> transport processes than floc size...|$|R

Samples of surface sediment and <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> were collected monthly. One sediment core was sampled at every {{station at the}} beginning of the sampling period. Cd concentrations in surface sediment and <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> were in the range of 0. 082 - 0. 904 mg kg- 1 and 0. 131 - 1. 057 mg kg- 1, respectively. The distribution pattern of Cd between sediment and <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> clarified Cd transport throughout the bay. The <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> acts as a collector and carrier of Cd in the bay. The higher concentrations in <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> were associated with lower concentrations in the sediments, which indicated that sediment resuspension has an important role in the distribution of Cd between sediments and <b>suspended</b> <b>matter.</b> The spatial distribution of Cd in the sediment and <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> of Kaštela Bay was in accordance with the prevailing circulation in the bay and indicated a partially anthropogenic origin of Cd.

In a region where few oceanographic surveys have been carried out, remote sensing has proven a powerful tool to track variations in the environment.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} technique for the treatment of leachate seeping from landfill of the Greater Agadir. Since its opening in 2010, the landfill produced huge quantities of leachate stored in large ponds because its pollution load does not allow the discharge into the receiving environment without adequate treatment. In this work, the aeration is used to reduce the pollution load of leachate seeping from fresh household waste in the Greater Agadir landfill. The treatment of effluents with high organic load by air injection is a technique that has given different results depending on pollution load and the chemical nature of inorganic constituents.

Deposited particles on PV modules interfere with illumination quality by both attenuating and scattering incident light (Qasem et al. 2011). There is a strong variation in particle shape, size and constituents of dust according to regions throughout the world. Similarly, the deposition patterns, rates and characteristics are found to vary dramatically in different localities. Ambient conditions such as humidity/moisture gradients, variation in wind velocity direction and magnitude and seasonal variations affect the properties of dust as well as deposition rates (Sarver et al. 2013). Dust particles attach onto a surface due to gravity, electrostatic charge or mechanical effects (wind or water droplets). After deposition, they are held by the variation of electrical potential near the surface (charge double layer), surface energy effects and capillary effects, in addition to gravity and electrostatic forces (Qasem et al. 2011).|$|E

40|$|The Almendares River, {{located in}} Havana city, {{receives}} the wastewaters {{of more than}} 200, 000 inhabitants. The high abundance of faecal bacterial indicators (FBIs) in the downstream stretch of the river reflects the very poor microbiological water quality. in this zone, the Almendares water is used for irrigation of urban agriculture and recreational activities although the microbiological standards for these uses are not met. Improvement of wastewater treatment is absolutely required to protect the population against health risk. This paper compares the removal of FBIs in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in this watershed: a conventional facility using trickling filters, a constructed wetland (CW) and a solar aquatic system (SAS). The results indicate better removal efficiency in the two natural systems (CW and SAS) for all the measured parameters (<b>suspended</b> <b>matters,</b> biological oxygen demand, total coliforms, E. coli and enterococci). Removals of the FBIs were around two log units higher in both natural systems than in the conventional one.

According to constructing a network-like “cold bridge ” as well as coordinating the layout of urban “hard underlying surface ” and “soft underlying surface ” which can promote urban “wind-heat ” movement, urban thermal climate environment may be improved by diffusing heat and solids effectively. As to suzhou, both city regional natural ecological pattern and main urban areal natural ecological environment structure reflect this philosophy.

Surveys of the seasonal variation of dispersed particle and non-dispersed particle characteristics, organic matter content as well as <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> deposition in two contrasting intertidal environments, one freshwater and one brackish water, in the Scheldt estuary were undertaken at fortnightly intervals for a year. The study of non-dispersed particle, i. e. floc, is mainly focused on floc size, shape, and microstructure, properties presumed to be significant in the <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> transport processes in the estuary. In this study, floc size as well as floc sphericity correlate positively with the change of organic matter content and reveal that floc grows in a three-dimensional way with increasing organic matter. It is observed that relatively condensed, small and elongated flocs appear in winter and spring periods, while loose, large and spherical flocs occur during the summer. The study also reveals that <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> transported as dense flocs with size range of ca. 105 – 250 µ m have a greater effect on its short-term deposition than loose flocs with size range of ca. 250 – 500 µ m. As the measured <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> deposition is much higher in winter–spring than in summer, it is deduced here that highly compact and relatively dense flocs contribute to deposition during winter and spring periods resulting in a stable layer, while loosely formed flocs likely lead to an easier erodible layer during the summer.

Based on the results of the research it was concluded that air temperature had low effect on changes in water quality during the year and that anthropogenic impact was far more dominant...|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{overcome}} the problem of disposal of colored high-strength wastewater released from the integrated pulp and paper industries. This particular research work is achieved by {{the reduction of the}} pollution caused due to the diluted chemicals, such as phenol, aromatic primary amines, carboxylic acids, and lignin etc., from the wastewater. Moreover, the same research work is greatly useful to conquer the problem of discharging colored wastewater generated from integrated pulp and paper industries. From this work, the color and COD reduction were achieved by maximum removal of pollutants, such as hydrated lignin (C=O), phenolic hydroxyl groups, chlorinated phenols, carboxylic acid groups, and inorganic functional groups, such as sulphur, phosphorous compounds, etc., which can be highly appreciable and valuable and applicable for the pulp and paper industries. Now, in the present treatment system of this integrated pulp and paper industry, there is no such type of chemicals added to the secondary clarifier unit. Its major role is only to remove the <b>suspended</b> <b>matters.</b> By the addition of the recommended coagulants and flocculants in secondary clarifier unit, the resource recovery is definitely possible. Also to solve the effluent problem, the large quantity of water may be absolutely reused for the other streams/waste facilities and it will not give harmful effects to the environment.|$|E

40|$|Thematic Mapper {{data were}} {{analyzed}} with respect to its capability for mapping the complex structure and dynamics of <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> distribution in the coastal area of the German Bight (North Sea). Three independent pieces of information were found by factor analysis of all seven TM channels: <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> concentration, atmospheric scattering, and sea surface temperature. For the required atmospheric correction, the signal-to-noise ratios of Channels 5 and 7 have to be improved by averaging over 25 x 25 pixels, which also {{makes it possible to}} monitor the aerosol optical depth and aerosol type over cloud-free water surfaces. Near-surface <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> concentrations may be detected with an accuracy of factor less than 2 by using an algorithm derived from radiative transfer model calculation. The patchiness of <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> and its relation to underwater topography was analyzed with autocorrelation and cross-correlation...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} use remote sensing in {{studying}} lake ecology lies in the capability of satellite sensors to measure the spectral reflectance of constituents in water bodies. This reflectance {{can be used to}} determine the concentration of the constituents of the water column through mathematical relationships. This work identified a simple linear equation for estimating <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> in Lake Naivasha with reflectance in Landsat 7 ETM+ image. A R² = 0. 94, n = 6 for <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> was obtained. Archive of Landsat imagery was used to produce maps of <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> concentrations in the lake. The <b>suspended</b> <b>matter</b> concentrations at five different locations in the lake over 30 year’s period were then estimated. It was therefore concluded that the ecological changes Lake Naivasha is experiencing {{is the result of the}} high water abstraction and the effect of climate change...|$|R
