5000|$|Billfish are {{exploited}} both as {{food and}} as fish. Marlin and sailfish are eaten {{in many parts}} of the world, and many sport fisheries target these <b>species.</b> <b>Swordfish</b> are subject to particularly intense fisheries pressures, and although their survival is not threatened worldwide, they are now comparatively rare in many places where once they were abundant. The istiophorid billfishes (marlin and spearfish) also suffer from intense fishing pressures. High mortality levels occur when they are caught incidentally by longline fisheries targeting other fish. Overfishing continues to [...] "push these declines further in some species". Because of these concerns about declining populations, sport fishermen and conservationists now work together to gather information on billfish stocks and implement programs such as catch and release, where fish are returned to the sea after they have been caught. However, the process of catching them can leave them too traumatised to recover. Studies have shown that circle fishing hooks do much less damage to billfish than the traditional J-hooks, yet they are at just as effective for catching billfish. This is good for conservation, since it improves survival rates after release.|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} component {{in determining the}} market value of fish is freshness, essentially the time period from capture to consumer. By shortening the time from harvest to landing, freshness can be improved and thus the market value may increase. The opportunistic nature of the marine capture fisheries sector, however, can encourage fishers to extend their time at sea to catch additional fish, while retaining already harvested fish. Here, fishers face a tradeoff: extending the duration of their operations, but compromising their ability to maintain product freshness. This study estimates the freshness premium for two fish <b>species,</b> <b>swordfish</b> and blue shark, landed at Kesennuma, Japan. Swordfish is generally destined for the raw market, while blue shark is first processed into several products. Our results suggest substantial heterogeneity in the freshness premium, depending on the likelihood of a product being consumed fresh or after processing. This work is an important investigation in the Kesennuma region, which suffered devastating damage from the tsunami following the Tohoku Earthquake...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} the effects of light toriline on seabird and target fish catches was carried out by two Brazilian NGOs (NEMA and Projeto Albatroz) and {{sponsored}} by the Secretariat of Aquiculture and Fisheries of Brazilian Government. In 2007, seventeen fishing trips on commercial pelagic longline vessels off southern Brazil (177 sets and 210, 270 hooks) were sampled by onboard observers alternating sets with and without light torilines. Torilines were made with light materials using nylon monofilament (branch line) or other light material as streamers. In general, the torilines were 40 - 70 m long and were fixed on a pole at least 4. 5 m above sea surface. The colorful streamers (0. 5 to 1. 5 m long) were attached to the line at intervals of 1 m. Overall, this study found that single light torilines reduced by 64 % the capture of seabirds, including species with the highest captures, i. e. Black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) and White-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis). The seabird capture rate was 0. 850 birds/ 1000 hooks in sets without toriline and decreased to 0. 308 birds/ 1000 hooks using a single toriline. The toriline design shall be improved because seabird capture rate reported is still very high considering the NPOA-Brazil and FAO recommendations.

40|$|Bycatch, defined here as catch {{discarded}} for regulatory, {{economic or}} personal reasons, from pelagic longline fisheries {{has contributed to}} wide spread population declines of sharks and sea turtles. Opportunities to reduce impacts in these fisheries occur throughout the fishing process and depend upon the fishing practices within fleets, and upon the behaviour of target and bycatch species. The overall objective of this thesis was to identify bycatch mitigation opportunities within the Canadian Atlantic pelagic longline fishery, which targets swordfish (Xiphias gladius), warm-water tunas (bigeye, Thunnus obesus; yellowfin T. albacares; and albacore, T. alalunga) and mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus). Bycatch includes common sharks and rays (blue shark, Prionace glauca; pelagic stingray, Pteroplatytrygon violacea), and endangered sea turtles (leatherback Dermochelys coriacea; loggerhead, Caretta caretta). Bycatch mitigation approaches such as shifting to circle hooks, increased the likelihood that shark bycatch would be released alive and with less severe hooking injuries. Shorter longline soak times also increased hooking survival among most of the common bycatch species. Shorter soak times would not decrease catch {{of the most common}} landed <b>species</b> (<b>swordfish),</b> but this shift in fishing practices could negatively impact fisher safety. Interviews with active longline captains revealed operational difficulties and unintended ecological impacts with proposed bycatch mitigation approaches. Longline captains also reported innovative uses of bycatch mitigation tools that could increase post-release survival of common bycatch species in this and other pelagic longline fleets. Finally, the combined analysis of fisheries observer data, qualitative data from fishers' knowledge interviews, and concurrent environmental data suggested that high blue shark catch rates were related to local oceanography - and did not reflect behavioural differences between blue shark and swordfish. Clearly, there are opportunities for bycatch mitigation within the Canadian pelagic longline fishery for swordfish and tunas. However, the process of interviewing pelagic longline captains revealed both interest in reducing bycatch, but also suspicion of research efforts. Such trust issues will need to be addressed in subsequent research as the combined use of fishery assessments, detailed oceanographic data, practical fishing knowledge, and on-the-water observations will be needed to decrease the amount of and harm to discarded bycatch...|$|E
40|$|The pelagic {{longline}} fishery {{in the western}} Atlantic Ocean targeting swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and tunas (Thunnus spp.) historically has a high frequency of interactions with marine mammals, particularly pilot whales (Globicephala spp.) in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) region. Typical {{pelagic longline}} hooks used in the MAB are size 16 / 0 2 ̆ 2 strong 2 ̆ 2 hooks that straighten at 250 lb of pull (113 kg), while alternative 2 ̆ 2 weak 2 ̆ 2 hooks straighten at 150 lb of pull (68 kg). Taking advantage of the size difference between large bycatch and relatively smaller target species, these 2 ̆ 2 weak 2 ̆ 2 hooks could be implemented as a bycatch reduction agent. To test this within the tuna fishery of the MAB, 21 sets were made using size 16 / 0 hooks, targeting yellow fin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (T. obesus) alternating strong and weak hooks. To test these hooks in a swordfish targeted area, nine sets were made using larger size 18 / 0 hooks within the Florida East Coast statistical area (FEC) and the Charleston Bump of the Southern Atlantic Bight statistical area (SAB) alternating strong and weak hooks. Size 18 / 0 strong hooks straighten at 350 lb (159 kg) of pull, while the weak straightens at 225 lb (102 kg). Results for the tuna targeted sets showed no significant reduction in total catch (a 3 ̆c 0. 05) of any target species, with weak hooks having higher trends for catch per unit effort (CPUE) for both tuna and swordfish. The only species to show {{a significant difference in}} total catch between strong and weak 16 / 0 hooks was the pelagic stingray (Pterplatytrygon violacea), with more individuals caught by the strong hook. The 18 / 0 hook sets had similar catches for all species except the target <b>species</b> <b>swordfish.</b> Swordfish CPUE trended higher for the strong hook, while also having significantly higher total catches.

40|$|Billfishes (marlins, spearfishes, {{sailfishes}} and swordfish) {{are one of}} {{the fastest}} and largest marine apex predators, and perhaps their most recognizable attribute is their bill or rostrum. The proposed function for this novel structure has ranged from hydrodynamic enhancement to defensive weaponry. However, the most supported hypothesis for its function has been linked to feeding. Billfishes have been observed to subdue their prey with their rostrum, either stunning or cutting them into pieces before ingestion. Due to their large body sizes and pelagic lifestyles a thorough investigation of the function of this structure has been logistically challenging. The goal of my dissertation is to investigate the role of the rostrum during feeding from a functional, mechanical and morphological standpoint. By the use of interdisciplinary approaches that blend engineering with biology, the function of the rostrum and billfish putative feeding behavior was investigated. By the use of different approaches that involve morphological characterizations, histology, estimation of performance measurements such as bite force and the investigation architectural tradeoffs from geometric morphometrics analysis, my dissertation aims to characterized the role of the rostrum in billfishes as a possible adaptation for feeding. Results showed that the rostrum in billfishes is mechanically capable of acting as a feeding weapon; continuous stress distribution along its length suggest no particular point that could lead to breakage during feeding. Finite element analysis, as well as bending experiments suggest feeding behavior may be species specific and strictly associated with rostrum morphology. While istiophorids may be morphologically suited to strike their prey {{with a wide range of}} motions, swordfish appear to be specialized from a mechanical and hydrodynamic standpoint to hit their prey with lateral strikes. Biting performance is relatively low in these top predators compared to other non-billfish species suggesting the rostrum may facilitate prey processing reducing the need for powerful biting. However contrary to my expectations rostrum length was not a predictor of bite force. Skull variation was evident among billfish <b>species.</b> <b>Swordfish,</b> the species with the longest rostrum, had the smallest head and the lowest relative bite force whereas blue marlin, the species with the stiffer, most compact rostrum, had the largest head and one of the greatest relative bite forces. The shortbill spearfish showed a relatively low bite force indicating predatory success in this species may be linked to an extended lower jaw that may facilitate a speed efficient jaw during prey capture. Whether the rostrum in billfishes has evolved as an adaptation for feeding, remains uncertain. However results from this study demonstrate that rostrum material properties, morphology and head architecture, in addition to relatively low biting performance in billfishes, favor a role of prey capture for the rostrum...|$|E

However the impact of its declining on marine life and ecosystems’ health is still quite unclear because of the difficulty in obtaining in situ data, especially in remote areas, like the Southern Ocean (SO). Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) proved to be a relevant alternative to the traditional oceanographic platforms to measure physical and biogeochemical structure of oceanic regions rarely observed. In this study, we use a new stage of development in biologging technology to draw a picture of {{dissolved oxygen concentration}} in the SO. We present the first results obtained from a dissolved oxygen sensor added to Argos CTD-SRDL tags and deployed on 5 female elephant seals at Kerguelen. From October 2010 and October 2011, 742 oxygen profiles associated with temperature and salinity measurements were recorded. Whether a part of the data must be considered cautiously, especially because of offsets and temporal drifts of the sensors, the range of values recorded was consistent with a concomitant survey conducted from a research vessel (Keops- 2 project). Once again, elephant seals reinforced the relationship between marine ecology and oceanography, delivering essential information about the water masses properties and the biological status of the Southern Ocean.

Future studies on the phylogeographic analysis of parasites suitable as biomarkers, and that of their fish host, performed on the same genes, will represent a further tool to be included in multidisciplinary studies on fish stock structure.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 39 - 43). v, 43 leaves, bound 29 cmCommercial {{fishing is}} a source of food for many types of seabirds, including albatrosses, but the importance of commercial fishing may vary between fishing methods, locations and affected species. Longline fishing in the north Pacific has expanded and affects Laysan Albatrosses and Black-footed Albatrosses through incidental bycatch, but the importance of longline fishing to the diets of these albatrosses is unknown. I analyzed fishery observer data to determine whether there are differences in fishery association behavior between Laysan and Black-footed Albatrosses and whether they differ in their amount of catch scavenging effort. I analyzed the digestive tract contents of tuna and swordfish longline-associated albatrosses to determine the fishery component of the albatross diets. Last, I analyzed the stable nitrogen isotopic compositions of longline associated birds and birds from colonies, as well as prey, to determine whether there might be broader, time-averaged effects on the albatross diets. Black-footed Albatrosses were more abundant around vessels than were Laysan Albatrosses and swordfish longline fishing attracted more birds than did tuna longline fishing. Black-footed Albatrosses also scavenged more swordfish catch, but not necessarily in greater proportion than expected. Laysan Albatrosses ate more fish bait and these two species also differed in their naturally acquired diets, with Laysan Albatrosses consuming more T. borealis. Albatross δ^ 15 N values differed between species and Black-footed Albatrosses differed between fishing methods, but it is unclear whether these differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions were fishery related because of overlap in the δ^ 15 N values among fishery and naturally acquired prey. Differential fishery resource use was evident, even when the albatrosses were exploiting the same resource, indicating that these species should not be given equal treatment in management decisions. Managers should consider the effect of longline fishing on the diets of Lay san and Black-footed albatrosses separately when making decisions that may change fishing practice. Black-footed Albatrosses should receive the most attention because they are the most affected <b>species,</b> while <b>swordfish</b> operations appear to have the greatest affect on the albatross diets...|$|R

Circle hooks have been promoted as an alternative to traditional J-hooks in pelagic longline fisheries to minimize bycatch mortality and injury to sea turtles and other marine wildlife. We evaluated the effect of hook type (circle hook vs J-hook) on the catch and length composition of target and non-target species in the Uruguayan pelagic longline fishery, for both American- and Spanish-style longlines. The sample unit used for comparing catches was two consecutive sections of the longline, each with a different hook type. For the American-style longline 39, 822 hooks were deployed in 108 paired sections, and for the Spanish-style 45, 142 hooks were deployed in 238 paired sections. The catch of albacore tuna, Thunnus alalunga (Bonnaterre, 1788), was higher with circle hooks with both gears. The catch of shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus (Rafinesque, 1810), also increased with the use of circle hooks, but only with the American-style longline. A decrease was observed in the catch of pelagic stingray, Pteroplatytrygon violacea (Bonaparte, 1832), with both gears, though it was significant only with the Spanish-style longline.

Hg exposure during pregnancy was studied by determination of total Hg in maternal hair and MeHg and I-Hg in maternal blood. Fetal exposure was assessed by MeHg and I-Hg in cord blood. Infant exposure was assessed by MeHg and I-Hg in infant blood and total Hg in breast milk. The concentrations of MeHg and I-Hg were determined by cold vapour atomic fluorescens spectrophotometry (CVAFS). Se concentrations in scrum or whole blood were analysed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry (GFAAS). The exposure to I-Hg was mainly as Hg 0 from dental amalgam fillings with low exposure from oilier sources. The concentration of I-Hg in cord blood was about the same as in maternal blood and increased with increasing number of maternal dental amalgam fillings. This shows that a substantial fraction of Hg 0 passes the placenta to the fetus before being oxidized to Hg 2 +. Also, I-Hg accumulated in the placenta in relation to the number of amalgam filings. The use of amalgam in dentistry is decreasing. MeHg exposure was highly dependent on fish consumption in general, but consumption of freshwater fish and certain marine <b>species</b> e. g. <b>swordfish</b> and tuna contributed more to the exposure. MeHg in cord blood increased with increasing maternal fish consumption. It was almost twice the concentration in maternal blood, supporting an active transport of MeHg across the placenta. Although, the average exposure to MeHg was relatively low, there was quite a range. A small fraction of women recruited because of high fish consumption had Hg concentrations exceeding the RfD (U. S. EPA) and PTWI (JECFA), corresponding to a daily intake of 0. 1 - 0. 2 µg MeHg/kg bw. Thus, {{there seems to be a}} fairly narrow margin of safety for increased risk of neurodevelopmental effects in fetus of women with high fish consumption unless they decrease their intake of certain fish species before being pregnant. It can be concluded that the recently updated dietary advisories on fish consumption for pregnant and lactating women and women planning pregnancy are justified and necessary as long as MeHg levels in fish are elevated. There was a good compliance to the dietary advisories regarding fish consumption during pregnancy but it is important that the advisories reach all women planning pregnancy, so they can decrease their consumption of certain fish species to avoid early fetal exposure. However, it is also important to emphasize the benefits of fish consumption. It is not known to what extent the positive effects of fish consumption may outweigh the negative effects of MeHg. Infant exposure to I-Hg and MeHg was lower than the prenatal exposure. Total Hg concentrations in breast milk decreased during the first three months postpartum. I-Hg seems to be more easily transported to breast milk than MeHg. Still, MeHg in breast milk may contribute more to infant exposure, because of higher gastrointestinal absorption. Infant blood MeHg decreased until 13 weeks of age indicating that infants are able to excrete MeHg taken up during fetal life, contrary to previous believes. No associations between Se and the different forms of Hg were observed in the placenta and Se did not affect the accumulation or transport of I-Hg or MeHg in placenta. The concentration of Se in serum decreased during the course of pregnancy. Probably, this can partly be explained by a prioritized fetal transport and need of Se for placental functions...|$|R
