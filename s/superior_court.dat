5|$|As part of Sarakreek's 1997 {{purchase}} {{of most of}} the L'Enfant Plaza complex, Sarakreek put the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel up for sale. Stanford Hotels Corporation, a privately owned firm, successfully bid $48 million for the structure. After a definitive sale agreement was reached in 1998, Sarakreek backed out of the deal. Hotels Stanford sued in the <b>Superior</b> <b>Court</b> of the District of Columbia. In Stanford Hotels Corporation v. Potomac Creek Associates (CAB-1413-99, 1999), <b>Superior</b> <b>Court</b> Judge Leonard Braman ruled that Sarakreek was not in breach of contract. Stanford Hotels appealed. Various motions delayed the appellate hearing until 2009.|$|E
5|$|Harrison County has a Circuit Court and a <b>Superior</b> <b>Court.</b> The <b>Superior</b> <b>Court</b> handles {{all adult}} {{criminal}} cases, small claims cases, traffic tickets, and infractions. The Circuit Court handles {{the rest of}} the cases in the county, including most of the divorce cases, juvenile matters, CHINS cases, civil proceedings, probate, estates, adoptions, civil commitments, and other civil cases. Judges in each court serve a six-year term. The Judge of the Circuit Court appoints a referee to handle family law cases.|$|E
50|$|The <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> {{of appeal}} hear appeals from the <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> of {{original}} jurisdiction, {{as well as}} from the inferior courts and administrative tribunals. The jurisdiction of the <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> of appeal are entirely statutory. The details of their jurisdiction will vary depending on the laws passed by the federal government and the particular province or territory.|$|R
50|$|Another {{peculiarity}} of California law is that traditionally, the <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> did not {{own their}} own buildings, and the state was not required {{to provide them with}} buildings, even though the <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> were part of the judicial branch of the state government. Rather, county governments were supposed to provide buildings and security for the <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> out of their own local budgets.|$|R
25|$|The <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> {{from the}} provinces and territories are courts of {{inherent}} jurisdiction, {{which means that}} the jurisdiction of the <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> is more than just what is conferred by statute. Following the principles of English common law, because the <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> derive their authority from the Constitution, they can hear any matter unless there is a federal or provincial statute that says otherwise or that gives exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The doctrine of inherent jurisdiction gives <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> greater freedom than statutory courts to be flexible and creative in the delivering of legal remedies and relief.|$|R
5|$|In April 2010, the Los Angeles County <b>Superior</b> <b>Court</b> denied Activision's {{motion to}} dismiss No Doubt's rights of {{publicity}} claims under California's anti-SLAPP law.

In May 2012, the <b>Superior</b> <b>Court</b> denied Activision's motion for summary judgment, though it also denied a preliminary injunction sought by the band. In October 2012, {{on the eve of}} trial, the case was settled for undisclosed terms.|$|E

25|$|Alaska's {{court system}} has four levels: the Alaska Supreme Court, the Alaska Court of Appeals, the <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> and the {{district}} <b>courts.</b> The <b>superior</b> and district <b>courts</b> are trial <b>courts.</b> <b>Superior</b> <b>courts</b> are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts only hear certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000.|$|R

5|$|Tran {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in Sacramento County <b>Superior</b> <b>Court</b> on November 6, 2015, charged of the attempted murder of Stone with an allegation of using a dangerous weapon, a knife. He did not enter a plea, was ordered to be held without bail, and was scheduled to return to court December 1, 2015. On December 1, 2015, Tran again appeared in the Sacramento <b>Superior</b> <b>Court</b> for a bail review hearing. This was subsequently postponed, with Tran held without bail. On January 7th, 2016, Tran was again denied bail, and another preliminary hearing was set for February 26th, 2016. At the February 26th hearing, Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz informed <b>Superior</b> <b>Court</b> Judge Geoffrey Goodman that his department plans to amend the original criminal charges against Tran, to include gang involvement in the assault. A gang involvement charge in California provides for additional penalties if the defendant is found guilty. Judge Goodman ordered another hearing to be held on March 30, 2016, {{to determine whether or}} not prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with the charges against Tran.|$|E
5|$|After the Court of Oyer and Terminer stopped sitting, a new <b>Superior</b> <b>Court</b> was created, and, in December 1692, Stoughton {{was elected}} by the governor's council to head the court, {{defeating}} Danforth by three votes. In early 1693, Danforth sat on <b>Superior</b> <b>Court</b> sessions conducted by Stoughton that continued to hear witchcraft cases, but without accepting spectral evidence. By this time the hysteria was dying down, and the court (sometimes with Danforth leading after Stoughton temporarily removed himself in protest at the ban on spectral evidence and other reforms imposed by Governor Phips. Danforth was sympathetic {{to the plight of}} individuals accused, relocating some of them to his lands west of Boston; Salem End Road in Framingham is part of the area where they settled.|$|E

50|$|Writs of {{prohibition}} {{are similar to}} writs of certiorari, as both types of writs allow <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> to manage inferior courts.

50|$|The <b>superior</b> <b>courts</b> are {{the lowest}} level of state courts in California holding general {{jurisdiction}} on civil and criminal matters.

As of 2007, the <b>Superior</b> <b>Courts</b> of California consisted of over 1,500 judges, and make up the largest part of California’s judicial system, which is in turn one of the largest court systems in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, Proposition 220 was {{approved}} by the state's voters; it amended the state Constitution to authorize judges in each county {{to decide whether or not}} to retain municipal or justice courts.
