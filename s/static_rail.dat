50|$|The Act {{does not}} apply to Victoria's most popular tourist and {{heritage}} railway, Puffing Billy. Instead, the Puffing Billy Railway is regulated by its own statute, the Emerald Tourist Railway Act 1977. The Tourist and Heritage Railways Act does also not extend to <b>static</b> <b>rail</b> exhibits such as the Williamstown Rail Museum.|$|E
40|$|Using {{multiple}} independent networks (also {{known as}} rails) is an emerging tech-nique to overcome bandwidth limitations and enhance fault-tolerance of current high-performance clusters. This report presents the limitations {{and performance of}} static rail-allocation approaches, where each rail is pre-assigned a direction for communication. An analytical lower bound {{on the number of}} networks required for rail allocation is shown. We present an extensive experimental comparison of the behavior of various allocation schemes in terms of bandwidth and latency, com-pared to <b>static</b> <b>rail</b> allocation. We also compare the ability of static and dynamic rail-allocation mechanism to stripe messages over multiple rails. Scalability issues of static and dynamic rail allocation are also compared. We find that not only <b>static</b> <b>rail</b> allocation necessarily consumes many resources, it also performs poorly com-pared to dynamic rail allocation schemes, in all the tested aspects. ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{multiple}} independent networks (also {{known as}} rails) is an emerging technique to overcome bandwidth limitations and enhance fault-tolerance of current high-performance clusters. We present and analyze various venues for exploiting multiple rails. Different rail access policies are presented and compared, including static and dynamic allocation schemes. An analytical lower bound {{on the number}} of networks required for <b>static</b> <b>rail</b> allocation is shown. We also present an extensive experimental comparison of the behavior of various allocation schemes in terms of bandwidth and latency. Striping messages over multiple rails can substantially reduce network latency, depending on average message size, network load and allocation scheme. The methods compared include a <b>static</b> <b>rail</b> allocation, a round-robin rail allocation, a dynamic allocation based on local knowledge, and a rail allocation that reserves both end-points of a message before sending it. The latter is shown to perform better than other methods at higher loads: up to 49 % better than localknowledge allocation and 37 % better than the round-robin allocation. This allocation scheme also shows lower latency and it saturates on higher loads (for messages large enough). Most importantly, this proposed allocation scheme scales well with the number of rails and message sizes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} {{abnormal}} rail corrugation problem of Beijing Metro Line 4, the track structural parameters comparative tests were carry {{out in the}} Metro Line 1, 2 and 4. Metro Lines 1 and 2 were chosen based of the Beijing Subway Survey and previous successful experiments. The comparative analysis was based off of <b>rail</b> <b>static</b> geometry, dynamic displacement and the lateral acceleration. The test results proved the stiffness of line 4 is weaker than line 1, 2 and suggestions on steps to prevent and correct the metro rail’s abnormal corrugation will be formulated...|$|R
40|$|Ruby on Rails (or just "Rails") is {{a popular}} web {{application}} framework built on top of Ruby, an object-oriented scripting language. While Ruby’s powerful features help make Rails development extremely lightweight, this comes at a cost: Ruby is dynamically typed, and so type errors in a Rails application can remain latent until run time, making debugging and maintenance harder. In this paper, we describe DRails, a novel tool that brings <b>static</b> typing to <b>Rails</b> applications to detect a range of run time errors. DRails works by translating Rails programs into pure Ruby code in which Rails’s numerous implicit conventions are made explicit. We then discover type errors by applying DRuby, a previously developed static type inference system, to the translated program. We ran DRails on a suite of applications {{and found that it}} was able to detect several previously unknown errors...|$|R
40|$|Rail pads {{are a part}} of rail {{fastening}} and have an important role for track strain. The main observed characteristics are a static stiffness and a dynamic stiffness of rail pad. At the moment there are two standards for determining static stiffness - the national document General technical conditions (Obecné technické podmínky - OTP) and the european norm ČSN EN 13 146 - 9. However, the metodology of static stiffness measuring is different. It means different values of <b>rail</b> pads <b>static</b> stiffness. In the OTP there are required values of static stiffneses for baseplate and baseplateless {{rail fastening}}. These requirements can't be applied on the static stiffness set by ČSN EN due to different measurement methodology. The aim of this thesis is to measure <b>static</b> stiffness of <b>rail</b> pads according to both methodologies and to check relation between the methodologies. The thesis proceeds from requirements of Správa železniční dopravní cesty - the national organization...|$|R

40|$|In strain {{measurement}} applications, the matched fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) {{method is}} generally {{used to reduce}} temperature dependence effects. The FBG parameters have to be {{designed to meet the}} requirements by the particular application. The bandwidth and slope of the FBG has to be balanced well, according to the measurement range, accuracy and sensitivity. A sensitivity enhanced strain demodulation method without sacrificing the measurement range for FBG sensing systems is proposed and demonstrated utilizing a pair of reference FBGs. One of the reference FBGs and the sensing FBG have almost the same Bragg wavelength, while the other reference FBGs has a Bragg wavelength offset relative to the sensing FBG. Reflected optical signals from the sensing FBG pass through two reference FBGs, and subtract from each other after the detection. Doubled strain measurement sensitivity is obtained by <b>static</b> <b>rail</b> load experiments compared to the general matched grating approach, and further verified in dynamic load experiments. Experimental results indicate that such a method could be used for real-time rail strain monitoring applications...|$|E
40|$|Train {{travel was}} once {{integral}} to the urban condition. Railway stations and rural depots were designed as machines for efficiency and it was within the station that one could escape {{the chaos of the}} city {{to become a part of}} the streamlined systematization of the industrial age. The terminal, it was thought, existed as an extension of the infrastructure of the railroad and as an integral part of the metropolitan corridor. As such, the architecture of the station re sided within the two dimensional network ascribed to the city and to the Western and Midwestern landscape. This thesis explores the amplification of a <b>static</b> <b>rail</b> station typology into a dynamic and multifaceted urban organism that is activated in its integration of multiple infrastructures operating at multiple speeds of travel [...] from airplane to high-speed train to subway to bus to car to pedestrian. Its mediation of multiple notions of arrival and departure results in a public space highly charged with activity; it is a connector, a facilitator, a non-place. The station program includes access to three underground subway lines (one proposed), on-grade bus connections, a secure high-speed airport train with baggage and ticket check-in, a portion of the pedestrian walkway which snakes underground through Chicago's loop, and a connection to the elevated rail. The exterior poche of the station building houses theaters and restaurants, shops, bars, and a hotel. Within this urban program hunkers a secure zone- waiting rooms and restaurants, newspaper kiosks and conference rooms linked hermetically to the secure airport connector train and ultimately to O'Hare Airport's gates. by Amanda Dickson.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the <b>static</b> position of <b>rails</b> in overhead industrial cranes is crucial to prevent failures and reduce undesired wearing effects due to wheels' contact. The traditional procedure used to verify the rail alignment is based on manual operations, which can be overcome with the automatic methodology described in this paper. Through the design and building of a motorized trolley, the optical target point identifying the rail position is able to move automatically under remote wireless control. The measurement procedure is carried out considering one rail {{at a time and}} the data acquired on the two rails are then analyzed together by a specific software. Additional sensors embedded in the trolley allow to provide different parameters about the rail positioning and about the conditions of its surface. The system can be integrated in a laser tracking total station and can be controlled by the operator from the ground assuring a time reduction during installation and maintenance operations and greater safety for the operato...|$|R
