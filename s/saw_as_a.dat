5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution. To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax. Taxpayers were angered, especially in southeast Pennsylvania, where the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out among rural German-speaking farmers who protested what they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> threat to their republican liberties and to their churches.|$|E
5|$|Another of Paco de Lucía's {{contributions}} was {{the inclusion}} of the cajón, an Afro-Peruvian instrument Caitro Soto exposed to him during his visit to Peru in the late 1970s. He understood this instrument, which he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> permanent solution to the need for percussion in flamenco. Along with Rubem Dantas, he added its percussive elements and it became an essential tool of contemporary flamenco and later, other international musical trends.|$|E
5|$|Barça's local rival {{has always}} been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, {{being one of the}} clubs granted royal patronage, was founded {{exclusively}} by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.|$|E

5|$|Escalating {{the scale}} of American {{intervention}} in the ongoing conflict between Ngô Đình Diệm's South Vietnamese government and the communist National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF) insurgents opposing it, Johnson deployed some 575,000 troops in Southeast Asia to defeat the NLF and their North Vietnamese allies in the Vietnam War, but his costly policy weakened the US economy and, by 1975, it ultimately culminated in what {{most of the world}} <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> humiliating defeat of the world's most powerful superpower at the hands of one of the world's poorest nations.|$|E
5|$|In 1814 {{under the}} new and ambitious Governor-General Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings, the Earl of Moira, the long-standing {{diplomatic}} disputes between British India and the Kingdom of Nepal, caused by expansionist policies of both parties, descended into open hostility. The British East India Company sought to invade Nepal not just to secure the border and to force the Nepali government to open trading routes to Tibet, but also for what Hastings <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> geo-political necessity to secure the foothold of the Company in the Indian sub-continent.|$|E
5|$|In New River, Cooley {{sustained}} {{himself as}} a salvager and farmer, cultivating and milling arrowroot. His fortune and influence grew: {{he became the first}} lawman and judge in the settlement, besides being a land appraiser. Local Indians held him responsible for what they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> misjudgment involving the murder of one of their chiefs, and attacked the settlement in revenge on January 4, 1836.|$|E

5|$|The British {{government}} had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which the British <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> joint discovery. On 9 November 1945, Mackenzie King and the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee went to Washington, D.C., {{to confer with}} President Harry Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. The three leaders agreed {{that there would be}} full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes for a full resumption of cooperation on nuclear weapons were disappointed. The Americans soon made it clear that this was restricted to basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|The label {{was founded}} in 1996 in Durham, North Carolina by {{musician}} Kaia Wilson and artist/UNC photography professor Tammy Rae Carland, aiming to redress what they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lack of feminist record labels at the time. As well as a range of recording artists, the label was also heavily involved in other events that promoted feminist thinking and music, such as the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival – which led to some controversy in 1999 – and various art showcases. Mr. Lady closed down in June 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team {{was responsible for}} casting, but Microsoft maintained a final say. The decision to use Alex Puccinelli instead of Steve Downes, the previous voice artist of Master Chief, was approved by Microsoft. The actors playing the cadets attended a boot camp before shooting to raise their fitness and accustom them to assault courses and rifle drills in their armour costumes. Cast members drove themselves to overexertion in the training, causing some to vomit, which they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bonding experience.|$|E
5000|$|The Austrian spiritualist, R.J.L. Steiner, in his article, The Fifth Gospel (1913), {{described}} what his [...] "clairvoyant consciousness" [...] <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> earthquake that hid {{the body of}} Jesus: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{term was}} coined by Charles B. Hunt, a USGS researcher, in his paper [...] "Geology and {{geography}} of the Henry Mountains region, Utah" [...] (1953). He was in fact describing an actual geological feature - a laccolith which he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> resembling <b>a</b> cactus - he was also, tongue-in-cheek, commenting on what he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> absurd number of [...] "-lith" [...] words {{in the field of}} geology.|$|R
50|$|Congress and the FCC {{selected}} these minority ownership {{policies to}} promote program diversity, which they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> important governmental objective. In addition, they would serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> constitutional {{basis for the}} preference policies.|$|R
5|$|Anne, however, {{expected}} {{kindness and}} compassion from her closest friend. Sarah was not forthcoming {{in this regard}} and frequently overpowered and dominated Anne. One major political disagreement occurred when Sarah insisted that her son-in-law, Charles Spencer, the third Earl of Sunderland, be admitted into the Privy Council. Sarah allied herself more strongly with the Whigs, who supported the Duke of Marlborough in the war; and the Whigs hoped to utilise Sarah's position as royal favourite. Anne refused to appoint Sunderland: she disliked the radical Whigs, whom she <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> threat to her royal prerogative. Sarah used her close friendship with the Earl of Godolphin, whom Anne trusted, to eventually secure such appointments, but continued to lobby Anne herself. She sent Whig reading materials to Anne {{in an attempt to}} win her over to her own preferred political party. In 1704, Anne confided to Lord Godolphin that she did not think she and Sarah could ever be true friends again.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of}} the Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{first year}} at Ohio State was a success. The Buckeyes won {{all but one of}} eight games in 1941; the only loss was to Northwestern University and its star tailback, Otto Graham. The final game of the season was a 20–20 tie with Michigan, which the school's {{supporters}} <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> good outcome given that Ohio State was a heavy underdog. The Buckeyes tied for second place in the Western Conference, a grouping of college teams from the Midwestern United States (now known as the Big Ten), and finished 13th in the AP Poll. Brown was fourth in balloting for national Coach of the Year.|$|E

5|$|Christopher Eccleston was {{the only}} one of the four lead actors who was already an {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of Moo, You Bloody Choir, much of Augie March's post-album touring {{involved}} supporting other bands. They played shows supporting The Aliens and Andrew Bird in the United States, before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House. Richards said the band's status as an opening act, rather than headlining their own shows, was something they <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> challenge—their intention was to win over fans who {{came to see the}} main act. However, he called the tour with The Aliens depressing; the bands played very different types of music, and the attendance at shows was small. Augie March later earned a prime slot at the 2008 Big Day Out.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered {{by large}} baggage trains. To some degree, this was turned into an advantage {{with the development of}} the tabor– military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it lost much of its military significance in the 18th century; the primary reason for this was a lack of sufficient funding.|$|E
5000|$|Later in 1946 he was demoted to 'Director - Talks Division' (or Assistant head [...] ) {{where he}} was restless: disliking the {{departmental}} in-fighting and what he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> increasing left-wing bias, he resigned in July 1947.|$|R
5000|$|Trouser Press <b>saw</b> Dirty <b>as</b> <b>a</b> big {{improvement}} over Goo, which the publication <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> [...] "failing miserably".|$|R
5000|$|Many people, {{including}} well-known baseball {{figures like}} authors Roger Kahn and Jules Tygiel, were upset {{by what they}} <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to punish political speech. Kahn canceled an appearance at the Hall and Tygiel called for Petroskey's resignation.|$|R
5|$|Enrollment dropped {{every year}} since the program's {{inception}} such that, when compounded by dropouts, the program was below half-capacity three years later. UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired. He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve what he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> communication issue. The adviser found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students {{to the point where}} they did not consider improvements upon that model. The adviser found students uninterested in the Experimental College's prospects.|$|E
5|$|Göring spent The Hardest Day at Karinhall {{with two}} of his top fighter pilots, Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland. He was decorating them with the Combined Pilots-Observation Badge in Gold with Diamonds after they had {{achieved}} much success in recent weeks. However, Göring took the opportunity to berate them over bomber losses and in particular, what he <b>saw,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lack of aggression in the Jagdwaffe. This criticism was not received well by the two men. Göring moved to quickly reconcile with them by ordering their promotion to Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) in command of their respective Geschwader (Wings). Göring felt a younger generation of combat leaders would help motivate the force. They were dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Seattle {{lost in the}} 2-legged 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League quarter finals by an {{aggregate}} score of 7–3 to Santos Laguna. The Sounders advanced to the finals of the Open Cup where they were defeated by Sporting Kansas City after penalty kicks. Schmid was furious over what he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> controversial call that handed Kansas City the victory. The team finished the regular season with a 15–8–11 record {{to make the playoffs}} where they advanced past Real Salt Lake to reach the conference championship series against the Galaxy. The team played defensive and suffered a 3–0 blowout in the first leg. They won on the return leg but lost on aggregate.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Kahn was {{a notable}} {{opponent}} of intracytoplasmic sperm injection, which he <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> experimental treatment {{not to be}} used by those with infertility, which was not serious enough to justify the risks he perceived the procedure as having.|$|R
