50|$|CTC did {{not believe}} it could meet its design goals for the CPU built from {{discrete}} TTL chips, and so Ray and Roche arranged dinner with Bob Noyce, the President of Intel, along with the President of Texas Instruments. Having pre-drawn the schematic for the microprocessor on two postcards, Ray gave one to each of his guests, and then made a bet: that the first company to build a computer on a chip (microprocessor) would forgive Datapoint their outstanding invoice. In part this was fiscally driven, as both <b>supplier</b> <b>debts</b> were large, and the annulment of either would mean that CTC could avoid a second IPO. Noyce initially questioned the approach, suggesting that development of the microprocessor would reduce Intel's sales of their dumb shift registers, but eventually agreed to the deal.

40|$|To date, {{corporate}} debt structure {{research has focused}} largely on national debt markets characterized by {{both public and private}} debts supplies. However, given that most national debt markets are characterized by the absence of public debt supply, the representative debt market of Spain is used to extend the research on {{corporate debt}} structure. A double-hurdle test approach reveals that the likelihood of using bank debt is positively related to firm size and information availability but negatively related to firm credit worthiness, while the likelihood of using non-bank private debt is positively related to firm size, growth potential, relative firm size and degree of leverage. Further, it is found that the amount of bank debt firms hold is positively related to firm size, growth potential, information asymmetry, and age but negatively related to information availability. The amount of non-bank private debt is positively related to firm size but negatively to growth potential and age. Moreover, it is found that though some roles of private debt providers are similar in the two distinct national debt markets, some roles of public <b>debt</b> <b>suppliers</b> are supplanted by non-bank private <b>debt</b> <b>suppliers</b> in a <b>debt</b> market bereft of public debt supply. ...|$|R

40|$|How do {{suppliers}} of finance {{make sure that}} firm managers enforce credit contracts, or do not invest in bad projects? This approach is missing in corporate governance research. To bridge the gap, we take steps towards developing a stakeholder perspective with the focus on examining the effects of creditor participation in a firm’s top decisions, in relation to board performance. Based on a sample of 154 questionnaire survey responses from Nigerian public firms, after relating all measured items to every construct in the statistical tests of exploratory factor analysis (EFA), we employed the use of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach for an in-depth analysis to estimate how well the stakeholder model fits the data. Building upon the construct creditor participation, {{and based on the}} proposed theory, we confirmed three dimensions – protect risk projects, protect collateral, and enforce contracts – to be confirmed measures of the latent construct. Significant creditors such as banks interfering in the firm’s board, especially in major board decisions, can reduce the potentials of managers to engage in high-risk projects. This has significant positive effects on the board’s role performance. However, items in the two dimensions – protect collateral and enforce credit contracts show weak measurements after EFA. The consequences are a new research agenda for boards has been set. The agenda will focus on the <b>suppliers</b> of <b>debt</b> finance, as significant to the firms akin with their equity shareholders’ counterparts. This will create knowledge; reduce conflicts of interests, and exploitation; and ensure equitable distribution of firm value. The approach exposes firms to access more inclusive strategic inputs especially on important and less risky projects that will yield better margin and sustainable growth. This may stimulate further debates on other stakeholder researches that are vital to debt financiers and boards, thus becoming actionable for practitioners in decisions on projects...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{two fundamental}} puzzles about trade credit: {{why does it}} appear to be so expensive. and why do input suppliers engage {{in the business of}} lending money. Both questions are answered analysing the interaction between the financial and the industrial aspects of the supplier-customer relationship. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we present a model where, in a context of limited enforceability of contracts, suppliers have a comparative advantage over banks in lending to their customers because they hold the extra threat of stopping the sup-ply of intermediate goods. Suppliers also act as lenders of last resort, providing insurance against liquidity shocks that may endanger the survival of their cus-tomers. The relatively high implicit interest rates of trade credit result from the existence of default and insurance premiums. The two necessary elements for these two roles of suppliers are the existence of some relationship surplus that is split between suppliers and customers, and an environment where debt repayment is difficult to enforce. Then we extend the analysis to suppliers who are themselves financially con-strained. Under certain assumptions, the optimal financial contract that arises is similar to a standard factoring contract. The interest rates paid by suppliers and customers in this contract depend on their own creditworthiness, but also on the characteristics of their commercial relationship. Finally the implications of the basic model are examined empirically using both parametric and non-parametric techniques on a panel of UK firms. The results show some regularities that had not been identified in previous literature and that support the role of <b>suppliers</b> as <b>debt</b> collectors and insurance providers of the basic model. In particular these results are consistent with the idea of trade credit being related to the existence of either some degree of technological specificity or a relationship surplus that takes time to build. Evidence is also found of the support of suppliers to their customers experiencing some form of liquidity shock...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} by three chapters. In Chapter 1 I use {{detailed information on}} labor composition of Brazilian firms to show that even though exporting firms are similar in the workforce composition, it is non- observable worker characteristics that matter the most to determine whether an exporting firm will become a future successful exporter. I find that the prior working experience of workers is a key component in determining a firm's future export success. Results show that hiring away workers with previous experience in other exporting companies has {{a significant effect on}} a firm's future probability of becoming a successful exporter. Furthermore, hiring these key workers increases a firm's market penetration and a firm's number of exporting destinations. In Chapter 2 I use detailed firm level data on a firm's external sources of financing and I show that firms with higher debt balances export less and grow at lower rates, especially during periods of economic distress. I use this data to provide evidence that financing constraints affect firms' extensive and intensive margins of exports. However, only a subset of financing constraints are related to exports. I show that short-term debt with domestic banking institutions is negatively related to a firm's extensive and intensive margins of trade, while <b>supplier</b> trade <b>debt</b> has a positive effect on a firm's intensive margin of exports. I show that firms located in sectors with higher dependence on external financing exhibit higher growth in their intensive margins of exports. In Chapter 3 I focus my attention a transport costs. In this chapter, I focus my attention on air cargo shipping and I extend the Melitz (2003) firm heterogenous model of trade by including a cargo shipping sector characterized by a oligopolistic competition structure with fixed entry costs. The market competition in air cargo shipping enables me to derive endogenous pricing rules that vary with the number of cargo carriers per route. Empirical results with US cargo data confirm the importance of competition in air cargo shipping price...|$|R
40|$|A {{symbiotic}} {{business relationship}} exists between materials suppliers and construction contractors. Specifically, contractors must continually purchase materials on credit to complete projects, whilst suppliers {{exist on the}} profits made from selling such. In the absence of this indirect source of liquidity, many construction projects would not be completed. Despite the supplier incurring substantial financial risk when furnishing credit to contractors, there are currently no definitive or accurate means with which to measure and predict this risk. This paper presents {{the findings of a}} survey conducted throughout the UK that aimed to model the utility value that material suppliers experience when they interact with contractors. It is proposed that the (novel and new) methodological approach used will enable materials suppliers to enhance their decision-making process and subsequently boost business performance (and most notably, profit). Such improvements could ultimately be passed directly to good debtors in terms of lower materials costs, better delivery specifications, and improved creditor staff motivation. Subsequently, this could translate as more economical construction projects for clients. The paper concludes with direction for future works that would develop a more user-friendly software package and subsequently implement the research findings throughout the construction industry.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the extent of access to debt finance and its determinants among SMEs in Uganda using the “Applied and Received” approach (ARa). In addition, supplementary to the main research objective, the thesis had two subsidiary objectives; firstly, to examine the effect of measuring access to debt finance by comparing two approaches, the “Received” (Ra) and “Applied and Received” (ARa), to the extent and determinants of access to debt finance. Secondly, to examine if there are significant differences in the way SMEs and financiers perceive effective lending rates, transaction costs, firm age, firm size, industry, financial transparency, collateral, education, entrepreneurial experience and gender as determinants of access to debt finance. To achieve the {{main objective}} and two subsidiary objectives, a survey was conducted based on a population of 128, 000 SMEs, out of which a sample of 384 was considered appropriate, according to random tables by Sekaran and Bougie (2013). From the financiers’ side, a population of 25 commercial banks, 22 insurance companies, 50 registered trade credit suppliers and a sample of 10 credit service bureaus, 10 MFIs and 10 SACCOs were used {{for the purposes of this}} study. The response rate was 57 % from the SMEs and 62 % from the financiers. In terms of analysis, the extent of access to debt finance was examined using descriptive statistics. In addition, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was employed to determine the relationship between access to debt finance and its determinants and binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the strength of the relationships between access to debt finance and the determinants. Overall, the model explained up to 73. 3 % of the variation in access to debt finance. Finally, the independent samples t-test was used to determine if there were significant variations and consensus between SMEs and financiers with regard to the determinants of access to debt finance. The findings of the study contribute to the literature in a number of ways; first, the conventional measures (“Received”, “Loan size” and “Frequency of acquisition” approaches) have understated the extent of access to debt finance, while the “Applied and Received” approach (ARa) is a superior measure of the extent of this among SMEs in Uganda. This is because the ARa focuses on active borrowers and not discouraged borrowers or those SMEs that have voluntarily excluded themselves from external credit. Second, the study provides empirical evidence of the determinants of access to debt finance for the first time in Uganda where such evidence was previously unknown. Third, the study documents significant differences in the perceptions of the determinants of access to debt from the SMEs and <b>suppliers</b> of <b>debt</b> finance. However, the ARa has limitations; for example, the degree to which discouraged borrowers can be excluded is open to debate. This is because, unlike voluntary excluded borrowers (not seeking funding at all), discouraged borrowers want debt but do not seek it because they think it will not be granted. The most important implication of this research to policy makers and academics is the methodology of operationalising access to debt finance using the ARa. This approach deals with voluntary exclusion and reports higher rates of access to debt finance compared to the Ra, which helps policy makers to estimate the financing gap among SMEs in Uganda. Likewise, the ARa includes additional determinants of access to debt finance variables, which suggests that SMEs seeking finance are aware of the factors that financiers consider in the credit scoring process. Secondly, for SMEs and financiers, the findings concerning the consensus and variations in the determinants of access to debt finance are of great value to educate policy makers on the information gap existing between the demand and supply sides. Knowledge of the determinants of access to debt finance from the financiers’ side will improve access among SMEs in Uganda because financiers play a pivotal role in the issue of this finance...|$|R
