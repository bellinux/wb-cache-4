The main ways of commercialization of the <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> creative achievements are: their implementation in enterprise?s production and transfer of rights on the objects of intellectual property.

This indicates that the eastern provinces are more profoundly integrated into the global industrial chain through the processing trade, {{while most of the}} western provinces are not yet integrated into the global industrial chain, but have instead become the suppliers of raw materials for the eastern provinces.

As a result, the depletion region can be increased and the quantum efficiency can be improved. The influence of some structure parameters {{on the performance of}} the new device is investigated. Through the simulation calculation, it is found that the quantum efficiency increases with the decrease of the barrier height between the metal electrode and the p(-) -GaN layer, and it is also found that the quantum efficiency can be improved by reducing the thickness of the p(-) -GaN layer. To fabricate the new photodetector with high performance, we should employ thin p(-) -GaN layer as the active layer and reduce the Schottky barrier height.

Here we report petrological and geochemical data on magmas erupted 4. 7 - 0. 3 Myr ago in central and northern Tibet, demonstrating that they were generated by partial melting of crustal rocks at temperatures of 700 - 1, 050 degrees C and pressures of 0. 5 - 1. 5 GPa. Thus Pliocene-Quaternary melting of crustal rocks occurred at depths of 15 - 50 km in areas where the LV-HCZs have been recognized. This provides new petrological evidence that the LV-HCZs are sources of partial melt. It is inferred that crustal melting played a key role in triggering crustal weakening and outward crustal flow in the expansion of the Tibetan Plateau. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E

Firstly, the integration of non-humans to the analysis (Latour, 2006) is relevant in the study of nature sports because physical entities transform the action and involve specific associations. Then it is a particular epistemological positioning that shakes the dichotomies up and givesimportance to the reflexive activity of actors. Finally, understanding the development of collectives is useful for the study of nature sports.

Two sets of novel multi-cavity transmissive Gires-Tournois etalon (MCT-GTE) composed of cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometer loops {{are added to the}} two arms of Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) respectively, which forms a new MZI, i. e., MZGTI. MZGTI has the same characteristics as Michelson-Gires-Tournois interferometer (MGTI), which is suitable for dense wavelength division multiplexing systems. The super-high extinction ratio comb filter (SHERCF) we proposed has good passband flatness and wide bandwidth (passband or stopband bandwidth) when the extinction ratio is fairly high, which is quite superior to MGTI or MZGTI. For the severe chromatic dispersion problems, we propose a set of multi-cavity ring resonator (MC-RR) as a tunable dispersion compensator (TDC) for MZGTI, which is a set of cascaded ring resonators.

Spectrum and chromatic dispersion of the HERMPF are given under ideal conditions, which show {{that such a}} filter has excellent performance. Analysis on fabrication tolerances is given as well, focusing on {{factors such as the}} length mismatch and loss which degrade the spectral and chromatic dispersion performances of HERMPF in practice. A single-cavity ring resonator is inserted into either arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to form a Mach-Zehnder ring resonator interferometer (MZRRI), which is an infinite-impulse-response half-band filter with two complementary channels (even and odd channels). MZRRI is the core element of HERMPF which determines the spectral performance. A set of multicavity Gires-Tournois etalon composed of cascaded Sagnac loop mirrors is proposed as the tunable dispersion compensator and fully reflective mirror in HERMPF.

Together these features pose diverse, important, and exciting challenges for tomorrow’s teachers and educational establishments. With backgrounds in molecular life science research and secondary life science teaching, we (LT and CJR, respectively) bring different experiences, perspectives, concerns, and awareness of these issues. Taking the nature of the discipline as a starting point, we highlight important facets of molecular life science that are both characteristic of the domain and challenging for learning and education.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of both inter-cultivar and intra-cultivar competition oil the growth of three spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars released in different periods that had different root:shoot ratios, differed in water extraction from dry soil, and differed in height. Two water regimes were imposed to compare competitive effects under irrigated and rainfed conditions. Our main hypotheses were that the different distribution of biomass between shoot and root in old and new wheat cultivars Will alter their competitive ability, that differences in root size will alter their competitive ability through different water uptake patterns, and differences in the gradient for water uptake will alter their competitive ability in different environments by enabling water extraction from drier soil. In monoculture, the recent cultivars had significantly more grain yield and higher water use efficiency for grain (WUEG,) than the old cultivar. Under the two water regimes the old cultivar had more root biomass, and extracted water in deeper soil layers. whereas the modern cultivars extracted more water in dry soil layers. The old cultivar benefited from inter-cultivar competition in terms of both grain yield and above-ground biomass accumulation {{at the expense of the}} modern cultivars, Which showed significantly reduced growth ill mixtures compared to in monoculture. Our study Suggested that the below-ground competitive ability of cultivars may have a negative relationship with the grain yield and WUEG in monoculture. The yield superiority of modern and recent cultivars was mostly due to increased above-ground biomass, kernel number and WUEG and a smaller proportion of root biomass. Our results demonstrate that inter-plant competition is an important factor affecting spring wheat productivity in contrasting environments, but the extent and intensity of these effects depend oil the adaptation of root traits to available soil water. Reducing root growth redundancy and enhancing the ability to deplete more soil water are clearly adaptive features for wheat for water-limited conditions. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B. V.

50|$|Science {{acknowledges}} reason, empiricism, and evidence, while religions include revelation, {{faith and}} sacredness whilst also acknowledging philosophical and metaphysical explanations {{with regard to}} the study of the universe. Both science and religion are complex social and cultural endeavors that vary across cultures and have changed over time. Most <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>innovations</b> prior to the scientific revolution were achieved by societies organized by religious traditions. Elements of the scientific method were pioneered by ancient pagan, Islamic, and Christian scholars. During the Islamic Golden Age foundations for the scientific method were laid by Ibn al-Haytham. Roger Bacon, who is often credited with formalizing the scientific method, was a Franciscan friar. Hinduism has historically embraced reason and empiricism, holding that science brings legitimate, but incomplete knowledge of the world. Confucian thought has held different views of science over time. Most Buddhists today view science as complementary to their beliefs. While the classification of the material world by the ancient Indians and Greeks into air, earth, fire and water was more philosophical, medieval Middle Easterns used practical and experimental observation to classify materials.|$|R
