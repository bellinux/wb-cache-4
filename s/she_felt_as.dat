5|$|M.I.A.'s {{commentary}} on the oppression of Sri Lankan Tamils, Palestinians and African Americans has drawn praise and criticism. The United States has restricted her access {{into and out of}} the country during her career since the release of her debut album. M.I.A. notes that the voicelessness <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a child dictated her role as a refugee advocate and voice lender to civilians in war during her career.|$|E
25|$|VIDA: Women in Literary Arts was co-founded in 2009 by poets Erin Belieu and Cate Marvin. Belieu and Marvin, {{because they}} are both poets and teachers, had been acquainted with one another for some time. However, due to there being {{a small amount of}} {{opportunities}} for women in the literary community, they perceived themselves as being in competition with one another. That perception changed when Marvin sent Belieu an email detailing how isolated <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a female writer, and questioning why there was no feminist conversation happening in literary circles. Belieu then forwarded the email to hundreds of writers, and it received a huge response. Based on that response, Belieu and Marvin decided to co-found VIDA: Women in Literary Arts.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of PCD (2005), {{and over the}} course of two years (2005–07), Scherzinger recorded 75-100 songs for Her Name Is Nicole, her planned solo debut album. [...] Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity as she began work on her own music. She stated that she enjoyed collaborating with many different artists, and that although she had been writing songs for over ten years, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if she was at a different level while working with such A-list writers and producers. Following the moderate success of [...] "Baby Love", the complete lack of success of the singles such as [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] and numerous push backs, Scherzinger decided to put the release of the on hold. She then returned her focus back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album. Scherzinger cited that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if the songs were more suited as a Pussycat Dolls song than her own.|$|E

500|$|Excited by the experience, Goldman refined {{her public}} persona during {{subsequent}} engagements. Quickly, however, {{she found herself}} arguing with Most over her independence. After a momentous speech in Cleveland, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though she had become [...] "a parrot repeating Most's views" [...] and resolved to express herself on the stage. Upon her return in New York, Most became furious and told her: [...] "Who is not with me is against me!" [...] She left Freiheit and joined with another publication, Die Autonomie.|$|E
500|$|... "My Hands" [...] was {{selected}} as the official theme song for the English version of the video game Final Fantasy XIII. Lewis decided to accept the offer of her track being used as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though she connected with the video game's female protagonist, Lightning. The song garnered a mixed response from music critics, who described it as forgettable, despite noting that Lewis performs the song undeniably well. In March 2010, [...] "My Hands" [...] debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 145.|$|E
500|$|In Singin' and Swingin, Angelou {{examines}} many of {{the same}} subjects and themes in her previous autobiographies including travel, music, race, conflict, and motherhood. Angelou depicts the conflict <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a single mother, despite her success as a performer as she travels Europe with the musical Porgy and Bess. Her depictions of her travels, which take up 40percent of the book, have roots in the African-American slave narrative. Angelou uses music and musical concepts throughout Singin' and Swingin'; McPherson calls it Angelou's [...] "praisesong" [...] to Porgy and Bess. Angelou's stereotypes about race and race relations are challenged as she interacts more with people of different races. During the course of this narrative, she changes her name from Marguerite Johnson to Maya Angelou for professional reasons. Her young son changes his name as well, from Clyde to Guy, and their relationship is strengthened as the book ends.|$|E

500|$|Talking {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with Joel Little, Lorde said that Little's refining of her [...] "raw potential {{to end up}} with [...] " [...] {{was one of the best}} aspects of him. She also views Little as [...] "the only one who was working with electronic music in the way [...] was interested in at the time". Lorde details that her songs are shaped by her lyrics, which <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "more cohesive way of working." [...] She said, [...] "I tend to start with lyrics– sometimes the seed of a song will just be a word that I thought was rad, one that summed up a particular idea I'd been trying to pin down." [...] Nonetheless, she points out that the songwriting process of [...] "Tennis Court" [...] was different to how she normally writes a song: the lyrics are built on the instant music and beat.|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} cover songs, which play a {{prominent}} role in Carlile's live act, represented what she typically includes in a concert. Carlile said that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though she were a member of The Beatles when the audience stood and loudly sang the words to [...] "Dreams", and that [...] "Before It Breaks" [...] and [...] "I Will" [...] were emotionally the most difficult to perform. Carlile jokes with the audience between songs, which she felt was well-received, and requests their participation in three-part harmony during [...] "Turpentine". During the concert, the band experienced technical difficulties, and a bra thrown from the audience, intended for the drummer, hit Carlile on stage. Carlile said the [...] "rock 'n' roll symphony album" [...] was [...] "the meeting of two worlds, two different kinds of artists who got together for completely different reasons." [...] She has said that the album is the one she and her band are most proud of, believing it truly represents their live act.|$|E
500|$|Adele, who {{had just}} {{released}} her second album 21, admitted that initially she was a [...] "little hesitant" [...] about agreeing to write a Bond theme song. On meeting with the Skyfall film crew, the singer had told Skyfall director Sam Mendes that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though {{she was not the}} person that they were looking for because [...] "my songs are personal, I write from the heart". Mendes simply replied [...] "just write a personal song", telling her to use Carly Simon's [...] "Nobody Does It Better" [...] from The Spy Who Loved Me as an inspiration. Adele left the meeting with the script of Skyfall and, upon reading it, decided that it was a [...] "" [...] as she [...] "fell in love" [...] with the film's plot. Producer Paul Epworth, who had worked with Adele on 21, was brought in to help her write the song. Adele stated that she enjoyed working to a brief and set of guidelines, even though it was something she had never done before.|$|E

500|$|On February 21, 2007, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that ABC was pursuing a spin-off medical drama television series for Grey's Anatomy featuring Walsh's character, Montgomery. Subsequent reports confirmed the decision, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of Grey's Anatomy {{would serve as}} a backdoor pilot for the proposed spin-off. The cast of Grey's Anatomy was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them. Pompeo commented that <b>she</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>as</b> the star, she should have been consulted, and Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Stevens. The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3, 2007 sees Montgomery take a leave of absence from Seattle Grace Hospital, to visit her best friend from Los Angeles, Naomi Bennett (Merrin Dungey, later Audra McDonald), a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist. While in Los Angeles, she meets Bennett's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center. The two-hour broadcast entitled [...] "The Other Side of This Life" [...] served as the twenty-second and twenty-third episodes of the third season, and was directed by Michael Grossman, according to Variety. The cast included Amy Brenneman, Paul Adelstein, Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Chris Lowell, and Merrin Dungey.|$|E
500|$|Azalea {{wrote the}} song with The Invisible Men, Trocon Markous Roberts and Natalie Sims. Sims stated that she, FKi, and Azalea had {{initially}} met back in 2008, but lost touch when Azalea moved to Los Angeles. The track specifically {{drew inspiration from}} a period when Azalea suffered from depression, and {{dropped out of high}} school to become a domestic worker with her mother. Azalea saved money for a flight ticket to Miami and left Mullumbimby, New South Wales before she turned 16—an event referenced in the song's lyric [...] "No money / No family / 16 in the middle of Miami" [...] which Azalea felt [...] "said it all". For this reason, she chose to write and record [...] "Work" [...] in isolation in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, with no phone reception, visitors or interruptions. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a location it would help her recall the personal struggles she wanted to write about on the song. Azalea also believed that her best output was produced when in an environment outside her comfort zone. Her vocals were recorded at Rockfield Studios and Monnow Valley Studios. Sims, who abandoned four tour dates in order to fly over to Britain to join Azalea, commented on her own involvement in the song that [...] "Fresh out of a breakup and depressed I spent a month in London in a small 10×10 studio somedays writing and writing and writing… Regardless of whether or not you like the content the song told Iggy's true story of struggle sacrifice and hard work as an artist." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 21, 2007, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that ABC was pursuing a spin-off medical drama television {{series for the}} series featuring Kate Walsh's character, Addison Montgomery. Subsequent reports confirmed the decision, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of Grey's Anatomy {{would serve as a}} backdoor pilot for the proposed spin-off.

While in Los Angeles, she meets Bennett's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center and even becomes the clinic's obstetrician-gynecologist for the day. The two-hour broadcast served as the twenty-second and the twenty-third episodes of the third season, and was directed by Michael Grossman, according to Variety. The cast included Amy Brenneman, Paul Adelstein, Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Chris Lowell and Merrin Dungey. ABC officially picked up Private Practice for its 2007 lineup on May 11, 2007. KaDee Strickland's character, Charlotte King, who would be introduced in the spin-off's first-season premiere, did not appear in the backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes. Also not present in the backdoor pilot was Audra McDonald, due to her character, Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress, Merrin Dungey. However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change. The premiere episode followed {{the second part of the}} season debut of Dancing with the Stars, and provided a lead-in to fellow freshman series, Dirty Sexy Money. Pushing Daisies, a third new series for the evening, rounded out the lineup as a lead-in to Private Practice. The series aired a total of six seasons.|$|E

2500|$|Ronstadt has {{remarked that}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> {{though she was}} [...] "artificially {{encouraged}} to kinda cop a really tough attitude (and be tough) because rock and roll is kind of tough (business)," [...] which she felt wasn't worn quite authentically.

2500|$|When {{making the}} song, Ochi {{wanted to make}} it the {{signature}} song on Force, as well as creating a work similar to her 2008 single [...] "Ai o Komete Hanataba o", that had been used for her previous tie-up with a TBS drama, Edison no Haha. After creating the song, Ochi felt the song was very representative of how <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a person at that moment. The song, as well as much of the Force album, was inspired by someone close to Ochi who made her want to expose more of her true self.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, Goldfrapp {{expressed}} [...] "not [...] very proud" [...] and [...] "not [...] crazy about" [...] the album, {{describing it}} as too [...] "on the nose".

2500|$|She {{regretted that}} she had to give up journalism, and could only write about {{tradition}} and culture. In her articles collected later into [...] "Mother's Words of Old", she bemoaned the loosening of social cohesion, morals, and traditional values in dress and manner which she blamed on economic disorder, consumerism and globalisation, and Chinese immigration. She once wrote that the Chinese had occupied Mandalay without firing a shot, and had dubbed the present Lawpan [...] (boss in Chinese) era; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if Mandalay was an undeclared colony of Yunnan Province. Daw Amar was a staunch defender of Burmese history, culture, religion and sovereignty embodied in her birthplace, the last royal capital of Burma, Mandalay - thus broadly nationalistic, religious and ethnocentric traditionalist in her perspective, and yet she had been in the forefront of modernising the written language, fostering mutual understanding and friendship between the dominant Bamar and the ethnic minorities in tandem with her husband, promoting sex education and public awareness of the HIV/AIDS problem, and voicing complaints regarding unpaid labour contributions of women in society.|$|E

Gordeeva has said that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if she skated with Sergei that night, that she was [...] "double strong" [...] because she felt him with her.
