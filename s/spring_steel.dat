5|$|The cage {{crinoline}} {{made out}} of <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> wire was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a 'skeleton petticoat of steel springs fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, saddle {{manufacturers}} are using various materials to replace wood {{and create a}} synthetic molded tree (some with the integrated <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> and gullet plate, some without). [...] Synthetic materials vary widely in quality. [...] Polyurethane trees are often very well-made, but some cheap saddles are made with fiberglass trees of limited durability. [...] Synthetic trees are often lighter, more durable, and easier to customize. Some designs are intended to be more flexible and move with the horse.|$|E
2500|$|Although to {{the untrained}} eye all saddles {{of a similar}} design look alike, the [...] "tree" [...] that {{underlies}} the saddle is usually one of the defining features of saddle quality. Traditionally, the tree of an English saddle is built of laminated layers of high quality wood reinforced with <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> along its length, with a riveted gullet plate. These trees are semi-adjustable and are considered [...] "spring trees." [...] They have some give, but a minimum amount of flexibility.|$|E
2500|$|Bascom {{has been}} honored as the [...] "Father of Modern Rodeo" [...] and {{known as an}} {{innovator}} and inventor. He is known in rodeo history for designing and making rodeo's modern bucking chute in 1916 and modified in 1919. He also made rodeo's first hornless bronc saddle in 1922 and rodeo's first one-hand bareback rigging in 1924, for {{which he has been}} called the [...] "Father of Rodeo Bareback Riding." [...] In 1926, he designed and made the modern rodeo riding chaps, and then in 1928, a rodeo exerciser made of <b>spring</b> <b>steel.</b> Bascom has been recognized in Canada's as an inventor.|$|E

2500|$|Another, different, bit {{also called}} an {{installer}} bit {{has a very}} long flexible shaft, typically up to [...] long, with a small twist bit at the end. The shaft is made of <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> instead of hardened steel, {{so it can be}} flexed while drilling without breaking. This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example to drill through studs from a light switch box without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is drilling still remains.|$|E
2500|$|John Howe was the {{supervisor}} on armour, having studied and worn it. Stu Johnson and Warren Green made 48,000 pieces of armour from the numerous molds of plate steel, {{as well as}} a small group who spent 3 years linking plastic chain mail (eventually wearing their thumbprints away). Peter Lyon also forged swords, each taking from three to six days, creating <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> [...] "hero" [...] swords for close-ups, aluminium fight swords and rubber versions too. Weta also created 10,000 real arrows and 500 bows. Howe even created a less crude type of crossbow for the Uruk-hai (the first army approved), based on a 16th-century manuscript.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{susceptibility}} to environmental embrittlement (EE) of automobile <b>spring</b> <b>steels</b> was investigated using six different steels. A SSRT test and TDS analysis {{were applied to}} specimens subjected to wet-dry cyclic corrosion tests in a NaCl solution. Experimental results revealed that the reduction in ductility after the corrosion tests was pronounced with increasing strength level. This degradation was {{closely associated with the}} resistance to pitting corrosion. Consequently, the hydrogen absorbed in steel and the corrosion pit as a geometric damage were responsible for the EE of <b>spring</b> <b>steels.</b> The hydrogen in rust layer had no significant influence on the EE...|$|R

2500|$|The clock's {{movement}} {{is famous for}} its reliability. The designers were the lawyer and amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison, and George Airy, the Astronomer Royal. Construction was entrusted to clockmaker Edward John Dent; after his death in 1853 his stepson Frederick Dent completed the work, in 1854. As the tower was not complete until 1859, Denison had time to experiment: instead of using the deadbeat escapement and remontoire as originally designed, Denison invented the double three-legged gravity escapement. This escapement provides the best separation between pendulum and clock mechanism. The pendulum is installed within an enclosed windproof box beneath the clockroom. It is [...] long, weighs , suspended on a strip of <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> 1/64 inch in thickness, and beats every 2 seconds. The clockwork mechanism in a room below weighs 5 tons.|$|E
2500|$|Slinky was {{originally}} priced at $1, but many paid much more due to price increases of <b>spring</b> <b>steel</b> {{throughout the state}} of Pennsylvania, and has remained modestly priced throughout its history {{as a result of}} Betty James' concern about the toy's affordability for poor customers. Slinky has seen uses other than as a toy in the playroom: it has appeared in the classroom as a teaching tool, in wartime as a radio antenna, and in physics experiments with NASA. Slinky was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York, in 2000. In 2002, Slinky became Pennsylvania's official state toy, and, in 2003, was named to the Toy Industry Association's [...] "." [...] In its first 60 years Slinky has sold 300 million units.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThere is {{a growing}} trend in the {{automotive}} industry to reduce vehicles weight so as to increase fuel efficiency and therefore reduce CO 2 emissions. For many automotive components such as springs, weight reduction is sought through {{an increase in the}} mechanical properties (allowing smaller components size). For ultra high strength springs, a good corrosion resistance becomes essential to avoid surface damage that will be detrimental to the corrosion-fatigue resistance. Corrosion-fatigue failures indeed often initiate on surface defects caused by corrosion in service (corrosion pits). Therefore, while of moderate importance in conventional <b>spring</b> <b>steels,</b> the corrosion resistance of ultra high strength <b>spring</b> <b>steels</b> is of primary importance. Fine changes in steel chemical composition can have an important effect on corrosion resistance. To understand the individual action of each element on the corrosion resistance of <b>spring</b> <b>steels,</b> corrosion products formed on samples exposed to NaCl environments were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, in a purposely designed experimental tool that allows mapping of corrosion products on the steel surface (by nature and mass fraction). Different steel grades were thus characterized after accelerated corrosion tests, and a clear correlation was established between weight loss {{and the nature of the}} corrosion products...|$|R
50|$|Many early molecatchers set out snares for the moles, {{taking care}} to remove human scent from the loops. Over time, traps used to catch and kill moles became more {{advanced}} and complicated, incorporating weighted wood or cast iron, and eventually <b>sprung</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|R
2500|$|An {{external}} collet is {{a sleeve}} with a (normally) cylindrical inner surface and a conical outer surface. The collet can be squeezed against a matching taper such that its inner surface contracts to a slightly smaller diameter, squeezing the tool or workpiece {{to hold it}} securely. Most often this is achieved with a spring collet, made of <b>spring</b> <b>steel,</b> {{with one or more}} [...] cuts along its length to allow it to expand and contract. An alternative collet design is one that has several tapered steel blocks (essentially tapered gauge blocks) held in circular position (like the points of a star, or indeed the jaws of a jawed chuck) by a flexible binding medium (typically synthetic or natural rubber). Regardless of the collet design, the operating principle is the same: squeeze the collet against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction.|$|E

50|$|The Salter {{coil spring}} spring balance for weighing, was first made in Britain by around 1770. This used the newly {{developed}} <b>spring</b> <b>steels</b> {{to make a}} powerful but compact spring in one piece.

40|$|AbstractSymmetric fatigue in two <b>spring</b> <b>steels</b> is {{investigated}} in {{three groups of}} specimens. One of the groups (Steel EN 10270 - 1 SH/ DIN 17223 C – C 0. 82 %, Mn 0. 76 %, Si 0. 26 %) has experienced rotating-bending fatigue in air, {{and the other two}} groups (Steel BS 250 A 53 / DIN 55 Si 7 – C 0. 56 %, Mn 0. 81 %, Si 1. 85 %), torsion fatigue in-air and corrosion environment. Fatigue life-time data are obtained for both <b>spring</b> <b>steels,</b> and their corresponding Wöhler curves plotted and mathematically described. Surface short fatigue cracks are observed from origin to fracture by using acetate-foil replication technique, and their length, a, measured at the corresponding number of fatigue cycles, N. Those data are presented in plots “Crack lengths, a – Cycles, N” and a comparison made between both the steels. The fractured surfaces of all specimens have been studied and analyzed by the scanning-electron microscopy methods...|$|R
