5|$|Roddenberry's {{favorite}} for Riker was Jonathan Frakes, {{who went through}} seven auditions before claiming the role. Despite being the <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> of the casting team, he was hired after their first choice was unimpressive in his auditions.|$|E

5|$|After finding himself <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> behind summer signing, Mark Howard, Amos {{signed a}} season long loan at Championship side, Cardiff City on 26 August. He was {{kept out of}} the {{starting}} line-up by Ben Wilson, until 17 September, where he made his debut against Leeds United.|$|E

5|$|If oral {{medications}} and mechanical treatments fail, the <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> is local injections: medications such as papaverine and prostaglandin that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are {{injected into the}} penis. This method is preferred for its effectiveness, but can cause pain and scarring.|$|E
5|$|Booth's {{performances}} saw him {{selected for}} a <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> Australian team that toured New Zealand under the captaincy of Ian Craig. He scored 105 {{in his first}} innings for his country, in a victory over Auckland. Booth scored 184 runs at 30.66 and took three wickets at 25.00 in the four international matches against New Zealand. Booth considered retiring after the season, feeling that the time needed for first-class cricket was impinging on {{his work as a}} lay preacher and a Christian youth worker.|$|E
5|$|Justice John McKinley's {{death in}} 1852 led to repeated, fruitless {{attempts}} by the president to fill the vacancy. The Senate took no action on the nomination of New Orleans attorney Edward A. Bradford. Fillmore's <b>second</b> <b>choice,</b> George Edmund Badger, asked that his name be withdrawn. Senator-elect Judah P. Benjamin declined to serve. The nomination of William C. Micou, a New Orleans lawyer recommended by Benjamin, was not acted on by the Senate. The vacancy was finally filled after Fillmore's term, when President Franklin Pierce nominated John Archibald Campbell, who was confirmed by the Senate.|$|E

50|$|Nauru Borda, {{relative}} to normal Borda, places {{a much stronger}} emphasis on first <b>choices</b> over <b>second</b> <b>choices,</b> which is why Catherine did so poorly under that system.|$|R
5|$|Like {{another ten}} {{cities in the}} world, this London was named after the English capital of London by John Graves Simcoe, who also named the local river the Thames, in 1793. That was {{understandable}} since John Graves Simcoe {{and many of the}} original settlers were from Britain. Simcoe had intended London to be the capital of Upper Canada. Guy Carleton (Governor Dorchester) rejected that plan after the War of 1812, but accepted Simcoe's <b>second</b> <b>choice,</b> the present site of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} deadlocked {{among the}} three main candidates, with Virginia's votes going to Clay. Many Northern Whigs opposed Clay, and some, including Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, showed the Virginians a letter written by Scott in which he apparently displayed abolitionist sentiments. The influential Virginia delegation then announced that Harrison was its <b>second</b> <b>choice,</b> causing most Scott supporters to abandon him in favor of Harrison, who gained the presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|When Blamey {{relieved}} Rowell {{of command}} of I Corps in New Guinea, he nominated Herring as successor. Blamey proposed Mackay as a <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> but preferred Herring {{as he was}} much younger, and this was important in the taxing New Guinea climate. When Blamey relinquished command of New Guinea Force on 30 January 1943, he handed over temporary command to Mackay to enable Herring to go on leave. The period was a quiet one, with no major operations being carried out, and Mackay handed back to Herring and returned to command of the Second Army at Parramatta, New South Wales, in May 1943.|$|E

25|$|December 2 - Second ballot of the {{leadership}} election. Polls were open between 9:00am and 7:00pm MST. The election was between Dinning, Morton, and Stelmach. Stelmach finished first followed by Dinning. After the <b>second</b> <b>choices</b> of Morton's supporters were factored in Stelmach was declared the winner.|$|R
50|$|Ronnie Barker and Norman Wisdom {{were the}} BBC's first and <b>second</b> <b>choices</b> {{for the role}} of Frank. However the casting of Crawford proved effective, as many of Frank's mannerisms and turns of phrase were invented by the actor, and his stunt-performing and singing skills were used in the series.|$|R
5|$|Alberta's second dynasty was the United Farmers of Alberta, a farmers' {{movement}} organization, {{formed in}} 1909 as a lobby group, whose political wing rose from a minor party named the Alberta Non-Partisan League, formed in 1916. Henry Wise Wood led the {{party at the}} time of the 1921 election, although he did not run himself. The loosely organized farmer candidates running in rural constituencies captured a majority of the seats. The party was allied with Labour candidates, so it did not contest urban ridings, aside from one in Edmonton. Wood did not want the job as premier so the farmers were forced to shop around. UFA lawyer John Brownlee was asked first but declined. UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield, the <b>second</b> <b>choice,</b> became the new premier, although he too had not run in the election so had to await success in a by-election to take his seat.|$|E
5|$|Amos {{made his}} first start of the 2011–12 season in a third round League Cup tie at Elland Road against Leeds United. He kept a clean sheet as United cruised through to the next round winning 3–0. He played again in the {{following}} round away at Aldershot Town, a game which United also won 3–0 and advanced to the quarter finals. He was in goal again for United's League Cup game in a defeat against Championship club Crystal Palace on 30 November. It also seemed that he had moved above last season's <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> Tomasz Kuszczak in the pecking order, but was now third choice behind Anders Lindegaard and David de Gea. He {{made his first}} Premier League start in a 2–0 home win against Stoke City on 31 January 2012, keeping a clean sheet on his debut.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the conclave, Alessandro Farnese, the cardinal-nephew of Paul III, and his faction of four or five {{cardinals}} (including Ranuccio Farnese and Guido Ascanio Sforza), whom Guise had counted among the French faction, began supporting the <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> of the Holy Roman Emperor, Reginald Pole, apparently having received assurances that Ottavio Farnese's claim to the Duchy of Parma would be supported by Charles V. On December 5, Pole received twenty-six votes, only two short of the requisite two-thirds majority, prompting French ambassador Claude d'Urfé to rush {{to the door of the}} conclave, demanding that the conclave wait for the French cardinals, whom he claimed were in Corsica, and threatening that the election of a pope in their absence would be likely to cause a schism.|$|E
50|$|First choice {{votes are}} first counted. If one {{candidate}} has a majority, that candidate wins. Otherwise the <b>second</b> <b>choices</b> {{are added to}} the first choices. Again, if a candidate with a majority vote is found, the winner is the candidate with the most votes accumulated. Lower rankings are added as needed.|$|R
50|$|Jeffrey was a {{standout}} athlete at Shawnee Mission West High School in Overland Park, Kansas. When picking the university {{where he would}} want to continue his football career, Missouri and Baylor were his first and <b>second</b> <b>choices,</b> respectively, even though his older brother Neal had previously been a star quarterback at Baylor.|$|R
50|$|Born in Barretos, Rafael Santos joined Corinthians' youth setup in 2004, aged 15. In 2008, he was {{promoted}} to the main squad, in Série B, and made his debut on 29 November, starting in a 0-2 loss at América-RN, as Timão were already champions and both Felipe and Júlio César (first and <b>second</b> <b>choices,</b> respectively) were already in vacations.|$|R
5|$|Ladas {{was sent}} to Doncaster for the St Leger on 12 September {{in an attempt to}} win the Triple Crown. Ridden by Tommy Loates, Ladas started at odds of 10/11 (0.9/1) in a field of eight, with Matchbox (ridden by Watts) the <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> on 2/1 and the filly Throstle ignored on 50/1. As usual, Ladas was held up {{at the back of the}} field as, at first Throstle, then a horse named Legal Tender, then Matchbox made the running. Ladas moved {{steadily}} closer and turned into the straight in second, before overtaking Matchbox and going into a clear lead. In the final furlong, however, he was challenged by Throstle, and in the closing stages the latter pulled ahead to win by three quarters of a length. According to The Sportsman, the cheers of the crowd were replaced by those of the bookmakers as the outsider overhauled the favourite.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass {{was played}} by the {{experienced}} Reginald Tate, who had appeared in various films, including The Way Ahead (1944). He died two years later, while preparing to take {{the role of the}} Professor again in Quatermass II. Tate was the <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> for the part; Cartier had previously offered it to André Morell, who declined the role. (Morell did later play Quatermass in the third instalment of the series, Quatermass and the Pit.) Victor Carroon was played by Scottish actor Duncan Lamont, who later appeared in the film Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), and as a different character in the film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He enjoyed working on The Quatermass Experiment so much that, although he was not required for the final episode, he went to Alexandra Palace to lend moral support. While there, he helped Kneale and Kerr to prepare their 'monster' prop.|$|E
5|$|The booked service allowed {{two options}} of fees. The Transit Booking System, {{available}} online, allowing customers {{who do not}} want to wait in queue to pay an additional 15% over the regular tolls, guaranteeing a specific day for transit and crossing the canal in 18 hours or less. ACP sells 24 of these daily slots up to 365 days in advance. The <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> was high priority transit. Since 2006, ACP has available a 25th slot, sold through the Transit Slot Auction to the highest bidder. The main customers of the Transit Booking System are cruise ships, containerships, vehicle carriers, and non-containerized cargo vessels.|$|E

50|$|In the {{election}} on 12 June 1952, the Liberals and Conservatives were decimated. The Social Credit League {{was the main}} beneficiary of the new voting system as many non-CCF voters chose Social Credit as either their first or <b>second</b> <b>choices.</b> Social Credit emerged as the largest party, with one more seat than Winch's CCF. Social Credit then chose a new leader, W.A.C. Bennett.|$|R
50|$|Ash faced {{off in a}} three way {{battle with}} Grisdale, who this time ran as an Independent and Social Credit {{candidate}} Norman Cook. The first vote showed Ash easily defeated running a distant third place. Grisdale was leading 110 votes ahead of Cook. Grisdale {{did not have a}} 50% majority so the Ash's second preferences were counted. Most of the <b>second</b> <b>choices</b> game Cook just enough votes to win the district and defeat Grisdale.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. In {{the background of the}} classroom, there are several portraits of past United States presidents. These were added for the scene where Bart tries to think of a name for his fictional letter writer, and sees a portrait of Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image for free. Howe, their <b>second</b> <b>choice,</b> was suggested by Al Jean, who had been a Detroit Red Wings fan growing up. At the end of the episode, Howe's NHL and WHA statistics are shown because the writers decided to try something different in filling a slight time under-run.|$|E
5|$|The {{medication}} typically recommended first are NSAIDs (though not aspirin) or {{skeletal muscle}} relaxants {{and these are}} enough for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs; however, is often small. High-quality reviews have found acetaminophen (paracetamol) {{to be no more}} effective than placebo at improving pain, quality of life, or function. NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk of side effects including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a <b>second</b> <b>choice</b> to acetaminophen, recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; {{there is no evidence to}} support the use of COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen may be best. Muscle relaxants may be beneficial.|$|E
5|$|With Butler's {{chances for}} the presidential {{nomination}} waning, Breckinridge convinced the Kentucky delegation to the 1852 Democratic National Convention not to nominate Butler until later balloting when he might become a compromise candidate. He urged restraint when Lewis Cass's support dropped sharply on the twentieth ballot, but Kentucky's delegates would wait no longer; on the next ballot, they nominated Butler, but he failed to gain support. After Franklin Pierce, Breckinridge's <b>second</b> <b>choice,</b> was nominated, Breckinridge tried, unsuccessfully, to recruit Douglas to Pierce's cause. Pierce lost by 3,200 votes in Kentucky—one of four states won by Winfield Scott—but {{was elected to the}} presidency, and appointed Breckinridge governor of Washington Territory in recognition of his efforts. Unsure of his re-election chances in Kentucky, Breckinridge had sought the appointment, but after John J. Crittenden, rumored to be his challenger, was elected to the Senate in 1853, he decided to decline it and run for re-election.|$|E
40|$|Fallback {{bargaining}} is {{a bargaining}} procedure under which bargainers begin by indicating their preference rankings over all alternatives. They then fall back, in lockstep, to {{less and less}} preferred alternatives - starting with first <b>choices,</b> then adding <b>second</b> <b>choices,</b> and so on - until an alternative is found on which all bargainers agree. This common agreement, which becomes {{the outcome of the}} procedure, may be different if a decision rule other than unanimity is used. BARGAINING; SOCIAL CHOICE; NASH EQUILIBRIUM...|$|R
5000|$|Used in {{national}} elections in Australia, {{this system is}} said to simulate a series of runoff elections. If no candidate is {{the first choice of}} {{more than half of the}} voters, then all votes cast for the candidate with the lowest number of first choices are redistributed to the remaining candidates based on who is ranked next on each ballot. If this does not result in any candidate receiving a majority, further rounds of redistribution occur. Or, in other words, [...] "... voters would rank their first, <b>second</b> and subsequent <b>choices</b> on the ballot. The candidate with the fewest votes would be dropped and his or her supporters’ <b>second</b> <b>choices</b> would be counted and so on until one candidate emerged with more than 50 per cent." ...|$|R
50|$|Elections use the {{supplementary}} vote system: voters mark the ballot paper {{with their first}} and <b>second</b> <b>choices</b> of candidate. If no candidate gets a majority of first preference votes, the top two candidates go on to a second round in which second preference votes of the eliminated candidates are allocated to them to produce a winner. The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 directs that the voting system is First past the post if {{there are only two}} candidates for a specific Commissioner region.|$|R
