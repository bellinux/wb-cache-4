40|$|Courtship song is a {{critical}} component of male courtship behavior in Drosophila, making the female more receptive to copulation and communicating species-specific information [1 - 6]. <b>Sex</b> <b>mosaic</b> {{studies have shown that the}} sex of certain regions of the central nervous system (CNS) is critical to song production [7]. Our examination of one of these regions, the mesothoracic ganglion (Msg), revealed the coexpression of two sex-determination genes, fruitless (fru) and doublesex (dsx). Because both genes are involved in creating a sexually dimorphic CNS [8, 9] and are necessary for song production [10 - 13], we investigated the individual contributions of fru and dsx to the specification of a male CNS and song production. We show a novel requirement for dsx in specifying a sexually dimorphic population of fru-expressing neurons in the Msg. Moreover, by using females constitutively expressing the male-specific isoforms of fru (Fru(M)), we show {{a critical}} requirement for the male isoform of dsx (Dsx(M)), alongside Fru(M), in the specification of courtship song. Therefore, although Fru(M) expression is sufficient for the performance of many male-specific behaviors [14], we have shown that without Dsx(M), the determination of a male-specific CNS and thus a full complement of male behaviors are not realized...|$|E
40|$|The {{elaborate}} courtship ritual {{performed by}} Drosophila melanogaster males to interest females in copulation {{is used as}} a model to investigate the genetic and neurobiological basis for the specification of complex behaviours. One component of this courtship ritual is the ‘lovesong’, which both promotes mating and carries vital species-specific information. <b>Sex</b> <b>mosaic</b> studies have shown that specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS) must be male in order to produce this courtship song. Indeed, two genes in the sex determination hierarchy, fruitless (fru) and doublesex (dsx), which are responsible for sexual differentiation in both the CNS and soma, are required for wild-type song production. However, the critical differences underlying the sexually dimorphic production of courtship song are unknown; moreover, the relative contributions of fru and dsx to the generation of these differences are not known. The central aim of this thesis was to investigate the neurobiological basis for the sexually dimorphic production of courtship song; and in addition, to determine the individual and combined contributions of fru and dsx in creating these essential differences. The long-term goal {{of this study was to}} determine the mechanism by which genetic factors such as fru and dsx can create the potential for courtship song by specifying aspects of CNS development and function. As a first step towards this long-term goal, the work presented in this thesis has identified the individual and combined contributions of fru and dsx to the production of courtship song. Moreover, a requirement for both fru and dsx in the specification of a neural substrate underlying courtship song was shown. Using females constitutively expressing the male-specific fru isoforms, the individual contribution of fru to the production of courtship song was determined; and the amount and quality of song generated by these females was found to be highly aberrant. Thus fru alone does not specify courtship song production. In fact, wild-type courtship song was only achieved when females expressed the male-specific isoforms of both fru and dsx, demonstrating that both genes are required for the specification of courtship song. Next, the co-expression of fru and dsx was examined, where fru and dsx were found to be co-expressed in three distinct regions of the CNS. One of these regions, the mesothoracic ganglion (Msg), is strongly implicated in the production of courtship song, suggesting that fru and dsx may act in concert to specify courtship song production. A closer examination of this region revealed a male-specific population of fru-expressing neurons in the Msg. This population of neurons was not present in females constitutively expressing fru’s male-specific isoforms, demonstrating that fru alone does not specify the development of a sexually dimorphic Msg. Instead, a critical requirement for dsx, alongside fru, in the specification of this sexually dimorphic population of neurons was shown. Thus a critical requirement for both fru and dsx in the specification of courtship song, and in the creation of a sexually dimorphic population of neurons in the Msg has been revealed. Finally, to determine how this sexually dimorphic population of neurons is linked to courtship song production, this thesis described the generation of genetic tools to allow the visualization and manipulation of these sex-specific neurons. Using the UAS/GAL 4 system of targeted gene expression, another sexually dimorphic population of neurons was identified in the posterior brain, which is, like the Msg, a region where fru and dsx are co-expressed. Together, these results suggest that fru and dsx act to generate sexually dimorphic populations of neurons in regions of co-expression, where these neurons may form part of the sex-specific neural circuits underlying the performance of sexually dimorphic behaviours.

50|$|Hall's {{work with}} Drosophila {{courtship}} behavior {{began as a}} collaborative work with Kankel to correlate courtship behaviors with genetic sex in various regions of the nervous systems using fruit fly <b>sex</b> <b>mosaics</b> during {{the last months of}} his postdoctoral years in Benzer's laboratory. This work triggered his interest in the neurogenetics of Drosophila courtship and led him to the subsequent career path of investigation into Drosophila courtship.|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} in genetic mosaics of 86 EMS-induced sex-linked lethals has been studied. Seventy-five {{percent of them}} are autonomous in gynandromorphs. Forty-three lethals nonviable in <b>sex</b> <b>mosaics</b> have been analyzed in X-ray-induced spots in the abdominal tergites and the imaginal wing derivatives. Of the lethals, 90. 7 % are homozygous viable in mosaic spots, and only 9. 3 % have been classified as epidermal cell lethal. Thus, the fraction of the Drosophila genome essential for cell viability has been estimated to be about 420 genes. The phenotypes at the cellular level of some cell-viable mutations altering cell parameters (mitotic orientation, differentiation, etc.) are described...|$|R
40|$|Given a mutant having {{abnormal}} behavior, {{the anatomical}} domain {{responsible for the}} deficit may be identified {{by the use of}} genetic mosaicism. Individuals may be produced in which a portion of the body is mutant male while the rest is normal female. In such <b>sex</b> <b>mosaics,</b> or gynandromorphs, the division line between normal and mutant parts can occur in various orientations. Mutants of five different genes (cistrons) on the X-chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster, having various abnormalities in visual function, have been tested by this method. All of these {{have been found to be}} autonomous, i. e., a mutant eye always functions abnormally, regardless of the amount of normal tissue present elsewhere, indicating that the primary causes of the behavioral deficits in these mutants are within the eye...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} {{cells in the}} brain of Drosophila melanogaster that are required to be of female genotype for receptivity to copulation with males. To do this, we determined experimental conditions in which female flies virtually always copulate, then measured the minimum amount of male courtship that is required to stimulate females to indicate their receptivity to copulation. We then observed gynandromorphs with female genitalia {{to determine whether the}} <b>sex</b> <b>mosaics</b> elicited at least the minimum amount of courtship and, if so, whether they copulated. By analyzing these gynandromorphs, in which the genotype of external and internal tissues could be ascertained, we were able to identify a group of cells in the dorsal anterior brain that, when bilaterally female, is necessary and sufficient for receptivity to copulation. This group of cells is anatomically distinct from those that are required to be of male genotype for the performance of courtship behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Tetraploid/diploid mosaicism {{is a rare}} {{chromosomal}} abnormality that is infrequently {{reported in}} patients with severe developmental delay, growth retardation, and short life span. Here, we present a 6 -year-old patient with severe penoscrotal hypospadias and a coloboma of the left eye but with normal growth, normal psychomotor development, and without dysmorphisms. We considered a local, <b>mosaic</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomal aneuploidy as a possible cause of his genital anomaly and performed karyotyping in cultured fibroblasts from the genital skin, obtained during surgical correction. Tetraploid/diploid (92,XXYY/ 46,XY) mosaicism was found in 43 / 57 and 6 / 26 metaphases in 2 separate cultures, respectively. Buccal smear cells, blood lymphocytes, and ells from urine sediment all showed diploidy. We investigated whether this chromosomal abnormality {{could be found in}} other patients with severe hypospadias and karyotyped genital fibroblasts of 6 additional patients but found only low frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Sex {{chromosome}} abnormalities {{are common}} in mammals and humans and are often associated with subfertility. In this study a boar with normal sperm parameters was indicated to have reduced prolificacy from figures obtained for return rate, farrowing rate and total number of piglets born. G-banded cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood identified an abnormal <b>mosaic</b> <b>sex</b> chromosome constitution 39,XYY[74]/ 38,XY[23]/ 37,X[3]. Cytogenetic analysis of fibroblasts confirmed this mosaic karyotype with similar percentages of cell lines observed 39,XYY[76]/ 38,XY[19]/ 37,X[5]. External genitalia revealed a poorly developed scrotum with the right testicle being smaller than the left. To {{the best of our}} knowledge this is the first time that this chromosome constitution has been reported in the pig. It is of particular interest that this karyotype is associated with reduced boar fertility, which could lead to potential economic losses if such a boar were selected for breeding purposes...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} large structural clonal mosaicism of chromosome X, we analysed the SNP microarray intensity data of 38, 303 {{women from}} cancer genome-wide association studies (20, 878 cases and 17, 425 controls) and detected 124 mosaic X events > 2 [*]Mb in 97 (0. 25 %) women. Here we show rates for X-chromosome mosaicism are four {{times higher than}} mean autosomal rates; X mosaic events more often include the entire chromosome and participants with X events more likely harbour autosomal mosaic events. X mosaicism frequency increases with age (0. 11 % in 50 -year olds; 0. 45 % in 75 -year olds), as reported for Y and autosomes. Methylation array analyses of 33 women with X mosaicism indicate events preferentially involve the inactive X chromosome. Our results provide further evidence that the <b>sex</b> chromosomes undergo <b>mosaic</b> events more frequently than autosomes, which could have implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of mosaic events and their possible contribution to risk for chronic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Cytogenetic {{studies were}} {{performed}} in 500 couples referred for in-vitro fertilization or gamete (zygote) intra-Fallopian transfer. Thirteen individuals (1. 3 %) with chromosomal ab-normalities were found. Four major types of anomalies were observed: reciprocal translocations (n = 3), inversions (n = 2), iso-Xq chromosomes (n = 2) and <b>sex</b> chromosome number <b>mosaics</b> (n = 4). Moreover two males with respec-tively a 47,XYY and a 47,XY,mar+ karyotype were iden-tified. These data {{pointed to a}} higher incidence of chromosomal aberrations in this infertile population as com-pared to a neonatal population without obvious chromosomal pathology. Analysis of the chromosomes which were involv-ed in hyperdiploidy and hypodiploidy in the 30 000 metaphases evaluated, showed a high proportion of cells that had lost or gained an X-chromosome. A puzzling finding was the statistically significant low incidence of 45,X metaphases (0. 9 %o) in women of couples treated on andrological indica-tion as compared to the frequency of 45,X chromosome com-plements in women with tubal disease (4. 0 %o) or of couples with an idiopathic (4. 3 %°) or mixed female and male (6. 7 %O) indication.

40|$|BACKGROUND and AIMS: According to the somatic {{mutation}} theory, monoclonal colorectal lesions arise from sequential mutations in the progeny {{of a single}} stem cell. However, studies in a <b>sex</b> chromosome mixoploid <b>mosaic</b> (XO/XY) patient indicated that colorectal adenomas were polyclonal. We assessed adenoma clonality on an individual crypt basis and completed a genetic dependency analysis in carcinomas-in-adenomas to assess mutation order and timing. METHODS: Polyp samples were analyzed from the XO/XY individual, patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, patients with small sporadic adenomas, and patients with sporadic carcinoma-in-adenomas. Clonality was analyzed using X/Y chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization, analysis of 5 q loss of heterozygosity in XO/XY tissue, and sequencing of adenomatous polyposis coli. Individual crypts and different phenotypic areas of carcinoma-in-adenoma lesions were analyzed for mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli, p 53, and K-RAS; loss of heterozygosity at 5 q, 17 p, and 18 q; and aneuploidy. Phylogenetic trees were constructed. RESULTS: All familial adenomatous polyposis-associated adenomas and some sporadic lesions had polyclonal genetic defects. Some independent clones appeared to be maintained in advanced adenomas. No clear obligate order of genetic events was established. Top-down growth of dysplastic tissue into neighboring crypts was a possible mechanism of clonal competition. CONCLUSIONS: Human colorectal microadenomas are polyclonal and may arise {{from a combination of}} host genetic features, mucosal exposures, and active crypt interactions. Analyses of tumor phylogenies show that most lesions undergo intermittent genetic homogenization, but heterotypic mutation patterns indicate that independent clonal evolution can occur throughout adenoma development. Based on observations of clonal ordering the requirement and timing of genetic events during neoplastic progression may be more variable than previously thought...|$|R
