40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of the pulsating flow in a pipe of circular cross section characterized by small imperfections {{are carried out}} to determine the conditions leading to the appearance of turbulence. The results show that in the oscillatory case (no <b>steady</b> velocity <b>component</b> of the basic flow), the critical value of the Reynolds number R_delta depends on the Womersley parameter alpha and in particular, R_delta increases as alpha decreases. The critical value of R_delta of the plane wall case is recovered when alpha is larger than about 10. For moderate values of the Reynolds numbers but larger than the critical one, turbulence appears around flow reversal and breaks the symmetry of the flow originating a <b>steady</b> velocity <b>component.</b> Moreover, turbulence is not present throughout the whole cycle and there are phases during which the flow relaminarizes. The presence of a steady pressure gradient tends to destabilize the flow and this destabilizing effect becomes larger as the <b>steady</b> velocity <b>component</b> is increased. When turbulence is present, its dynamics {{is similar to that}} of the steady case and a log-law layer can be identified both in the oscillatory and the pulsating case...|$|R

50|$|In optical interferometry, {{homodyne}} signifies {{that the}} reference radiation (i.e. the local oscillator) {{is derived from}} the same source as the signal before the modulating process. For example, in a laser scattering measurement, the laser beam is split into two parts. One is the local oscillator and the other is sent to the system to be probed. The scattered light is then mixed with the local oscillator on the detector. This arrangement has the advantage of being insensitive to fluctuations in the frequency of the laser. Usually the scattered beam will be weak, in which case the (nearly) <b>steady</b> <b>component</b> of the detector output is a good measure of the instantaneous local oscillator intensity and therefore can be used to compensate for any fluctuations in the intensity of the laser.|$|E

40|$|Fram Strait is {{the only}} deep ocean {{connection}} between the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas. It therefore {{plays a crucial role}} in the oceanic exchanges between the Arctic and the lower latitudes. The West Spitsbergen Current and the East Greenland Current are relatively well-studied boundary currents transporting warm water poleward respectively cold water equatorward. The central Fram Strait is dominated by the so-called Atlantic Water Recirculation. This is warm water of Atlantic origin that flows as far north at the approximate latitude of Fram Strait before it turns westward and then back equatorward. Moorings measuring temperature and current velocity have been maintained in Fram Strait from 1997 to the present. Here we use this data set as well as other available information to study the nature of the recirculation. Particular focus is devoted to its temporal variability on daily to interannual time scales.

40|$|Ultrasonically {{activated}} irrigation is {{an advanced}} dental technique for irrigation {{of the root}} canal system during a root canal treatment. The basic cleaning mechanism {{is a result of}} acoustic streaming induced by an oscillating file, leading to mixing of the irrigant and pressure and shear stresses {{on the walls of the}} root canal. Here the induced acoustic streaming, pressure, and shear stress are investigated in a two-dimensional cross-section of the root canal, using a combination of theory, numerical predictions, and experimental validation through high-speed particle tracking velocimetry. Acoustic streaming theory describes very well the flow induced by an ultrasonically oscillating endodontic file. It consists of an oscillatory component, which is dominant near the file, and a <b>steady</b> <b>component,</b> or jet, along the axis of oscillation. The importance of the oscillatory component for both the pressure and the shear stress is apparent, as it is two to three orders of magnitude higher than the <b>steady</b> <b>component.</b> A confinement affects the formation of the steady jets; meanwhile the oscillatory velocities and associated pressure and shear stress are increased. Previous work considering only the <b>steady</b> <b>component</b> of the flow therefore, underestimated the hydrodynamic effects induced by ultrasonic files.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} for strong coupling between the diurnal components of zonal neutral winds and ion drifts, {{suggesting that the}} relative importance of the E- and F-region dynamos be reevaluated. Measurements of zonal neutral winds in the equatorial region of the earth's thermosphere at an average altitude of about 350 km show that the nighttime zonal winds are very similar to the zonal ion-drifts. That similarity is examined, comparing the corresponding tidal components of the 24 hr variations of these two parameters. The amplitude spectrum of the neutral winds exhibits primary and secondary maxima at the diurnal and ter-diurnal frequencies respectively, while the ion-drift spectrum shows only the diurnal maximum. It is found that the simularity between neutral winds and ion-drifts is strongest in the diurnal mode where the phases differ by less than one half hour, the amplitude of the ion-drift being between 70 percent and 80 percent that of the neutral wind, suggesting a first-order relation between the two quantities. The largest difference is found in the <b>steady</b> <b>component</b> representing superrotation; under similar conditions of solar activity, the ions superrotate with a velocity of about 30 m/s and the neutrals with 10 m/s. For the ions, the <b>steady</b> <b>component,</b> the phase of the semi-diurnal component and the amplitude of the ter-diurnal component appear to be sensitive to solar activity and are responsible for the observed solar cycle variations in the times of eastward-to-westward reversals between 0400 and 0700 LT.
