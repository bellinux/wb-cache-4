5000|$|Dr. Jim Whitley, a math {{professor}} and {{assistant to the}} Principal, helped spearhead a student project in 1971 called the Birth Control and Abortion Information and Referral Centre, which was also staffed by full-time coordinators. [...] One of the initial goals of the Centre was to provide information on “birth control, abortion, infertility, vasectomies and veneral disease, and medical referrals.” [...] By 1974, its expanding mandate led to a name change to the Birth Control, VD & Abortion Referral Centre. [...] The Centre moved to the Grey House at 51 Bader Lane in 1975 and established a lending library. The name was again changed to the shorter “Birth Control Centre” in 1983. [...] The Centre began selling sexual health products at cost {{with the introduction of}} <b>spermicidal</b> <b>foam</b> and condom wallets in the late 1980s. [...] This selection expanded by 1991 to include spermicidal jelly and sponges. [...] In 1995, the Centre was again renamed as the “(Not Just the) Birth Control Centre” in recognition of its growing mandate, which was again promptly changed to the Sexual Health Resource Centre, which it remains today. [...] In 2004, theSHRC began receiving direct funding from Queen’s University undergraduate students through the establishment of a mandatory $0.85 CAD fee per student. [...] The fee withstood a challenge that it discriminated against students on the basis of religion that same year.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{assessed}} {{the acceptability of}} three nonoxynol- 9 spermicides among persons attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Lusaka, Zambia. METHODS. <b>Spermicidal</b> <b>foam,</b> suppositories, and foaming tablets were evaluated. Women (n = 114) and men (n = 150) attending an sexually transmitted disease clinic were enrolled. After each participant used two products, each for 2 weeks, consistency of use and acceptability were evaluated. RESULTS. At admission, most women (74 %) and men (58 %) were not using any family planning method. Moreover, most women (85 %) and men (98 %) {{had at least one}} sexually transmitted disease or genital infection. During the study, the proportion of coital episodes protected by spermicide use was high, yet loss to follow-up and discontinuation were also substantial. Discontinuation was frequently unrelated to acceptability. Women and men rated all three products positively along several acceptability parameters. Foam was the least desirable delivery system due to excess messiness. CONCLUSIONS. The {{results of this study suggest}} that it is feasible to distribute spermicides to women and men at increased risk for sexually transmitted disease and that the products will be used. Further research should be done among different populations and include other spermicidal delivery mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} qualitative methods in operations research on a family planning service delivery system. Market traders in Ibadan, Nigeria were trained to sell oral contraceptives, condoms, and <b>spermicidal</b> <b>foaming</b> tablets in a collaborative research project of the Fertility Research Unit of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, and the Center for Population and Family Health of Columbia University. Focus group discussion, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews were used to investigate the cultural acceptability of distribution of contraceptives in the market places and the motivations of participating traders. The strength of the market associations was a factor influencing acceptance {{of the project and}} the number of customers for the traders' other wares were found to positively influence the volume of sales of contraceptives. Traders were motivated by the status associated with participating in a program of a well-known health institution. Findings from qualitive research suggest areas for quantitative studies and vice versa in an interactive process. qualitative methods operations research contraceptive sales Yoruba markets...|$|R

50|$|Dr. Gamble and {{his workers}} {{explained}} and promoted simple methods—not the expensive and often impractical diaphragm, but <b>spermicidal</b> jellies, <b>foam</b> powders, sponges to be dipped in salt or other inexpensive solutions—to women {{who otherwise would}} never have known of nor been able to afford contraceptives. At the same time, he recognized the need for scientific data to back his promotion of the simple methods, and he set up extensive clinical trials, with his visiting nurses collecting data that measured {{the effectiveness of the}} simple methods. Again and again, it was shown that birth rates were reduced by as much as two-thirds or more using these simple methods.|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the relation between}} contraceptive methods and cervical Chlamydia trachomatis infection, the authors studied a population-based sample of 1, 779 nonpregnant women aged 15 - 34 years who underwent cell culture diagnostic testing {{for the detection of}} C. trachomatis at a health maintenance organization. Barrier contraceptive method users were classified as those who reported using one of the following methods at time of testing: condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, <b>spermicidal</b> sponge, <b>foam,</b> or vaginal <b>spermicidal</b> suppositories. Barrier methods were associated with a reduction in the risk of chlamydial infection in women aged 25 years or older when compared with all other women in the same age category (adjusted prevalence odds ratio = 0. 15, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) 0. 04 - 0. 66). When compared with only noncontracepting women, the adjusted prevalence odds ratio was 0. 34 (95 % Cl 0. 06 - 1. 99). The protective effect of barrier methods was not evident in women younger than age 25 years. Oral contraceptive use was not associated with the risk of C. trachomatis infection using either referent group; the adjusted prevalence odds ratio was 0. 99 (95 % Cl 0. 57 - 1. 73) compared with all other women, and 0. 88 (95 % Cl 0. 44 - 1. 79) compared with noncontracepting women. These findings suggest that present patterns of use of barrier methods differ by age and afford only selective protection against cervical C. trachomatis infections.

50|$|Products were {{introduced}} in late 1975. By {{the end of the}} following year, they had spread to all urban markets, and sales reached 4.9 million Raja condoms and about 250,000 cycles of Maya oral contraceptive pills. In 1979, the Joy brand <b>foaming</b> <b>spermicidal</b> tablet, donated by the Japanese, was introduced and sold about 3 million pieces. (Joy was discontinued in 1989 when the Japanese ceased supplying it and no other donor could be found. About 50 million tablets had been distributed.) In 1980, a second pill brand called Ovacon was introduced. Total sales for that year were 33.4 million Raja and over 600,000 pill cycles. In 1982, after the original contract with PSI had been renewed twice, USAID decided to change to a cooperative agreement, which now expires at the end of FY 1992 for family planning and FY 1994 for oral rehydration therapy (ORT). By 1983, a second brand of condoms (Panther) was introduced. Condom sales reached 76 million that year, with pills up to 1.7 million. PSI was asked to call in an outside agency to assist in producing a motivational campaign to promote the virtues of the small family, birth spacing, male responsibility, and the like, through mass media. This campaign was designed by Manoff International Inc. and ran for five years until an unexpected cut in USAID funding. During 1985, SMP introduced a third condom, the ultra-thin Majestic. Total condom sales passed the 100 million mark {{for the first time and}} pills the 2 million mark. ORSaline (a brand of oral rehydration salts) was introduced in the same year; initial annual sales of 120,000 have now grown to 10-12 million. By 1985, SMP employed almost 500 people, and its sales force was regarded as among the best in Bangladesh.|$|R
