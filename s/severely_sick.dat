30|$|The {{linear scaling}} {{characteristics}} of the VAS item AMS and the LLS score (Fig.  1) do not plot close to a theoretical identity line. Kayser et al. (2010) revealed in their study a threshold effect for the LLS scores below 5 – 6 leading to low VAS scores. The present study does not reflect this result. Nevertheless only 64  % of the subjects were consistently diagnosed with AMS by both scales. Due to the VAS-AMS-scale, four subjects who {{would not have been}} diagnosed with AMS by the LLS (score <  5) described themselves as moderately to almost <b>severely</b> mountain <b>sick.</b> Eight people who would have been diagnosed as sick by the LLS (score ≥  5) were below the cut off line of the VAS. In regard to previous literature (Hext et al. 2011; Wagner et al. 2007) and the results of the actual study, we think that a single VAS-item to assess overall AMS intensity can help to immediately assess the changes in the sensation of AMS but might only be effective for experienced mountaineers. However, moderate to strong correlations between the VAS and the LLS have been shown. Therefore, to answer our first research question, we found a strong relationship between the VAS measurement and the LLS. Despite the huge reputation of the LLS, in our opinion a VAS system might give further possibilities to work out a more valid cut off-score in comparison to an instrument with a 4 -point Likert approach as the LLS, in the future.|$|R

40|$|Background: In vitro {{studies suggest}} that {{administering}} betalactam antibiotics by continuous infusion may maximise efficacy. Several pharmacokinetic studies have compared the distribution of beta-lactam antibiotics administered by continuous and bolus dosing in plasma and tissues. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic exposure to tissues is essential, as tissue sites are most commonly the ‘target site’ for antibiotic therapy. Aim: To identify published studies that measure the serum and tissue concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics administered by continuous and bolus dosing. Data sources: A number of studies in animals, healthy volunteers and hospitalised patients were identified. Results: More prospective clinical trials are required to validate that the continuous infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics attain better tissue distribution at the target site. Conclusion: Beta-lactam antibiotics administered by continuous infusion maintain higher concentrations in serum and tissue. There is also compelling evidence that tissue distribution of antibiotics is impaired with increased sickness severity, therefore, larger doses of beta-lactam antibiotics may be required in <b>severely</b> <b>sick</b> patients to optimise antibiotic exposure at the target site...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectivesRe-conditioning before {{cardiac surgery}} in {{critically}} sick children is often needed. We report our experience using tailored management approach in these patients. Methods and patientsThe charts {{of patients with}} CHD who judged to have high operative risk were reviewed. Included were patients with: large left to right shunt and ventilation for longer than 2 months, significant left to right shunts at multiple levels combined with malnutrition or recent infection, severely impaired cardiac function needing inotropic support and antifailure medications, recent. RSV infection, severe malnutrition (body weight < 5 th centile), and critically sick patients during early postoperative course. Excluded were patients with: significant left to right shunts, presented early, with minor growth retardation, and without recent active infection. ResultsSix patients were included. The median age was 13 months (2 – 48 months) and median weight was 4. 6 kg (2. 3 – 12. 6 kg). Two patients had multiple left to right shunts and ventilator dependency. One with huge VSD presented at four years of age. Another with low body weight, large VSD and impaired LV function. Two more with early postoperative complications and ventilator dependency. In the first category, staged approach was essential. This was done by transcatheter closure of the PDA, followed by pulmonary artery banding. This approach lead to extubation. After proper nutrition, total correction was done. The patient who presented at four years of age underwent banding of PA, later surgical repair of VSD. Because of long postoperative ICU stay, he needed percutaneous closure of his residual VSD and then discharged. The patient with large muscular VSD and impaired LV function underwent percutaneous VSD closure with good result despite low weight (4. 2 kg). The last two patients; one needed balloon dilation of residual coarctation, the other because of severe obstruction to his bilateral Glenn anastomosis, underwent stenting of these stenosis.

Twenty-three percent were current and 48 % were previous pet-owners. Current pet-owners were younger than non-pet-owners (63. 5 vs. 72. 0 years, p =. 0003). Twelve patients (16 %) showed interest in AAA visits. However, only two patients agreed to an AAA visit. Both patients were visited once, but declined further visits. Hence, AAA sessions at home were poorly accepted, mainly because the patients considered themselves too busy or healthy, or due to a general disinterest in AAA.

40|$|Mitochondrial {{disorders}} {{recognized in}} the neonatal period usually present as a metabolic crisis combined with one or several organ manifestations. Liver disorder in association with a respiratory chain deficiency may be overlooked since liver dysfunction is common in <b>severely</b> <b>sick</b> newborn infants. Lactacidosis, hypoglycemia, elevated serum transaminases and conjugated bilirubin are common signs of mitochondrial hepatopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly may occur in severe cases. A clinical picture with fetal growth restriction, postnatal lactacidosis, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, and cholestasis, especially in combination with neurological symptoms or renal tubulopathy, should alert the neonatologist to direct investigations on mitochondrial disorder. A normal lactate level does not exclude respiratory chain defects. The most common liver manifestation caused by mutated mitochondrial DNA (deletion) is Pearson syndrome. Recently, mutations in several nuclear DNA genes have been identified that lead to mitochondrial hepatopathy, e. g. mitochondrial depletion syndrome caused by DGUOK, MPV 17, SUCLG 1, POLG 1, or C 10 ORF 2 mutations. A combination of lactacidosis, liver involvement, and Fanconi type renal tubulopathy is common when the complex III assembly factor BCS 1 L harbors mutations, the most severe disease with consistent genotype-phenotype correlation being the GRACILE syndrome. Mutations in nuclear translation factor genes (TRMU, EFG 1, and EFTu) of the respiratory chain enzyme complexes have recently been identified.

Materials and methods: the report is focused on three cases involving patients suffering from pyogenic liver abscess caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae in two hospitals in Bogota, Colombia, where phenotyping and hypermucoviscosity studies were carried out, {{as well as the}} genotyping of cultured Klebsiella isolates. Reults: {{it was found that the}} isolated microorganism in cases I and II corresponded to the same K. pneumoniae strain, having 100 % sequence identity for the 5 genes being studied while the strain in Case III was genotypically different. Conclusion: it is important to carry out multidisciplinary studies allowing all pyogenic liver abscess cases reported in Colombia to be complied to ascertain the frequency of microorganisms causing this pathology in our country, as well as a genotyping study of different K. pneumoniae strains to compare them and confirm clonal and pathogenicity relationships through housekeeping gene analysis...|$|E
40|$|Acute lower {{respiratory}} tract infections (ALRIs) are {{a major cause of}} death among young children in developing countries. A targeted programme designed to treat children with ALRI was implemented in 1988 in a primary health care project in rural Bangladesh. In the 2 years preceding the introduction of the programme (1986 - 87), non-ALRI-specific health services were provided, including promotion of oral rehydration therapy, family planning, immunization of children and mothers, distribution of vitamin A, referral of <b>severely</b> <b>sick</b> children to field clinics, and nutritional rehabilitation of malnourished children. The targeted ALRI programme, which was in place in 1988 - 89, was based on systematic ALRI case detection and management by community health workers, who were linked to a referral system for medical support. These two levels of intervention have been evaluated by comparing the ALRI-specific mortality in the programme area and a neighbouring control area during the two periods. During the first phase (1986 - 87), the ALRI mortality among under- 5 -year-olds was 28 % lower in the intervention than in the comparison area (P less than 0. 01). During the second phase (1988 - 89), the ALRI mortality was 32 % lower in the intervention area than during the preceding phase, while {{there was no significant difference}} for the comparison area. These findings suggest that in the study region the combination of specific and nonspecific interventions can reduce ALRI mortality by as much as 50 % and the overall mortality among under- 5 -year-olds by as much as 30 %...|$|E
40|$|Arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain-containing {{proteins}} and their phosphorylation by specific protein kinases constitute control circuits to regulate pre-mRNA splicing and coordinate splicing with transcription in mammalian cells. We present here {{the finding that}} similar SR networks exist in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We previously showed that Dsk 1 protein, originally described as a mitotic regulator, displays high activity in phosphorylating S. pombe Prp 2 protein (spU 2 AF 59), a homologue of human U 2 AF 65. We now demonstrate that Dsk 1 also phosphorylates two recently identified fission yeast proteins with RS repeats, Srp 1 and Srp 2, in vitro. The phosphorylated proteins bear the same phosphoepitope found in mammalian SR proteins. Consistent with its substrate specificity, Dsk 1 forms kinase-competent complexes with those proteins. Furthermore, dsk 1 + gene determines the phenotype of prp 2 + overexpression, providing in vivo evidence that Prp 2 is a target for Dsk 1. The dsk 1 -null mutant strain became <b>severely</b> <b>sick</b> with the additional deletion of a related kinase gene. Significantly, human SR protein-specific kinase 1 (SRPK 1) complements the growth defect of the double-deletion mutant. In conjunction with the resemblance of dsk 1 + and SRPK 1 in sequence homology, biochemical properties, and overexpression phenotypes, the complementation result indicates that SRPK 1 is a functional homologue of Dsk 1. Collectively, our studies illustrate the conserved SR networks in S. pombe consisting of RS domain-containing {{proteins and}} SR protein-specific kinases and thus establish {{the importance of the}} networks in eucaryotic organisms...|$|E
