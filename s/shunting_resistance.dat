5000|$|Although the ac Josephson effect {{provides}} {{a much more}} stable voltage reference than Weston cells, the first single-junction Josephson standards [...] were difficult to use because they generated very small voltages (1-10 mV). Several {{attempts were made to}} raise the voltage by connecting two or more junctions in series. The most ambitious of theseused 20 junctions in series to realize a voltage of 100 mV with an uncertainty of a few parts in 109. Ensuring that every junction was on a constant voltage step required individually adjusting the bias current to each of the 20 junctions. The difficulty of this procedure makes arrays of significantly more than 20 junctions impractical. [...] In 1977, Levinson et al.made a suggestion that would ultimately lead to a solution to the multiple-bias problem. Levinson pointed out the importance of the parameter [...] in determining the characteristics of rf-induced Josephson steps. [...] {{is a measure of the}} damping of Josephson oscillations by the junction <b>shunting</b> <b>resistance.</b> In particular, he showed that junctions with a large capacitance [...] and a large [...] could generate an I-V curve with hysteretic constant-voltage steps like those shown in Fig. 1b. These steps have become known as zero-crossing steps because they cross the zero-current axis of the I-V curve. The lack of stable regions between the first few steps means that for small dc bias currents, the junction voltage must be quantized. With a common bias current at or near zero, the voltage across a large array of these junctions must also be quantized. The possibility of obtaining constant-voltage steps at zero current over a wide range of junction and operating parameters suggested the possibility of building a voltage standard using large arrays of junctions.|$|E

In the standard equation, it includes series <b>resistance</b> (Rs) and <b>shunt</b> <b>resistance</b> (Rsh) with {{different types of}} parameters. Maximum simulation and modeling work done previously, related to single diode photovoltaic cell used this equation. However, there is another form of the standard equation which has not included Series <b>Resistance</b> (Rs) and <b>Shunt</b> <b>Resistance</b> (Rsh) yet, as the <b>Shunt</b> <b>Resistance</b> is {{much bigger than the}} load resistance and the load resistance is much bigger than the Series Resistance. For this phenomena, very small power loss occurs within a photovoltaic cell. This research focuses on the comparison of two forms of basic Shockley diode equation. This analysis describes a deep understanding of the photovoltaic cell, as well as gives understanding about Series <b>Resistance</b> (Rs) and <b>Shunt</b> <b>Resistance</b> (Rsh) behavior in the Photovoltaic cell. For making estimation of a real time photovoltaic system, faster calculation is needed.
