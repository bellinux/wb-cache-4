30|$|Factor Analysis {{based on}} PCA was {{employed}} to interpret underlying dataset and to identify possible sources of contamination through reduce new set of orthogonal variables called Principal components (PCs) which provide information in decreasing order of importance. Factor analysis revealed underlying structure of dataset by means of distance between variables in multi-dimensional space. Varimax rotation of PCs was used to derive and extract the Varimax Factor (VFs). Varimax factors with eigenvalue > 1 were retained. FA/PCA was applied on raw data separately for seasonal groups (i.e., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season) and spatial groups (HIIG, MIG, and LIG defined by HACA). Input data matrices (sites × variables) for FA/PCA in seasonal groups for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season were (16  ×  25). FA and PCA with Varimax rotation of <b>standardized</b> <b>component</b> loadings were conducted for extracting and deriving factors, respectively. Input data matrices (sites × variables) for spatial PCA/FA were (3  ×  25) for HIG, (5  ×  25) for MIG, and (8  ×  25) for LIG, respectively. Statistical analyses were made using Excel and STATISTICA software.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) are a {{fundamental}} <b>standardized</b> <b>component</b> of most cell phones used worldwide. A SIM {{can be removed}} from a phone handset and inserted into another, allowing users to port identity, personal information, and service between devices. All cell phones are expected to incorporate some type of identity module eventually, in part, because of this useful property. Some of the earliest, general purpose, forensic tools for cell phones targeted SIMs to recover digital evidence. While over time the capabilities and number of such tools have increased, they are not completely free of problems. Validating a forensic SIM tool is an essential quality assurance measure. It allows a forensic specialist {{to determine how to}} compensate for any shortcomings identified or whether to use one version of the tool in lieu of another. Tool manufacturers also benefit from rigorously validating their products before releasing them. However, creating reference SIMs that contain comprehensive test data can be time consuming and difficult to accomplish. This paper describes an approach for automating the population of test data onto SIMs to create reference material for use in tool validation. It also covers details of the implementation and explains characteristics of SIMs that pertain to the solution...|$|E

So CDSS can {{improve the quality of}} patient care. In CDSS, a core component is guideline which specifies best practice and evidence-based knowledge. For clinical guideline, several different approaches for modeling the clinical guideline have been proposed.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{solution to the}} high volume of excess foundry sands generated in metal casting facilities is to beneficially reuse them. A variety of possible reuse programs suit the utilization of foundry sands. These programs mainly relate to civil and agricultural applications, e. g., highway embankment, concrete, backfills, topsoil, and growing amendments. Foundry sand exhibits qualified physical, mechanical, or chemical properties for these end-use products and is acknowledged as a marketable resource. Most often, foundry sand is characterized to match a target material, which has been adopted as a <b>standardized</b> <b>component</b> in an end-use product, e. g. fine aggregate in concrete. If the match gives favorable outcomes, the foundry sand is introduced fully or partially replacing the target material to form a technically competitive end-use product, e. g. foundry sand used in concrete. In addition to its engineering qualifications, foundry sand’s environmental safety is also ensured to comply with regulations. The chemical characterization of foundry sand needs to be accomplished to demonstrate {{that it will not}} pose a thread to environments and human health during reuse programs.

40|$|Historically, {{researchers}} {{have shown the}} limitations of measuring complex cognition and inquiry processes via multiple-choice and constructed-response paper-and-pencil tests (Resnick & Resnick, 1992; Quellmalz & Haertel, 2004; NRC, 2006). These tests also demonstrate limited sensitivity to discrepancies between inquiry and non-inquiry based science instruction (Haertel, Lash, Javitz, & Quellmalz 2006). Attempts to address these limitations by designing hands-on and virtual performance assessments in late 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s encountered a number of technical, resource, and reliability problems in large-scale administration (Cronbach, Linn, Brennan, & Haertel, 1997; Shavelson, Ruiz-Primo, & Wiley, 1999). Then, these problems were substantial enough to undercut the potentially greater construct validity for science inquiry that performance assessments can provide over paper-and-pencil tests. However, virtual performance assessments based on modern interactive media could mitigate many of these historical problems, because today’s technologies have advanced capabilities such as data-tracking, access to large data sets, GIS map visualizations, ability to contrast visualizations of different data, and model phenomena that can’t be observed with the naked eye, that were not available a decade ago.

40|$|AbstractAttitude toward {{violence}} is a good predictor of violent behavior (Gellman & Delucia-Waack, 2006). Professionals, administrators, and teachers may develop appropriate strategies and intervention methods by assessing adolescents’ attitudes toward violence. Moreover, measuring attitudes toward violence {{can be useful in}} preventing violent behavior and assessing the effectiveness of training programs. In the present study, the Attitudes Towards Violence Scale (ATVS; Funk Elliott, Urman, Flores, & Mock, 1999) was studied with a group of Turkish adolescents. The original ATVS, a 15 -item, 5 -point, Likert-type instrument, was developed to measure attitudes toward violence among adolescence (Funk et al., 1999) with two subscales as “reactive violence” and “culture of violence. ” The sample of the study was 1953 students from 18 different high schools from 10 high school types in two cities; one of which is on the Blacksea region and the other is on the Middle Anatolian Region. In this group, there were 897 men (45. 9 %) and 1047 women (53. 6 %). Confirmatory factor analyses were specified and estimated. Because the factor structure of the original scale was not confirmed in the Turkish population, exploratory factor analysis was performed with a principal component analysis and varimax rotation. Results showed that the Turkish version of the ATVS contained two distinct, but related components. These two components are named as “reactive violence” and “culture of violence. ” Further evidence for construct validity was found through the <b>standardized</b> <b>component</b> loadings, which were all positive and statistically significant, ranging from. 27 to. 80. The reliability of the scale was investigated in terms of internal consistency of the 13 scale items and was found to be. 78...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{the current status}} of the nationwide implementation process of a sports and physical activity stimulation programme to gain insight into how sports and physical activity were integrated into Dutch rehabilitation care. METHODS: The current implementation status of a sports and physical activity stimulation programme in 12 rehabilitation centres and 5 hospitals with a rehabilitation department was described by scoring fidelity and satisfaction. Seventy-one rehabilitation professionals filled out a questionnaire on how sports and physical activity, including stimulation activities, were implemented into rehabilitation care. Total fidelity scores (in %) were calculated for each organization. Professionals' satisfaction was rated on a scale from 1 to 10. RESULTS: In most organizations sports and physical activity were to some extent integrated during and after rehabilitation (fidelity scores: median[*]=[*] 54 %, IQR[*]=[*] 23 %). Physical activity stimulation was not always embedded as standard component of a rehabilitation treatment. Professionals' satisfaction rated a median value of 8. 0 (IQR[*]=[*] 0. 0) indicating high satisfaction rates. CONCLUSIONS: The fidelity outcome showed that activities to stimulate sports and physical activity during and after rehabilitation were integrated into rehabilitation care, but not always delivered as <b>standardized</b> <b>component.</b> These findings have emphasized the importance to focus on integrating these activities into routines of organizations. Implications for Rehabilitation Components of an evidence-based programme to stimulate sports and physical activity during and after rehabilitation can be used to measure {{the current status of}} the integration of sports and physical activity in rehabilitation care in a structural and effective way.

40|$|Complicated and {{sophisticated}} requirements to today’s huge and complex software systems cause the following serious problems. 1. Difficulties in developing software systems reflecting many requirements which are mutually interrelated. (There could be various {{gaps between the}} requirements and the implementations.) 2. Difficulties in maintaining large-scale systems caused by additional and adhoc changes. Those difficulties lower the productivity of software development, especially in industrial applications or enterprise back-office applications which are usually based on large-scale and vague requirements. Two emerging technologies in software engineering for this decade have been tried to cope with such problems as the difficulties in implementation and maintenance of software systems. They are enterprise modeling and Component Based Software Development (CBSD). Enterprise modeling mainly deals with requirements, and helps us to build accurate enterprise models {{which would be a}} part of the requirements definition for software systems. On the other hand, CBSD mainly focuses on software systems, and provides us with convenient ways to develop software systems using reusable components, with the assistance of <b>standardized</b> <b>component</b> specifications, inter-component communications, and system assembly methods. Those technologies provide us with various practical methods to construct software systems based on requirements models by reusing components, and contribute to productivity improvement of software system development. However, due to insufficient formalism in those technologies, we often have to make considerable efforts for applying them to real applications. This thesis proposes a formal approach to construct software systems in CBSD environments, which covers from requirements modeling to software system evaluation. The following four kinds of formal methods are used in this thesis, that is: 1.
