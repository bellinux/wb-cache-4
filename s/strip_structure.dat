40|$|The {{electronic}} {{states and}} magnetotransport properties of quantum waveguides (QW’s) {{in the presence}} of nonuniform magnetic fields perpendicular to the QW plane are investigated theoretically. It is found that the magnetoconductance of those structures as a function of Fermi energy exhibits stepwise variation or square-wave-like oscillations, depending on the specific distributions (both in magnitude and direction) of nonuniform magnetic fields in QW’s. We have investigated the dual magnetic <b>strip</b> <b>structures</b> and three magnetic <b>strip</b> <b>structures.</b> The character of the magnetotransport is closely related to the effective magnetic potential and the energy-dispersion spectrum of electron in the structures. It is found that dispersion relations seem to be combined by different sets of dispersion curves that belong to different individual magnetic subwaveguides. The magnetic effective potential leads to the coupling of states and the substantial distortion of the original dispersion curves at the interfaces in which the abrupt change of magnetic fields appears. Magnetic scattering states are created. Only in some three magnetic <b>strip</b> <b>structures,</b> these scattering states produce the dispersion relations with oscillation structures superimposed on the bulk Landau levels.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of the plasmonic thin-film solar cell with the periodic <b>strip</b> <b>structure</b> is presented in this paper. The finite-difference frequency-domain method is employed to discretize the inhomogeneous wave function for modeling the solar cell.

The parameter extraction methods for the zeroth-order reflectance and the absorbed power density are also discussed, which is important for testing and optimizing the solar cell design. For the numerical results, the physics of the absorption peaks of the amorphous silicon thin-film solar cell are explained by electromagnetic theory; these peaks correspond to the waveguide mode, Floquet mode, surface plasmon resonance, and the constructively interference between adjacent metal strips.

Secondly, through exact full-field calculations, we demonstrate that high refractive index spherical resonators present such topologically protected features. Furthermore, we calculate the polarization structure of light around the generated C lines, unveiling a Möbius <b>strip</b> <b>structure</b> in the main axis of the polarization ellipse.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to understand the structure of trapped intermetallics particles and localized composition changes in the anodized anodic oxide film on AA 1050 aluminium substrates. Design/methodology/approach - The morphology and composition of Fe-containing intermetallic particles incorporated into the anodic oxide films on industrially pure aluminium (AA 1050, 99. 5 per cent) has been investigated. AM 050 aluminium was anodized in a 100 ml/l sulphuric acid bath with an applied voltage of 14 V at 20 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C for 10 or 120 min. The anodic film subsequently was analyzed using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), SEM, and EDX. Findings - The intermetallic particles in the substrate material consisted of Fe or both Fe and Si with two different structures: irregular and round shaped. FIB-SEM cross-sectioned images revealed that the irregular-shaped particles were embedded in the anodic oxide film as a thin <b>strip</b> <b>structure</b> and located near the top surface of the film, whereas the round-shaped particles were trapped in the film with a spherical structure, but partially dissolved and were located throughout {{the thickness of the}} anodic film.

40|$|A key {{objective}} {{in the design}} of any sports stadium is to include the maximum number of spectators with minimum obstruction in the visual cone. This functional requirement often results in employing one or more cantilevered tiers, which in turn culminates in more slender grandstands often with relatively low natural frequencies and modal damping ratios. These natural frequencies may sometimes fall in the range of frequencies of human movement, which can possibly excite the structure in resonance resulting in vibration serviceability issues. One of the available techniques to reduce excessive responses is to use passive vibration control techniques such as Tuned Mass Dampers (TMD). However, the off-tuning problem is a potential drawback of this technique, whereby changes in natural frequencies caused by crowd-structure interaction may detune the TMDs. This thesis presents a study into the possibility of using Hybrid Tuned Mass Dampers (HTMDs) to augment the vibration serviceability of structures. An appropriate control algorithm is developed. It shows a comparative analysis of vibration mitigation performances that are likely to be attained by utilising the proposed HTMD. Also, an appropriate control scheme is utilised with the proposed HTMD to deal with the off-tuning issues in TMDs caused by crowd loading, and is shown to be effective. In addition, it shows a comparative experimental investigation of a passive TMD and a prototype HTMD applied on a slab <b>strip</b> <b>structure.</b> The most effective control algorithm to enhance the performance of the HTMD and also deal with the off-tuning problem is investigated.

40|$|A {{triangular}} mesh is the {{piecewise linear}} approximation of a sampled or analytical surface, when each patch is a triangle. The connectivity of the mesh can be easily represented using its dual graph. Each node of such a graph has at most three incident edges; if the surface is homeomorphic to a sphere, each node has exactly three incident edges. Several triangular meshes, representing the same surface, with {{an increasing number of}} triangles are a representation of the surface at different levels of detail (LOD). When the number of triangles from one LOD to another varies continuously we call such a structure a continuous level of detail (CLOD) approximation of the surface. Given a CLOD data structure we can extract, at each level, the mesh representing the surface and derive its dual graph. If we group the triangles forming each mesh in strips, to accelerate their rendering, we should use two colors for the dual graph’s edges to distinguish between the edges linking nodes belonging to the same strip or not. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} present a set of rules to recolor the dual graph of the mesh when passing from one LOD to the next and back. The operations used to change the mesh are a Vertex Split (VS) when the resolution increases, and an Edge Collapse (EC) when the resolution decreases. We can, then, use a local topological analysis to derive the rules allowing to recolor the graph, and to show that, under certain conditions, the recoloring is optimal. This allows to keep effectively an optimal triangle <b>strip</b> <b>structure</b> over the mesh, while changing its resolution. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this article, two {{coplanar}} waveguide-fed {{high gain}} multiband antennas {{with and without}} uniplanar copper strip-based electromagnetic band gap (CS-EBG) structure are proposed for portable wireless applications at 2. 1, 2. 4, 3. 5, 5. 2, 5. 4, and 5. 8 GHz. The initial multiband antenna is realized by patch-ground shape modification and open-ended rectangular slot insertion on the patch. The two layer uniplanar CS-EBG structure is composed of square ring periodic elements of copper strips of different widths and gaps. The top unit cells are placed at an offset position {{with respect to the}} bottom layer, which is new technique applied to obtain multiple resonances from such a simple and compact planar structure. The antenna, when combined with the CS-EBG structure, still preserved its multiband characteristics and produced directional pattern because of the reflecting property (like artificial magnetic conductor, AMC) of the CS-EBG/AMC structure behind it, which was donut and omnidirectional shape in case of the antenna alone. The initial antenna gain is 5 dBi while the final antenna gain is improved to approximately 12 dBi at the first band and more than 6 dBi at other bands. Thus, the developed square ring copper <b>strip</b> <b>structure</b> is very effective to improve the antenna performances and finally resulted in a high gain antenna. Both of the configurations with and without the CS-EBG/AMC are fabricated and tested, and the measurements are well agreed with the simulations.

Systematic reproduction and distribution, duplication of any material in this paper for a fee or for commercial purposes, or modification {{of the content of}} the paper are prohibited. Current sport stadia designs focus mainly on maximizing audience capacity and providing a clear view for all spectators. Hence, incorporation of one or more cantilevered tiers is typical in these designs. However, employing such cantilevered tiers, usually with relatively low damping and natural frequencies, can make grandstands more susceptible to excitation by human activities. This is caused by the coincidence between the activity frequencies (and their lowest three harmonics) and the structural natural frequencies hence raising the possibility of resonant vibration. This can be both a vibration serviceability and a safety issue. Past solutions to deal with observed or anticipated vibration serviceability problems have been mainly passive methods, such as tuned mass dampers (TMDs). These techniques have exhibited problems such as lack of performance and offtuning caused by human-structure interaction. To address this issue, research is currently underway to investigate the possible application of hybrid TMDs (HTMDs), which are a combination of active and passive control, to improve the vibration serviceability of such structures under human excitation.
