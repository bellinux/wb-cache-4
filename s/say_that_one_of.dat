5|$|The {{origin of}} the name of the pub is unclear, but one {{reported}} theory is that it was named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664. Local people <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the beams in the pub comes from the ship, the remains of which may have been broken up at a nearby shipyard after the battle. Another theory is that it was named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E
500|$|A direct {{relationship}} between the real Clyde and the fictional Winesburg, however, remains the supposition of scholars. Anderson wrote in A Writer's Conception of Realism that he reacted with [...] "shock" [...] when he [...] "...heard people <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my own books Winesburg, Ohio, was an exact picture of Ohio village life." [...] The author went on to admit that, [...] "the hint for almost every character was taken from my fellow lodgers in a large rooming house..." [...] These lodgers were the [...] "...young musicians, young writers, painters, actors..." [...] and others that lived in proximity to Anderson on the North Side of Chicago and to whom he referred as [...] "The Little Children of the Arts". The truth probably lies somewhere in between, with memories of Clyde [...] "merging" [...] with Anderson's interactions at the boardinghouse.|$|E
2500|$|Whenever {{the persons}} in the masks gave a signal, {{the people who were}} in the queues were taken away from the queue to a side. [...] When this {{operation}} was completed, 158 persons who were pulled out from the queues were taken away by the Army despite the protests by their kith and kin. [...] There was evidence to show that the arrests were done by the Kommathurai Army camp with the assistance of personnel from other army camps as well and that the following Army officers were directing the operations as Capt. Munas, Capt. Palitha, Capt. Gunarathna, Major. Majeed, and [...] Major. Monan. Some of these names were alias. There was also evidence to show that one Gerry de Silva had visited the refugee camp on [...] 8 September. 1990 and had told the officers responsible for the administration of the refugee camp that all 158 persons who were taken into custody on 5 September 1990 were found guilty. [...] However he had declined to say what had happened to them after they were found guilty. There was further evidence to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the officers who were in charge of the refugee camp made a request to the army personnel in charge of the operations, to give a list of persons arrested for which there was no response.|$|E

2500|$|When the two steamers {{began their}} journey {{down the coast}} again, it wasn't long before they found three of the prahus. The water was shallow that the Rainbow had the Jolly Bachelor in tow and her captain, the rajah mudah, {{intended}} to release the other ship {{as soon as they}} were in a good firing position. Brooke then asked his Sarawakian followers if the three vessels in front of him were that of pirates, to be sure, and they said yes, so as soon as the Sulus realised they were under attack they began killing the captives while fleeing to dangerous waters. Father McDougall later wrote the following; [...] "So we took to our stations, loaded our guns, and prepared for action. The leading boat had already gained on the other two and was going nearly as fast as the steamer herself. I never saw fellows pull so. We put on all steam, cast off the Jolly, and tried to get in between her and the point, but she beat us, and passed inside of us into shallow water, where we could not follow. Then she opened her fire upon us, which we returned with interest. She, like the others, had no heavy guns, but they all carried three long brass swivels, called lelahs, and plenty of rifles and muskets." [...] The bishop went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the captured pirates revealed to him that each of their swivels took seven men to lift and there was forty rifles and muskets aboard each boat, or more.|$|E

6000|$|People {{who have}} seen <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the quaintest {{spectacles}} of human frailty is an outbreak of hysterics in a girls' school. It starts without warning, generally on a hot afternoon, among the elder pupils. A girl giggles till the giggle gets beyond control. Then she throws up her head and cries, [...] "Honk, honk, honk," [...] like a wild goose, and tears mix with the laughter. If the mistress be wise, she will rap out something severe {{at this point to}} check matters. If she be tender-hearted, and send for a drink of water, the chances are largely in favour of another girl laughing at the afflicted one and herself collapsing. Thus the trouble spreads, and may end in half of what answers to the Lower Sixth of a boys' school rocking and whooping together. Given a week of warm weather, two stately promenades per diem, a heavy mutton and rice meal {{in the middle of the}} day, a certain amount of nagging from the teachers, and a few other things, some amazing effects develop. At least, this is what folk say who have had experience.|$|E

"All of {{a sudden}} I remembered that oil in the can; but just as I was puttin' my fingers on the cork my {{conscience}} smote me. `Am I goin' to use this oil,' I said to myself, `and let my sister-in-law's husband be wrecked for want of it?' And then I thought that he wouldn't want it all that night, and perhaps they would buy oil the next day, and so I poured out about a tumblerful {{of it on the}} water, and I can just tell you sailormen that you never saw anything act as prompt as that did. In three seconds, or perhaps five, the water all around me, for the distance of a small front yard, was just as flat as a table and as smooth as glass, and so invitin' in appearance that the three gulls jumped out of the boat and began to swim about on it, primin' their feathers and lookin' at themselves in the transparent depths, though I must <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them made an awful face as he dipped his bill into the water and tasted kerosene.|$|E
60|$|And now we will {{cross the}} water, {{and with this}} object will return by the bridge out of Goat Island, on the main land of the American side. But as we do so, let me <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the great charms of Niagara {{consists}} in this: that over and above that one great object of wonder and beauty, {{there is so much}} little loveliness-- loveliness especially of water I mean. There are little rivulets running here and there over little falls, with pendent boughs above them, and stones shining under their shallow depths. As the visitor stands and looks through the trees, the rapids glitter before him, and then hide themselves behind islands. They glitter and sparkle in far distances under the bright foliage, till the remembrance is lost, and one knows not which way they run. And then the river below, with its whirlpool,--but we shall come to that by-and-by, and to the mad voyage which was made down the rapids by that mad captain who ran the gantlet of the waters at the risk of his own life, with fifty to one against him, in order that he might save another man's property from the sheriff.|$|E
