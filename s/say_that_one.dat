5|$|The {{origin of}} the name of the pub is unclear, but one {{reported}} theory is that it was named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664. Local people <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of the beams in the pub comes from the ship, the remains of which may have been broken up at a nearby shipyard after the battle. Another theory is that it was named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E

25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so {{how is it possible}} to speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One may <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
500|$|A direct {{relationship}} between the real Clyde and the fictional Winesburg, however, remains the supposition of scholars. Anderson wrote in A Writer's Conception of Realism that he reacted with [...] "shock" [...] when he [...] "...heard people <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of my own books Winesburg, Ohio, was an exact picture of Ohio village life." [...] The author went on to admit that, [...] "the hint for almost every character was taken from my fellow lodgers in a large rooming house..." [...] These lodgers were the [...] "...young musicians, young writers, painters, actors..." [...] and others that lived in proximity to Anderson on the North Side of Chicago and to whom he referred as [...] "The Little Children of the Arts". The truth probably lies somewhere in between, with memories of Clyde [...] "merging" [...] with Anderson's interactions at the boardinghouse.|$|E

The episode's setpiece was pitched by Selman, and originated from a discussion he had with current showrunner Al Jean, about [...] "how much crap there is at the movie theater before the movie actually begins." [...] The episode's plot was also pitched by Selman, who had wanted to do an [...] episode with a [...] "jaws-wired-shut plot" [...] for a while. It was not until long after the episode was completed that Selman learned that one can in fact talk [...] with one's jaw wired shut. He learned this from fellow Simpsons writer Brian Kelley, who had had his jaw wired shut once in high school. Kelley joined the writing staff during the writing stage of the episode, however {{he did not mention}} that one could talk, since {{he did not want to}} [...] "ruin" [...] the episode. However, he did <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> should eat a lot before since one will lose weight when their jaw is wired shut. These trivias were subsequently included in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Keller also {{discusses}} {{a primary}} {{critic of the}} long poem, Kamboureli, in her essay. Kamboureli's stance is that long poem's readers and contributors should not preference one form of long poem over another. To extend this idea, it is also equally important to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> type of author within this genre should not be privileged over another. The textual [...] "betweeness", an idea coined by Kamboureli and discussed in Keller's essay, provides a place where writers can create their art in a genre that is by its nature less restrictive than other poetic forms. [...] This lack of restriction should be the very reason that the genre should be open to all. [...] Its hybridisms and variety will only be enhanced {{by the presence of}} women and other writers.|$|E

The Protestants, Unionists and Loyalists who come from that area are happy to call themselves Derrymen. It was a matter that did not provoke excitement and it certainly was not taken as being an offensive remark to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> was from Derry. Then, in the 1960s, as part of a deliberate campaign by Republicans to loosen the London connection, they emphasised that they had dropped the name London from the name of the city.

2500|$|In 2011, Father Edward McNamara, {{professor}} of liturgy {{and dean of}} theology at the Regina Apostolorum university in Rome, said that, for Catholics, assistance at Mass celebrated by priests of the Society {{is not necessarily a}} sin: [...] "It would only become so if a person attended this Mass with the deliberate intention of separating himself from communion with the Pope and those in communion with him." [...] However, he concluded: [...] "Only if there is objectively no alternative should one attend the Mass celebrated by a priest from the Society of St. Pius X. If one has to do so, then I would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> may go in good conscience." [...] He added: [...] "At the same time, it is our ardent prayer and desire, as it should be for all Catholics, that the doctrinal issues with the Society of St. Pius X will be resolved as soon as possible so that these priests may return to full communion and canonical good standing within the Church." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Chinese {{authorities}} have been cautious {{not to have}} CIs act as direct promoters of the party's political viewpoints, a few suggest that the Confucius Institutes function in this way. Officials <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> important goal of the Institutes is to influence other countries' view of China. Peng Ming-min, a Taiwan independence activist and politician, claims that colleges and universities where a Confucius Institute is established have to sign a contract in which they declare their support for Beijing's [...] "One China" [...] policy. As a result, both Taiwan and Tibet become taboos at the institutes. However, this claim is in dispute. Michael Nylan, professor of Chinese history at the University of California at Berkeley, stated that CIs have become less heavy-handed in their demands, and have learnt from [...] "early missteps", such as insisting that universities adopt a policy that Taiwan is part of China. Nylan's survey of faculty and administrators at fifteen universities with Confucius Institutes revealed two reports that institutes had exerted pressure to block guest speakers, but both events went ahead anyway.|$|E
2500|$|The long poem Omeros by Derek Walcott {{has drawn}} mixed {{criticism}} {{on whether it}} {{should or should not}} be tied to the traditional epic form. [...] Those against that idea say that the poem's story is not as important as those found in traditional epics. [...] Omeros tells the tale of fishermen in the Caribbean fighting over and lusting after a waitress instead of a typically heroic tale of battles and quests. [...] On {{the other side of the}} argument lies the point that it is important to keep in mind that Omeros has ties to the epic genre, if only as a contrast. [...] By putting more simple characters in the forefront as opposed to warriors, Walcott revises the traditional epic form, which these critics say is something to notice as opposed to cutting off Omeros from any ties to the epic whatsoever. [...] Furthermore, these critics <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> cannot ignore the epic influence on the poem since its characters' names are taken from Homer. [...] In Omeros there are distinct elements obviously influenced by traditional epics, such as a trip to the underworld, talk of a muse, etc.|$|E

[...] There was evidence to show that the arrests were done by the Kommathurai Army camp with the assistance of personnel from other army camps as well and that the following Army officers were directing the operations as Capt. Munas, Capt. Palitha, Capt. Gunarathna, Major. Majeed, and [...] Major. Monan. Some of these names were alias.

Brooke then asked his Sarawakian followers if the three vessels in front of him were that of pirates, to be sure, and they said yes, so as soon as the Sulus realised they were under attack they began killing the captives while fleeing to dangerous waters. Father McDougall later wrote the following; [...] "So we took to our stations, loaded our guns, and prepared for action. The leading boat had already gained on the other two and was going nearly as fast as the steamer herself. I never saw fellows pull so. We put on all steam, cast off the Jolly, and tried to get in between her and the point, but she beat us, and passed inside of us into shallow water, where we could not follow. Then she opened her fire upon us, which we returned with interest. She, like the others, had no heavy guns, but they all carried three long brass swivels, called lelahs, and plenty of rifles and muskets." [...] The bishop went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of the captured pirates revealed to him that each of their swivels took seven men to lift and there was forty rifles and muskets aboard each boat, or more.|$|E
