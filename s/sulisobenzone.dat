40|$|Topical {{ketoprofen}} (KP) {{is widely}} used because of its anti-inflammatory effect. However, photocontact dermatitis is a side-effect. Between May 2001 and June 2002, the Belgian Contact & Environmental Dermatitis Group conducted a prospective, open patch and photopatch test study in 20 patients suspected of KP dermatitis. Severe skin symptoms requiring systemic corticotherapy occurred in 47 %. 5 patients were hospitalized. 1 patient showed prolonged photosensitivity. All patients were tested with KP and the other constituents of KP gel. Attribution to KP was demonstrated in all cases. Patch and photopatch tests with KP 2 % in petrolatum showed contact photoallergy in 17 patients, contact allergy in 1 patient and photoaggravated contact allergy in 2 patients. 5 patients also reacted to the fragrance components lavender (Lavandula augustifolia) oil and/or neroli (Citrus aurantium dulcis) oil 5 % in alcohol. However, in 4 of these, irritant reactions to the ethanolic dilutions could not be ruled out. Additional tests with 3 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs without benzophenone structure ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac identified only 1 contact allergic reaction to diclofenac. Cross-reactivity to the substituted benzophenones, oxybenzone and <b>sulisobenzone</b> occurred only to the first in less than 30 % of the patients. A high frequency (69 %) of contact allergy to fragrance mix was found. Dermatologists {{should be aware of}} the severity of photoallergic reactions to KP and the risk of cross-sensitization.

40|$|International audiencePhototoxicity {{inducing}} in vivo photoirritation, a reversible inflammatory {{reaction of}} the skin after chemical contact and UVA radiation exposure, is increasingly observed as a side effect {{associated with the use}} of both cosmetics and systemic drugs. In order to systematically screen for the phototoxic potential of new compounds, we propose two three-dimensional models suitable for in vitro testing: a dermal equivalent (DE) and a skin equivalent (SE) model. The DE model includes a collagen-glycosaminoglycans-chitosan porous matrix populated by normal human fibroblasts. The SE model is made by seeding normal human keratinocytes onto the DE, leading to a fully differentiated epidermis. The objectives of this pilot study are: 1) to compare the deleterious effects of UVA radiation on the two models and 2) to evaluate to what extent the in vitro results can predict the in vivo phototoxicity caused by well-known photoirritant compounds, included in the COLIPA validation phototoxicity reference chemical list. Dilutions of thiourea, <b>sulisobenzone,</b> promethazine, chlorpromazine and tetracycline were applied (20 microliters) onto DEs and SEs (n = 6) and incubated for 1 h (or 15 h) at 37 degrees C. Irradiated samples received 3 J/cm 2 UVA. The 24 h post-irradiation residual cellular viability was measured using the MTT test on treated and untreated tissues and IL- 1 alpha release measurement in collected SE culture media. A concordance in terms of photoirritant/non-photoirritant was obtained between the in vivo data and the in vitro results, suggesting that the DE and the SE models could be integrated, after a complete validation study, into a protocol for in vitro testing of the photoirritant potential of new molecules.
