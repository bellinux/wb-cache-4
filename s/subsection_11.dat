Methods: The concordance between generic medicines {{listed in the}} WMLEM 2009 (standard reference list) and the LPLEM 2006 (comparator list) was evaluated. Results: The total number of Basic Essential Medicines (BEMs) listed on the WMLEM 2009 was 347. The total number of generic medicines listed on the LPLEM was 584. Although the LPLEM has more listed medicines, only 270 (77. 6 %) of BEMs from the WMLEM were listed as available. However, 25 of the 77 missing medicines were deemed to have appropriate alternatives. A total of 52 medicines from the WMLEM 2009 were therefore missing from the LPLEM. Discrepancies compared to the WMLEM 2009 were identified in 15 out of 29 therapeutic sections. The highest discrepancy rate from the WMLEM 2009 was in the anti-infective section (35 missing medicines). Missing BEMs were noted in many subclassifications of the anti-infective medicines section, but omissions were particularly prevalent in the antibacterial medicines <b>subsection</b> (<b>11</b> missing medicines). Antituberculosis medications had the highest discrepancy rate for antibacterial BEMs with one-third of the single medicines recommended by the WHO in the WMLEM 2009 not listed on the LPLEM. Of the 314 additional medicines on the LPLEM, 18 were deemed to be irrational non-essential medicines. Conclusion: The LPLEM does not include several essential medicines recommended by the WHO in the WMLEM 2009. These discrepancies may have serious public health implications for management of some infectious diseases, particularly, tuberculosis and HIV...|$|E
40|$|Chaplygin [9] {{proved the}} integrability by quadratures of a round sphere, rolling without {{slipping}} on a horizontal plane, with {{center of mass}} {{at the center of}} the sphere, but with arbitrary moments of inertia. Although the system is integrable in every sense of the word, it neither arises as a Hamiltonian system, nor is the integrability an immediate consequence of the symmetries. On the other hand, the constants of motion are obtained as a consequence of Noether’s principle, cf. Section 1 and 2. The system also turns out to be related to a Hamiltonian system, the geodesic flow on the Euclidean motion group for a left invariant metric, cf. Subsection 9. 3. In this paper we analyse the global dynamics of Chaplygin’s sphere. In the process we will explain almost all of Chaplygin’s results. Readers who are mainly interested in these may consult Sections 1, 2, 3, 7, Subsections 9. 2, 11. 2, 11. 3, 11. 5, and Section 12. These can be read independently from the rest of the paper with some exceptions, such as Subsection 9. 2 in which Subsection 9. 1 has been used. At the end of each section we describe in a subsection ”Chaplygin ” the relation between our text and Chaplygin’s. We also obtain some new results, such as the proof in Section 4 that the level sets of the constants of motion in the reduced phase space are two-dimensional tori. In Section 8 we prove that, after a suitable time reparametrization, the rotational motion is quasi-periodic on two-dimensional tori. After suitable completion of the level surfaces, this is also true for the complexified system, cf. Section 10. This shows that the rotational motion is algebraically integrable according to the definition of Adler and van Moerbeke. In <b>Subsection</b> <b>11.</b> 4 it is explained how this also follows, in a quite different way, from Chaplygin’s integration in terms of hyperelliptic integrals. 1 Noether’s Principle for Nonholomic Systems We use the equations of motion for a system with nonholonomic constraints as given by d’Alembert’s principle 〈[L] γ (t), v 〉 = 0 for every v ∈ Cγ(t), (1. 1) A large part of this work has been done during a sabbatical leave in Berkeley, in the fall of 1994, partially supported by AFOSR Contract AFO F 49629 - 92.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The bequest of a {{usufruct}} {{to one or}} more interim usufructuaries for {{a limited}} period after the decease of the first usufructuary is often utilised by estate planners to reduce the value of the ceasing limited interest and thus to effect a saving in respect of estate duty. The saving in respect of estate duty is effected {{due to the fact that}} - the value of the ceasing limited interest in the estate of the first usufructuary is calculated only over the duration of the period during which the interim usufructuary is entitled to the limited interest and not also over the life expectancy of the ultimate beneficiary, and - that, on the cessation of the interim usufruct due to the efflux of time. no estate duty is payable. The very first reference to this method appeared in an article published in The Taxpayer during 1965. Other authors like Meyerowitz, Silke and Stein and Davis, Beneke and Jooste also referred to this method without analysing it or investigating the legality thereof. All the aforementioned authors relied to a certain extent for their views on a judgment of acting judge Warner in Bassett v Commissioner for Inland Revenue (1 961 4 SA 769 (D)). This dissertation is therefore aimed at investigating the legality of the method and to focus on a few practical aspects regarding the application thereof as an estate planning instrument. An analysis of the wording of the charging clause (section II (a) (1) of the Estate Duty Act and the valuation clause (section 5 (1) of the act) has led to the belief that, in considering the validity of the method, it is extremely important to bear in mind the principles applicable to the vesting of testamentary rights. In terms of the valuation clause of the Estate Duty Ad the value of a ceasing limited interest for estate duty purposes is determined by capitalising the annual value of the right of enjoyment of the properly in which the deceased held any such limited interest to the extent to which the person who, upon the cessation of the said interest of the deceased in consequence of the death of the deceased, becomes entitled to any right of enjoyment of such properly. In terms of the charging clause "the person to whom any advantage accrues by the death of the deceased" is liable for the payment of estate duty in respect of the cessation of a limited right. In order to calculate the value of a ceasing limited interest and to determine the liability for payment of estate duty in respect thereof it is necessary to determine (a) the extent to which a successor in title of a deceased in consequence of the death of the deceased has become entitled to any right of enjoyment, and (b) to which person any advantage has accrued by the death of the deceased. After analysing the wording of section 5 (1) (b) and section 11 (a) (1) the writer has come to the following conclusions: (a) In the case of an interim usufruct the right of enjoyment of the first usufructury has to be capitalised only over the period of currency of the interim usufruct and not also over the life expectancy of the owner of the nuda proprietas. (b) Subsection 5 (l) (b) does not make provision for the valuation of an interim usufruct at the termination them due to the efflux of time. (c) Upon the decease of the first usufructuary an advantage as contemplated in section 11 (a) (1) accrues to the interim usufructury but not to the owner of the nuda proprietas. (d) On the cessation of an interim usufruct due to the efflux of time there is no person to whom any advantage accrues by the death of a deceased as contemplated in <b>subsection</b> <b>11</b> (a) (1), and consequently the owner of the nuda proprietas does not at that stage incur any liability for estate duty. In view of the aforegoing considerations the writer has come to the conclusion that the utilisation of this method does not constitute a contravention the provisions of the Estate Duty Ad. The artificiality of the valuation method prescribed in terms of subsection 5 (1) (b) lends itself to reducing the value of a limited interest by interposing a successor for a short period between the deceased and the ultimate beneficiary. It follows therefore that the utilisation of this method does not constitute tax evasion. Where the main consideration for the appointment of an intermediary usufructuary is not so much the possible benefit that may acme to the intermediary as the limitation of estate duty, the application of the method may constitute an avoidance of estate duty. The Estate Duty Act, however, does not contain any general anti-avoidance provision similar to section 103 of the lncome Tax Act. In utilising this method estate planners should therefore bear in mind the possibility that the fiscus may sooner or later introduce an amendment to the Estate Duty Act to close this loophole.

ConclusionFor the first time, anaphylaxis is now properly classified and has attained greater visibility within ICD. In addition to all the benefits expected from the actions we have undertaken in updating the terminology, definitions and classification of allergic and hypersensitivity conditions for ICD- 11, we strongly believe that anaphylaxis should be a public health priority and that it should therefore be formally added into the list of rare diseases in order to support awareness and quality clinical management of patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{involved in}} the taxonomy of the genus Crassula, such as the extensive variation and often difficult species complexes, vicariousness and hybridization, are sketched against a historical background. These difficulties have prompted the author to review concepts of taxa from subspecific to generic level and have also led to the approach adopted in this work. It is argued that in several genera and sections, as previously recognized, too much stress {{was placed on the}} several floral characters which form part of a pollination syndrome which is shown up by convergent developments of these flower types. The different types of seedling morphology recognized are considered in relation to the morphology of adult plants and their affinities at specific and sectional level. The distribution of the hydathodes has proved useful in the delimitation of supra-specific taxau ThB morphology of the developing seedlings and the distribution of the hydathodes on the leaves become the main arguments for a new classification in the genus Crassula. A cytological review stresses the different basic chromosome numbers (8, 7) and their structural differences for the delimitation of the subgenera. Problems in determining the original basic number and the high percentage of polyploidy with various rainfall conditions are evaluated. Subsequently the characteristics and affinities of Crassula and its subgeneric taxa are briefly discussed. The key to the species, subspecies and varieties is divided into twelve groups which are similar to sections or groups of sections recognized.
