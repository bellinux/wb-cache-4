40|$|Stock <b>splits</b> are a {{relatively}} new phenomenon in the Indian context. This paper examines the market effect of stock <b>splits</b> on stock price, return, volatility, and trading volume around the <b>split</b> ex-dates for a sample of stock <b>splits</b> undertaken in the Indian stock market over the period 1999 – 2005. The traditional view of stock <b>splits</b> as cosmetic transactions that simply divide the same pie into more slices is inconsistent with the significant wealth effect associated with the announcement of a stock <b>split.</b> However, the empirical evidence confirms {{a negative effect on}} price and return of stock <b>splits.</b> The overall cumulative abnormal returns after the <b>split</b> are negative. These results suggest that stock <b>splits</b> have induced the market to revise its optimistic valuation about future firm performance, rejecting signaling hypothesis to which <b>splits</b> convey positive information to markets. Hence, stock <b>splits</b> have reduced the wealth of the shareholders. The results also show that presence of a positive effect on volatility and trading volume following the <b>split</b> events, thus suggesting that <b>split</b> events enhance liquidity.
