40|$|Inferences of site {{function}} from <b>stone</b> <b>tool</b> function {{based upon}} tool typologies are {{very common in}} the contemporary archaeological literature. A brief review of some ethnographic and archaeological studies confirms the long standing proposition that <b>stone</b> <b>tool</b> shape does not always correlate to the particular function and that some <b>stone</b> <b>tool</b> shapes may have been effective for multiple functions. It is shown that processes such as tool production and tool use as well as situational constraints encountered by tool makers are responsible {{for much of the}} variability in <b>stone</b> <b>tool</b> shape and that these processes and constraints should be accounted for when building <b>stone</b> <b>tool</b> typologies. As a result, it is argued that site functions can not be inferred from artifact functions based upon morphological typologies in all cases. Andrefsky, Jr., William. (1997).

Some of these tools belong to the Mousterian industry, which are associated with Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered there, indicating occupation between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.|$|E

This study was conducted to determine whether these two <b>stone</b> <b>tool</b> production periods could also be distinguished based solely on debitage, or the by-products of <b>stone</b> <b>tool</b> production. Goals included accurately analyzing and classifying <b>stone</b> <b>tool</b> flakes from an Early Paleoindian site, a Late Paleoindian site, and two Terminal Archaic sites, based on morphology, material, and possible geographical sources.

5|$|A Corded Ware culture princely burial {{was found}} in Szczytna, Subcarpathian Voivodeship. The grave, well-secured three meters below the surface, {{contained}} a man's skeleton and a funerary gift collection of highly valuable copper decorations, containers, <b>stone</b> <b>tools</b> and arrowheads. The uniquely equipped burial of a warrior-chief has close analogies with finds from Transylvania, a testimony to geographically extensive contacts of Corded Ware culture nomadic people.|$|E
5|$|By about 5500BC, small tribes {{living in}} the Nile valley had {{developed}} {{into a series of}} cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry, and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads.

5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} workings by Native Americans. Native copper {{is known to have}} been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive <b>stone</b> <b>tools</b> between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} {{in what is now}} Pennsylvania since at least 10,000BC. The first {{settlers}} were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their <b>stone</b> <b>tools.</b> The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000to 1000BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000BC and 1500AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrows, and ornaments.|$|E
5|$|The Barnhouse Settlement is {{a cluster}} of at least fifteen buildings, {{including}} one {{that may have been}} used for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch. Pottery of the grooved ware type, flints and <b>stone</b> <b>tools</b> have been found, as well as three flakes of pitchstone thought to have come from the Isle of Arran.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlement}} of Madagascar {{is a subject}} of ongoing research and debate. Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and <b>stone</b> <b>tools</b> in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000BC. Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between 350BC and 550AD, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250AD. In either case, these dates make Madagascar {{one of the last}} major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans.|$|E
5|$|Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis) {{refers to}} hominins from Sri Lanka's late Quaternary period. The term was {{initially}} coined {{to refer to}} anatomically modern Homo sapiens from sites near Balangoda that {{were responsible for the}} island's Mesolithic 'Balangoda Culture'. The earliest evidence of Balangoda Man from archaeological sequences at caves and other sites dates back to 38,000 BP, and from excavated skeletal remains to 30,000 BP, which is also the earliest reliably dated record of anatomically modern humans in South Asia. Cultural remains discovered alongside the skeletal fragments include geometric microliths dating to 28,500 BP, which together with some sites in Africa is the earliest record of such <b>stone</b> <b>tools.</b>|$|E
5|$|Human {{settlements}} on Polish lands occurred {{later than}} in the more climatically hospitable regions of southern and western Europe and were dependent on the recurring episodes of glaciation. Gatherer-hunter Homo erectus campsites, together with their inhabitants' primitive <b>stone</b> <b>tools</b> (choppers and microliths), bones of the large mammals they hunted and the fish they caught, were found below the San River glaciation period sediments in Trzebnica and are about 500,000 years old. Younger sites related to the same species were found at Rusko near Strzegom, located, like Trzebnica, in the Lower Silesia region. This represents the microlithic complexes of the Lower Paleolithic period. Homo erectus, earlier known as Pithecanthropus erectus, was a species of early humans.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that St Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for <b>stone</b> <b>tools</b> on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E
