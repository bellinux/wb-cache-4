50|$|Other SLRs soon followed, {{but because}} of {{limitations}} with their lens mounts, the manufacturers of these cameras had to choose 'aperture-priority' automation, where the camera's metering system selects the correct shutter speed. As one example, Pentax introduced the Electro Spotmatic, which {{was able to use}} the then considerable bulk of 42 mm <b>screw-mount</b> <b>lenses</b> produced by various manufacturers. Yashica, another screw-mount camera manufacturer, soon followed.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} Pentax DSLRs, the *ist DS uses the Pentax KAF bayonet mount and can use older lenses using the KA-mount without limitations. Original K mount lenses and, with adapter also M42 <b>screw-mount</b> <b>lenses,</b> {{can be used}} in manual mode by {{selecting}} a menu option. Centre-weighted metering, aperture priority and focus indication are maintained, even with adapter mounted lenses. When using non-auto aperture lenses, a press of the AE-L button with the camera in manual mode will meter the scene and set the shutter speed. Some non-Pentax K-mount lenses have been reported not to mount on the camera, because a plate protecting the aperture stop-down lever is slightly deeper.|$|E
50|$|Pentax {{supplies}} adapters to fit M42 <b>screw-mount</b> <b>lenses,</b> as do several third-party manufacturers. The M42 screw-mount {{system was}} used by Pentax prior {{to the introduction of}} the K-mount. Pentax designed the K-mount wide enough to allow an adapter to fit between the M42 thread and the K bayonet. They also kept the same flange focal distance (also called registration distance or register) as the M42 screw-mount, so that M42 lenses focus correctly using the correct adapter (such as Pentax original or Bower). There are however other third-party adapters that add to the flange focal distance so that one loses the ability to focus to infinity. The loss of infinity-focus may not be significant in macro or close-up photography.|$|E
5000|$|Petri {{produced}} many early bellows, rangefinder and single-lens reflex cameras. Due {{to increased}} electronization, mass production and {{competition from other}} camera vendors, Kuribayashi filed for final bankruptcy in 1977. The labor union, affiliated with Sohyo, continued the company under the name Petri Kōgyō K.K. with employee capital. The last model produced was the MF10, but with its <b>screw-mount</b> <b>lens</b> it could not compete with products having electrical contacts, and disappeared in the autofocus boom of the 1980s. The Petri Camera brand was sold to the Dixons Group in the UK and became an [...] "in-house" [...] brand {{for a short time}} in the early eighties.|$|R
5000|$|Pentax resurrected the Takumar {{name in the}} 1980s and 1990s for {{a budget}} line of zoom and prime lenses that lacked the Pentax [...] "Super Multi-Coating" [...] {{anti-reflective}} coating that reduces lens flare. These lenses are marked [...] "Takumar (Bayonet)" [...] or [...] "Takumar-F" [...] to distinguish them from the older <b>screw-mount</b> Takumar <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
