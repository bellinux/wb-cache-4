5|$|During the {{daylight}} hours, Jericho's powers are gone, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> fight {{as a normal}} human, using {{a wide variety of}} weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a crossbow firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|Stacy Warner is {{a fictional}} {{recurring}} character portrayed by Sela Ward on the Fox Broadcasting Company's medical drama House. She {{was in a}} relationship with Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), when a clotted aneurysm in his right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf, causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. Regarding House's treatment, Stacy acted against House's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced coma. She authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle, leaving House with a lesser, but serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive her and they broke up. The two meet again, five years later, at the end of season one; Stacy wants House to treat her husband, Mark. House correctly diagnoses Mark with acute intermittent porphyria, and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> remain at the hospital for close monitoring. Stacy becomes the hospital's lawyer, and she and House grow closer together. When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.|$|E
500|$|Irving {{was dismayed}} by the storyline which saw Meyer shot in a road rage incident, {{describing}} filming the scenes as an [...] "unpleasant experiences", the worst aspect being that Meyer loses his spleen {{as a result of}} his injuries. Of the later storyline which sees Meyer investigated by Tom Campbell-Gore on behalf of the hospital Board, Denis Lawson explained: [...] " [...] actually rather fancies Meyer's job but if he finds against him in the investigation he cannot get the job because it's a conflict of interest. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> play a rather clever game, which he does." [...] On taking over as head of the cardiothoracic surgery department, he commented: [...] "George is fantastic in the show, but obviously I'm going to do something very, very different, so I don't feel that I'm stepping into his shoes." ...|$|E

Anthony, who had become intrigued by Lopez after seeing her in Selena (1997), came into her studio {{and asked her to}} appear in the music video for his song [...] "No Me Conoces". She agreed, but only if he recorded a song with her, to which he in turn agreed. Lopez recalled the events on her [...] video album by stating: [...] "So at that time I called Tommy [...] and I'm like 'Look, so Marc Anthony said he would do a song and I really don't want to do a duet with just anybody, I want to do a duet with him. So can you force him to sign something, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do a record with me? If I do this video!'". The two first shot the video and then began working on the song.|$|E

2500|$|I {{never even}} heard his name till {{last week when he}} made threats and rants. The guy is a fucking idiot, making threats to me, Clooney, Eli Roth, says he has a doctorate—but uses the word [...] "retard" [...] in his vocabulary, come on. When you look at his videos, what is {{interesting}} are the backgrounds. I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E

60|$|You cannot {{lean out}} of a German bed to pick up {{anything}} off the floor, owing to its box-like formation; <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> scramble out after it, and of course every time he does this he barks both his shins twice against {{the sides of the}} bed.|$|E

6000|$|The {{opposition}} to Proportional Representation of Mr. Sidney Webb {{and his little}} circle is a trifle more [...] "scientific" [...] in tone than these naive objections of the common run of antagonist, but underlying {{it is the same}} passionate desire to keep politics a close game for the politician and to bar out the politically unspecialized man. There is more conceit and less jobbery behind the criticisms of this type of mind. It is an opposition {{based on the idea that}} the common man is a fool who does not know what is good for him. <b>So</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be stampeded. Politics, according to this school, is a sort of cattle-driving.|$|E

Poor Mr. Ruck, who’s a mush of {{personal}} and private concession—I don’t know what {{he may have been}} in the business world—strikes me as a really tragic figure. He’s getting bad news every day from home; his affairs may be going to the dogs. He’s unable, with his lost nerve, to apply himself; <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> stand and watch his fortunes ebb. He has been used to doing things in a big way and he feels ‘mean’ if he makes a fuss about bills. So the ladies keep sending them in.” ...|$|E
