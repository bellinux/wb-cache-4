5|$|The railway was rebuilt as a non-electrified, largely <b>single-track</b> <b>line.</b> Several {{surviving}} Waverley Route structures, including viaducts and tunnels, {{were rehabilitated}} and reused for the reopened railway. Passenger services run half-hourly on weekdays until 20:00, and hourly until 23:54 and on Sundays. The timetable also allows charter train promoters to run special excursion services, {{and for the}} weeks following the line opening scheduled steam trains were run.|$|E
5|$|The District {{also had}} {{parliamentary}} permission to extend westward from Brompton and, on 12 April 1869, it opened a <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> to West Brompton on the WLR. There were no intermediate stations {{and at first}} this service operated as a shuttle. By summer 1869 separate tracks had been laid between South Kensington and Brompton and from Kensington (High Street) to a junction with the line to West Brompton. During the night of 5 July 1870 the District secretly built the disputed Cromwell curve connecting Brompton and Kensington (High Street).|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{started an}} {{evaluation}} of the Ringerike Line, carried out by the National Rail Administration, in 2006. The first edition was completed in 2009, but was found to be insufficient, resulting in the process being restarted. A new report was published in June 2011. In September 2012, the ministry concluded that also the second report was insufficient {{and that it would be}} discarded. There were two main concerns with the report. Firstly, it was based on a <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> which would not be built to the standards of high-speed rail. The ministry stated that all new railway plans in Norway were to have double track and be optimized for high-speed rail. Secondly, the report had a simplified economic analysis which was not sufficient to be used for political evaluation. The result of the discard was that the planning of E16 was no longer tied to the planning of the railway.|$|E
5000|$|On <b>single-track</b> <b>lines</b> with passing loops, {{measures}} must {{be taken}} to ensure that only one train in one direction can use a stretch of single track at a time, as head-on collisions are a particular risk. Some form of signalling system is required. In traditional British practice (and countries using British practice), <b>single-track</b> <b>lines</b> were operated using a token system where the train driver had to be in possession of a token in order to enter a stretch of single track. Because there was only one unique token issued at any one time for each stretch of single track, it was impossible for more than one train to be on it at a time. This method is still used on some minor lines but in the longest <b>single-track</b> <b>lines</b> in Britain (e.g. the Highlands of Scotland) this has been superseded by radio communication.|$|R
50|$|Five Class DE15-2500 {{locomotives}} {{were formed}} by modifying Class DE15-1500 locomotives {{with the addition}} of a second snowplough unit at the other end. These were designed for clearing <b>single-track</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{subclass}} {{consisted of}} two locomotives for clearing <b>single-track</b> <b>lines.</b> DE15 2052 was converted from DE15 1002 and was fitted with a [...] engine, while DE15 2053 was converted from DE15 3 and was fitted with a [...] engine.|$|R
25|$|Route: Services {{operated}} from Circular Quay initially via Elizabeth, Chalmers and Redfern Streets (from 1902), then in 1933 via Pitt and Castlereagh Streets, and Eddy Avenue, Lee and Regent Streets, to Botany Street in Waterloo. A single-track connection along Bourke and O'Dea Streets {{joined at}} the present day Green Square, allowing access to the Dowling Street Tram Depot. The line then passed down {{the entire length of}} Botany Road to Botany. In Mascot, a branch led to the former Ascot Racecourse at the site of Sydney Airport. Points were provided at Bay Street on Botany Road in Botany for short working. The line was double track throughout. From Botany, a <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> crossed the Botany Goods railway at Beauchamp Road, then passed along Perry Street and Bunnerong Road, past the former Bunnerong Power Station to join the La Perouse line at Yarra Junction. Generally a shuttle service operated on this single track section between Botany and La Perouse. This <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> was cut back to Military Road in 1935. The line opened in 1882 as a steam tramway to Botany, and electric services commenced in 1903. The line from the junctions at Cleveland Street to Botany closed in approximately 1956/57. Sydney Buses' route 309 generally follows the route.|$|E
25|$|Many {{improvements}} {{took place}} at Trent Bridge at this time, and in June 1920 an automatic trolley pole reverser was installed. This did not remain in use long, as the principal terminus was shortly afterwards removed {{to the end of}} Victoria Embankment, a new kerbside loading line being put in at the same time. The old terminus by the bridge approach remained in use for football and other specials. A new <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> was laid along the Embankment and Bathley Street to Trent Bridge Depot, the entrance to the depot was altered, and a new shed to hold 25 cars was built {{on the opposite side of}} Turney Street.|$|E
25|$|Carlingford {{railway station}} is the {{terminus}} of the Carlingford Line on the Sydney Trains network. The Carlingford Line, which opened on 20 April 1896 {{as a private}} railway, then as a public line on 1 August 1901, is a mostly <b>single-track</b> <b>line.</b> There is currently only one service {{in the early morning}} which connects to the city directly, at other times a train-change at Clyde, is necessary to reach other stations, and consequently the service has a low patronage, though it is quite popular during peak hours. As part of the CityRail Clearways Project, a passing loop was promised to the Carlingford Line with two services per hour all day to become effective in 2010. This was however scrapped in the 2008 mini-budget.|$|E
5000|$|This {{subclass}} {{was built}} between 1976 and 1979 by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Nippon Sharyo with snowplough units {{at both ends}} and designed for clearing <b>single-track</b> <b>lines.</b> The locomotives were equipped with a [...] engine and no train-heating steam generator.|$|R
50|$|Iserlohn {{station is}} located in central Iserlohn in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It {{is at the end}} of two <b>single-track</b> <b>lines,</b> the Ardey Railway (Ardeybahn) from Schwerte and the line from Letmathe. Since 2008, it has {{operated}} from a rebuilt station called the Stadtbahnhof (city station).|$|R
25|$|Stations {{may also}} be {{classified}} according to {{the layout of the}} platforms. Apart from <b>single-track</b> <b>lines,</b> the most basic arrangement is a pair of tracks for the two directions; there is then a basic choice of an island platform between, or two separate platforms outside, the tracks. With more tracks, the possibilities expand.|$|R
500|$|The full {{business}} {{case for the}} line was published in mid-2004, showing a modest benefit to cost ratio of 1.01 to 1. The case was in some part built on projected housing developments – 700 in the Borders and 1,100 in Midlothian – that led to an anti-rail backlash in local elections {{with the success of}} the Borders Party. Representing the party, Councillor Nicholas Watson described the scheme as [...] "a colossal waste of money" [...] and called for the funds to be used instead on the Glasgow Airport Rail Link. The Campaign for Borders Rail indicated that the low ratio followed from the choice to build a <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> for half-hourly commuter services with no capacity for freight or specials.|$|E
500|$|In 1866, {{permission}} {{had been}} granted to landowners in the Hounslow area for a Hounslow and Metropolitan Railway to connect to a proposed Acton & Brentford Railway. However, this had never been built, but with the District now at Acton there was an alternative. Permission was granted in 1880 for a nearly [...] railway from Mill Hill Park station to Hounslow Barracks, with stations at South Ealing, Boston Road and Spring Grove, and agreement reached for the District to work the line. On 1 May 1883 the District started a service to Hounslow Town, calling at South Ealing, Boston Road (now Boston Manor) and Osterley & Spring Grove (replaced by Osterley). A <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> from junction near Hounslow Town to Hounslow Barracks (now Hounslow West) opened a year later in 1884. Traffic was light and Hounslow Barracks was initially served by a shuttle to Osterley & Spring Grove that connected to an off-peak Hounslow Town to Mill Hill Park train. Hounslow Town station closed in 1886 and Heston Hounslow station (now Hounslow Central) opened.|$|E
500|$|From the 1860s onwards, various schemes were {{promoted}} {{to build a}} railway line, either through Glendale or over the Milfield Plain. [...] In 1881 the Central Northumberland Railway was proposed, linking Newcastle upon Tyne with Ponteland, Rothbury, Wooler and Kelso. [...] The threat posed by the proposal spurred the North Eastern Railway to put forward a branch line of its own between Alnwick, Wooler and Cornhill on Tweed. [...] The company was strongly supported by the tradespeople of Alnwick, who were concerned {{at the loss of}} business if the farmers of Glendale had a direct raillink to the rival market and shops in Rothbury. [...] Both schemes were presented to Parliament in 1881, and it was the North Eastern Railway's route which gained approval, with the Alnwick and Cornhill Act passed in 1882. [...] The <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> opened on 5 September 1887, having cost £272,267 to build. [...] From Wooler, it ran through Kirknewton and Kilham to Mindrum, before turning north to Cornhill on Tweed, where it joined the line from Tweedmouth to Kelso. [...] There was no station at Kilham, but sidings were built to handle goods traffic.|$|E
50|$|The line {{begins in}} Pforzheim station, {{where there are}} {{connections}} to the line from Karlsruhe to Mühlacker. Since 2002, the Enz Valley Railway has run together with the Nagold Valley Railway from to Horb on a two-track line through Pforzheim to Brötzingen Mitte station. Previously, the two lines had run parallel as independent <b>single-track</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{distant signal}} (遠方信号機, enpō shingōki) is {{installed}} before a home signal with limited visibility and {{is linked to}} the home signal. Distant signals are primarily installed in non-automatic block sections on <b>single-track</b> <b>lines.</b> They may have two (caution and clear) or three (caution, reduced-speed and clear) displays. With multiple home signals, the distant signal applies to all.|$|R
2500|$|The Fulton Subdivision is a <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> {{that runs}} [...] from the Montreal Subdivision at Woodard, north of Liverpool to Oswego, serving {{customers}} in Phoenix and Fulton {{on the east}} side of the Oswego River, formerly the old NYC line.|$|E
2500|$|It {{generally}} {{consists of}} at least one track-side platform and a station building (depot) providing such ancillary services as ticket sales and waiting rooms. If a station is on a <b>single-track</b> <b>line,</b> it often has a passing loop to facilitate traffic movements. The smallest stations are most often referred to as [...] "stops" [...] or, {{in some parts of the}} world, as [...] "halts" [...] (flag stops).|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "railway electrification" [...] mainly {{refers to}} the project to {{electrify}} the Keretapi Tanah Melayu's West Coast Line from Padang Besar to Johor Bahru, combined with the duplication of the <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> {{and the elimination of}} level crossings. As of November 2015, the stretch between Padang Besar and Gemas has been completed, with two electrified train services operating on the stretch: the KTM Komuter and the ETS.|$|E

2500|$|The Point Shirley Street Railway {{was built}} from Winthrop Beach station to Point Shirley {{beginning}} in August 1910 and opened later that year. The [...] <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> ran along Shirley Street and Tafts Avenue. The BRB acquired the entire line with legislative approval in October 1912. By 1914, the line operated 30,594 car miles (an average of 35 daily round trips), carried 165,037 passengers (an average of 452 daily), and employed seven people.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>single-track</b> <b>line</b> {{north of}} Epping, which closed in 1994, {{is now the}} Epping Ongar {{heritage}} railway.
