The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the affair}} brought such a <b>shock</b> <b>that</b> people were sobered. The legal battle had been lost, the {{railroad}} had won, {{and there was}} not enough public support for changing the policy of granting public lands to railroads. The only concession SP made was to reduce the land price slightly. In the end, most people simply stayed where they were and purchased the land.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article {{explores the}} paradox that {{forecasts}} {{may be most}} likely to fail during dramatic moments of historic change that social scientists are most eager to predict. It distinguishes among four types of <b>shocks</b> <b>that</b> can undermine the predictive power of time series analyses: effect <b>shocks</b> <b>that</b> change {{the size of the}} causal effect; input <b>shocks</b> <b>that</b> change the causal variables; duration <b>shocks</b> <b>that</b> change how long a causal effect lasts; and actor <b>shocks</b> <b>that</b> change the number of agents in the system. The significance of these shocks is illustrated in Israeli–Palestinian interactions, one of the contemporary world’s most intensely scrutinized episodes, using vector autogression analyses of more than 15, 000 Reuters news stories over the past three decades. The intervention of these shocks raises the prospect that some historic episodes may be unpredictable, even retrospectively...|$|R

5|$|The Catholic {{community}} {{responded to}} news of these plots with <b>shock.</b> <b>That</b> the Bye Plot had been revealed by Catholics {{was instrumental in}} saving them from further persecution, and James was grateful enough to allow pardons for those recusants who sued for them, as well as postponing payment of their fines for a year.|$|E
5|$|Several {{strands of}} the SAF {{in the eastern}} region of the San Francisco Bay Area are the Hayward–Rodgers Creek and Calaveras Faults. The Hayward Fault {{exhibits}} fault creep, {{but it also has}} potential for large earthquakes, like the 1868 Hayward earthquake that occurred on its southern segment. The northern Calaveras Fault meets the Hayward Fault near the Calaveras Reservoir and can also produce large earthquakes. Except for a ~M6.5 <b>shock</b> <b>that</b> occurred in 1911, the central and southern segments might only produce smaller events and fault creep.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defeat at}} Sedan left the Allied Army Groups in Belgium with sparse flank protection. The German attack, {{especially}} the breakout from the bridgeheads at Sedan, was {{so fast that}} there were hardly any major combats. Many French soldiers were in such <b>shock</b> <b>that</b> they were taken prisoner before they could offer resistance, which also explains the low casualty rates for both sides. The two assault engineer battalions under Korthals achieved the most important success. By eliminating the bunkers in the Bellevue sector, they made the breakthroughs of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions possible. This was achieved without a single casualty.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} of poor health, Suramarit, Sihanouk's father, died on 3April 1960 which Sihanouk blamed upon the <b>shock</b> <b>that</b> his father had {{received}} from the parcel bomb attack. The following day, the royal throne council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent {{to that of the}} king. A referendum held on 5June 1960 approved Sihanouk's proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to play an active role in politics as Sangkum's leader.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad {{took part}} in blowing up railway tracks on the {{stretches}} around Støren Station, but the group had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They could for instance not go through with blowing up the railway bridge near Hovin, which they sought as their main target. He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945, and Durham was dissolved. He reacted with <b>shock</b> <b>that</b> London had {{decided that it was}} too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim. He was uneasy about being set on the sideline, and headed a mission of four men from Stockholm to Namsvatnet {{at the end of the}} month to receive British sabotage supplies. They established a base of operations, as well as radio connection to the UK by the station Quail. The mission returned to Stockholm in early April, and Gjems-Onstad was transferred to a mission in Northern Norway. He was in Troms at the time of the German capitulation.|$|E
5|$|Sailors {{on nearby}} ships heard {{the series of}} signals and, realizing that a {{collision}} was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo bore down on Mont-Blanc. Though both ships had cut their engines by this point, their momentum carried them {{right on top of}} each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a <b>shock</b> <b>that</b> would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imos prow pushed into the French vessel's No. 1 hold on her starboard side.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the role of financial market imperfections in a simplified version of a twocountry model.

On the other hand, <b>shocks</b> <b>that</b> reduce agricultural income motivate transitions into high-return rural nonfarm employment. ...|$|R
25|$|As the Mach number increases, so {{does the}} {{strength}} of the shock wave and the Mach cone becomes increasingly narrow. As the fluid flow crosses the shock wave, its speed is reduced and temperature, pressure, and density increase. The stronger the shock, the greater the changes. At high enough Mach numbers the temperature increases so much over the <b>shock</b> <b>that</b> ionization and dissociation of gas molecules behind the shock wave begin. Such flows are called hypersonic.|$|E
25|$|Astrophysical environments feature many {{different}} types of shock waves. Some common examples are supernovae shock waves or blast waves travelling through the interstellar medium, the bow shock caused by the Earth's magnetic field colliding with the solar wind and shock waves caused by galaxies colliding with each other. Another interesting type of shock in astrophysics is the quasi-steady reverse shock or termination <b>shock</b> <b>that</b> terminates the ultra relativistic wind from young pulsars.|$|E

40|$|With an {{increasingly}} integrated global financial system, we frequently observe <b>that</b> <b>shocks</b> to individual asset markets affect financial markets worldwide. The {{aim of this}} paper is to quantify the comovements between bond markets in the US and emerging market economies using daily data from prior to the East Asian crisis through to the early stages of the current global financial crisis. We exploit the changing volatility of the data to fully identify a structural VAR, without imposing ad hoc restrictions. We find <b>that</b> <b>shocks</b> <b>that</b> widen emerging market sovereign debt (EMBIG) spreads have a negative effect on US interest rates in the short run (consistent with 'flight to quality' effects), while <b>shocks</b> <b>that</b> increase US interest rates raise EMBIG spreads over longer horizons (consistent with 'financing cost' or 'search for yield' effects). We also find <b>that</b> <b>shocks</b> <b>that</b> increase EMBIG spreads tend to widen US high-yield spreads and vice versa, constituting an important contagion channel through which crises in emerging market economies can affect mature markets. Forecast error variance decompositions show <b>that</b> <b>shocks</b> to US long rates can explain around 60 %- 70 % of the variation of EMBIG and US high-yield spreads. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{temperature}} of the starter culture is then slowly reduced, often by the graduated addition of must to get within 5–10°C (41–50°F) of the must that the culture will be added to. This is done to avoid the sudden cold <b>shock</b> <b>that</b> the yeast cells may experience if the starter culture was added directly to the must itself which can kill up to 60% of the culture. Additionally, surviving cells exposed to cold shock tend to see an increase in hydrogen sulfide production.|$|E
