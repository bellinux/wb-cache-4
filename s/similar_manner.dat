5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went {{hand in hand with}} the increasing use of hired labor by the government. In a <b>similar</b> <b>manner,</b> because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E

The hydrides require extreme care in handling as they decompose {{in a vacuum}} at 300°C to form finely divided neptunium metal, which is pyrophoric.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted of slot-rectangular spouted beds with air entry slots spanning the full {{thickness of the}} column and vertical draft plates intended to help control the solids circulation rate. With increasing superficial gas velocity, the flow between the draft plates changed from bubbling to slugging and then to spouting with dilute pneumatic between the plates and moving-bed downward motion on both sides. However, there was difficulty maintaining stability and symmetrical flow on the two sides. Once spouting is established, pressure drops and local voidages vary with gas velocity, particle size and gas entry size in broadly <b>similar</b> <b>manners</b> as for conventional spouted beds.

40|$|Oxazolidinones {{are known}} to inhibit protein {{biosynthesis}} and act against {{a wide spectrum of}} gram-positive bacteria. A new investigational oxazolidinone, ranbezolid, inhibited bacterial protein synthesis in Staphylococ-cus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In S. epidermidis, ranbezolid showed inhibition of cell wall and lipid synthesis and a dose-dependent effect on membrane integrity. A kill-kinetics study showed that ranbezolid was bactericidal against S. epidermidis. In vitro translation of the luciferase gene done using bacterial and mam-malian ribosomes indicated that ranbezolid specifically inhibited the bacterial ribosome. Molecular modeling studies revealed that both linezolid and ranbezolid fit in <b>similar</b> <b>manners</b> the active site of ribosomes, with tota...|$|R
