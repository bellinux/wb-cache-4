Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated <b>standard</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>test</b> values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E

2500|$|The early {{applications}} of CPT mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical {{measurements of the}} total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the conical tip (the [...] "tip friction") and friction generated by the rod string. A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil cohesive strength in the 1960s. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather pore water pressure data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). Pore water pressure data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this piezometer data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using screwed-in anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the <b>Standard</b> <b>Penetration</b> <b>Test</b> (SPT) is a more continuous profile of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20cm but as small as 1cm.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main purpose}} of the test is to provide an {{indication}} of the relative density of granular deposits, such as sands and gravels from which {{it is virtually impossible to}} obtain undisturbed samples. [...] The great merit of the test, and the main reason for its widespread use is that it is simple and inexpensive. The soil strength parameters which can be inferred are approximate, but may give a useful guide in ground conditions where it may not be possible to obtain borehole samples of adequate quality like gravels, sands, silts, clay containing sand or gravel and weak rock. In conditions where the quality of the undisturbed sample is suspect, e.g., very silty or very sandy clays, or hard clays, it is often advantageous to alternate the sampling with standard penetration tests to check the strength. If the samples are found to be unacceptably disturbed, it may be necessary to use a different method for measuring strength like the plate test. [...] When the test is carried out in granular soils below groundwater level, the soil may become loosened. In certain circumstances, it can be useful to continue driving the sampler beyond the distance specified, adding further drilling rods as necessary. Although this is not a <b>standard</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>test,</b> and should not be regarded as such, it may at least give an indication as to whether the deposit is really as loose as the standard test may indicate.|$|E

40|$|Sensitive {{marine clay}} in Ottawa is a {{challenging}} soil for geotechnical engineers. This type of clay behaves differently than other soils in Canada or {{other parts of}} the world. They also have different engineering characteristic values in comparison to other clays. Cone <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> in sensitive marine clays is also different from that carried out in other soils. The misestimation of engineering characteristics from cone <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> can result. Temperature effects have been suspected as the reason for negative readings and erroneous estimations of engineering characteristics from cone <b>penetration</b> <b>testing.</b> Furthermore, the applicability of correlations between cone <b>penetration</b> <b>test</b> (CPT) results and engineering characteristics is ambiguous. Moreover, it is important that geotechnical engineers who need to work with these clays have background information on their engineering characteristics. This thesis provides comprehensive information on the engineering characteristics and behaviour of sensitive marine clays in Ottawa. This information will give key information to geotechnical engineers who are working with these clays on their behaviour. For the purpose of this research, fifteen sites in the Ottawa area are taken into consideration. These sites included alternative technical data from cone and <b>standard</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>tests,</b> undisturbed samples, field vanes, and shear wave velocity measurements. Laboratory testing carried out for these sites has resulted in acquiring engineering parameters of the marine clay, such as preconsolidation pressure, overconsolidation ratio, compression and recompression indexes, secondary compression index, coefficient of consolidation, hydraulic conductivity, clay fraction, porewater chemistry, specific gravity, plasticity, moisture content, unit weight, void ratio, and porosity. This thesis also discusses other characteristics of sensitive marine clays in Ottawa, such as their activity, sensitivity, structure, interface shear behaviour, and origin and sedimentation. Furthermore, for the purpose of increasing local experience with the use of cone and ball penetrometers in sensitive marine clays in Ottawa, three types of penetrometer tips are used in the Canadian Geotechnical Research Site No. 1 located in south-west Ottawa: 36 mm cone tip, and 40 mm and 113 mm ball tips. The differences in their response in sensitive marine clays will be discussed. The temperature effects on the penetrometer equipment are also studied. The differences in the effect of temperature on these tips are discussed. Correlations between the penetrometer results and engineering characteristics of Ottawa's clays are verified. The applicability of correlations between the testing results and engineering characteristics of sensitive marine clays in Ottawa is also presented in this thesis. Two correlations from the Canadian Foundation Engineering Manual are examined. One of these correlations is between the N 60 values from <b>standard</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>testing</b> and undrained shear strength. The other correlation is between the shear wave velocity measurement and site class. Temperature corrections are suggested and discussed for penetrometer equipment according to laboratory calibrations. The significance of the effects due to radical temperature changes in Canada and Ottawa is discussed. Some of the main findings from this research are as follows. •	The Canadian Foundation Engineering Manual presents a correlation between <b>standard</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>tests</b> (SPTs) and the undrained shear strength of soils. This relationship may not be applicable to sensitive marine clays in Ottawa. •	Another correlation between the site class, shear wave velocity, and undrained shear strength is presented by this same manual which may not be applicable to sensitive marine clays in Ottawa. •	The rotation rate for field vane testing as recommended by ASTM D 2573 is slow for sensitive marine clays in Ottawa. •	Correction factors applied to undrained shear strength from laboratory vane tests may not result in comparable values with the undrained shear strength obtained by using field vane tests. •	Loading schemes in consolidation or oedometer testing may affect the quality of the targeted results. •	Temperature corrections should be applied to penetrometer recordings to compensate for the drift in the results of these recordings due to temperature changes. •	The secondary compression index to compression index ratio presented in the literature may not be the value obtained from this research...|$|R
