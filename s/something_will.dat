5|$|Kinstones {{are special}} {{artifacts}} which Link can find throughout his quest. Kinstone pieces are fragments of a medallion {{that are found}} {{throughout the course of}} the game. If the player can find a character or object with a Kinstone piece (indicated by a thought bubble above their heads), the player can try to fuse their Kinstone piece with one of their own to make a match. If a successful fusion is made, <b>something</b> <b>will</b> occur somewhere within the game's world, including the placement of treasure chests, access to secret areas and certain events which occur among certain characters. Whilst many Kinstone fusions are optional, some fusions, such as those which use Golden Kinstones, are necessary to advance the story.|$|E
25|$|The many {{different}} terms for vows and pledges used in Kol Nidrei can be confusing, especially because the English language is poor in short equivalent terms that express the same nuances. These terms are almost exclusively religious pledges of various kinds: That <b>something</b> <b>will</b> be done (or not done) or given {{in exchange for}} a prayer being answered, that <b>something</b> <b>will</b> be done (or not done) for religious purposes or to show religious devotion, that a thing will be used only for religious purposes (e.g., as a tool used for building or repairing the Temple) and never for mundane purposes, that a thing will be given to the Temple or treated as if it were already given to the Temple, and so forth; and to make this declaration all the more clear, every possible synonym for such pledging and for nullification or cancellation of such pledges is used.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{controversy}} surrounding {{the future of}} Interstate 25 in northern Colorado (SH 7 in Broomfield to SH 14 in Fort Collins). Suggestions from adding toll lanes to general expansion to six lanes from the two lane bottleneck at SH 66 to SH 14 and adding multi-modal transportation options have been discussed. The future of the highway remains in question as funding is limited, and agreement is limited as well. The I-25 corridor in Weld and Larimer counties is becoming increasingly heavy with traffic, and <b>something</b> <b>will</b> {{have to be done}} soon.|$|E

25|$|Rincewind was {{the first}} protagonist of Discworld; a wizard with no skill, no wizardly qualifications, and no {{interest}} in heroics. He is the archetypal coward but is constantly thrust into extremely dangerous adventures. In The Last Hero, he flatly states {{that he does not}} wish to join an expedition to explore {{over the edge of the}} Disc—but, being fully geared for the expedition at the time, clarifies by saying that any amount of protesting on his part is futile, as <b>something</b> <b>will</b> eventually occur that will bring him into the expedition anyway. As such, he not only constantly succeeds in staying alive, but also saves Discworld on several occasions, and has an instrumental role in the emergence of life on Roundworld (Science of Discworld).|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that <b>something</b> <b>will</b> come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E

Asked to comment, Amundsen avoided an outright endorsement of either explorer, but surmised that [...] "probably <b>something</b> <b>will</b> {{be left to}} be done". While he avoided {{the controversy over the}} rival claims, [...] he saw immediately that his own plans would be seriously affected. Without the allure of capturing the pole, he would struggle to maintain public interest or funding. [...] "If the expedition was to be saved... there was nothing left for me but to try and solve the last great problem—the South Pole". Thus Amundsen decided to go south; the Arctic drift could wait [...] "for a year or two" [...] until the South Pole had been conquered.|$|E

Here he's just hoping <b>something</b> <b>will</b> stick." [...] In Melody Maker, Ray Coleman wrote that McCartney [...] "seems {{to be on a}} treadmill of banality". Coleman described [...] "Rockestra Theme" [...] and [...] "So Glad to See You Here" [...] as [...] "creditable, rolling, raunchy and at least efficient, with Paul's voice at its rocking best on the last named track", but concluded: [...] "This album gets Wings nowhere..." [...] Billboards reviewer gave Back to the Egg [...] "Spotlight" [...] status (meaning [...] "the most outstanding new product of the week's releases and that with the greatest potential for top of the chart placement") and commented: [...] "The music features typical McCartney fare of late with nothing here that will distinguish it as one of his classics. The arrangements, though, are interesting, encompassing a variety of styles." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two noted that Anderson was {{constantly}} playing [...] "a mother who's always crying, shouting or looking miserable" [...] in the episode. They wrote that the episode's [...] "characters no longer make sense" [...] and that the plot has [...] "been so required to dance through the little conspiracy hoops that there's no consistency any more." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the idea to suggest that Mulder died in the episode, {{due to the fact}} that Carter announced Duchovny would return for the season finale. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticised the plot of the episode, saying that it [...] "throws up many elements that we've seen the series do better elsewhere...in the hope that <b>something</b> <b>will</b> stick".|$|E

500|$|The move to {{the sixth}} series also meant Gaiman had to include Rory, who had ceased {{to exist in the}} {{original}} slot in the fifth series. With Rory included, Gaiman had to [...] "reshape" [...] much of {{the second half of the}} episode, featuring Amy being on the run in the TARDIS. In the original draft where Amy was the only companion, Gaiman added a [...] "heartbreaking monologue" [...] by the character, further stating [...] "you get to see what it's like to be the companion from the companion's point of view, and she got to talk about essentially in that version how sad it is, in some ways. One day <b>something</b> <b>will</b> happen to her, she'll get married, she'll get eaten by monsters, she'll die, she'll get sick of this, but he'll go on forever." [...] At a certain point, Gaiman became tired of rewriting drafts and asked Steven Moffat for help.

When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think <b>something</b> <b>will</b> happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest.
