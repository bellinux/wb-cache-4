5|$|The Hungry Saw is {{the seventh}} studio album by British {{alternative}} band Tindersticks, released on 28 April 2008 by Beggars Banquet Records. Following {{the release of}} the band's sixth album, Waiting for the Moon in 2003, Tindersticks had entered an extended hiatus before reconvening to perform at the Don't Look Back event in September 2006. This concert marked the final performance of the original line-up of the band, and three members left the group shortly afterwards. The remaining members of Tindersticks felt reinvigorated by the performance, and relocated to France to begin working on new material in the summer of 2007, recording and producing the album at their own Le Chien Chanceaux studio in Limousin. The Hungry <b>Saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first new Tindersticks material in five years.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the battle, the English removed their baggage train from the field, {{prompting}} a hasty French assault, believing that what they <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> English retreating. The fighting began with a charge by a forlorn hope of 300 German knights, led by Jean de Clermont. The attack was a disaster, with many of the knights shot down or killed by English soldiery. According to Froissart, the English archers then shot their bows at the massed French infantry. The Dauphin's division reached the English line. Exhausted by a long march in heavy equipment and harassed by the hail of arrows, the division was repulsed after approximately two hours of combat.|$|E
25|$|Sputnik 1 was not {{immediately}} used for Soviet propaganda. The Soviets had kept quiet about their earlier accomplishments in rocketry, fearing that {{it would lead to}} secrets being revealed and failures being exploited by the West. When the Soviets began using Sputnik in their propaganda, they emphasized pride in the achievement of Soviet technology, arguing that it demonstrated the Soviets' superiority over the West. People were encouraged to listen to Sputnik signals on the radio and to look out for Sputnik in the night sky. While Sputnik itself had been highly polished, its small size made it barely visible to the naked eye. What most watchers actually <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> much more visible 26 meter core stage of the R-7. Shortly after the launch of PS-1, Khrushchev pressed Korolev to launch another satellite in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 7 November 1957.|$|E
50|$|Closed loop {{vertical}} slide <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> stiffest, {{but also}} the most expensive machines. They require less space than horizontal or angular slide <b>saws,</b> but it <b>is</b> also more difficult to control the horizontal chip flow. They are also more expensive and difficult to service.|$|R
30|$|The {{compensation}} for employees (CE) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{proportion of the}} output (of each sector of <b>the</b> economy) that <b>is</b> attributed to labour; the sectoral average wage (<b>SAW)</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> € amount of wages divided {{by the number of}} employees.|$|R
50|$|Horizontal cutting pivot <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most cost {{efficient}} machines. They require less parts and floor space and have favorable downward chip control. The {{closed loop system}} reduces compliance and hence can be built lighter, while maintaining a high amount of stiffness.|$|R
500|$|Gould also {{discusses}} {{the possibility that}} what Morrell sighted was [...] the eastern coast of Graham Land, the so-called [...] "Foyn Coast", despite its being 14° further west from position of the New South Greenland sighting. [...] Gould asserts that {{the features of the}} peninsula's eastern coast corresponds [...] closely with [...] Morrell's description of Nw South Greenland. This theory supposes that Morrell miscalculated the ship's position, perhaps because he lacked the chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation. In his account Morrell writes that he was [...] "destitute of the various nautical and mathematical instruments", although other parts of his narrative seem to indicate that the occasional dead reckoning calculation was the exception to the norm. A longitudinal error of 14° is very large, and the additional distance of about [...] to the Foyn coast seems too great to have been covered within the ten-day voyage from the South Sandwich Islands, where the ship's position is recorded accurately. Even so, Gould suggests that a [...] "balance of evidence" [...] shows that what Morrell <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Foyn coast.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{notes that}} he shares his {{birthday}} with Eva Longoria, {{and that it will}} be a perfect icebreaker if he ever meets Teri Hatcher. After Michael asks what Dwight is playing on the recorder, Dwight replies that it is [...] "for the longest time", by [...] "William Joel" [...] (Billy Joel released [...] "The Longest Time" [...] in 1984). [...] When Kevin mentions he might have skin cancer, Kelly starts discussing a case involving cancer on the popular medical drama Grey's Anatomy. She later says that the saddest funeral she ever <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one for Princess Diana. For Michael's birthday, his mother sent him a picture of James Dean Resignedly, Michael notes that [...] "I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this". While at the grocery store, Jim and Pam buy a copy of the American comedy movie American Pie 2. Pam later impersonates Darth Vader, a character from the science fiction movie franchise Star Wars on the store's intercom. To show his support for Kevin, Michael makes a fake Livestrong wristband out of construction paper. Dwight later gives Michael a Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins jersey with the words [...] "From Dwight" [...] on the back.|$|E
500|$|Aside from {{experts and}} {{security}} personnel, several eyewitnesses gave {{evidence to the}} inquest. Three witnessed parts of the shootings, and gave accounts which supported the official version of events—in particular, they did not witness the SAS shooting any of the suspects while {{they were on the}} floor. Witnesses uncovered by the journalists making [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] also appeared: Stephen Bullock repeated his account of seeing McCann and Savage raise their hands before the SAS shot them; Josie Celecia repeated her account of seeing a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground. Hucker pointed out that parts of Celecia's testimony had changed since she spoke to [...] "Death on the Rock", and suggested that the gunfire she heard was from the shooting of Savage rather than sustained shooting of McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, a suggestion Celecia rejected; the SAS's lawyer further observed that she was unable to identify the military personnel in photographs her husband had taken. Maxie Proetta told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car the Proettas <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one being driven by Inspector Revagliatte, carrying four uniformed police officers rather than plain-clothed soldiers, but Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' version did not make sense. His wife gave evidence the following day. Contrary to her statement to [...] "Death on the Rock", Carmen Proetta was no longer certain that she had seen McCann and Farrell shot while on the ground. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop table <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> least {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three}} major types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. <b>The</b> universal motor <b>is</b> not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of <b>the</b> blade). Benchtop <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|R

2500|$|Indiana players wear {{warm-up pants}} that are striped red and white, like the stripes of a candy cane. They were first {{worn by the}} team in the 1970s under head coach Bob Knight. At {{the time they were}} in keeping with the fashion trends of the 1970s, but despite {{changing}} styles they have since become an iconic part of playing for Indiana. IU star guard Steve Alford said, [...] "As you watch television and you watch the IU games, that's the first thing you <b>saw,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> team run out in the candy stripes. So when you finally got to put those on, those are pretty special." [...] Rusty Stillions, Director of Indiana's Equipment Operations, said the pants were originally available only for team members. However, changes in licensing agreements permitted the general public to buy them as well. They have since become a staple at games and other Indiana basketball events. Beginning in 2014, during Hoosier Hysteria, former IU basketball players have presented to the new players their first pair of candy striped pants. This practice symbolizes a [...] "passing-of-the-torch" [...] and carrying on the rich tradition and responsibilities of playing for Indiana University.|$|E

2500|$|Truesdale {{played a}} key role in several {{important}} decisions during his term on the Board. Among these were Makro, Inc., 316 NLRB 109 (1995) (better known as Loehmann's Plaza II), in which the Board reversed a precedent (Makro, Inc., 305 N.L.R.B. 663 , also known as Loehmann's Plaza I) established just four years earlier and denied union picketers the right to access an employer's property; Oakland Mall, 316 NLRB 1160 (1995), also known as Oakland Mall II, in which the Board held that nonemployee handbilling on behalf of a labor union may not occur on an employer's property; Leslie Homes, Inc., 316 NLRB 123 (1995), aff'd Metropolitan District Council of Philadelphia and Vicinity United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 68 F.3d 71 (3d. Cir. 1995), in which the Board held that a union may not picket on land occupied by homes being sold by a real estate developer. He also voted with the majority in important cases (California Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224 , Paperworkers Local 1033 (Weyerhaeuser Paper Co.), 320 NLRB 349 [...] ) involving the rights of workers who are not union members as established in Communications Workers of America v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735 (1988). California <b>Saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> NLRB's first ruling in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Beck. Truesdale and the majority held that whenever a union seeks to make employees pay dues under a union security agreement, it must inform all workers that they have the legal right to remain a non-member of the union and to pay only such fees as may be used for collective bargaining purposes (and no more). Paperworkers Local 1033 (Weyerhaeuser Paper Co.) addressed issues which California Saw did not, and Truesdale and the Board unanimously held that a union must inform all bargaining unit members (not just existing nonmembers) of their Beck rights and that they must inform all union members that they have the right to become a nonmember. In Canteen Co., 317 NLRB 1052 (1995), enf'd. 103 F.2d 1355 (7th Cir. 1997), Truesdale joined with the majority in a major new ruling on successorship. [...] In Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB, 482 U.S. 27 (1987), the Supreme Court had held that if a one company succeeds another, it has a duty to bargain with the previous company's union if there is a substantial continuity between the two companies and the new company retains at least 50 percent of the workforce. Joining an opinion written by Gould, Truesdale held that the duty to bargain was not sundered by the employer's decision to change wage rates or benefit levels. In Keeler Brass Automotive group, 317 NLRB 1110 (1995), Gould convinced Truesdale and Cohen to change their vote and form a five-member majority in holding that a grievance committee is not a labor organization under the NLRA and hence cannot be a [...] "company union" [...] (even if employer-dominated). In A.P.R.A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, 320 NLRB 408 (1995), Truesdale joined with Gould against Democratic Member Peggy Browning to interpret the Supreme Court's ruling in Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883 (1984). [...] The Court had held in Sure-Tan that undocumented workers are entitled to back pay awards under the NLRA. In A.P.R.A. Fuel Oil, the collective bargaining agreement required the employer to reinstate laid-off workers first when it begins hiring again. If there were no dismissed workers available, then the employer was required to hire union-referred workers. [...] The union asserted that this included undocumented workers. But Truesdale and the majority held that the Board has no authority to force an employer to hire such undocumented workers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Wood plastic {{composites}} (WPCs) <b>are</b> <b>the</b> industrial products. It is {{made out}} of wood waste fibre and waste plastic glued together by heat and pressure. Nowadays WPCs products are preferred over solid wood in many applications due to certain comparative advantages. <b>Sawing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> machining operation frequently used in manufacturing parts of WPCs. The aim of this article <b>is</b> to study <b>the</b> effect of cutting speed on surface roughness in different WPCs sawing. A plan of WPCs <b>sawing</b> experiments <b>was</b> preformed with prefixed cutting parameters. <b>The</b> objective <b>was</b> to establish correlation between rice hull flour/PE composite, rice hull flour/PP, rice hull flour/PVC and cutting speed with the surface roughness after sawing. The results show that the spindle speed had significant effects on the surface qualities of rice hull flour/PE composites, rice hull flour/PVC composites and rice hull flour/PP composites. The advantage of using a high cutting speed in WPCs <b>sawing</b> <b>is</b> evident. With appropriate cutting parameters, one can obtain surfaces with Ra＜ 6 µm and to get surfaces qualities (dimensional precision) in workpiece of different WPCs...|$|R
