In this Bachelor’s Degree Final Project we study the Groebner fan of a polynomial ideal, including the proof by Fukuda, Jensen and Thomas {{that it is}} a polyhedral complex consisting of polyhedral cones. Next, we will see a constructive proof of the existence of the state polytope of a homogeneous ideal, whose normal fan is the Grobner fan of such ideal. On the other hand, we will introduce toric ideals associated with integer matrices and regular triangulations of the latter.

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between tropical Severi varieties and secondary fans. In the case when tropical Severi varieties are hypersurfaces this relationship is very well known; specifically, in this case, a tropical Severi variety of codimension 1 is a subfan of the corresponding <b>secondary</b> <b>fan.</b> It was expected {{for some time that}} this continues to hold more generally, but Katz found a counterexample in codimension 2, showing that this relationship is more subtle. The two main results in this paper are as follows. The first theorem finds a simple condition under which a tropical Severi variety cannot be a subfan of the corresponding <b>secondary</b> <b>fan.</b> The second theorem provides a partial converse, namely, we find conditions under which a cone of the <b>secondary</b> <b>fan</b> is fully contained in the tropical Severi variety.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} greedily solvable linear programs in a geometric way. Such linear programs have recently been considered by Queyranne, Spieksma and Tardella, Faigle and Kern, and Krüger for antichains of posets, and by Frank for a class of lattice polyhedra, and by Kashiwabara and Okamoto for extreme points of abstract convex geometries. Our guiding principle is that solving linear programs is equivalent to finding a normal cone of a polyhedron which contains a given cost vector. Motivated by this observation, we introduce and investigate a class of simplicial subdivisions, called greedy fans, whose membership problem can be greedily solvable. Our approach sheds a new perspective on greediness and submodularity in terms of theory of regular triangulations. Furthermore we introduce a well-behaved special class of greedy fans, named acyclic greedy fans, which can be obtained by some poset. In particular, its close relationship to reverse lexicographic triangulations is revealed. We show that the set of acyclic greedy fans on fixed vertices can be naturally regarded as a certain kind of a polyhedral subdivision like <b>secondary</b> <b>fans.</b> We establish the relationship between our approach and Frank’s and Kashiwabara and Okamoto’s models...|$|R

40|$|The Maxwell {{integral}} equations {{of transfer}} {{are applied to}} a series of problems involving flows of arbitrary density gases about spheres. As suggested by Lees a two sided Maxwellian-like weighting function containing a number of free parameters is utilized and a sufficient number of partial differential moment equations is used to determine these parameters. Maxwell's inverse fifth-power force law is used to simplify the evaluation of the collision integrals appearing in the moment equations. All flow quantities are then determined by integration of the weighting function which results from the solution of the differential moment system. Three problems are treated: the heat-flux from a slightly heated sphere at rest in an infinite gas; the velocity field and drag of a slowly moving sphere in an unbounded space; the velocity field and drag torque on a slowly rotating sphere. Solutions to the third problem are found to both first and second-order in surface Mach number with the <b>secondary</b> centrifugal <b>fan</b> motion being of particular interest.

40|$|We {{study the}} physics of {{two-dimensional}} N=(2, 2) gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) via the two-sphere partition function. We show that the classical phase boundaries separating distinct GLSM phases, which are described by the <b>secondary</b> <b>fan</b> construction for abelian GLSMs, are completely encoded in the analytic structure of the partition function.

We develop a set of conditions that are necessary for a GLSM phase to admit an interpretation as the low-energy limit of a non-linear sigma model with a Calabi-Yau threefold target space.

40|$|Debris-flow {{fans with}} depositional records over several 105 years {{may be useful}} {{archives}} for the understanding of fan construction by debris flows and post-depositional surface modification over long timescales. Reading these archives, however, requires that we establish the temporal and spatial pattern of debris-flow activity over time. We used a combination of geomorphic mapping of fan surface characteristics, digital topographic analysis, and cosmogenic radionuclide dating using 10 Be and 26 Al to study {{the evolution of the}} Warm Springs fan {{on the west side of}} southern Death Valley, California. The 10 Be concentrations yield dates that vary from 989 ± 43 to 595 ± 17 ka on the proximal fan and between 369 ± 13 and 125 ± 5 ka on distal fan surfaces. The interpretation of these results as true depositional ages though is complicated by high inheritance with a minimum of 65 ka measured at the catchment outlet and of at least 125 ka at the distal fan. Results from the 26 Al measurements suggest that most sample locations on the fan surfaces underwent simple exposure and were not affected by complex histories of burial and re-exposure. This implies that Warm Springs fan is a relatively stable landform that underwent several 105 years of fan aggradation before fan head incision caused abandonment of the proximal and central fan surfaces and deposition continued on a younger unit at the distal fan. We show that the primary depositional debris-flow morphology is eliminated over a time scale of less than 105 years, which prevents the delineation of individual debris flows as well as the precise reconstruction of lateral shifts in deposition as we find it on younger debris-flow <b>fans.</b> <b>Secondary</b> post-depositional processes control subsequent evolution of surface morphology with the dissection of planar surfaces while smoothing of convex-up interfluves between incised channels continues through time...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{conceptual}} {{models of}} the aquifer systems are an essential base working for groundwater modelling and for a correct groundwater resources management. At {{the same time the}} right approach to obtain reliable conceptual models is certainly interdisciplinary, which guarantees the knowledge of geological, hydrogeological and geochemical features of the aquifer systems. In this contribute an example of multidisciplinary study carried out on the Versilian coastal plain aquifers (NW Tuscany) is presented, underlining as the comparison between geological framework and hydraulic, hydrodynamic, chemical and isotopic data allowed at understanding the feeding mechanism of groundwater flow and at defining the seawater-freshwater mixing process. The study area has an extension of about 55 kmq and it has delimitated by Poveromo and Motrone ditch, northward and southward respectively, and by shoreline and Apuan Alps, in the western and eastern parts. The Versilian plain constitutes a recent succession of alternating continental and marine deposits. Hydrostratigraphic cross-sections reaching a depth of about 80 - 100 metres were elaborated. Aquitards/aquicludes are locally interbedded to the prevalent aquifer terms, which are mainly made up by sand and gravel. Gravel is shallow in the inner portion of the plain, where the alluvial fan of Versilia River is present. Seaward gravel deepens and is overlain by sands. For this framework the aquifer results throughout a phreatic monolayer, although the local presence of superficial silty-clayey or peaty deposits may determine confined or semi-confined conditions. Moreover, the presence of a discontinuos subsurface layer of conglomerate and silty-clayley lenses may locally separate the groundwater flow in multiple levels. In order to achieve {{the purpose of the present}} work, multiple types of hydrogeological and hydrodinamics surveys and chemical and isotopic analyses on water samples were performed. In details, two piezometric surveys and physical-chemical analyses (temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, Eh) were carried out in April 2009 (high level condition) and in September 2009 (low level condition). On the whole, 192 wells and 14 stream water points were examined. Piezometric and iso-conductive maps suggest as the recharge area of the coastal plain is mainly the alluvial fan. Afterwards, more detailed hydrogeochemical analyses were performed. Major elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, NO 3, SO 4, HCO 3), some minor elements (Br, F, B, As, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn) concentration and some isotopic ratios (2 H/ 1 H, 18 O/ 16 O for water and 13 C/ 12 C of total inorganic carbon dissolved) were estimated. Vertical logs were also performed in order to measure the electrical conductivity and temperature into 10 wells next to the coastline. In addition, in the apex of the fan a long term pumping test was executed, determining the aquifer hydraulic parameters (K, T, S). The last, together with the potentiometric surface, allowed us estimating the groundwater flow rate at the section corresponding to the Versilia River entrance into the plain. Finally, comparing all data, it was possible to identify the principal component which supplies the coastal aquifer system starting from the upper part of the plain, where the Versilia River feeds the groundwater hosted in its alluvial <b>fan.</b> <b>Secondary</b> contributes are linkable to the local rainfall infiltration, well recognized in the dune sand, and to the groundwater flow coming from some fractured complexes bordering the plain.
