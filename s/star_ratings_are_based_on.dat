30|$|The {{providers}} {{compete on}} the basis of pay-for-performance contract which are drawn up, designed and monitored by the Australian Department of Employment. The government issues contracts to the providers based on performance for periods of three to four years. Provider performance is rated under this system. There is a form of <b>ratings</b> which <b>are</b> called <b>star</b> <b>ratings,</b> which <b>are</b> <b>based</b> mainly on econometrically-adjusted estimates of the performance of the providers, taking account of the caseload and the state of the local labour market and other factors. Providers are driven out of the market {{at the end of the}} contract period if their performance is not judged to be up to standard. Or some of them go out of business because they are unable to make money from the remuneration that they get under the contract.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{organizations}} {{have changed their}} work culture in which the business and IT leaders work together with the organizational data {{in order to make}} decisions and planning. The handling of these big data was always a challenging taking for IT people as it involved large and complex information, which cannot be handled by conventional tools. For the present study on big data analytics, yelp dataset is taken as a case study. Yelp is a website which publishes crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses and provides opportunity to business owners to improve their services and helps the users to choose best business amongst available. However, it is not possible for the business owners to go through all the user reviews and make important decisions for the improvement of their business. Here comes the importance of big data analytics. There have been many researchers in the past who worked with yelp dataset and produced very good results with the data. However, many of those studies were focussed on prediction algorithms. In the present study, an attempt is made to interpret the yelp review data using two different data processing techniques; change point analysis and sentiment analysis. Our approach is aimed to provide the owners a more realistic interpretation of the yelp data and finally make some important decisions on the improvement of the business. The relevant businesses for the present study <b>are</b> obtained <b>based</b> on certain criteria, {{in order to have a}} better applicability of the analysis methods. The businesses which have adequate number of reviews and highest fluctuation in the business <b>star</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>are</b> chosen for the study. The change point algorithm is used to obtain the period of fluctuation in the star rating over the past years. In order to ensure optimum number of change points obtained, various parameters used in the change point algorithm <b>is</b> determined <b>based</b> on a sensitivity study. The change points obtained indicated the time where there is a noticeable deviation in the business <b>star</b> <b>ratings.</b> From the present study, it is observed that the number of change points obtained strongly depends on the penalty function used in the algorithm. Further in the study, sentiment analysis is performed on the review text data corresponding to the same business and star rating data used in change point analysis. Sentiment analysis is meant for text data processing, in which the overall polarity of the text <b>is</b> obtained <b>based</b> on the positive and negative words and phrases used in the text data. In the present study, the polarity of the review text data is obtained using sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is performed using Textblob text processing in python. It was observed that there is an overall agreement with the sentiment score of the review text and business ratings. The correlation between sentiment score and change points obtained for the selected businesses were further investigated. There was clear deviation in the sentiment score whenever there is a change point obtained. The possible reasons for the deviation in the <b>star</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>were</b> made <b>based</b> on reviewing the positive and negative noun phrases in the business review text data...|$|R

Methods: We analyzed risk-adjusted data for more than 3000 US hospitals from CMS Hospital Compare using linear regression. Results: We found that better patient experience was associated with favorable clinical outcomes. Specifically, a higher number of stars for patient experience had a statistically significant association with lower rates of many in-hospital complications. A higher patient experience star rating also had a statistically significant association with lower rates of unplanned readmissions to the hospital within 30 days. Conclusion: Better patient experience according to the CMS <b>star</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>is</b> associated with favorable clinical outcomes.

40|$|The Affordable Care Act set {{in motion}} a renewed {{emphasis}} on quality of care evaluation. However, the evaluation strategies of quality by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services do not consider geography when comparisons are made among plans. Using an overall measure of a plan's quality in the public sector [...] the Medicare Advantage (MA) <b>star</b> <b>ratings</b> [...] we explored the impact of geography in these ratings. We identified 2, 872 U. S counties in 2010. The geographic factor predicted a larger fraction of the MA ratings' compared to socio-demographic factors which explained less. Also, after the risk adjustments, almost half of the U. S. states changed their ranked position in the <b>star</b> <b>ratings.</b> Further, lower MA <b>star</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>were</b> identified in the Southeastern region.
