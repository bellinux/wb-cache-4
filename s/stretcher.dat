5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a <b>Stretcher</b> match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam, {{in which the}} object is to place your {{opponent}} on a <b>stretcher</b> and wheel the <b>stretcher</b> across a finish line. The match went back and forth before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on the <b>stretcher</b> and tried to wheel him across the finishing line. Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the <b>stretcher.</b> Van Dam wheeled the <b>stretcher</b> over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the <b>stretcher.</b>|$|E

5|$|Batista and Orton {{decided to}} work {{together}} to assault Bryan, and the original referee returned to the match. At ringside, Batista threw Bryan down with a Batista Bomb onto the Spanish announce table, while Orton immediately combined with an inverted version of his signature RKO maneuver. As both Bryan and Orton were sent through the Spanish announce table, only Batista emerged unscathed. Medical personnel arrived and carted Bryan away on a <b>stretcher.</b> Batista attacked Orton, who retaliated with a DDT onto the floor. Suddenly, Bryan got off the <b>stretcher</b> and crawled back to the ring, where he was set upon by Orton.|$|E
25|$|The heading {{course in}} English garden wall bond {{sometimes}} features bricks {{of a different}} colour to its surrounding <b>stretchers.</b> In English chalk districts, flint is substituted for the <b>stretchers,</b> and the headers constitute a lacing course.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of foot arch <b>stretchers,</b> dancers found creative ways to stretch their feet: usually placing their feet under pianos or couches, or having a partner manually force the stretch. It wasn't until the early 2000s that a few crafty dancers put their minds to work {{and came up with}} a solution. Between 2000 and 2001 foot arch <b>stretchers</b> first emerged in both the United States of America (with the Arch Genie) and in Europe (with the Ballet Footstretch). Since the creation and introduction of these foot arch <b>stretchers</b> to the market, there have been many imitation foot <b>stretchers</b> flooding the market.|$|R
2500|$|This bond {{also has}} {{alternating}} stretching and heading courses. [...] However, whilst the heading courses are identical with {{those found in}} the standard English bond, the stretching courses alternate between a course composed entirely of <b>stretchers,</b> and a course composed of <b>stretchers</b> half off-set relative to the <b>stretchers</b> two courses above or below, by reason of a header placed just before the quoins at either end. The bond is widely found in Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands.|$|R

5000|$|The {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of using foot arch <b>stretchers</b> has been called into question by many dance and healthcare specialists. Most of the controversy surrounds the idea that foot <b>stretchers</b> weaken the muscles and tendons by forcing them into [...] "pointe" [...] position {{for long periods of}} time. However, most of the same sources agree that foot arch <b>stretchers</b> can be a valuable addition to dance training when accompanied by strengthening exercises to build up the areas of the foot that are stretched.|$|R

5|$|On 26 February, {{an interim}} report {{published}} by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was {{the condition of the}} <b>stretcher</b> bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. The <b>stretcher</b> bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train.|$|E
5|$|As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's {{headquarters}} {{near the}} Trostle barn, the general {{and his staff}} began {{to move to the}} rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was carried off in a <b>stretcher,</b> sitting up and puffing on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force.|$|E
5|$|Following engagements at Bullecourt, the 5th Division—of {{which the}} 55th Battalion was part—spent {{four months in}} reserve, before moving into the Ypres sector in Belgium. Made a regular <b>stretcher</b> bearer, Corey was {{decorated}} with a bar to his Military Medal for his actions on 26 September during the Battle of Polygon Wood. While subject to heavy artillery and machine gun fire, he frequently ventured out into no-man's-land to tend to the wounded.|$|E

Rothenburg then dies of her injuries.|$|E
5|$|Shabazz {{was in the}} {{audience}} near the stage with her daughters. When she heard the gunfire, she grabbed the children and pushed them to the floor beneath the bench, where she shielded them with her body.
