60|$|They had <b>struck</b> the <b>level,</b> {{long for}} the hill country, {{at the foot of}} the hotel road, and the mare, that found herself neither {{mounting}} nor descending a steep, dropped from the trot proper for an acclivity into a rapid walk.|$|R
50|$|In the {{simplest}} sand casting procedure, the drag is placed {{upside down on}} a board, around a pattern of the part to be cast. The pattern {{is a model of}} the desired casting. Talcum powder is often dusted over the pattern to aid in the removal of the pattern. Sand is sifted over the pattern until the model is covered by a few inches of sand. More sand is then dumped into the drag, and rammed with a wooden wedge, or mechanically vibrated to pack the sand down. The sand is then <b>struck</b> <b>level</b> with the top edge of the cope, using a wooden or metal strake. A board is then placed on top of the drag and the drag is flipped over.|$|R
50|$|On August 18, 1993, an American International Airways, Inc. Douglas DC-8-61 (N814CK), {{with three}} crew members on board <b>struck</b> <b>level</b> terrain 1,400 feet {{west of the}} {{approach}} end of the runway while landing at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The aircraft approached {{from the south and}} was making a right turn for runway 10 with an increasing angle of bank in order to align with the runway. At 200-300 feet AGL the wings started to rock towards wings level and the nose pitched up. The right wing appeared to stall, the aircraft rolled to 90-degree angle of bank and the nose pitched down. Probable cause of the accident attributed primarily to the impaired judgment, decision-making, and flying abilities of the captain and flight crew due to the effects of fatigue resulting from extended flight/duty hours.|$|R

50|$|In {{the fourth}} round away to Northwich Victoria County found {{themselves}} 1-0 down after 26 minutes and 2-0 down after 47. Super-substitute Jake Harris {{was called for}} on 52 minutes and four minutes later County {{were back in the}} game as he scored to leave County trailing by only one goal. With six minutes of time remaining County looked {{to be out of the}} Trophy, but Harris <b>struck</b> again <b>levelling</b> the scores at 2-2. A replay would have been a fair result, but County won it in the 89th minute with Nat Jarvis heading the winner.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{very fast}} game played with ample movements. Leg sweeps and take downs are common in this game. The toque is {{identical}} to São Bento Pequeno, except that the 1/4 note pause is replaced by an additional solto note (i.e. the open note <b>struck</b> below the <b>level</b> of the coin) and the tempo is faster.|$|R
50|$|The underhand serve is <b>struck</b> below {{shoulder}} <b>level.</b> In children's tennis, {{young children}} may be encouraged to use the underhand serve on 36 ft courts. Although this serve is legal, it {{may be seen as}} unsportsmanlike in adult tennis. Some notable examples include Michael Chang's in the Round of 16 at the 1989 French Open against Ivan Lendl, and Martina Hingis was booed by the crowd for hitting one at the 1999 French Open.|$|R
60|$|The chase now {{was close}} and all down-hill for the watchers. Silvermane twinkled {{in and out}} among the cedars, and {{suddenly}} stopped short on the rim. He wheeled and coursed away toward the crags, and vanished. But soon he reappeared, for Billy had cut across and faced him about. Again he <b>struck</b> the <b>level</b> stretch. Dave was {{there in front of}} him. He shot away to the left, and flashed through the glades beyond. The brothers saved their steeds, content to keep him cornered in that end of the plateau. Then August spurred his roan into the scene of action. Silvermane came out on the one piece of rising ground beyond the level, and stood looking backward toward the brothers. When the great roan crashed through the thickets into his sight he leaped {{as if he had been}} stung, and plunged away.|$|R
25|$|The New South Wales Government Railways placed {{orders for}} five diesel power vans with Eveleigh Carriage Workshops and 12 trailer cars with Ritchie Brothers, Auburn in the mid-1930s. The double ended power cars were each fitted with two Harland & Wolff Hardlandic diesel engines. One was {{destroyed}} by fire at Ivanhoe in January 1950 with the remaining four repowered with General Motors 6-110 engines between 1952 and 1957. Another was withdrawn after being <b>struck</b> at a <b>level</b> crossing at Forbes in August 1982. The carriages were the first in Australia to feature air-conditioning.|$|R
5000|$|Olmstead and Zúñiga were <b>struck</b> by the <b>level</b> {{of public}} {{advertising}} {{and the extent}} to which public space had been privatized through advertising: Even the strap handles on Santiago buses held slots for advertising. One bus company ad stated [...] "We worry about your security, what do you worry about?" [...] The collaborators adopted this ad imitating its font, style and colors. One version included an illustration of Milton Friedman said [...] "The economy is in your hands" [...] and the other an illustration of Juan Sebastian Piñera Echenique, the neo liberal president of Chile, in ads declaring [...] "Consumerism is in your hands." ...|$|R
60|$|Thirty {{precious}} {{minutes that}} seemed as many hours to the impatient men were consumed in locating a precarious {{way from the}} summit {{to the base of}} the cliffs that bounded the plateau upon the south, and then once again they <b>struck</b> off upon <b>level</b> ground toward their goal. The closer they approached the fort the greater became their apprehension that all would not be well. They pictured the barracks deserted or the small company massacred and the buildings in ashes. It was almost in a frenzy of fear that they broke through the final fringe of jungle and stood at last upon the verge of the open meadow a half-mile from Fort Dinosaur.|$|R
5000|$|Brooks Atkinson {{wrote in}} the New York Times review: [...] "Although Miss Merman is jaunty and Mr. Lahr is funny, they {{have a hard time}} keeping this show merry.

As the music-maker Mr. Porter has written a number of accomplished tunes in the modern idiom and one excellent romantic song, [...] "Do I Love You?" [...] but the lyrics are no more inspired than the book; they treat all humor as middling. The performers supply more pleasure than the authors and composer. Betty Grable and Charles Walters, who would also be featured in a free society, dance and sing with remarkable dash." ...|$|R
60|$|On the Sunday {{following}} this {{interview with the}} Truth Mr. Lavender, who ever found the day of rest irksome to his strenuous spirit, left his house after an early supper. It, had been raining all day, but the sinking sun had now emerged and <b>struck</b> its <b>level</b> light into the tree tops from a still cloudy distance. Followed by Blink, he threaded the puddled waste which lies {{to the west of}} the Spaniard's Road, nor was it long before the wild beauty of the scene infected his spirit, and he stood still to admire the world spread out. The smoke rack of misted rain was still drifting above the sunset radiance in an apple-green sky; and behind Mr. Lavender, as he gazed at those clouds symbolical of the world's unrest, a group of tall, dark pine-trees, wild and witch-like, had collected as if in audience of his cosmic mood. He formed a striking group for a painter, with the west wind flinging back his white hair, and fluttering his dark moustache along his cheeks, while Blink, a little in front of him, pointed at the prospect and emitted barks whose vigour tossed her charming head now to this side now to that.|$|R
5000|$|Tayler was {{promoted}} to lieutenant on 29 April 1802, and on 18 October 1803 he {{was appointed to the}} 50-gun fourth-rate , serving in her under Captains James Nicoll Morris, Francis William Austen, and Richard Raggett. Leopard was part of the squadron stationed off Boulogne during Napoleon's planned invasion, and Tayler assisted in the capture of seven French gun-vessels. In October 1804 he was present at the Raid on Boulogne when the British used Robert Fulton's catamaran-torpedoes in an attempt to attack the French invasion fleet. On 30 March 1806 Leopard sailed from St Helens, Isle of Wight, with orders to escort six Indiamen as far as the Cape Verde islands. At 2 a.m. on 20 April one of the convoy, the Lady Burgess, <b>struck</b> Laten's <b>Level,</b> a rocky reef near Santiago. At daylight it was seen that her masts had fallen, and that the sea was breaking over her. Tayler volunteered to take a boat to her assistance. He contrived to throw a block attached to a rope over the stump of her bowsprit, and rescued 21 people before she broke up; nine more people were rescued from the sea. Two of the Indiaman's boats had already escaped with the captain and several others aboard; but 38 were lost. On 19 August 1806 Tayler transferred to the [...] under Captain Richard Raggett, for passage home from Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|R
60|$|He {{had ridden}} {{for nearly an}} hour, when {{suddenly}} there seemed to spring up from the earth, a mile away, a dark line of wall, terminating in an irregular, broken outline against the sky. His first impression {{was that it was}} the valda or a break of the stiff skirt of the mountain as it <b>struck</b> the <b>level</b> plain. But he presently saw the dull red of tiled roofs over the dark adobe wall, and as he dashed down into the dry bed of a vanished stream and up again on the opposite bank, he passed the low walls of a corral, until then unnoticed, and a few crows, in a rusty, half-Spanish, half-clerical suit, uttered a croaking welcome to the Rancho of the Holy Trinity, as they rose from the ground before him. It was the first sound that for an hour had interrupted the monotonous jingle of his spurs or the hollow beat of his horse's hoofs. And then, after the fashion of the country, he rose slightly in his stirrups, dashed his spurs into the sides of his mustang, swung the long, horsehair, braided thong of his bridle-rein, and charged at headlong speed upon the dozen lounging, apparently listless vaqueros, who, for the past hour, had nevertheless been watching and waiting for him at the courtyard gate. As he rode toward them, they separated, drew up each side of the gate, doffed their glazed, stiff-brimmed, black sombreros, wheeled, put spurs to their horses, and in another instant were scattered to the four winds. When Arthur leaped to the brick pavement of the courtyard, there was not one in sight.|$|R

40|$|MCom (Risk Management), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 One {{objective}} of the BCBS is to implement minimum supervisory capital standards in the banking sector. Basel I to Basel III attempted to maintain a minimum capital standard for credit risk, market risk and operational risk. Many loopholes were highlighted through years when political and economic disturbances occurred and caused volatility in the financial markets. This study analysed five major South African banks from 2002 – 2012 to determine the size of these disturbances on the regulatory capital levels. The empirical portion of this study comprised of statistical models {{to be applied to}} the quantitative observations of capital levels. These measurements served as the bases of comparison between the five banks. After the investigation it was evident that the capital levels of these five banks first decreased as the South African economy prevailed in a boom phase and banks were at ease. When the 2007 – 2009 financial crisis <b>struck,</b> the capital <b>levels</b> increased again in respect of the three risks.

40|$|The {{level of}} {{interest}} which was generated by this campaign exceeded expectations. With the present level of early retirement on ill health grounds, this interest in health and lifestyle should be rostered and supported. The format of the campaign to·date seems to have <b>struck</b> the right <b>level</b> in {{that there was a}} very positive atmosphere at the seminars, and there was a high uptake of the health screening among those amending the various venues, The following is a summary of the recommendations: 1. A structure Should be set up to address the health problems of the workforce in the Construction industry. 2. The causes and effects of absenteeism due to sickness. early retirement and sick pay benefits should be quantified. 3. Annual screening for risk factors including blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking should be carried out. 4. A Health Promotion programme aimed at reducing the level of risk factors among the workforce should be developed. 5. A smoke free environment in the workplace should be promoted. 6. The progress achieved by annual surveys of risk factors and absenteeism due to sickness should be monitored. The result of the health screening suggests {{that there is a need}} to put in place a structured screening programme for the industry and to carry out further research. Consideration should also be given to health screening other than cardiovascular e. g. audiometry testing. Such testing could be carried out on a random controlled basis which Should provide valuable data on the health of the workforce. The emphasis should clearly be on prevention rather than cure...|$|R
50|$|On the Monday {{before the}} first home game against Birmingham City, Wednesday {{confirmed}} the signing of Rodrigo Ríos Lozano, also known as Rodri, on a season-long loan from Barcelona B. It is expected that the Owls {{have the option to}} buy Rodri on a permanent basis {{at the end of the}} season. Rodri made his debut for Wednesday just the next day when he started in the first home tie of the campaign against Birmingham City. After Réda Johnson put the Owls ahead due to a mistake from England goalkeeper Jack Butland, Rodri scored on his debut, after a brilliant solo effort. The first-half ended with Wednesday two goals up. Nikola Zigic did pull back a goal for Birmingham in the second-half, but Jermaine Johnson sealed victory on the eighty-ninth minute, after going one-on-one with the goalkeeper. However, Marlon King did score from the penalty-spot, with exactly the last kick of the game, after a clumsy challenge from Réda Johnson. Wednesday went second in the league after two games, due to the amount of goals scored. Millwall were Wednesday's next opponents, again at home, and the Owls took the lead through the in-form Jermaine Johnson, who scored with a wonderful shot from outside the area. However, as thunder and lightning <b>struck</b> Hillsborough Wednesday's <b>level</b> of performance dropped, and so did their lead with Millwall scoring twice through James Henry and Liam Trotter, and Sheffield Wednesday went into the break a goal behind. Great team spirit and a higher level of performance saw Miguel Llera score a thoroughly deserved equaliser after a scramble in the box, which included the ball hitting the post and a wonderful save. Then as Wednesday pushed on defender Miguel Llera scored again after a Rhys McCabe free-kick in the last-minute of normal time. The Owls had turned it around again and won the game 3-2.|$|R
40|$|An area of 4 400 km² in the North-western Transvaal is {{compared}} to an area of 75 000 km² in the North-western Cape Province with regard to geology, physiography, and hydrology. In the Transvaal the Archaean Formations range from the Swaziland System to the Dominion Reef System, with younger intrusives and a cover of Tertiary to Recent ferricrete, calcrete and soil. In the Cape Province the comparable formations are the Kheis System to the Soetlief Formation, younger intrusives and a Tertiary to Recent cover of wind-blown sand, calcrete and soil. The available literature on the geological formations and structure is reviewed. Outcrops are scarce in the Transvaal in an almost featureless tree-covered plain with ill-defined drainage, except for the two perennial rivers. In the Cape Province relief is higher and drainage better developed towards the perennial Orange River. Large portions of the Bushmanland Plateau are nevertheless, covered by sand and calcrete, without well-developed drainage. The rain falls during summer in both areas, and the average annual rainfall is 526 mm in the Transvaal, and 176 mm in the Cape Province. In both areas the farms and villages are almost entirely dependant on ground-water supplies. The importance of geophysical methods {{in the selection of}} borehole sites is stressed, and a summary is given of the more important geological and geophysical procedures and methods in both areas. This included magnetic, electromagnetic, and electrical resistivity methods. A summary is given of previous hydrological investigations in both areas. It was fragmentary, and only a few reports from the Cape Province could be traced. The results of a total of nearly 1 500 boreholes drilled in Archaean Formations in the Transvaal, and nearly 3 800 boreholes drilled in these formations in the Cape Province are analysed with respect to different parameters. Boreholes are classified according to the geological formation in which they occur, and the physiographical conditions ruling in the area. In the different formations in the Transvaal, the (percentage of successful boreholes ranged from 30 per cent in the Dominion Reef System to 38 per cent in the Archaean Granite. In the Cape Province it ranged from 29 per cent in the Grey Gneiss to 45 per cent in the Kheis System, except for the adamellite with 6 per cent and the Soetlief lava with 90 per cent successful boreholes. In both areas certain geological and physiographical controls were determined by means of which borehole results can be improved. Analyses of geophysical data, especially apparent resistivity at the rest level, sometimes gave positive results. Depths at which water was <b>struck,</b> rest <b>levels,</b> depth of weathering, and other parameters are compared for different formations and areas...|$|R
5000|$|Fetfatzidis became on September 2013 {{the most}} {{expensive}} Greek player {{to move out of}} the Super League this summer by securing a 4 million-euro transfer from Olympiacos to Serie A club Genoa. The Greece attacking midfielder, has accepted the improved offer by Genoa that will earn him 500,000 euros per year. The deal also contains a clause providing for Genoa to give Olympiacos 25 percent of the money it will get when it sells Fetfatzidis to another club in the future. The 23-year-old Drama-born player is a product of the Olympiacos academy and was eager to play in Italy. [...] "I wish to thank president Vangelis Marinakis for helping me make my dream come true," [...] said Fetfatzidis. Ioannis Fetfatzidis has admitted that he has been <b>struck</b> by the <b>level</b> of support the Genoa fans have shown since his arrival. “The stadium is beautiful and the fans have really hit me,” he told reporters. “Football is clearly very popular in this city. I have not been on a tour of the city yet, but I will very soon. That’ll be the first step towards me acclimatization. “My ambitions? I just want to work. And if I do that, then I’m sure I can have my say”, he said in his first interview. Undoubtedly after few games with Genoa, the Greek winger had already impressed sufficiently at the Italian club to have attracted the interest of several top European sides. Scouts from Fulham and Everton have been spotted at Genoa's home games and are believed to have been impressed with the performances of the 5 foot 5 winger. Moreover, Fetfatzidis has been linked with a move to the Premier League as Roberto Martinez has reportedly identified the 22-year-old as a possible signing for the January transfer window. However, it is understood that Genoa are currently only willing to sell if a team will match their 9 million Euro valuation.|$|R
5000|$|Collingwood also {{lay in the}} Great Artesian Basin. Nevertheless, {{there does}} not seem to be any record of an {{artesian}} bore ever being attempted at Collingwood, as was done in many other places in Outback Queensland, even locally (as at Dagworth, 65 km to the northwest, in the 1890s) often with great success. Geologically, the site lies in the Eromanga Basin. More locally, the geology consists of the Cretaceous Winton Formation, and it was at Manfred Station (...) , 168 km from Collingwood's former site, where the formation yielded up at least two palaeobotanical fossils to a J. Williams in 1920. More recently, in 2005, Australovenator and Diamantinasaurus matildae Early Cretaceous dinosaur remains were unearthed by palaeontologists at the [...] "Matilda site" [...] not far north of the former town, on Elderslie Station (site's position roughly [...] ). A [...] "major fault" [...] passes just southeast of the Collingwood site, called the Cork Fault. It runs roughly northeast to southwest. Its downthrow is to the northwest, towards Collingwood. Seismic studies along this fault began in 1960 with the Bureau of Mineral Resources (now Geoscience Australia). In the years that followed, a number of other surveys were conducted by private companies, among which was the Western River Seismic Survey in 1967 by the United Geophysical Corporation, which was [...] "aimed at further defining the Permo-Triassic section on the downthrown (west) side of the Cork Fault indicated by the previous Collingwood survey (Phillips, 1966)." [...] This information is all held in a report that also mentions petroleum exploration in the area, with one exploratory well sunk about 20 km north of the former townsite, at Lovelle Downs (...) [...] Drilling was underway late in 1972 by Hematite Petroleum. The Cork Fault might have begun as long ago as the Mesoproterozoic (1.6 to 1.0 billion years ago), when it would have been part of a great network of active normal faults in the land that would eventually come to be known as Australia, although then, the land was part of the supercontinent of Rodinia. The team from Monash University who reached these conclusions and presented them in 2015, namely Giovanni P. T. Spampinato, Laurent Aillères, Peter G. Betts and Robin J. Armit, believed that while the Cork Fault was to be regarded as a fundamental crustal discontinuity, it was not Rodinia's former eastern margin. This they believe because the Cork Fault is the line in the Earth's crust where the Proterozoic Mount Isa terrane (the fault's downthrown side mentioned above) has been thrust under the Phanaerozoic Thomson Orogen (the upthrown side).Robert Logan Jack, FGS, FRGS, the Government Geologist for Queensland, wrote a report on the region (and indeed all Queensland) in 1892. Along with fellow geologist Robert Etheridge, Junior, the New South Wales Government Palaeontologist, Jack identified [...] "a bed of gypsum, of workable thickness, and of great purity" [...] at Chollarton, a place said by Jack to lie near Collingwood (although the name only seems to appear in one other place in the records, also in connection with Jack's work). Jack also mentioned in his report that the area between Wokingham Creek and the Diamantina River, just north of the town, was characterised by grey sandstones [...] "with occasional sandy ironstone or ironmasked sandstone". He furthermore wrote that there was silicified wood strewn over the ground. Jack's report also makes clear that there are coal seams in the region. A well sunk about 1878 between Werna and Ayrshire Downs, about 50 km north of Collingwood, struck two such seams, and otherwise yielded strata of grey sandstones and sandy shales with beds of argillaceous flagstone (which contained seashells) and sandstone with iron pyrites. The well also yielded forth many fragments of silicified and carbonised wood. The boring ended at 204 feet (62 m) in hard, fine-grained sandstone. Water was <b>struck</b> at two <b>levels</b> below the first coal seam. Other wells in the region, too, struck coal (but not always water).|$|R
