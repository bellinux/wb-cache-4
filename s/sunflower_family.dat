5|$|Radyr {{hawkweed}} is {{the common}} name of Hieracium radyrense, a very rare endemic member of the aster, daisy, or <b>sunflower</b> <b>family.</b> It is a microspecies, so far only identified at Radyr. It was first identified in 1907 at the quarry, {{was described as a}} variety in 1948 and then as a separate species in 1955. It has rarely been seen and regular surveys between 1998 and 2004 indicate that today only a single population of about 25 plants survives in the wild.|$|E
5|$|The {{light energy}} {{captured}} by chlorophyll a is initially {{in the form}} of electrons (and later a proton gradient) that's used to make molecules of ATP and NADPH which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme rubisco to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose is converted to starch which is stored in the chloroplast. Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while inulin, a polymer of fructose is used for the same purpose in the <b>sunflower</b> <b>family</b> Asteraceae. Some of the glucose is converted to sucrose (common table sugar) for export {{to the rest of the}} plant.|$|E

It seems that Ellis had her own taste when she choosing the object, which resulted in the limitation of botanical species in her painting.

40|$|Jerusalem {{artichoke}} (Helianthus tuberosus L.) {{belongs to}} <b>sunflower</b> Compositae <b>family,</b> generally {{considered as one}} of the oldest among modern agricultural plants. The effects of plant growth regulators on somatic embryogenesis were studied in leaf cultures of Helianthus tuberosus L. Leaf tissues of genotypes derived from allohexaploid species Helianthus tuberosus L. (2 n = 6 x = 102) responded to growth regulators (BAP/kinetin, NAA/IAA), while adventitious organogenesis or somatic embryogenesis were occasionally induced. A remarkable regeneration frequency (about 39 to 41. 6 %) was only achieved from leaves from plants treated with BAP 0. 5 or NAA 0. 1 mg l- 1. White globular structures were initiated on the adaxial surface of these leaves without intermediate callus phase. Somatic embryogenesis was asynchronous and embryoids of different developmental stage were simultaneously detected on each explant. Although many embryos developed single or malformed cotyledons or germinated precociously without differentiation of complete root system, phenotypically normal plants were regenerated after rooting on half strength MS free regulators medium...|$|R

40|$|An allergy to honey {{is a rare}} symptom. It usually {{occurs when}} people are {{allergic}} to food components, pollen and bee venom. Most often an allergy to honey is manifested by disturbances of skin and digestive system. Anaphylaxis is seldom, pollen proteins are more often the cause of an allergy to honey than honeybee ones. In particular cases an allergy {{can be caused by}} moulds, yeasts and secretion of sapsucking insects. An allergy to honey is often caused by pollen of floral plants from Compositae family (e. g. : sunflower, mugwort, marguerite, dandelion, golden rod, ragweed). It is caused more rarely by grass pollen (timothy) and trees (birch, hazel, olive). The cross allergy between two kinds of pollen of the same <b>family</b> (dandelion and <b>sunflower)</b> and between pollen of different <b>families</b> (<b>sunflower</b> and celery) is well-known.

5000|$|Hieracium ,known by {{the common}} name {{hawkweed}} and classically as hierakion (from ancient Greek ιεράξ, hierax 'hawk'), [...] is a genus of the <b>sunflower</b> (Helianthus) <b>family</b> Asteraceae (or Compositae), and {{closely related to}} dandelion (Taraxacum), chicory (Cichorium), prickly lettuce (Lactuca) and sow thistle (Sonchus),which {{are part of the}} tribe Cichorieae. Hawkweeds, with their 10,000+ recorded species and subspecies, do their part to make Asteraceae the second largest family of flowers.Some botanists group all these species or subspecies into approximately 800 accepted species, while others prefer to accept several thousand species. Since most hawkweeds reproduce exclusively asexually by means of seeds that are genetically identical to their mother plant (apomixis or agamospermy), clones or populations that consist of genetically identical plants are formed and some botanists (especially in UK, Scandinavia and Russia) prefer to accept these clones as good species (arguing {{that it is impossible to}} know how these clones are interrelated) whereas others (mainly in Central Europe and USA) try to group them into a few hundred more broadly defined species. What is here treated as the single genus Hieracium is now treated by most European experts as two different genera, Hieracium and Pilosella, with species such as Hieracium pilosella, Hieracium floribundum and Hieracium aurantiacum referred to the latter genus. Many members of the genus Pilosella reproduce both by stolons (runners like those of strawberries) and by seeds, whereas true Hieracium species reproduce only by seeds. In Pilosella, many individual plants are capable of forming both normal sexual and asexual (apomictic) seeds, whereas individual plants of Hieracium only produce one kind of seeds. Another difference is that all species of Pilosella have leaves with smooth (entire) margins whereas most species of Hieracium have distinctly dentate to deeply cut or divided leaves.|$|R
40|$|Members of the CYCLOIDEA (CYC) /TEOSINTE-BRANCHED 1 (TB 1) {{group of}} {{transcription}} {{factors have been}} implicated {{in the evolution of}} zygomorphic (i. e., bilaterally symmetric) flowers in Antirrhinum and Lotus and the loss of branching phenotype during the domestication of maize. The composite inflorescences of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. Asteraceae) contain both zygomorphic and actinomorphic (i. e., radially symmetric) florets (rays and disks, respectively), and the cultivated sunflower has evolved an unbranched phenotype in response to domestication from its highly branched wild progenitor; hence, genes related to CYC/TB 1 are of great interest in this study system. We identified 10 members of the CYC/TB 1 gene <b>family</b> in <b>sunflower,</b> which is more than found in any other species investigated to date. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these genes occur in 3 distinct clades, consistent with previous research in other eudicot species. A combination of dating the duplication events and linkage mapping indicates that only some of the duplications were associated with polyploidization. Cosegregation between CYC-like genes and branching-related quantitative trait loci suggest a minor, if any, role for these genes in conferring differences in branching. However, the expression patterns of one gene suggest a possible {{role in the development of}} ray versus disk florets. Molecular evolutionary analyses reveal that residues in the conserved domains were the targets of positive selection following gene duplication. Taken together, these results indicate that gene duplication and functional divergence have played a major role in diversification of the <b>sunflower</b> CYC gene <b>family...</b>|$|R
40|$|Plant-plant {{interference}} {{is inherently}} local and seed dispersal generally limited. Both processes generate spatial and genetic structure within plant populations and communities {{that need to}} be better understood in order to predict dynamic community changes due for example to biodiversity loss or global change. There is increasingly strong theoretical evidence that spatial pattern is an essential factor controlling the species dynamics of many communities. In particular, one conclusion from spatial models is that intraspecific aggregation promotes coexistence by slowing down competitive exclusion. Whereas local interactions contribute to interspecific segregation, limited seed dispersal leads to aggregation at two hierarchical levels: i) species within communities and ii) genetically related individuals (e. g. siblings) within populations. However, especially for plant communities {{there is a need for}} experimental tests of the predictions generated from spatial models. The principal goal of this thesis was to narrow the gap between theoretical and empirical investigations on the role of spatial pattern in plant communities and population dynamics. I focused on the effects of spatial pattern on the dynamics of experimental plant communities at the level of species as well as at the level of genotypes within species. In particular, I (i) manipulated the spatial pattern, i. e. the relative frequency of intra- vs. interspecific contacts and (ii) contrasted the performance of genetically related (half-sibs) vs. non-related individuals. The basic goal of the experiments was to investigate whether different spatial patterns (random vs. aggregated) and relatedness of neighbors had any effects on population dynamics within experimental plant communities. The experiments provided interesting results and showed essential aspects of the role of intraspecific aggregation and sibling interference in regulating the dynamics of populations within experimental plant communities. I showed that weak competitors increased their fitness (e. g. biomass and seed production) when grown in neighborhoods of conspecifics compared to neighborhoods of heterospecifics, at least in the short run. The data further suggested that the advantages of intraspecific aggregation for weaker competitors might be independent of the species identity and that all other species are best avoided. An additional aggregation at the level of genotypes (e. g. seed families) suggested speciesspecific effects linked with seed size. For instance, I found negative sibling competition effects for the small-seeded species (Capsella), while rather positive effects for the largeseeded species (Stachys). Negative effects of sibling competition were also observed among relatives of <b>sunflower</b> seed <b>families.</b> By contrast, genetically similar individuals of the dimorphic species Senecio jacobaea increased their fitness (e. g. biomass) compared to genetically dissimilar individuals. However, also this species suggested seed traits specific relatedness effects (e. g. dispersal ability). Positive relatedness effects were more evident by seeds expected to aggregate more locally (without pappus) than by seeds expected to disperse wider (with pappus). Generally, I observed lower size variation (measured as coefficients of variation) among related compared to non-related individuals. This might be a consequence of more genetic uniformity and / or kin selection among relatives compared to non-relatives. Although, I could not provide strong evidence for sibling competition or kin selection, I believe that relatedness among plants, especially for species with highly localized dispersal, should play a considerable role in the regulation of local population dynamics. Similar to the species level, there must be subtle trade-offs (e. g. between neighbour relatedness and density) that determine the complicated local dynamics of plant communities. However, the question under which circumstances and to which extent relatedness effects are species-specific remains open and deserves further investigation. At the level of species, effects of intraspecific aggregation on the dynamics of experimental plant communities were clear and consistent throughout my experiments. By contrast, at the level of genotypes, they were less clear and to some extent contrasting. This emphasized the importance for further investigations on population dynamics at levels below that of species. From an applied point of view, findings of this thesis might help to give better information for management practices (e. g. restoring species rich communities). For example, by varying spatial pattern (random vs. intraspecifically aggregated) of selected species in wildflowers strips or fallows, the dominance of undesired species (e. g. Dipsacus sp.) and the exclusion of weaker species can be delayed...|$|R
