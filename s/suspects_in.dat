5|$|The Gun Court is {{the branch}} of the Jamaican {{judicial}} system that tries criminal cases involving firearms. The Court was established by Parliament in 1974 to combat rising gun violence, and empowered to try <b>suspects</b> <b>in</b> camera, without a jury.

Those convicted by the Gun Court are imprisoned in a dedicated prison compound at South Camp in Kingston. Until 1999, the Gun Court sessions were also held in the same facility.|$|E

5|$|Exton {{submitted}} {{his report}} to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton {{that the report}} and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between {{the company and the}} fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of <b>suspects</b> <b>in</b> her book, Madeleine (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.|$|E
5|$|As Steinhauer {{noted in}} his autobiography, the UK was a {{dangerous}} environment for a foreign agent. Only five years previously, the country {{had not had a}} dedicated counter-espionage organisation. In 1909 a series of spy scares fanned by the press led to the establishment of the Secret Service Bureau, jointly headed by Captain Vernon Kell and Lieutenant-Commander Mansfield Cumming. They soon split their responsibilities; Kell took charge of counter-espionage, while Cumming focused on foreign intelligence. These two divisions of the Secret Service Bureau eventually became two independent intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6. The Bureau quickly identified a list of possible German agents in the UK. Just before the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, Chief Constables across Britain and Ireland were instructed to arrest <b>suspects</b> <b>in</b> their areas. This was done quickly and a number of German agents were caught, crippling German intelligence operations in the UK at a crucial moment in the war. Steinhauer himself had been lucky to escape arrest; he was known by name to the British authorities and he had been spying on the Royal Navy in Scotland as recently as late June 1914.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute {{a number of his}} Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's {{superiors}}. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural <b>suspects</b> <b>in</b> Romania. It is {{a result of}} this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, and ultimately falling of the stool (which his mare had chewed on) and weeping uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is stoned by those Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.|$|E
5|$|Nick flees at high speed, {{setting off}} a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their {{reservations}} about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them <b>suspects</b> <b>in</b> Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film Snow Falling on Cedars. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him {{to get rid of}} the witness.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 2012, the Delhi Police Department arrested Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Hamza, {{one of the}} key <b>suspects</b> <b>in</b> {{the attack}} at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. His arrest was touted as the most {{significant}} development in the case since Kasab's arrest. Security agencies had been chasing him for three years in Delhi. Ansari is a Lashker-e-Taiba ultra and the Hindi tutor of the 10 attackers who were responsible for the Mumbai attacks in 2008. He was apprehended, after he was arrested and deported to India by Saudi Intelligence officials as per official request by Indian authorities. After Ansari's arrest, investigations revealed that in 2009 he allegedly stayed for a day in a room in Old Legislators's Hostel, belonging to Fauzia Khan, a former MLA and minister in Maharashtra Government. The minister, however, denied having any links with him. Home Minister P. Chidambaram, asserted that Ansari was provided a safe place in Pakistan and was present in the control room, which could not have been established without active State support. Ansari's interrogation further revealed that Sajid Mir and a Pakistani Army major visited India under fake names as cricket spectators to survey targets in Delhi and Mumbai for about a fortnight.|$|E
