5000|$|The lady's {{position}} may {{be classified}} as upright (upper body vertical), star (sideways with upper body parallel to the ice), or platter (flat with upper body parallel to the ice, facing up or down). Lifts without rotation are termed carry lifts. In current competitive skating, they are incorporated into lifts that include rotation before or after, unlike in the past where they would more typically appear as <b>separate</b> <b>lifts.</b> Lifts below the man's shoulders are termed dance lifts and are counted toward the choreography mark. Stationary lifts, lifts performed [...] "on the spot" [...] without ice coverage, are also counted in choreography.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two main objectives: Learning to use NORSOK-R 002 and comparing it with Aker Solutions former work instruction manual A 237; and conducting a case study on the main frame of the C 05 east balcony for the Gina Krog project. The main task in the case study was to maintain proper weight structure with sufficient capacity and strength in respect to transportation, installation and operation. Apart from that, the design analysis and optimization of this structure were undertaken to create a structure that has a high element of safety with respect to life, environment and economic risk. NORSOK R- 002 was used for hand calculations of <b>lifting</b> <b>accessories</b> used in the case study. During modeling, design analysis and optimization of the C 05 balcony the following software tools were learned and used:  STAAD. pro.  Mathcad. In addition, the following topics were considered:  Evaluation and use of relevant rules and standards for offshore construction.  Optimizing the main frame and selection of steel profiles to achieve optimum design with respect to weight, strength and costs for transport, lifting, installation and operation.  Using the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) method for checks and control.  Local calculation of joints, beams, lifting lug, slings, master links, forerunners, bolts, welds and other <b>lifting</b> <b>accessories.</b> The structural design and analysis was performed considering the lifting operation as basic. However, other stages had {{to be considered in}} order to create an optimal structure.

These hazards are identified; their risks explained and studied; and appropriate advice for stakeholders explicated. A developmental approach is employed that embraces accrual of evidence; case studies; theoretical examination; and derivation of guidance. It is found that excavators are often used as cranes employing both ‘formal’ or less satisfactory ‘informal’ methods of load connection. Hazards from using excavators as cranes (found principally among load connection points and associated <b>lifting</b> <b>accessories),</b> are often ‘hidden’ {{and can lead to}} catastrophic failure during lifting operations.

Below is space for catering, a laundromat, ironing facilities and office space.

50|$|Like the Yak-141, the Yak-43 {{would have}} had only a single main engine, {{as well as two}} {{dedicated}} vertical-lift engines. The main engine would have been based on the Samara NK-321 three-shaft augmented turbofan with a takeoff rating of 24,980 kg (55,077 lb). This same engine is used to power the Tupolev Tu-160 Blackjack bomber. The engine {{would have had}} a large air bleed leading to an auxiliary combustion chamber located in the nose, though a <b>separate</b> <b>lift</b> jet would have been retained.|$|R

50|$|Pow Wow is a rope tow, {{built out}} of an old dump truck, the rope runs between the double tires, and over old car wheel rims mounted on old {{telephone}} poles. The lift was originally powered by the truck's diesel engine, but was later converted to run on an electric motor. This lift has two ropes that run parallel over both truck wheels, and is considered as two <b>separate</b> <b>lifts,</b> however both ropes are powered by the same motor, so they start and stop at the same times.|$|R
5000|$|The Learning Centre {{has its own}} {{separate}} {{entrance and}} is arranged over two floors. It is serviced by a <b>separate</b> <b>lift</b> and stairs. It can therefore be used both during and outside of normal opening hours. On the ground floor there is a dedicated Entrance, Reception, toilets and two classrooms seating up to 20 students each. On the first floor there are two multi-purpose rooms, which {{can also be used}} as additional classrooms, reception area or as an extension to the adjacent Lecture Room which seats up to 80 visitors.|$|R

50|$|Goldfinger's {{design is}} based on his earlier and {{slightly}} smaller Balfron Tower in Poplar, east London. It has a long, thin profile, with a <b>separate</b> <b>lift</b> and service tower linked at every third storey to the access corridors in the main building; flats {{above and below the}} corridor levels have internal stairs. The building contains 217 flats and was originally entirely owned by the GLC with the flats rented as council flats. Shortly after its completion the building was transferred to the local council (the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea). Most of the flats are still social housing, but a significant minority are now privately owned.|$|R

50|$|The {{opening of}} the eastern {{terminus}} of the Central London Railway (CLR, now the Central line) at Bank followed on 30 July 1900.As with the C&SLR, {{the high cost of}} property in the City, coupled with the presence of the Royal Exchange, the Bank of England, and Mansion House, meant that the station had to be built entirely underground. Permission was granted by the City of London Corporation for the station to be sited beneath the busy junction of roads meeting at this point on condition that public subways were provided to act as pedestrian road crossings. To avoid undermining the road above, the station's lifts were installed in <b>separate</b> <b>lift</b> shafts rather than paired two-per-shaft as usual.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Melbourne architects A & K Henderson with {{assistance}} from local firm of Atkinson, Powell & Conrad, the contractor was G A Stronach, with the technical advice of Thomas Walker Pearce. It {{was an example}} of the pervasive fashion for the neo-classical style in commercial and civic buildings, of similar scale and materials during the period. The building was opened on 6 May 1930 and its lavish fittings and imposing style attracted favourable comment. Prominent features of the building included the large bronze doors in the Queen Street entrance, <b>separate</b> <b>lifts</b> for tenants, and a special women's banking section fitted with lounge, retiring room, writing facilities and telephone. Over the years various professional tenants have occupied the upper floors - solicitors, doctors, accountants, architects, and optometrists.|$|R

The second front is absent if the laser-supported absorption wave sets in when the background gas pressure is increased to 50 -mbar Ar. The optical emission spectroscopy display many of triply, doubly, and singly ionized carbon species in the expanding plume at < 0. 3 mbar He, while the excited and singly ionized helium species are found in (1 - 30) mbar He which coincides with streak observations of strong luminous fronts.

5000|$|The {{original}} Proctor test, ASTM D698 / AASHTO T99, uses a 4 in mould {{which holds}} 1/30 {{cubic feet of}} soil, and calls for compaction of three <b>separate</b> <b>lifts</b> of soil using 25 blows by a 5.5 lb hammer falling from 12 inches, for a compactive effort of 12,400 ft-lbf/ft³.

Both tests allow {{the use of a}} larger mould, 6 inches in diameter and holding 1/13.333 ft³, if the soil or aggregate contains too large a proportion of gravel-sized particles to allow repeatability with the 4-inch mould.

40|$|Lifted {{message passing}} {{algorithms}} exploit repeated structure {{within a given}} graphical model to answer queries efficiently. Given evidence, they construct a lifted network of supernodes and superpotentials corresponding to sets of nodes and potentials that are indistinguishable given the evidence. Recently, efficient algorithms were presented for updating the structure of an existing lifted network with incremental changes to the evidence. In the inference stage, however, current algorithms need to construct a <b>separate</b> <b>lifted</b> network for each evidence case and run a modified message passing algorithm on each lifted network separately. Consequently, symmetries across the inference tasks are not exploited. In this paper, we present a novel lifted message passing technique that exploits symmetries across multiple evidence cases. The benefits of this multi-evidence lifted inference are shown for several important AI tasks such as computing personalized PageRanks and Kalman f ilters via multi-evidence lifted Gaussian belief propagation...|$|R
