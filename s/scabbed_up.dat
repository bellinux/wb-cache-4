5000|$|The Chinese {{practiced the}} oldest {{documented}} use of variolation, {{dating back to}} the fifteenth century. They implemented a method of [...] "nasal insufflation" [...] administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually <b>scabs,</b> <b>up</b> the nostrils. Various insufflation techniques have been recorded throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries within China. According to such documentation, mild smallpox cases were selected as donors in order to prevent serious attack. The technique used scabs that had been left to dry out for some time. Fresh scabs were more likely to lead to a full-blown infection. Three or four scabs were ground into powder or mixed with a grain of musk and bound in cotton. Infected material was then packed into a pipe and puffed up the patient's nostril. The practice of variolation {{is believed to have been}} ritualized by the Chinese. The blowpipe used during the procedure was made of silver. The right nostril was used for boys and the left for girls. Variolated cases were treated as if they were as infectious as those who had acquired the disease naturally. These patients were subsequently kept apart from others until the rash had cleared. Two reports on the Chinese practice were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers. But no action was taken.|$|R
60|$|The scab is {{powerless}} under terrorism. As a rule, {{he is not}} so good nor gritty a man as the men he is displacing, and {{he lacks}} their fighting organization. He stands {{in dire need of}} stiffening and backing. His employers, the capitalists, draw their two remaining weapons, the ownership of which is debatable, but which they for the time being happen to control. These two weapons may be called the political and judicial machinery of society. When the <b>scab</b> crumples <b>up</b> and is ready to go down before the fists, bricks, and bullets of the labor group, the capitalist group puts the police and soldiers into the field, and begins a general bombardment of injunctions. Victory usually follows, for the labor group cannot withstand the combined assault of gatling guns and injunctions.|$|R
40|$|Five {{different}} strategies to control apple scab {{have been tested}} during the summer season in 2005. Four of the strategies are based on sulphur, one is based on Bicarbonate. The test took place in an apple orchard, which was slightly infected by apple scab. Bicarbonate was able to control scab on the fruits in the orchard even as during storage at 84 % (Abbott). The best sulphur variant could control apple <b>scab</b> in storage <b>up</b> to 95 % (Abbott) ...|$|R
40|$|In an {{investigation}} into alternative methods for the treatment and control of sheep scab, the efficacy of moxidectin, a second generation milbemycin, was evaluated {{in a series of}} laboratory and field studies in Ireland. Initial laboratory trials demon-strated that moxidectin, given as a subcutaneous injection at 200 gg/kg bodyweight was effective in the treatment of clinical psoroptic mange. Subsequent work showed that a single injec-tion of clean sheep with moxidectin at the same dose rate pro-vided protection against natural and experimental sheep <b>scab</b> infection for <b>up</b> to 35 days. This residual protective efficacy was tested in a large scale field trial in County Offaly, Ireland, in which more than 6500 sheep on 50 farms received a single prophylactic injection with moxidectin in the autumn and remained free from scab throughout the winter. This was comparable to the preventive effect of the annual compulsor...|$|R
2500|$|The {{mortality}} of the severe form of smallpox—variola major—was very high without vaccination, up to 35% in some outbreaks. A method of inducing immunity known as inoculation, [...] or [...] "variolation" [...] was practiced before {{the development of}} a modern vaccine and likely occurred in Africa and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. It may also have occurred in India, but this is disputed; other investigators contend the ancient Sanskrit medical texts of India do not describe these techniques. The first clear reference to smallpox inoculation was made by the Chinese author Wan Quan (1499–1582) in his Douzhen xinfa (痘疹心法) published in 1549. Inoculation for smallpox {{does not appear to have}} been widespread in China until the reign era of the Longqing Emperor (r. 1567–1572) during the Ming Dynasty. In China, powdered smallpox <b>scabs</b> were blown <b>up</b> the noses of the healthy. The patients would then develop a mild case of the disease and from then on were immune to it. The technique did have a 0.5–2.0% mortality rate, but that was considerably less than the 20–30% mortality rate of the disease itself. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers. According to Voltaire (1742), the Turks derived their use of inoculation to neighbouring Circassia. Voltaire does not speculate on where the Circassians derived their technique from, though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it [...] "these hundred years".|$|R
