By supporting quantitative characterization of the <b>semantic</b> <b>gaps,</b> more effective inference models can automatically be selected for concept classifier training by: (a) identifying the image concepts with small <b>semantic</b> <b>gaps</b> (i. e., the isolated image concepts with high inner-concept visual consistency) and training their one-against-all SVM concept classifiers independently; (b) determining the image concepts with large <b>semantic</b> <b>gaps</b> (i. e., the visually-related image concepts with low inner-concept visual consistency) and training their inter-related SVM concept classifiers jointly; and (c) using more image instances to achieve more reliable training of the concept classifiers for the image concepts with large <b>semantic</b> <b>gaps.</b> Our experimental results on NUS-WIDE [18] and ImageNet [11] image sets have obtained very promising results...|$|R

However, which semantic concepts should be used for data collection and model construction is still an open question. Currently, there is very little research found on automatically choosing multimedia concepts with small <b>semantic</b> <b>gaps.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel framework to develop a lexicon of high-level concepts with small <b>semantic</b> <b>gaps</b> (LCSS) from a large-scale web image dataset. By defining a confidence map and content-context similarity matrix, images with small <b>semantic</b> <b>gaps</b> are selected and clustered. The final concept lexicon is mined from the surrounding descriptions (titles, categories and comments) of these images. This lexicon offers a set of high-level concepts with small <b>semantic</b> <b>gaps,</b> which is very helpful for people to focus for data collection, annotation and modeling. It also shows a promising application potential for image annotation refinement and rejection. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of the developed concepts lexicon. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} and {{illustrate}} {{an approach to}} compositional reasoning for hardware/software co-verification of embedded systems. The major challenges in compositional reasoning for co-verification include: (1) the hardware/software <b>semantic</b> <b>gaps,</b> (2) lack of common property specification languages for hardware and software, and (3) lack of compositional reasoning rules that are applicable across the hardware/software boundaries. Our approach addresses these challenges by (1) filling the hardware/software <b>semantic</b> <b>gaps</b> via translation of hardware and software into a common formal language, (2) defining a unified property specification language for hardware, software, and entire systems, and (3) enabling application of existing compositional reasoning rules across the hardware/software boundaries based on translation, developing a new rule for compositional reasoning with components that share sub-components, and extending the applicability of these rules via dependency refinement. Our approach {{has been applied to}} co-verification of networked sensors. The case studies have shown that our approach is very effective in enabling application of compositional reasoning to co-verification of non-trivial embedded systems. ...|$|R

50|$|Real world {{tasks are}} formalized by {{programming}} languages, which are executed on computers {{based on the}} von Neumann architecture. Since programming languages are only comfortable representations of the Turing machine any program on a von Neumann computer has the same properties and limitations as the Turing machine or its equivalent representation. Consequently every programming language such as CPU level machine code, assembler, or any high level programming language has the same expressional power as the underlying Turing machine is able to compute. There is no <b>semantic</b> <b>gap</b> between them since a program is transferred from the high level language to the machine code by a program, e.g. a compiler which itself runs on a Turing machine without any user interaction.

Measuring stochasticity involves finding suitable representations that can significantly reduce statistical dependencies of any order. Wavelet packet representations provide such a framework for a large class of stochastic processes trough an appropriate dictionary of parametric models. From this dictionary and the Kolmogorov stochasticity index, the paper proposes semantic stochasticity templates upon wavelet packet subbands {{in order to support}} high level classification and content-based image retrieval.

50|$|The yet {{unproven}} but commonly accepted Church-Turing thesis {{states that}} a Turing machine and all equivalent formal languages {{such as the}} lambda calculus perform and represent all formal operations respectively as applied by a computing human. However the selection of adequate operations for the correct computation itself is not formally deducible, moreover {{it depends on the}} computability of the underlying problem. Tasks, such as the halting problem, may be formulated comprehensively in natural language, but the computational representation will not terminate or does not provide a usable result, which is proven by Rice's theorem. The general expression of limitations for rule based deduction by Gödel's incompleteness theorem indicates that the <b>semantic</b> <b>gap</b> is never to be fully closed. These are general statements, considering the generalized limits of computation on the highest level of abstraction where the <b>semantic</b> <b>gap</b> manifests itself. There are however lots of subsets of problems which may be translated automatically, especially in the higher numbered levels of the Chomsky hierarchy.|$|E
