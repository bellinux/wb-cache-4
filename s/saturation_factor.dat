Motor characteristics analysis via equivalent circuit {{is very important}} for designing a high efficiency single phase induction motor. The accuracy of the motor characteristics depends on the accuracy of the parameters, especially <b>saturation</b> <b>factor,</b> which determines the cyclical relationship in the analysis process.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A complete mathematical model for a generator system consisting of an isolated laminated salient-pole alternator, exciter and prime mover is presented, with emphasis on the inherent electromagnetic nonlinearities in the alternator and its exciter. An equivalent circuit, representing the rotor circuits accurately, has been adopted to model the al ternator in the dqo reference frame. A computer program has been developed to calculate the unsaturated parameters of the model using the machine design data. A new approach has been developed {{to account for the}} electromagnetic saturation effects on the model reactances. Consequently new <b>saturation</b> <b>factors,</b> based on the machine design particulars have been deri ved. The advantages of these <b>saturation</b> <b>factors,</b> compared with conventional factors, are that both mutual saturation effects between the main and leakage fluxes, and between the direct- and quadratureaxis fluxes are considered. A mathematical nonlinear model, utilising the new <b>saturation</b> <b>factors,</b> is presented for a system containing an isolated laminated salientpole alternator and a direct thyristor static exciter. A digital computer program has been developed to simulate the system. The predicted results, for some steady state and dynamic candi tions, showgood agreement with test results and clear improvement over those obtained if saturation is either neglected or considered using the conventional <b>saturation</b> <b>factors.</b> At high <b>saturation</b> levels, the conventional method of calculating the machine transformer voltages, using static saturated reactances, gives unacceptable errors. A method for calculating these voltages correctly, in models utilising the currents as state space variables, is presented using new derived dynamic saturated reactances. This dynamic reactance concept is presented in a generalised form {{so that it can be}} applied to any machine with different <b>saturation</b> <b>factors.</b> The previous mathematical model of the alternator system has been modified according to the dynamic reactance concept, and the computer program has been developed accordingly. The predicted results confirm the need to apply this concept especially to dynamic conditions characterised by high saturation levels. To extend the analysis to a wider range of loading conditions, the alternator has been modelled in the abc reference frame. The unsaturated, static and dynamic saturated reactances of the machine in this reference frame have been obtained using conventional dqo-abc transformation techniques. Starting from the fundamental machine relations, a new set of equations, in the phase reference frame, has been derived employing the new dynamic reactance concept. A comprehensive system consisting of an isolated laminated salientpole alternator, brushless exciter, thyristor divert automatic voltage regulator and a diesel prime mover has been studied. Both the alternator and the exciter have been modelled in the abc frame to comply with the nature of rectifier loading associated with the exci ter. A complete steady state and dynamic mathematical model is presented where the t r technique has been applied to the dynamic variable topology of the system electrical circuits. The model presented covers all the possible modes of operation associated with the exciter rotating bridge rectifier circuit. A digital computer program has been developed to simUlate the system. The predicted results obtained using the new set of <b>saturation</b> <b>factors</b> in conjunction with the dynamic reactance concept show good agreement with the test results. The study presented confirms the validity of the mathematical models developed for the alternator systems. Also, it supports the metlxxi by which the electromagnetic nonlinearity has been accounted for...|$|R

Measurements in surface water were performed by a continuously working equilibration technique that allowed for the determination of small and rapid variations of the dissolved CO. Carbon monoxide concentrations in the water body increased toward the sea surface, there reaching <b>saturation</b> <b>factors</b> of up to 50 with respect to atmospheric CO. The daily average CO saturation increased with average chlorophyll a concentration and light intensity and decreased with wind speed. The dissolved CO showed strong diurnal variations, with maximum values in the afternoon.

Carbon monoxide production in seawater was mainly due to photooxidation of dissolved or ganic matter. Photobiological and microbiological CO production processes were of minor importance.

Nuclear magnetic reso-nance signal enhancements at 0. 34 and 3. 4 T of the bulk water protons are recorded {{as a function of}} the irradiation time and the polarizer concentration. The build-up rates are consistent with the T 1 n of the observed water protons at room temperature (for 9 GHz/ 0. 34 T) and for about 50 ± 10 C at 94 GHz/ 3. 4 T.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{interaction}} of the antitumoral drug daunorubicin with egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) liposomes, used as a cell membrane model, was quantified by determination of the partition coefficient (Kp). The liposome/aqueous-phase Kp of daunorubicin was determined by derivative spectrophotometry and measurement of the zeta-potential. Mathematical models were used to fit the experimental data, enabling determination of Kp. In the partition of daunorubicin within the membrane both superficial electrostatic and inner hydrophobic interactions seem to be involved. The results are affected by the two types of interaction since spectrophotometry measures mainly hydrophobic interactions, while zeta-potential is affected by both interpenetration of amphiphilic charged molecules in the bilayer and superficial electrostatic interaction. Moreover, the degree of the partition of daunorubicin with the membrane changes with the drug concentration, due mainly to <b>saturation</b> <b>factors.</b> Derivative spectrophotometry and zeta-potential variation results, together with the broad range of concentrations studied, revealed the different types of interactions involved.

This paper proposes a novel analytical model of air-gap eccentricity in induction motors (IMs) by allowing teeth saturation due to the local air-gap over-fluxing {{to be taken into}} account. The approach takes into account the magnetic saturation by means of a fictive permeance variation while supposing that, under air-gap eccentricity conditions, the <b>saturation</b> <b>factor</b> must be revaluated in function of the varying air-gap length. The well-known 2 D-modified winding function approach (2 D-MWFA) is used to get the formalism of the inductances by assuming a partial uniform rise of the <b>saturation</b> <b>factor</b> with respect to the air-gap length. We show that applying the new approach confirms that the magnetic saturation reduces the asymmetry of the air-gap flux distribution due to rotor eccentricity. In contrast to the harmonic and flux models, the proposed one allows us to proceed with a full dynamic simulation without any need for the experimental data. Thanks to a fast convolution-based technique of inductance calculation, we demonstrate that the 2 D-MWFA preserves its major qualities even with these new extensions. The study is supported by simulation and experimental results...|$|E

In addition, the stability limits for the SynRM are studied using a suggested more accurate method. The saturation and cross-saturation effects on both direct (d) and quadrature (q) axis flux linkages are considered. A Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to obtain an accurate representation for the dq-axis flux linkages relations. In order to reduce the calculation time of the finite element analysis, a look-up table (LUT) for the dq-axis flux linkages is generated based on the FEM to be used for simulating the SynRM characteristics. It is found that the magnetic saturation in the adopted motor results in an enlarged region of stable operation of the SynRM by about 200 % compared with the unsaturated case. The results show the importance of including the <b>saturation</b> <b>factors</b> on the performance of the SynRM and its stability limits. Hence, the magnetic saturation effect will not only reflect on the stability of the motor but also on the whole drive system...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a mathematical model}} on the dynamics of demand and supply incorporating collectability and <b>saturation</b> <b>factors.</b> Our analysis shows that when the fluctuation of the determinants of demand and supply is strong enough, there is chaos in the demand-supply dynamics. Our numerical simulation shows that such a chaos is not an attractor (i. e. dynamics is not approaching the chaos), instead a periodic attractor (of period 3 under the Poincaré period map) exists near the chaos, and co-exists with another periodic attractor (of period 1 under the Poincaré period map) near the market equilibrium. Outside the basins of attraction of the two periodic attractors, the dynamics approaches infinity indicating market irrational exuberance or flash crash. The period 3 attractor represents the product's market cycle of growth and recession, while period 1 attractor near the market equilibrium represents the regular fluctuation of the product's market. Thus our model captures more market phenomena besides Marshall's market equilibrium. When the fluctuation of the determinants of demand and supply is strong enough, a three leaf danger zone exists where the basins of attraction of all attractors intertwine and fractal basin boundaries are formed. Small perturbations in the danger zone can lead to very different attractors. That is, small perturbations in the danger zone can cause the market to experience oscillation near market equilibrium, large growth and recession cycle, and irrational exuberance or flash crash...|$|R
