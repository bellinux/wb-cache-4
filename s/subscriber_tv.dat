5000|$|Since 1990, Kenya Television Network {{has offered}} a mixture of relayed re-transmission of Cable News Network (CNN) programming, {{business}} and entertainment, as well as MTV, and European, American and Australian programming, in addition to programs developed in other African states. KTN also filed stories for use by affiliated foreign stations. KTN reporters doubled as foreign correspondents and news sources for CNN World Report, BBC, and VOA. Transmitting on the UHF channel, KTN {{started out as a}} pilot project for a 24-hour <b>subscriber</b> <b>TV</b> service in Nairobi and its environs, but abandoned plans to scramble its signal and for most of the 1990s derived its revenue from advertising and TV production services. Founded by Jared Kangwana, its early success attracted bids for joint ownership by London-based Maxwell Communications, by South African MNET, and by the then ruling party Kenya African National Union (KANU).|$|E
40|$|Digital Television (DTV) was {{the first}} major advance in the {{television}} industry since the establishment of color TV sets in the 50 's. However, despite the ambitious anticipations, most DTV operators offering <b>subscriber</b> <b>TV</b> services are facing serious economic problems. Many believe that significantly increasing the DTV operator revenues is closely linked to the provision of advanced interactive TV applications which, on one-hand, based on content enhancements will attract more subscribers, {{and on the other hand}} will also generate indirect revenues through services like TV-commerce or on-line betting. In this paper an end-to-end interactive TV application is presented. The application has been developed for accompanying sport broadcasts, given that sports content is very attractive for the majority of subscribers. This application enhances sport broadcasts with relevant content (statistics, news, information) appearing on user-demand, as well as with an innovative interactive entertaining game of predictions challenging users to make predictions and to prove their anticipatory skills and sport knowledge. The application supports multiple types of forward and return channels and STB middleware systems. Furthermore, its components can be used in content distribution networks targeting multiple network-enabled information appliances...|$|E

40|$|Delivering TV {{services}} via internet protocols over high-speed connections {{is commonly}} referred to as IPTV (Internet Protocol TeleVision). A particularly interesting aspect of IPTV is the augmentation of the <b>subscriber’s</b> <b>TV</b> experience with interactive applications (apps). Due to the service-oriented infrastructure of many IPTV platforms it is fairly easy to integrate 3 rd party services and expose them in form of IPTV apps. However, due to the very competitive market in which IPTV providers operate, they are forced to minimize their costs and thus avoid costly customer complaints. This in turn introduces the need for highly dependable IPTV apps/web services with minimal downtimes. This paper focuses on the development of dependable web services for IPTV. Using Brewer’s CAP theorem the paper investigates the role of state-management within web services and presents the idea of the Enterprise Resource Bus (ERB) and an evaluation of its Erlang implementation...|$|R
