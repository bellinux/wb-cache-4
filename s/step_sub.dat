Among the existing clustering techniques, hierarchical clustering {{is one of the}} widely preferred algorithms. Though there are many algorithms existing,K-Means for hierarchical clustering stand top. But still it is observed that the K-Means algorithm has number of limitations like initialization of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose the utilization of E-M algorithm. The K-Means algorithm is implemented by using measure of Cosine similarity and Expectation-Maximization(E-M) with Gaussian Mixture Model. The proposed method has two steps. In first step, the K-Means and E-M methods are combined to partition the input dataset into several smaller sub clusters.

The composite components should fulfil the mechanical design requirements related to stiffness, strength, impact resistance and fatigue life. Due to the manual labour involved {{in the production of}} composite bicycle components, deviations in the fabrication process from the prescribed instructions are expected, such as wrong orientation of the pre-preg sheets, missing pre-preg sheets, accidentally inserted release film, etc. and might affect the short or long term performance requirements.

Participaram do estudo cinco crianças do sexo masculino com idade de 8 a 10 anos. Primeiramente, o pesquisador estabeleceu com o treinador a meta final a ser alcançada pelo atleta (salto Tsukahara), bem como os passos (submetas) para que a meta final fosse alcançada. Cada submeta era composta por componentes importantes para a execução do salto (entrada de lado, repulsão, cair fechado e rolar e mortal). Ao todo, foram estabelecidas 7 submetas. Em seguida, na fase de linha de base, registrou-se a freqüência dos componentes do salto realizados corretamente que compunham as submetas. Posteriormente, deu-se início a fase de intervenção, na qual, após apresentar a submeta para a sessão de treino, pedia-se que o atleta executasse 4 saltos. Se a submeta fosse atingida, uma placa de cortiça contendo as 7 submetas era entregue ao atleta e ele poderia deslocar a figura de um ginasta para a submeta seguinte. Na fase de follow-up, toda a intervenção era retirada embora os dados continuassem a ser registrados. Três participantes conseguiram alcançar todas as submetas propostas pelo programa. Observou-se que houve um aumento no número de componentes realizados corretamente e na porcentagem de componentes realizados consecutivamente para a maioria dos participantes. Os resultados obtidos sugerem que o programa de estabelecimento de metas mostrou-se efetivo para aumentar a eficiência na execução dos componentes do salto realizados corretamente. The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the effects of a goal setting and feedback program on the execution of the Tsukahara vault by children who practice artistic gymnastics.

Initially, the researcher has established, with the coach, the final goal to be reached by the athletes (Tsukahara vault), as well as the <b>steps</b> (<b>sub</b> goals) necessary to the acquisition of the final goal. Each sub goal was constituted by components which are important for the jump execution (side entrance, repulsion, fall closed and roll and mortal).

40|$|Abstract—For better {{area and}} power efficiencies, rail-to-rail-output {{single-stage}} amplifiers are a potential replacement of their multi-stage counterparts, especially for display applications that entail massive buffer amplifiers in their column drivers. This paper describes a nested-current-mirror (NCM) technique for a single-stage amplifier to achieve substantial enhancements of DC gain, gain-bandwidth product (GBW) and slew rate (SR). Specifically, NCM is customizable for different mirror <b>steps,</b> and <b>sub</b> mirror ratios, {{to balance the}} performance metrics and capac-itive-load () drivability, avoiding any compensation passives while preserving a rail-to-rail output swing. Analytical treatments of the NCM technique in terms of performance limits and robust-ness reveal that the NCM amplifier can surpass the fundamental power-efficiency limit set by the basic differential-pair (DP) am-plifier. Two prototypes, 3 -step and 4 -step NCM amplifiers, were fabricated in 0. 18 m CMOS for systematic comparison with the DP amplifier. The former represents a robust design exhibiting 72 dB DC gain and 0. 0028 – 0. 27 MHz GBW over 0. 15 – 15 nF with 80 phase margin (PM). The latter embodies an aggressive design attaining 84 dB DC gain and 0. 013 – 1. 24 MHz GBW over 0. 15 – 15 nF with 62 PM. All amplifiers were sized for the same area (0. 0013 mm) and power (3. 6 W).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{presented}} a novel technique for the navigation and path formulation of wheeled mobile robot. In a given environment having obstacles, a path is {{generated from the}} given initial and final position of the robot. Based on the global knowledge of the environment a global path is formulated initially. This global path considers all the known obstacles in the environment and must avoid collision with these obstacles, i. e. the formulated path must be safe (collision free). For global path formulation strategic schemes have been employed using the a priori knowledge of the environment. The global path is fed to the robot. When unknown obstacles come {{in the path of}} the robot, it must deviate from the given global path and should generate a local path to avoid collision with the new unknown obstacle. By using sensors data the reactive schemes have been implemented for local path formulation. For local path formulation the path has been subdivided into intermediate <b>steps</b> known as <b>sub</b> goals. In the existing approaches known and unknown objects are considered separately.

Emptying of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca 2 + stores prevented any Ca 2 + release by IP 3, and, after IP 3 addition, little or no Ca 2 + was released by thapsigargin. In both instances, a further Ca 2 + release was accomplished by A 23187. The IP 3 -thapsigargin-sensitive pool and the residual A 23187 -sensitive one corresponded to approximately 60 and 37 % of non-mitochondrial stored Ca 2 +, respectively. In intact EATCs, IP 3 -dependent agonists and thapsigargin discharged Ca 2 + pools almost completely overlapping, and A 32187 released a minor residual Ca 2 + pool. The IP 3 -insensitive pool appeared to have a relatively low affinity for Ca 2 + (below 600 nM). The high affinity, IP 3 -sensitive Ca 2 + pool was discharged in a 'quantal' manner following <b>step</b> additions of <b>sub</b> maximal [IP 3], and the IP 3 -induced fractional Ca 2 + release was more marked at higher concentrations of stored (luminal) Ca 2 +, The IP 3 -sensitive Ca 2 + pool appeared to be devoid of the Ca(2 +) -activated Ca 2 + release channel since caffeine did not released any Ca 2 + in intact and permeabilized EATCs, and Western blot analyses of EATC microsomal membranes failed to detect any known ryanodine receptor isoform...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} step, called [...] "kori kuthu", {{which is the}} qualifier, the striker places the kutti on the hole, and using the kolu lofts the kutti {{as far as he}} can. The kutti becomes {{airborne}} after it is lofted. If a fielder from the opposing team catches the kutti, the striker is out. If the kutti lands on the ground, the fielder closest to the kutti has one chance to hit the kolu ( [...] with a throw (similar to a run out in cricket).If the fielder misses the kolu, the striker progresses to the next step.In step two, called [...] "ittadi" [...] (meaning drop and strike), the striker holds kutti and kolu in the same hand, drops the kutti and strikes at it before it reaches ground. If the fielders catch the kutti, the striker goes out. If the kutti hits the ground, the fielder throws it back at the hole. Now, the Striker hits the kutti again. The striker then measures the distance from the point where the kutti lands, up to the hole, using the kolu in a straight line. If the measure is less than one length of kolu, the striker is out.The measuring sub-steps are: Saadu, Muri, Naazhi, Aytti, Aarenku. On measuring up to Aarenku, the striker counts one point and proceedes starting with Saadu again. Depending on the <b>sub</b> <b>step</b> at which the measure has ended the striker strikes the kutti from different positions:Saadu -> Places the kutty on the feet, tosses up and strikes with the koluMuri -> (easy one) drops the kutti from one hand and strikes with the koluNaazhi -> Places the kutti {{on the back of the}} palm with middle and ring fingers bent inwards, tosses up the kutti and strikes with the koluAytti -> drops the kutti from the elbow and strikes with the koluAarenku -> (tough one) Closes an eye, places the kutti over it, drops it and strikes with the kolu.|$|R
