Additionally, pertinent background information directly related to the area of research is elaborated on to facilitate understanding. Particular attention is devoted to the Collection Agent, Admissions Office and Command Referral Clerk operations and interactions. Pay Adjustment Authorization procedures are reviewed along with a glance at AQCESS MSA to ascertain whether the current version of software provides the existing capability to account for occupied bed days outside the hospital. A questionnaire is employed to gather the data necessary to evaluate the processes used at the hospital and estimate the amounts available for recoupment. Comparisons of the estimated amounts are contrasted against funding authority and reimbursables. The analysis concludes with a cost and benefit analysis, a brief observation of three other medical treatment facilities, and recommendations [...] [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

We draw upon service marketing theory, organisational sociology, development anthropology and cultural consumer research {{to conduct an}} ethnographic study of vaccination delivery in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia–one such region. We find that Western public health sector policies are dominated by an administrative logic. Critical failures in delivery are produced by a system that obfuscates the on-the-ground problems that mothers face in trying to vaccinate their children, while instead prioritising administrative processes. Our ethnographic analysis of 83 mothers who had not vaccinated their children reveals key barriers to vaccination from a‘customer’ perspective. While mothers value vaccination, it is a ‘low involvement’ good compared to the acute daily needs of a <b>subsistence</b> life. The <b>costs</b> imposed by poor service – such as uncaring staff with class hostilities, unpredictable and missed schedules and long waits – are too much and so they forego the service.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{question}} of income convergence among countries. While the methodology used to determine convergence differs from the common cross-sectional approach, it corroborates Baumol's finding of a convergence club among the world's wealthiest countries. It also shows that there is strong evidence in support of a second convergence club, however. This one is among the world's very poorest countries. These clubs exhibit different forms of convergence. The group of wealthy countries is characterized by what may be referred to as upward convergence, where the poorer group members catch up with the richer countries. The group of extremely poor countries exhibits downward convergence, or a reduction in income disparity brought about by nearly zero, or even negative, growth by the group's `wealthier' members. One of the attributes that sets these countries at the bottom apart is that they are very close to what Stigler once calculated as the least <b>cost</b> <b>subsistence</b> diet. Inserting this constraint into the neoclassical growth model produces two steady states, with divergence in between. An example of such a model is developed here.

60|$|Turgot's {{policy in}} this matter is more {{instructive}} as to the social state of France, than it may at first sight appear. At first sight we are astonished to find the austere economist travelling {{so far from the}} orthodox path of free contract as to order a landowner to furnish at his own <b>cost</b> <b>subsistence</b> for his impoverished tenants. But {{the truth is that the}} métayer was not a free tenant in the sense which we attach to the word. 'In Limousin,' says Arthur Young, 'the métayers are considered as little better than menial servants.' And it is not going beyond the evidence to say that they were even something lower than menial servants; they were really a kind of serf-caste. They lived in the lowest misery. More than half of them were computed to be deeply in debt to the proprietors. In many cases they were even reduced every year to borrow from their landlord, before the harvest came round, such coarse bread of mixed rye and barley as he might choose to lend them. What Turgot therefore had in his mind was no relation of free contract, though it was that legally, but a relation which partly resembled that of a feudal lord to his retainer, and partly--as Sir Henry Maine has hinted--that of a planter to his negroes. It is less surprising, then, that Turgot should have enforced some of the responsibilities of the lord and the planter.|$|R

40|$|Termites are eusocial {{insects that}} are found on all continents except Antarctica. Termites have serious {{destructive}} impact, damaging local huts and crops of poor <b>subsistence.</b> The annual <b>cost</b> of termite damage and its control is determined in the billions globally. In Egypt, most of these damages are due to the subterranean termite species especially the sand termite, P. hypostoma. Pyrethroids became the primary weapon for subterranean termite control, after the use of chlorpyrifos as a soil termiticide was banned. Despite {{the important role of}} pyrethroids in termite control, its extensive use in pest control led to the eventual rise of insecticide resistance which may make many of the pyrethroids ineffective. The ability to diagnose the precise mechanism of pyrethroid resistance in any insect species would be the key component of its management at specified location for a specific population. In the present study, detailed toxicological and biochemical studies was conducted on the mechanism of pyrethroid resistance in P. hypostoma. The susceptibility of field populations of P. hypostoma against deltamethrin, α-cypermethrin and ƛ-cyhalothrin was evaluated. The obtained results revealed that the workers of P. hypostoma have developed high resistance level against the tested pyrethroids. Studies carried out through estimation of detoxification enzyme activity indicated that enhanced esterase and cytochrome P 450 activities were probably important mechanisms for pyrethroid resistance in field populations. Elevated esterase activity and also additional esterase isozyme were observed in the pyrethroid-resistant populations compared to the susceptible populations. Strong positive correlation between cytochrome P 450 activity and pyrethroid resistance was also reported. |Deltamethrin could be recommended as a resistance-breaking pyrethroid that is active against resistant populations of P. hypostoma...|$|R
40|$|Current Web-based {{training}} (WBT) {{is based}} upon systematic research and experience with strategies for improving learning and instruction, {{beginning in the early}} part of the 20 th century and continuing to the present. Use of the World-Wide Web for delivery may improve access to training, but the effectiveness of the resulting training and the usefulness of the outcomes is chiefly dependent upon the quality of the instructional design and the completeness of the support package provided. Factors that impact WBT quality, and which must be addressed in design and implementation processes, include assessment and accommodation of trainees previous learning experiences, training expectations, and overall readiness for new training; availability and familiarity to trainees and trainers of appropriate delivery technologies; presence of technical support; opportunities for interaction with the trainer and other trainees; the preparation and practices of trainers; corporate support and recognition; trainees capacities and expectations for independent and self-directed learning; and the presence of relevant, quality online training materials. WBT creates changes and may thus produce stresses in the training environment, as well as efficiencies. Reduction in travel and <b>subsistence</b> requirements means <b>cost</b> savings, but may also be seen by trainees as depriving them of opportunities to meet with each other face-to-face; self-pacing means trainees may proceed independently and at their own rate, but also that group support may be reduced (unless a cohort model is adopted); use of the Internet for delivery of training materials may foster trainee independence, but may also result in confusion for some trainees used to print materials and a paced, group delivery model; trainers no longer have to lecture as materials (always high quality, and often multimedia-based) are prepared in advance, but some may resent the loss of their role at center-stage; trainees are more responsible for their own learning, which may reflect the autonomy of adult responsibility common in the other areas of their lives, but this may be different from the expectations of some for how training should be conducted. To achieve the efficiencies and advantages well-designed and -managed WBT may offer, adopting organizations must make adjustments. Managers may need to show concrete support for online training by permitting trainees to use corporate resources during company time, to assure access to adequate bandwidth. Trainers may need to master new skills and be willing to adopt new roles less concerned with information dissemination and more involved with meeting individual trainees expressed needs. Trainees themselves may also need new skills, and may need to exercise more independence and selfdirection in their learning. As technologies become more available to support WBT, and as more models of successful WBT are available, the commitment to this delivery model is predicted to continue to grow. The previous corporate experience of the productivity paradox in relation to computers, in which some succeeded in improving productivity while others did notand some even experienced productivity losseswill need to be avoided, especially in relation to promising innovations such as reusable learning objects.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} report is to identify and quantify the cost drivers of three district hospitals in the Western Cape, namely Knysna Hospital, Oudtshoorn Hospital and Mossel Bay Hospital, and to simultaneously measure value-driven performance indicators. An environmental scan identified various driving forces that would significantly affect change in the healthcare industry such as the brain drain of health professionals, consumerism and cost containment and efficiency initiatives. The Department of Health’s understanding of the eighth Batho Pele principle of value for money is generally understood as providing quality health care within prescribed cost limits. An attempt is made to establish {{the effect of the}} quadruple burden of disease (the HIV/AIDS pandemic, persistent infectious diseases, injury arising from violence and road traffic collisions and emerging chronic conditions) on hospital expenditure in the Eden District. Research identified Mossel Bay as a high TB burden area known as a TB “hotspot” and it is a recognized immigration transit point en route to Cape Town. The population analyses revealed that Mossel Bay is the growth point of the Eden District, showing extraordinary growth of 25 % between 2007 and 2009. Personnel costs: This study revealed that personnel costs are responsible for {{the overwhelming majority of the}} total expenditure of the district hospitals. Staff numbers, occupation specific dispensation (OSD) implementation and annual wage negotiations are the cost drivers of personnel costs. This study also found a clear correlation between an over-expenditure in personnel expenses and over-expenditure in the total expenditure of all three hospitals. Health care costs: Expenditure on blood products is considered a major cost driver of clinical expenses. Laboratory expenditure is clearly the largest cost driver for clinical expenses at all three hospitals. Together with laboratory expenses, medicine and medical supplies are the cost drivers for clinical expenses. Costs not related to health care: The three most significant administrative expenses are communication, stationery and printing as well as travel and <b>subsistence</b> allowances. The <b>cost</b> driver for <b>subsistence</b> and travel expenses is the number of vehicles followed by the preference of vehicle, which in turn determines the daily tariff and the kilometre tariff. This study revealed that Knysna Municipality has the cheapest electricity cost of the three towns. It is clear that cost and consumption of electricity and water are the two variables that affect municipal service expenditure the most. Equity: When the district hospital expenditure is combined with the primary health care expenditure in the three sub-districts, the figures show that Oudtshoorn is spending 3 % more than its equitable share of the total budget at a higher cost of R 978 per capita, in excess of R 100 above the district average. Efficiency: The cost per patient day equivalent (PDE) per economic classification for all three hospitals is less than the average cost per PDE of the district hospitals in the Western Cape. The cost/PDE of Oudtshoorn Hospital is considerably higher than that of Knysna and Mossel Bay in all economic classifications, with the single exception of the agency cost of Mossel Bay Hospital. The cost of health care always reflects a combination of price, quantity and value, and it is impossible to consider individual cost drivers in isolation. Several cost-saving initiatives and managerial control measures are recommended...|$|R

50|$|Since nothing {{coming from}} nature {{can enter the}} market unaltered, {{exchange}} presupposes labour, especially wage labour.

This does not imply that the product reflects the labourer’s needs in any way, but he produces it by processes alien to him. Furthermore, the wages only just cover the <b>subsistence</b> <b>costs</b> of the worker and his family. Hence the market price does not in any way reflect the wage, allowing the conclusion that the value added by the worker doesn’t go back to the worker, but instead returns to the capitalist. A person who buys with money does not directly exchange the product of their labor. The primitive barter on the other hand, only exchanges a surplus of his own products, without exchanging money, but only to satisfy his needs.|$|E

40|$|In Britain, the {{wellbeing}} {{of young}} people is often linked to the education they receive, and going to university {{in order to obtain}} an undergraduate degree is seen as a necessary and desirable step in life, which should secure their employability and financial future.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the thesis is to investigate needs and incentives of all income/wealth groups in order to explore ways and means to remedy the excessive economic inequality. A closer examination of individual decisions across richer and poorer households allows us to recognize conflicts of wants, needs and values and subsequently to draw recommendations for future policies. The first chapter examines households' preferences over the redistribution of wealth resources. The preferences of voting households are restricted by agents' present and future resource constraints. The wealth resources vary over the business cycle, which affects the grounds for speculations of voting households. We augment the standard Real-Business-Cycle (RBC) model by the majority voting on lump-sum redistribution employing a balanced government budget. Our findings indicate that for the usual elasticity of labor supply both transfers' level and share of output are procyclical, with the procyclicality increasing in the discrepancy between richer and poorer households. In the second chapter we analytically demonstrate that all economic agents face <b>subsistence</b> <b>costs</b> that hinder economic and financial decisions of the poor. We find that the standard two-asset portfolio-selection model with a time-invariant subsistence component in the common-across agents Stone-Geary utility function is capable of explaining qualitatively and quantitatively three empirical regularities: (i) increasing saving rates in wealth, (ii) rising risky portfolio shares with wealth, (iii) more volatile consumption growth of the richer. On the contrary, "keeping-up-with-the-Joneses" utility with a time-varying weighted mean consumption produces identical saving rates and portfolio asset shares across richer and poorer agents, failing to match the micro data. Finally, in the third chapter we use Epstein-Zin-Weil recursive preferences altered to include <b>subsistence</b> <b>costs,</b> as this form of utility function enables trade-off between stability and safety. We pursue an analytical investigation of a more complex multi-asset portfolio-choice model with perfectly insurable labor risk and no liquidity constraints and find further support of the data evidence. If households' total resources are anticipated to increase over time, poorer agents can afford to gradually escape subsistence concerns by choosing lower saving rates and accepting only minor portfolio risks as their consumption hovers close to the subsistence needs. The calibration part of the model economy shows that analytical results can quantitatively reconcile the data, too. ESRC funded PhD fees.

40|$|Introduction {{of tuition}} fees {{has been much}} {{discussed}} in the Czech Republic over the recent years. Unfortunately, {{the current system of}} non-discriminate higher-education funding is no longer supportable, that is, provided that we do not want all universities to be evenly “mediocre”. A well configured tuition-fee system with low payments, suitably complemented by student loans covering not only the tuition fees but also the <b>subsistence</b> <b>costs</b> could be an acceptable vision of the future higher education. The obligation to pay for the study should also prevent from enrolment those applicants that only enter a university to avoid having to cater for themselves in real life. A survey was conducted to find out the views of Czech university students on the introduction of tuition fees and the possible methods of their payment. A subsequent analysis was made to see whether the introduction of tuition fees would aggravate students’ financial situation, whether they would be more motivated to complete the studies in due time, and whether they would be more concerned with the quality of teaching. The survey also analysed the relationship between a respondent’s view on the introduction of tuition fees and the current methods of financing the studies (accommodation, transport, meals, textbooks, …), the household income, and the gender. It also takes into account the attitude of respondents on the system of student loans proposed. In order to interpret the results correspondence and dependence analysis were used...|$|E
40|$|The {{organizational}} (procurement, manufacture, maintenance/discard) {{and structural}} (composition, diversity, complexity) dimensions of contemporary hunter-gatherer technological strategies {{are discussed in}} terms of the selective advantages for limiting <b>subsistence</b> <b>costs</b> and/or risks. It is argued that where subsistence is primarily cost (energy) limited technological strategies differ from those employed where risk (time) is limiting. Anticipatory organizational strategies - embedded procurement and reduction, and curation - achieve their most significant role in time-stressed contexts where there are selective benefits in separating subsistence and technological schedules. Structural strategies [...] function-specific tools, diverse tool-kits, complex tool design - offer selective benefits where the act of food procurement is time-stressed. If subsistence is time-stressed but cannot be effectively 'separated from technological schedules tools may be made both reliable (high component redundancy) and maintainable (readily repaired) - the latter being facilitated by limiting component design thereby enabling materials of varied quality to be employed. The implications of differing organizational and structural strategies for the formation of the archaeological record and for the lithic analyst are discussed. Evidence concerning the environment, chronology, economy, settlement and technology of the Mesolithic of mainland Britain is reviewed. For the Earlier Mesolithic an alternative to the Clark model of subsistence and mobility is developed, whilst multivariate analyses of stone tool inventories and evidence concerning the function, complexity and design of microlithic tools provides the basis for suggestions as to the character and significance of the Earlier-Later Mesolithic transition. Analyses of lithic debitage from sites in northern England provide evidence for embedded procurement and reduction strategies during the Earlier Mesolithic consistent with the expectations of a model where autumn was spent in upland valleys engaged in intercept hunting, winter was spent in lowland residences...|$|E
40|$|Scheme {{has been}} {{established}} to select the very best early stage post-doctoral researchers {{from all over the}} world and enable them to work at UK research institutions for a period of two years. The Scheme covers researchers in all disciplines covered by the two academies – physical, natural and social sciences, and the humanities. Objectives of the Newton International Fellowships Scheme • To ensure the UK engages with the best post-doctoral researchers, across all disciplines of physical, natural and social sciences, and the humanities, from around the world. • To provide an opportunity for post-doctoral researchers at an early career stage from any country outside the UK to work at a UK research institution for two years. • To foster long-term relations between Newton Fellows and the UK research base through the establishment of an alumni programme for former Fellows of this Scheme. The alumni programme will include the possible provision of further funding for Newton Fellows for up to 10 years for follow-on activities, to enable links with UK based researchers to be maintained and developed. This is expected to facilitate, in the longer term, improved access to international centres of excellence for UK-based researchers.

40|$|This report {{estimates}} {{the financial and}} greenhouse gas impacts of conferencing and other virtual meetings at nine UK universities and for the whole HE sector. As there are many uncertainties, it uses three scenarios – actual survey responses, conservative and very conservative - based on differing assumptions about key variables such as the reliability of responses, and how many virtual meetings, and what number of participants, actually avoid travel in practice. We consider the conservative and very conservative scenarios {{to be the most}} reliable, and the conservative scenario figures to be the most appropriate when discussing virtual meeting use in institutions or the sector as a whole. The financial benefits of avoided travel and <b>subsistence</b> <b>costs,</b> and freed up productive time, are estimated for: •	A single virtual meeting: between £ 106 - 257 (average £ 175) in the nine universities in the conservative case, and £ 48 - 78 (average £ 62) in the very conservative case. •	A single member of academic staff: between £ 199 - 613 (average £ 366) annually in the conservative case, and £ 86 - 199 (average £ 130) in the very conservative case. •	Each of the nine universities: between £ 151, 800 -£ 1, 609, 000 (average £ 553, 000) annually in the conservative case, and £ 72, 300 -£ 523, 300 (average £ 197, 700) in the very conservative case. •	The UK higher education sector as a whole: £ 66 million annually in the conservative case, and £ 23 million in the very conservative case. The net (i. e. after taking account of the emissions from IT equipment and ‘rebound’ effects) annual avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions (expressed as CO 2 equivalent) is estimated for: •	A single virtual meeting: between 12 - 55 kg of CO 2 eq emissions (average 24) in the nine universities in the conservative case, and 4 – 18 (average 9) in the very conservative case. •	A single member of academic staff: between 15 - 167 kg of CO 2 eq emissions (average 56) annually in the conservative case, and 6 - 54 (average 20) in the very conservative case. •	Each of the nine universities: between 19 - 438 tonnes of CO 2 eq emissions (average 97) annually for the conservative case, and 7 - 143 (average 34) in the very conservative case. •	The UK higher education sector as a whole: 10, 253 tonnes of CO 2 eq emissions annually in the conservative case, and 3. 647 in the very conservative case. Hence, there is a strong business and environmental case for encouraging greater use of virtual meetings within higher education and, by extension, further education. However, one point to note is that the environmental case is focused on air travel in general, and long haul air in particular, whereas these modes will often be much less central to the business case, where the greatest benefits can arise from reducing peak fare rail journeys and inter-campus travel. ...|$|E

The work contained within the report has been carried out on a voluntary basis, although considerable support has been provided by GOAL {{in the provision of}} travel and <b>subsistence</b> <b>costs</b> within Uganda, spanning the period from the 22 nd September to the 12 th October 2007. Funding for preparatory work and for the writing of this report was provided by the British Geological Survey (BGS). The report describes the hydrogeology of five sub-counties (Lapono, Lukole, Paimol, Parabongo and Wol) within Agago County, which cover GOAL’s area of operation for water and sanitation in Pader district. The area currently benefits from a large number of deep boreholes, although many of these have proved to be dry at the time of drilling. GOAL aims to meet the requirement for further water supplies largely through the provision of shallow, hand-dug wells. There has been no systematic geological or hydrogeological survey of the area to date and geological maps are only available at scales of 1 : 1, 000, 000 and 1 : 1, 250, 000. Further data collection during this visit has been restricted by limited exposures of rock, a lack of drill cuttings and logistical difficulties arising from poor transport and continuing security concerns. In general, however, the study area can be divided into areas of deeply weathered crystalline basement and large inselbergs, exposing a range of high-grade metamorphic rocks. Given the current emphasis on shallow well construction in the area, GIS layers of water strike data and predicted depth to water have been created. The depth to the first recorded water strikes appears to be largely controlled by the local topography and a map based on land surface curvature (rate of change in slope) has been used to highlight topographic depressions where water strikes are likely to be shallowest (negative curvature) and areas of raised ground where water strikes may be more than 50 m below the surface (positive curvature). Where the land surface curvature is below - 0. 001, recorded water strikes are uniformly within 40 m of the surface. Where the land surface curvature is greater than this, however, the depth to water strike is highly variable and recorded values range from 15 m to nearly 100 m below the surface. These results suggest that deep boreholes remain the most viable option for water supplies in the majority of cases. While it is possible to highlight parts of the study area where water strikes are likely to be shallowest, groundwater in these areas may still be more than 20 m below the surface. As a result, shallow wells constructed in these areas would be unlikely to succeed. Overall aquifer productivity has also been assessed and the study area has been divided into four domains with distinct hydrogeological characteristics. Transmissivity data from nearly 50 locations have been used in the delineation of these domains, along with topographic considerations. The low-lying, flat land in the southwest is shown to contain the most productive aquifers, while the areas close to the inselbergs in the north and east of the study area are shown to have aquifers with low productivity. The available data show no correlation between aquifer productivity and the depth of weathering. This has implications for the continued use of resistivity surveys in identifying suitable drilling sites, as much of the value of this technique lies in identifying the depth of weathering...|$|E
40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{ubiquitous}} computing, {{it is becoming increasingly}} easy to carry out work from anywhere, using a simple computing device that can connect you to the internet. Governments, policy makers, not-for-profit and scientific organizations have been reaching out to members of the general public - citizens, popularly known as the ‘crowd’, to get their ideas, opinions and expertise on various matters. This phenomenon of using the expertise of the ‘crowd’ for different purposes is called ‘crowdsourcing’. For sometime now businesses have been looking for new ways of saving money, beyond outsourcing, for their organizations; and have thus started reaching out to the crowd, through various platforms online to get access to a cheap, mobile workforce that is presumably available round the clock. Employing the crowd comes with massive benefits for such organisations that choose to use them: the crowd-workers serve as contractors or daily workers, who do not receive standard employee benefits such as holiday pay and insurance, as well as, pay for their own primary resources – the internet, computer, infrastructural and <b>subsistence</b> <b>costs.</b> There is also no current legislation that provides guidelines regarding such type of work, although {{there are quite a few}} researchers and advocacy groups now trying to change this. For the workers, crowdsourcing provides opportunities to make money, get exposure towards developing skills, learning to work and see a world outside their own all thanks to growth in tele-communication technologies and unstable employment patterns around the world. And although there is a lot of discourse surrounding crowdsourcing and crowdwork, particularly due to the legal aspect of such work, not much is understood about the work and the workers. Questions about this workforce remain unanswered such as: why does the crowd choose to do this type of work, how do they find these crowdsourcing platforms and crowdsourced jobs, what do they look for in the jobs they pick, how they organized their activities (both work and non-work), what tools and technologies they used, what might their concerns be as workers, how do they relate to requesters and the work platform? This thesis aims to provide insights into the work of crowdwork, what entails ‘doing crowdwork’, from the perspective of the workers who partake in crowdsourced work through online platforms. The thesis presents insights from an ethnographic study conducted in India through the summer of 2013, of crowdworkers, with a particular focus on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) as the principle site for work. The naturalistic data was collected from virtual and in-person interviews as well as observations of crowdworkers in their places of work and dwelling, and analysed with an ethnomethodological orientation to data, to uncover the local methods of the workers in their own words, to provide more information about this understudied cohort. Learning about crowdwork and the workers is important because this type of work has potential from an organizational perspective; a variety of relatively low-skilled work such as data entry processing, tagging, information verification, transcription and translation are being (and could be) crowdsourced by medium and large organisations. Hence this thesis makes contributions to the fields of human computation, CSCW, HCI and crowdsourcing by bringing forth insights into ‘doing crowdwork’ and ‘being a crowdworker’, which might help parties interested in using, applying or designing for crowdsourced work and crowdsourcing platforms, as well as, researchers and designers interested in this field. The contributions of the thesis include: •	Uncovering the heterogeneity in the motives of turkers: what motivates workers to work on platforms like AMT, and why they choose to continue their engagement with such work and platforms. •	The features of the crowdsourcing platform: what made a platform attractive to the turkers? For instance, features such as ease of use and flexibility in choosing work, played an important role in crowdsourcing. •	The social nature of work: although crowdwork is highly individualized and atomic, the nature of work itself was very social. Most workers found that they needed help for one thing or the other and found online resources such as forums and Facebook groups to get support or information regarding work and personal life. •	Invisible work and constant contingency management undertaken by the crowdworkers: Workers had to find and do work while managing contingencies that were created due to the opaque nature of the platform studied, AMT; requiring them to seek help externally, e. g by means of browser plug-ins, to help them work around this opacity, at the same time, creating more unpaid work for them...|$|E
