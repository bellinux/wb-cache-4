500|$|The {{following}} day, Hendrix {{received a}} phone call from one of his girlfriends, Devon Wilson, who had become jealous after hearing rumors that he was dating another woman, Kirsten Nefer. Nefer recalled: [...] "I heard Jimi talk to Devon... she was mad... she went into fits... Jimi said 'Devon, get off my back'". Hendrix was scheduled to perform in Rotterdam on September 13, but the show, along with three others, was cancelled due to Cox's incapacitation. During the evening of September 13, Nefer visited Hendrix at the Cumberland. After informing him that she would have to go back to work that evening, he convinced her to phone her boss, actor George Lazenby, and ask for the night off. Lazenby became angry and <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> the phone to Nefer: [...] "You're nothing but a fucking groupie", which Hendrix overheard. The exchange upset him, and he told Nefer: [...] "Don't you ever go out to that guy again". Nefer explained to him that she had spent six months working on a film with Lazenby and that she did not want to quit her job; Hendrix eventually agreed. Nefer spent the night with him and left in the morning.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 7 November 1976, three insurgents {{from a group of}} seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man [...] "stops" [...] involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> the noise of the aircraft. [...] "They are going to get me this time," [...] he yelled, sardonically; [...] "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!" [...] Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. [...] "Go nail gooks!" [...] Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.|$|E
2500|$|Sandy Irons {{was banned}} by George Noory due to Irons simply calling in to bash fan {{theories}} surrounding Supreme Leader Snoke of the Star Wars franchise. Irons' final call in was on August 16, 2017 when he <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> the phone, [...] "Your Snoke theory sucks! All Snoke theories suck!" [...] {{as soon as}} he got on the line. Noory simply asked Irons for his own Snoke theory and Irons began shouting again. Noory dumped him mid-shouting and Irons was banned from the program.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} album vocals {{were also}} remixed into a reggae version that included Jamaican-American reggae rap artist Li'l Vicious.

2500|$|In April 2011, {{during the}} trial of the civil suit brought by Corrie's parents, an IDF officer testified that Corrie and other activists had spent hours trying to block the bulldozers under his command. He {{went on to say that}} it was a war zone [...] "where Palestinian militants used {{abandoned}} homes as firing positions and exploited foreign activists for cover". He <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> a megaphone for the activists to leave, tried to use tear gas to disperse them and moved his troops several times. [...] "To my regret, after the eighth time, (Corrie) hid behind an earth embankment. The D9 operator didn't see her. She thought he saw her," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Van Peebles {{turned down}} a large money offer from a record label that wanted him to perform his lyrics over samples of older recordings. Van Peebles said, [...] "That's not what I do! The {{structures}} of my songs are more complicated and subtle than jingles or nursery rhymes, with music which helps carry the story along. The words aren't just <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> some loop which repeats itself." [...] Van Peebles later received an offer from Capitol Records and told the label [...] "Here's the deal: Send money, and leave me alone. I'll send the tape. That's it. Just go away, and let the doorknob hit you where the good Lord split you." [...] Capitol gave Van Peebles complete artistic control over the recording as a result, and he was satisfied with the business deal, {{as well as the}} finished album.|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd {{was coming}} off two C Grade bowling awards in a row, and joined Warrandyte for the 1981/82 season, {{and went on to}} {{completely}} dominate the opposition. He claimed 66 wickets and won the Bill Dean Medal as the league's best player, the only time a Warrandyte player has won such an award at the highest level. He was instrumental in guiding the 1st XI to 3rd place on the ladder and finals, another first for the club. His batting however was quite the opposite. After a caught behind shout from a fast bowler, he removed his gloves and walked off. As the bemused umpire yelled out that he wasn't out, Graeme, who was halfway off the ground <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, [...] "Close enough for me". Captain Davis also had a stellar season, claiming 44 wickets himself and snatching the competition bowling award from Lloyd, whilst Robert White returned the club from a stint at District cricket, and averaged 80 with the bat.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Come on! We {{must get}} those two twins' names,' said Una, and they charged uphill <b>shouting</b> <b>over</b> the hedge, till Nurse slowed {{up and told}} them.

5000|$|At {{times the}} dealer needs to {{communicate}} with the floor, or other casino staff.

6000|$|... 'Another time, too,' added Lady Merrifield, 'remember that {{it would}} be proper to come down and speak to me instead of <b>shouting</b> <b>over</b> the balusters in that unmannerly way; without so much as taking leave of your Aunt Jane. If she had not been almost late for her train, I should have insisted.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the Madonnino!" [...] he <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, {{and hurried}} forward {{to take my}} reins, uttering words of respectful welcome, which seemed to relieve the fears of my peasant, who had never quite {{believed}} me what I proclaimed myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a {{sound of}} revelry by night!" [...] For Mr. May, after a long depression, was in high feather. They shouted, {{positively}} <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> their cards, they roared with excitement, expostulation, and laughter. Miss Pinnegar sat through it all. But {{at one point she}} could bear it no longer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hasten!" [...] he <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder. [...] "Follow me!" [...] And {{without waiting}} for them he ran across the bridge and darted round the building, his torch {{scattering}} a shower of sparks behind him on the night, and sending little rills of blood-red light down the sword which he still carried.|$|E
6000|$|... "By my faith! that's easily seen," [...] {{said the}} prince, laughing, [...] "for a few score English archers at yonder end are bellowing {{as though they}} would out-shout the mighty multitude.

6000|$|... "At it again, eh? Throwing {{bouquets}} at yourselves." [...] Del Bishop {{grinned at}} them, {{and made to}} depart {{as quickly as he}} had come. [...] "But twist yourselves.

6000|$|They {{proceeded}} to the station--found the station-master--were conducted {{down to the}} signal-box. Lilly naturally hung back from people, but Jim was hob-nob with the station-master and the signal man, quite officer-and-my-men kind of thing. Lilly sat out {{on the steps of}} the signal-box, rather ashamed, while the long telegram was <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> the telephone to the junction town--first the young lady and her address, then the message [...] "Meet me X. station 3:40 tomorrow walk back great pleasure Jim." ...|$|E
50|$|Like the Teen Idles' other material, Minor Disturbance {{features}} mainly standard hardcore punk {{melodies and}} rhythms.

On Minor Disturbance, the band {{drew inspiration from}} local punk band Bad Brains, as well as Californian hardcore bands such as Black Flag and Germs.|$|R

60|$|Till one o'clock, then, {{there will}} be three parties, National Assembly, National Rascality, National Royalty, all busy enough. Rascality rejoices; women trim {{themselves}} with tricolor. Nay motherly Paris has sent her Avengers sufficient 'cartloads of loaves;' which are <b>shouted</b> <b>over,</b> which are gratefully consumed. The Avengers, in return, are searching for grain-stores; loading them in fifty waggons; that so a National King, probable harbinger of all blessings, may be the evident bringer of plenty, for one.|$|E
60|$|At {{four in the}} afternoon, therefore, the {{bombardment}} was renewed; and in less than half an hour, a white flag appeared above the wall. As, however, the garrison made no further sign of surrender, and refused to admit Colonel Clive with his troops, when he advanced to take possession, {{the bombardment}} was again renewed, more vigorously than ever. The enemy were unable to support {{the violence of the}} fire, and soon <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> the walls, to Clive, that they surrendered; and he might enter and take possession. He at once marched in, and the pirates laid down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners.|$|E
60|$|Everybody drank; {{the wounded}} drank; Oofty-Oofty, who helped me, drank. Only Louis refrained, {{no more than}} {{cautiously}} wetting his lips with the liquor, though he joined in the revels with an abandon {{equal to that of}} most of them. It was a saturnalia. In loud voices they <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> the day’s fighting, wrangled about details, or waxed affectionate and made friends with the men whom they had fought. Prisoners and captors hiccoughed on one another’s shoulders, and swore mighty oaths of respect and esteem. They wept over the miseries of the past and over the miseries yet to come under the iron rule of Wolf Larsen. And all cursed him and told terrible tales of his brutality.|$|E
50|$|After months {{writing and}} experimenting {{they decided to}} recruit a vocalist, one that with a {{powerful}} voice able to <b>shout</b> <b>over</b> the heavy sound which {{was a part of}} all their songs at the time. It was because of a recommendation from Alejandro Rosso (current Plastilina Mosh member) that Fernando Martz joined Zurdok. Later, keyboardist Gustavo Mauricio was brought in, and the Zurdok Movimento project was taken more seriously.|$|R

5000|$|... "Yung Rapunxel" [...] sees Banks {{alternating}} between rapping and <b>shouting</b> <b>over</b> a manic '90s Hi-NRG-influenced [...] "witch-hop" [...] beat.

[...] "Chasing Time" [...] is a dance-pop track, that takes influence from UK garage, deep house and jazz music. [...] "Nude Beach A-Go-Go" [...] is an alternate take on Ariel Pink's {{song of the}} same name, which is featured on pom pom.|$|R
