From an early age he was an {{enthusiastic}} <b>sketcher</b> and collector of prints, but while his brother Sawrey Gilpin became a professional painter, William opted {{for a career in}} the church, graduating from Queen's College, Oxford in 1748.|$|E
25|$|Cust's Gully at {{the western}} end of Great End's cliffs is named after 19th-century pioneer climber and <b>sketcher</b> Arthur Cust, a {{classical}} scholar from Yorkshire also known for his watercolour sketches of the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc. Cust's Gully is a Grade 1 rock climb, but a difficult obstacle for walkers ascending from Sprinkling Tarn. Cust's first winter ascent of the gully was recorded in 1880, although he is thought to have ascended it earlier.|$|E

50|$|Urban <b>Sketchers</b> created many {{regional}} communities. Correspondents of {{the original}} Urban <b>Sketchers</b> blog and Flickr group organized local <b>sketchers</b> and number of local sketching groups were started.

50|$|Urban <b>Sketchers</b> {{organization}} organizes Urban <b>Sketchers</b> Symposiums. These are festive {{gatherings of}} artists, where for 3 days <b>sketchers</b> draw on location, attend numerous workshops, panel discussions, lectures, {{meet each other}} in person and draw.|$|R
50|$|Urban <b>Sketchers</b> (USk) is {{a global}} {{community}} of artists that practice drawing on location in cities, towns and villages they live in or travel to. The Urban <b>Sketchers</b> movement was started on Flickr in 2007 by journalist Gabriel Campanario. In 2009 Campanario established Urban <b>Sketchers</b> as a nonprofit organization (501 (c) (3) tax-exempt). The Urban <b>Sketchers</b> Manifesto has been translated into several languages.|$|R
25|$|The {{police and}} the gang fired {{at each other for}} about a quarter of an hour. Then there was a lull but nothing could be seen {{for a minute or two}} because of the smoke. Superintendent Hare {{returned}} to the railway-station with a shattered left wrist from one of the first shots fired. He bled profusely, but Tom Carrington, artist for the Australasian <b>Sketcher,</b> stopped the haemorrhage with his handkerchief. Hare then ordered O'Connor to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to the battle but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be conveyed to Benalla by a special railway engine.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to playing}} cricket, Turner was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Royal Berkshire Regiment. Turner was a proficient <b>sketcher</b> and reporter, as reported by his commanding officer on 29 November 1882. The same year {{he served in the}} Egyptian campaign. The following year he undertook training at the School of Musketry in Hythe, Kent, where he became qualified to instruct the theory and practice of Musketry. He was promoted Major in 1901 and retired from the army in 1902. It was in the latter year that he purchased Thatcham House which was to be his home for the remainder of his life. He was re-employed in the First World War as Railway Transport Officer at Aldershot from 1914 to 1917.|$|E
500|$|Bengough {{attended}} Whitby Grammar School, {{where he}} was an average student; he won a prize one year for general proficiency, for which he received a book titled Boyhood of Great Artists. [...] He was an avid <b>sketcher,</b> a talent which caught the notice of his teacher, who presented Bengough {{with a set of}} paints one Christmas. [...] Bengough credited this act with setting him on the path to a career as an artist. [...] Whitby residents later reminisced of the young Bengough drawing chalk portraits of his neighbours on fences. [...] He described himself as a [...] "voracious reader", particularly of the Whitby Gazette, a didactic weekly that stressed Christian values.|$|E
50|$|Urban <b>Sketchers</b> is {{a diverse}} group of people united by a passion for sketching. Discussions, for example about {{supplies}} and materials, take place when <b>sketchers</b> meet in real life or virtually.|$|R
50|$|A {{year later}} in 2008 Campanario created the Urban <b>Sketchers</b> blog. Participation in the Urban <b>Sketchers</b> blog is by {{invitation}} and {{is limited to}} a hundred artists. The term Urban <b>Sketchers</b> Correspondent was created. Correspondents are invited by Campanario and commit to contribute journalistic sketches on a regular basis. The sketches are accompanied by stories providing a background for the sketch: when and where the sketch was created and some details about content - words and narrative that go with pictures. The Urban <b>Sketchers</b> blog gained popularity between 2008 and the present, attracting hundreds and soon thousands of visitors daily.|$|R

500|$|Bean {{is often}} {{described}} as [...] "down to earth" [...] and has retained his Yorkshire accent, despite now living in London. He is also described as a sex symbol, partly because of his role as Sharpe. He was voted the UK's second sexiest man in 2004, placing just behind his Lord of the Rings co-star Orlando Bloom. He admits that he does not mind being considered as a [...] "bit of rough" [...] by women. He has developed a reputation as a loner, in addition to his image as a sex symbol and an admitted [...] "bit of rough," [...] a label that he considers unfair. He has described himself instead as quiet, and interviewers confirm that he is a [...] "man of few words", with one interviewer calling him [...] "surprisingly shy". He admits that he can be a workaholic; he relaxes with a book or listens to music in his spare time, and is a talented pianist. He is also a keen gardener, welder, and <b>sketcher.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the 1920s, [...] Buenos Aires was {{overflowing}} with creative drawings and design, the Argentine illustrators and sketchers were attracting worldwide recognition, {{artists such as}} Jose Freire Segundo, creator of gráﬁca of Aikal (1940); Jose Luis Salinas, called upon by King Features to create a comic strip of world-wide fame, Cisco Kid; Florencio Molina Campos, the brilliant <b>sketcher</b> of the Alpargatas Almanacs of rural life (1930), collaborated in three Walt Disney films.|$|E
2500|$|An unrepentant lifelong doodler and <b>sketcher,</b> Saint-Exupéry had {{for many}} years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined {{notebooks}} and other scraps of paper. Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged {{in a variety of}} tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's later famous Keep On Truckin' of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office. Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as [...] "...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as [...] "the little prince," [...] and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet." [...] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a [...] "realistic ideal". Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. [...] One [...] "most striking" [...] illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry's editing process.|$|E
50|$|Regional Urban <b>Sketchers</b> groups {{function}} {{similar to}} the main global group. All embrace {{the vision of the}} Urban <b>Sketchers</b> Manifesto as leading guidelines, while each group maintains its local and cultural individuality.

60|$|There are few in {{whom the}} sight of a sunset does not beget as much meditative melancholy as contemplative pleasure, the human decline and death that it {{illustrates}} being too obvious to escape the notice of the simplest observer. The <b>sketcher,</b> {{as if he had been}} brought to this reflection many hundreds of times before by the same spectacle, showed that he did not wish to pursue it just now, by turning away his face after a few moments, to resume his architectural studies.|$|E
60|$|This {{might have}} {{applied to the}} <b>sketcher</b> no less than to the sketch; but Mr Carker's manner was {{openness}} itself--not as to his mouth alone, but as to his whole spirit. So it continued to be while the drawing was laid aside for Mr Dombey, and while the sketching materials were put up; then he handed in the pencils (which were received with a distant acknowledgment of his help, but without a look), and tightening his rein, fell back, and followed the carriage again.|$|E
60|$|The sun blazed {{down and}} down, till it was within half-an-hour of its setting; but the <b>sketcher</b> still lingered at his {{occupation}} of measuring and copying the chevroned doorway--a bold and quaint {{example of a}} transitional style of architecture, which formed the tower entrance to an English village church. The graveyard being quite open on its western side, the tweed-clad figure of the young draughtsman, and the tall mass of antique masonry which rose above him to a battlemented parapet, were fired to a great brightness by the solar rays, that crossed the neighbouring mead like a warp of gold threads, in whose mazes groups of equally lustrous gnats danced and wailed incessantly.|$|E
