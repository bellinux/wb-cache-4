5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

25|$|In other words, don't {{spend the}} money unless you're sure you're {{going to have the}} legal {{environment}} to go forward. Don't {{spend the money}} unless you're sure you're going to have the permit. No, I can't tell you that I'm going to have that permit until June, but we need to plan like we're going to have that permit in June. And so probably the biggest lesson is to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> could smooth out the on/off switches wherever we could and take control of our own destiny.|$|E

25|$|Yeah <b>sure,</b> <b>we</b> see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E
25|$|Once we {{have found}} the {{augmented}} shortest path, {{we want to make}} <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, we can start at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. When we finally arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then we know that the path we followed is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we can go ahead and update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the symmetric difference (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).|$|E
500|$|Piquet retired on lap13, after {{spinning}} off and {{colliding with}} a wall. Following the race, the Renault driver blamed damp patches {{on the track}} for the incident, adding that [...] "It's a shame because I'm <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> could have done something today." [...] On lap17, Rubens Barrichello retired with a gearbox problem, suffering from a failing sixth gear and engine over-revving.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, {{the death toll}} among the ponies {{increased}} to six, three drowning when sea-ice unexpectedly disintegrated, casting in doubt the possibility of reaching the pole at all. However, during the 1911 winter Scott's confidence increased; on 2 August, after the return of a three-man party from their winter journey to Cape Crozier, Scott wrote, [...] "I feel <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> are as near perfection as experience can direct".|$|E
500|$|The animators {{cited the}} classic {{television}} specials Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town by Rankin/Bass Productions as inspirations for the episode's animation styles. Caballero said, [...] "Well, we are heavily immersed {{in that particular}} Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass style. They are big heroes of ours ... So we tapped into that knowledge for <b>sure.</b> <b>We</b> definitely use modern tricks, though. We shot everything with digital cameras directly to the hard drives of our iMacs." ...|$|E
500|$|While Juskalian {{was held}} in Nuremberg, the Americans began their {{bombardment}} of the city. He describes the moment in his own words: [...] "We were cheering, and our guards were getting irritated, but the bombs came down on us, too, and I was <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> {{were going to get}} it. About 30 of us were killed. I was thinking of my mother and how ironic it would be to be killed {{at the end of the}} war—and by your own aircraft." ...|$|E

500|$|The duo modeled their {{relationship}} on writers Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond, but were much closer friends {{rather than just}} writing partners. They took the approach {{that they were in}} a band together and purposely studied teams to discover why they break up. Kurtzman later explained in 2009 that [...] "One big thing that makes the wheels start to wobble is when someone feels that the contribution isn't 50-50. We make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> live up to the partnership. If we didn't, we wouldn't have lasted this long." ...|$|E
500|$|Monaghan told MTV {{he thought}} the couple {{represents}} Eminem and Scott. The clip was produced by Kathy Angstadt and MaryAnn Tanedo of HSI Productions. Shortly before its release, Eminem reported in a press statement: [...] "Joseph and I worked pretty closely together to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> got this right". He said the difficult topic resulted in a powerful video because of the contributions of Rihanna, Fox and Monaghan. Fox donated her appearance fee to the Soujourn House, a battered women's shelter. On August 5, 2010, the video premiered on MTV and the music video website Vevo.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{she had a}} well-publicized {{affair with}} Enrico Bomba, the Italian {{producer}} and production manager of her film Panic Button. Hargitay accused Bomba of sabotaging their marriage. In 1963, she had another well-publicized relationship with singer Nelson Sardelli, whom she said she planned to marry when her divorce from Mickey Hargitay was finalized. The couple divorced in Juarez, Mexico, in May 1963, where Nelson Sardelli accompanied Mansfield in her legal preparations. She had previously filed for divorce on May 4, 1962, but told reporters [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> will make it up." [...] During the acrimonious divorce proceedings, the actress attempted to force a more favorable financial settlement by accusing Hargitay of kidnapping one of her children.|$|E

500|$|Biden's most {{important}} role {{within the administration}} was to question assumptions, playing a contrarian role. Obama said that [...] "The best thing about Joe {{is that when we}} get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me." [...] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden [...] "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> are as intellectually honest as possible." [...] On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup, attended the England v. U.S. game which was tied 1–1, and visited Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.|$|E
500|$|Pacquette {{earned a}} call-up to the Dominica {{national}} {{team for the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification CONCACAF First Round match against Barbados on 6 February 2008. Barbados went into the match as heavy favourites but fell behind to Pacquette's goal on his international debut, which finished as a 1–1 draw. After making his debut, manager Christopher Ericson said [...] "He is great in front of goal, powerful and full of effort and work.

500|$|The {{process of}} putting {{together}} All the Way... A Decade of Song was laborious for all involved, from balancing {{the number of}} hits and new songs to ensuring {{that each of the}} latest tracks showed a new side of Dion. [...] "We had hourly conversations, back and forth, about what the combination should be," [...] said John Doelp, the album's co-executive producer. [...] "We wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> had some new sounds and {{that we were able to}} go to new places." [...] Co-executive producer Vito Luprano added: [...] "The first idea was to record three new songs, then Dion said, 'Let's go for five,' her lucky number. But we had so many great songs coming in that we ended up recording nine. Out of that, we decided to go with seven." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, the SRVUSD was {{affected}} by a major statewide school budget crisis. 236 layoff notices were sent to teachers within the district, {{more than half of}} whom worked at Dougherty. All permanent teachers were rehired {{with the help of a}} $144 per-parcel tax measure passed in May 2009, expected to raise $6.7 million yearly. During the 2009 flu pandemic in the United States, one tenth grade student at Dougherty was known to have been infected with the Influenza A/H1N1 virus; however, closure of the school did not occur, as it was found to be unnecessary and inconvenient. According to Principal Hibbard, [...] "We just have to make <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> educate parents", and the school administration reacted to the outbreak by sending out an email to parents with advice from the Center for Disease Control.|$|E
500|$|Manson {{stated that}} {{eliminating}} the corporate pressure and indifference, {{as well as}} the band having a relaxed approach to the making of the record was pivotal for a healthy regroup, writing and recording process. [...] "We didn't put any pressure on ourselves to finish an album... We just took our time and got together in two-week blocks of time - any longer than that I'm <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> would have started getting on each others' nerves. So we did two weeks and then we'd take some time off and then when everybody felt ready we'd get back in [...] again. As a result, I think everybody really enjoyed our time together and really plugged in", she remarked. Never much enjoying being in a studio, Manson relished the record-making process this time around.|$|E
