50|$|Queensland in {{its early}} years was {{burdened}} with problems of vast distances, scattered populations and limited resources. The Department of Public Works produced a standardised timber school design that was easy and economical to build, enabling the government to introduce education to developing areas of the state. Designs between the 1920s and 1950s allowed future extensions to buildings as student numbers rose. These sectional schools notably incorporated large areas of glazing in the southern walls of classrooms, providing left-hand <b>side</b> <b>lighting</b> for predominantly right-handed students.|$|E
50|$|In July 2015, Facebook issued Stokes {{a warning}} after he posted a photo called “Mary, The Venus,” which depicts topless female Army veteran and amputee Mary Dague. In an {{interview}} with The Independent UK, Stokes said he believed the photo would be acceptable because it shows breast scarring, which Facebook does not prohibit. Two months later, Stokes was banned from the site for 30 days after posting a photo from his book Masculinity that showed a man nude from the <b>side,</b> <b>lighting</b> a cigarette. The photo was later reinstated and Stokes received an apology but not an explanation.|$|E
50|$|As {{the role}} of women {{increased}} in car-purchase decisions, automakers began to hire female designers. Hudson, wanting a female perspective on automotive design, hired Elizabeth Ann Thatcher, who later became Betty Thatcher Oros, in 1939. A graduate of the Cleveland School of Arts (now Cleveland Institute of Art) with a major in Industrial Design, she became one of America's first female automotive designers. Her contributions to the 1941 Hudson included exterior trim with <b>side</b> <b>lighting,</b> interior instrument panel, interiors and interior trim fabrics. She designed for Hudson from 1939 into 1941, leaving the company when she married Joe Oros, then a designer for Cadillac. He later became head of the design team at Ford that created the Mustang.|$|E

5000|$|A major use of gray cards is {{to provide}} a {{standard}} reference object for exposure determination in photography. A gray card is an (approximate) realization of a Lambertian scatterer; its apparent brightness (and exposure determination) therefore depends only on its orientation relative to the light source. By placing a gray card in the scene to be photographed, oriented toward the direction of the incident light, and taking a reading from it with a reflected light meter, the photographer can be assured of consistent exposures across their photographs. This technique is similar to using an incident meter, as it depends on the illuminance but not the reflectivity of the subject. (Of course taking photographs with <b>side</b> <b>lighting</b> or back lighting implies that the gray card should be oriented toward the camera instead.) ...|$|E
50|$|Values {{for direct}} {{sunlight}} apply between approximately {{two hours after}} sunrise and two hours before sunset, and assume front lighting. As a rough general rule, decrease EV by 1 for <b>side</b> <b>lighting,</b> and decrease EV by 2 for back lighting.This is approximately the value given by the sunny 16 rule.These values are appropriate for pictures of the Moon taken at night with a long lens or telescope, and will render the Moon as a medium tone. They will not, in general, be suitable for landscape pictures that include the Moon. In a landscape photograph, the Moon typically is near the horizon, where its luminance changes considerably with altitude. Moreover, a landscape photograph usually must {{take account of the}} sky and foreground as well as the Moon. Consequently, it is nearly impossible to give a single correct exposure value for such a situation.|$|E
5000|$|After The Great Train Robbery Porter {{continued}} {{to try out}} new techniques. He presented two parallel stories in The Kleptomaniac (1905), a film of social commentary like his technically more conventional film of 1904, The Ex-Convict. In The Seven Ages (1905) he used <b>side</b> <b>lighting,</b> close-ups, and changed shots within a scene, {{one of the earliest}} examples of a filmmaker departing from the theatrical analogy of a single shot for each scene. He also directed trick films such as Dream of a Rarebit Fiend (1906), based on the comic strip by Winsor McCay. Between 1903 and 1905 he successfully demonstrated most of the techniques that were to become the basic modes of visual communication through film. For instance, he helped to develop the modern concept of continuity editing, and is often credited with discovering that the basic unit of structure in film was the [...] "shot" [...] rather than the scene (the basic unit on the stage), paving the way for D. W. Griffith's advances in editing and screen storytelling. Yet he seemed to regard them only as separate experiments and never brought them together in a unified filmmaking style. Porter directed future filmmaker Griffith in Rescued from an Eagle's Nest (1908).|$|E

5000|$|After {{attending}} Houghton College, {{where he}} studied history with plans to be a lawyer, Sheffer returned to his hometown of Youngsville, Pennsylvania to teach high school history. He often lectured against war in his class room as World War II escalated. Working for the college year book at Houghton College exposed him to photography and lead him to leave teaching {{to work as a}} photographer for a department store in Pittsburgh. He later answered a newspaper ad for a photographer in Wisconsin because he admired the work of Wisconsin architect Frank Lloyd Wright and respected that Capital punishment in Wisconsin was abolished in 1853. He moved to Milwaukee in 1945 without [...] "knowing a soul" [...] to work for the prominent society portraitist John Platz. Inspired by the artistic achievements of Yousuf Karsh, Julia Margaret Cameron, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Emily Dickinson, Sheffer approached portraiture in a poetic and artistic manner working to get close in order to isolate the subject. Using a handheld 35 mm camera, natural <b>side</b> <b>lighting</b> and dramatic darkroom techniques, the portraits he generated out of his own Jefferson Street studio were known as having the [...] "Sheffer look". His portraits of Milwaukee's mid-century social elite, artists and architecture earned him the title [...] "Photographer of Photographers" [...] from the Wisconsin Professional Photographers Association in 1955. His clients included actor Jimmy Stewart, comedian Tallulah Bankhead, and politician Joseph McCarthy who he photographed for Life (magazine). He created the [...] "Portraits of Men" [...] series in the mid-1950s for DuPont, a manufacturer of photographic film and paper, which was destroyed in a fire at his studio. He was president of the Milwaukee Photo Pictorialists and the [...] "Darlot Club" [...] which he once described as the [...] "self-appointed ten best photographers in Wisconsin." [...] The groups favored pictorial style soft focus lenses, and deep shadows in prints. He photographed theater productions extensively for Marquette University from 1955-1968 where many of his works are preserved in a photographic archive. Several of his portraits are also held {{in the collection of the}} Milwaukee Art Museum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} is {{a breakdown of the}} types of evidence encountered and how the evidence should be handled:Fingerprints (also includes palm prints and bare footprints) are the best evidence to place an individual at the scene of a crime. Collecting fingerprints at a crime scene requires very few materials, making it ideal from a cost standpoint. All non-movable items at a crime scene should be processed at the scene using gray powder, black powder, or black magnetic powder. Polaroid 665 black and white film loaded in a Polaroid CU-5 camera with detachable flash should be used to make one-to-one photographs of prints which do not readily lift. All small transportable items should be packaged in paper bags or envelopes and sent to the crime lab for processing. Because of the [...] "package it up and send it to the lab" [...] mentality, some investigators skim over collecting prints at a crime scene. Collecting prints at the crime scene should be every investigator's top priority. Fingerprints from the suspect as well as elimination fingerprints from the victim will also be needed for comparison (the same holds true for palm and bare footprints).Bite marks are found many times in sexual assaults and can be matched back to the individual who did the biting. They should be photographed using an ABFO No. 2 Scale with normal lighting conditions, <b>side</b> <b>lighting,</b> UV light, and alternate light sources. Color slide and print film as well as black and white film should be used. The more photographs under a variety of conditions, the better. Older bitemarks which are no longer visible on the skin may sometimes be visualized and photographed using UV light and alternate light sources. If the bitemark has left an impression then maybe a cast can be made of it. Casts and photographs of the suspect's teeth and maybe the victim's teeth will be needed for comparison. For more information consult a forensic odontologist. Much like a bullet that has individualizing striations on it, natural fingernails have individualizing striations on them. A broken fingernail found at a crime scene can be matched to the individual it came from many months after the crime has been committed. Broken fingernails should be placed in a paper packet which is then placed in a paper envelope. It can then be transported to the crime lab for analysis. Known samples from the suspect and maybe from the victim will be needed for comparison.Handwriting samples can also be matched back to the individual that produced them. Known exemplars of the suspected person's handwriting must be submitted for comparison to the unknown samples. Questioned documents can also be processed for fingerprints. All items should be collected in paper containers. For more information consult a questioned documents examiner.Fracture matches can positively link broken pieces at the scene with pieces found in the possession of a suspect. For example, headlight fragments found at the scene of a hit and run could be positively matched to a broken headlight (just like putting together a jigsaw puzzle) on a suspect's vehicle. Larger fragments should be placed in paper bags or envelopes. Smaller fragments should be placed in a paper packet and then placed in an envelope. If a root sheath is attached, then DNA analysis using PCR technology can say that this hair came from a certain percentage of the population to which the suspect belongs. If there is no root sheath, then a microscopic analysis can say that the hair has the same characteristics as the suspect's hair and is similar to his or her hair. At this point, no one can say that a hair came from a particular individual. Hair found at the scene should be placed in a paper packet and then placed in an envelope. If a microscopic examination is required, then 15-20 representative hairs from the suspect must be submitted to the lab for comparison. If DNA analysis if going to be used, then a whole blood sample from the suspect must be submitted to the lab in a [...] "Vacutainer." [...] Contact a DNA lab for more information.Fibers can be said that they are the same type and color as those found in a suspect's clothes, residence, vehicle, etc. Fibers should be collected in a paper packet and placed in an envelope. Representative fibers should be collected from a suspect and submitted to the lab for comparison.Paint can be said that it is the same type and color as paint found in the possession of a suspect. Paint fragments should be collected in a paper packet and placed in an envelope. Representative paint chips or samples should be collected from the suspect and submitted to the lab for comparison. Glass can be said that it has the same characteristics as glass found in the possession of a suspect. Smaller glass fragments should be placed in a paper packet and then in an envelope. Larger pieces should be wrapped securely in paper or cardboard and then placed in a padded cardboard box to prevent further breakage. Representative samples from the suspect should be submitted to the lab for comparison.|$|E

40|$|Formulations are {{presented}} that permit prediction of image quality {{as a function}} of camera performance, surface radiance properties, and lighting and viewing geometry. Predictions made {{for a wide range of}} surface radiance properties reveal that image quality depends strongly on proper camera dynamic range command and on favorable lighting and viewing geometry. Proper camera dynamic range commands depend mostly on the surface albedo that will be encountered. Favorable lighting and viewing geometries depend mostly on lander orientation with respect to the diurnal sun path over the landing site, and tend to be independent of surface albedo and illumination scattering function. <b>Side</b> <b>lighting</b> with low sun elevation angles (10 to 30 deg) is generally favorable for imaging spatial details and slopes, whereas high sun elevation angles are favorable for measuring spectral reflectances...|$|E
