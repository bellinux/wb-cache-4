40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} change in the therapeutic approach to patients with Paget's disease of bone over the last 40 years. In the 1960 s, only symptomatic therapy could be given, with control of pain the main objective. Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly used agents. From 1968 onwards, antiosteoclastic agents became available, including calcitonin, plicamycin (mithramycin) and etidronate (etidronic acid), a first-generation bisphosphonate. Limitations with these agents, including potentially deleterious effects on bone mineralization with etidronate (etidronic acid), has cleared the way for increasingly potent second- and third-generation bisphosphonates, including clodronate (clodronic acid), pamidronate (pamidronic acid), alendronate (alendronic acid) and risedronate (risedronic acid). Even more potent bisphosphonates will become available in the near future. With the newer bisphosphonates, there is some hope for long-term remission (if not definitive healing) of pagetic lesions, as well as prevention of long-term complications in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Thus, indications for therapy have been extended to include younger patients to prevent bone deformity of the limbs and skull, leading to secondary osteoarthritis, facial deformities and potentially to sarcoma transformation; as well as to elderly patients to prevent bone fragility, leading to fracture, and pagetic vascular <b>steal</b> <b>syndromes.</b> The increased potency and longer duration of action of newer bisphosphonates more than compensates for their marginally increased cost compared with older bisphosphonates...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Coronary subclavian <b>steal</b> (CSS) <b>syndrome</b> {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery (CABG) involving the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. It results from stenosis of the left subclavian artery proximal to the LIMA, which compromises myocardial blood flow. The incidence of CSS syndrome is between 0. 1 - 3. 4 % in the United States. 1 Most cases occur as a result of long-standing subclavian stenosis due to progres-sion of the stenosis following CABG. We report a case of CSS syndrome, which presented as a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) ...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We present {{two cases}} of subclavian steal syn-drome from the {{ipsilateral}} vertebral artery (VA) to the subclavian artery (SCA), {{one with the}} left VA originating from the aortic arch {{and the other with}} the left VA origi-nating very close to the origin of the SCA, proximal to the occluded segment. In both cases, angiographic demonstra-tion of these anatomic variations and successful endovas-cular treatment are presented. Subclavian <b>steal</b> (SS) <b>syndrome</b> is a well-recognized phenomenon. Although color Doppler sonography is a safe method, diagnosis of SS has some difficulties in the presence of antegrade flow in the ipsilateral ver-tebral artery (VA). We present two cases of SS syn-drome from the ipsilateral VA, one with the arch originating from the VA and the other with the VA originating very proximal to the subclavian artery (SCA). In both cases, angiographic demonstration of these anatomic variations and successful endovascu-lar treatment outcomes are presented...|$|R

50|$|Subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{arises from}} {{retrograde}} (reversed) {{flow of blood}} in the vertebral artery or the internal thoracic artery, due to a proximal stenosis (narrowing) and/or occlusion of the subclavian artery.|$|E
5000|$|Coronary steal (with its {{symptoms}} termed coronary <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome</b> or cardiac <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome)</b> is {{a phenomenon}} where an alteration of circulation patterns leads {{to a reduction in}} the blood directed to the coronary circulation. It is caused when there is narrowing of the coronary arteries and a coronary vasodilator is used - [...] "stealing" [...] blood away from those parts of the heart. This happens {{as a result of the}} narrowed coronary arteries being always maximally dilated to compensate for the decreased upstream blood supply. Thus, dilating the resistance vessels in the coronary circulation causes blood to be shunted away from the coronary vessels supplying the ischemic zones, creating more ischemia.|$|E
50|$|Coronary {{arteriovenous}} fistula between {{coronary artery}} and another cardiac chamber, like, the coronary sinus, right atrium, or right ventricle may cause <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome</b> under conditions like myocardial infarction and possible angina or ventricular arrhythmias, if the shunt is large in magnitude.|$|E
50|$|Patients with mesenteric, or {{intestinal}} FMD, {{may experience}} abdominal pain after eating or weight loss. FMD within the extremities may cause claudication {{or may be}} detectable by bruits. If the lower limb arteries are affected, the patient may present with cold legs or evidence of distal embolic disease. FMD present in the subclavian artery may cause arm weakness, parenthesis, claudication, and subclavial <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|Subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SSS), {{also called}} subclavian steal {{phenomenon}} or subclavian steal steno-occlusive disease, is {{a constellation of}} signs and symptoms that arise from retrograde (reversed) blood flow in the vertebral artery or the internal thoracic artery, due to a proximal stenosis (narrowing) and/or occlusion of the subclavian artery. The arm may be supplied by blood flowing in a retrograde direction down the vertebral artery {{at the expense of}} the vertebrobasilar circulation. This is called the subclavian steal. It is more severe than typical vertebrobasilar insufficiency.|$|E
50|$|Teratomas {{are thought}} to {{originate}} in utero, and therefore can be considered congenital tumors. Many teratomas are not diagnosed until much later in childhood or in adulthood. Large tumors {{are more likely to}} be diagnosed early on. Sacrococcygeal and cervical teratomas are often detected by prenatal ultrasound. Additional diagnostic methods may include prenatal MRI. In rare circumstances, the tumor is so large that the fetus may be damaged or die. In the case of large sacrococcygeal teratomas, a significant portion of the fetus' blood flow is redirected toward the teratoma (a phenomenon called <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome),</b> causing heart failure, or hydrops, of the fetus. In certain cases, fetal surgery may be indicated.|$|E
5000|$|Some people {{develop an}} initial [...] "inflammatory phase" [...] {{characterized}} by systemic illness with {{signs and symptoms}} of malaise, fever, night sweats, weight loss, joint pain, fatigue, and fainting. Fainting may result from subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome</b> or carotid sinus hypersensitivity. There is also often anemia and marked elevation of the ESR or C-reactive protein (nonspecific markers of inflammation). The initial [...] "inflammatory phase" [...] is often followed by a secondary [...] "pulseless phase". The [...] "pulseless phase" [...] is characterized by vascular insufficiency from intimal narrowing of the vessels manifesting as arm or leg claudication, renal artery stenosis causing hypertension, and neurological manifestations due to decreased blood flow to the brain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advantages}} of the AV fistula use are lower infection rates, because no foreign material is involved in their formation, higher blood flow rates (which translates to more effective dialysis), and a lower incidence of thrombosis. The complications are fewer than with other access methods. If a fistula has a very high blood flow and the vasculature that supplies {{the rest of the}} limb is poor, a <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome</b> can occur, where blood entering the limb is drawn into the fistula and returned to the general circulation without entering the limb's capillaries. This results in cold extremities of that limb, cramping pains, and, if severe, tissue damage. One long-term complication of an AV fistula can be the development of an aneurysm, a bulging in the wall of the vein where it is weakened by the repeated insertion of needles over time. To a large extent the risk of developing an aneurysm can be reduced by carefully rotating needle sites over the entire fistula, or using the [...] "buttonhole" [...] (constant site) technique. Aneurysms may necessitate corrective surgery and may shorten the useful life of a fistula. Fistulas can also become blocked due to blood clotting or infected if sterile precautions are not followed during needle insertion at the start of dialysis. Because of the high volume of blood flowing through the fistula, excessive bleeding can also occur. This is most common soon after a dialysis treatment. Pressure must be applied to the needle holes to induce clotting. If that pressure is removed prematurely or a patient engages in physical activity too soon after dialysis, the needle holes can open up.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by the vertebral artery flow inversion, due to a stenotic lesion in the origin of the subclavian artery. The Coronary-subclavian <b>Steal</b> <b>Syndrome</b> is a variation of the Subclavian <b>Steal</b> <b>Syndrome</b> and {{is characterized}} by inversion of flow in the Internal Thracic artery that has been used as conduct in a myocardial revascularization. Its diagnosis must be suspected in patients with difference in pulse and arterial pressure in the upper limbs, that present with angina pectoris and that have done a myocardial revascularization. Its treatment must be a surgical bypass or a transluminal angioplasty. Objective: The objective is to show the left subclavian artery stenting as a safe and effective method to treat the coronary-subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Methods: Historical prospective, non-randomized trial, through revision of the hospital records of the patients treated with the stenting of the left subclavian artery, from January 2006 to September 2012. Results: In the mentioned period, 4. 291 miocardial revascularizations were performed {{with the use of the}} left mammary artery, and 16 patients were identified to have the Coronary-subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome.</b> All of them were submitted to endovascular treatment. The success rate was 100 %; two patients experienced minor complications; none of them presented with major complications. Eleven of the 16 patients had ultrassonographic documentation of patent stent for at least one year; two patients lost follow up and other two died.

40|$|The subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by a subclavian artery stenosis located proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. In this case, the subclavian artery steals reverse-flow blood from the vertebrobasilar artery circulation to supply the arm during exertion, resulting in vertebrobasilar insufficiency. As the vertebrobasilar arterial system feeds both the peripheral and central auditory and vestibular systems, in subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> neurotological symptoms are expected because of the vertebrobasilar insufficiency. In this report, we describe three patients suffering from subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> who presented with isolated dizziness, recurrent vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus. In two of the three cases, a positional nystagmus was detected, which was vertical in two. Abnormal saccades were documented in one, and the auditory brainstem responses were pathological in all three patients; the caloric response was reduced in only one case. Upon magnetic resonance imaging, ischaemic lesions were observed in two patients, in the brainstem and in the hemispheres, respectively. These findings suggest that the central auditory and vestibular system {{is more likely to be}} involved in the pathogenesis of neurotological symptoms in subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Patients complaining of numbness of the upper arm and isolated neurotological symptoms should be thoroughly examined for subclavian <b>steal</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Furthermore, regular follow-up must be undertaken in order to prevent other neurological deficits in the vertebrobasilar arterial territory...|$|E
