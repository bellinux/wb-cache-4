5|$|Further {{issues were}} {{discovered}} upon {{the launch of}} the Anniversary Update ("Redstone"), including a bug that caused some devices to freeze (but addressed by cumulative update KB3176938, released on August 31, 2016), and that fundamental changes to how Windows handles webcams had caused many to <b>stop</b> <b>working.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Melua {{was ordered}} by her doctors to <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> {{for a few}} months after {{suffering}} a nervous breakdown, resulting in her hospitalisation for six weeks. As a result, all touring and promotional activities were postponed until the following year.|$|E

5|$|It {{is clear}} that John has an ulterior motive; first, he paralyses Gwen and locks her in a crate telling {{her that if she}} is not found in two hours, her main organs will <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> and she would die. He then finds Owen and Tosh, {{shooting}} the former in the hip. After letting Ianto go, he finally confronts Jack, who realises that the bombs are an elementary 51st century confidence trick. Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|These radars {{have been}} {{installed}} at six different radar stations {{and as of}} 2012 are operational at three – Balkhash, Mishelevka and Olenegorsk. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty required that early warning radars were located {{on the periphery of}} national territory and faced outwards. This caused problems when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 as many of the radar stations were now in newly independent states. The first station to close was Skrunda, in newly independent Latvia. A 1994 agreement between Russia and Latvia agreed that the two Dnepr radars there would <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> in 1998, and would be fully demolished by 2000.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to <b>stop</b> <b>working.</b> When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E

5|$|Punk's matches with Cabana led him {{to being}} hired by the Ring of Honor promotion. From February 2003 until May 2004, Punk refused to wrestle for IWA Mid-South, {{explaining}} this as a protest to Ian Rotten's mistreatment of Chris Hero in the company. Hero, however, has stated he believes there were other reasons, and Rotten's treatment of him was just an excuse by Punk to <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> for the company. Eventually Punk returned to IWA Mid-South and continued to perform as a wrestler and commentator for them until 2005 when he was signed to World Wrestling Entertainment. His last appearance in IWA Mid-South was on July 2, 2005 in which he competed in a 60-minute time limit draw against Delirious.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} the ex-boyfriend before {{learning}} that the Kurt's best friend is probably guilty. Veronica gets a disturbing phone call from Logan, so she tracks his cell phone, finding him gambling. Veronica and Logan have a fight before she learns that Keith had to <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> for a client when Weevil hit a suspect; Keith feels required to fire Weevil. Veronica tells Weevil the news before {{she gives him a}} job fixing the Dean’s car. Veronica confronts the best friend, but he’s not the perpetrator, and Veronica suddenly realizes that Trish is. Veronica lies to Trish about what happened to Kurt in order to elicit a true reaction from her; this plan works, and Veronica learns that Trish took the playbook in order to get him off the team. However, she lost it in the process. Kurt, Trish, and Veronica track it down to the ex-boyfriend, who gave the plays to another team to spite the couple.|$|E

NSS is used by Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome to implement SSL. Some web servers that have a broken implementation of the SSL specification may <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> as a result.|$|E
25|$|In nationalistic terms, the {{abolition}} of slavery also served as a moral triumph of France over England as seen {{in the latter half of}} the above quote. Yet {{the abolition}} of slavery did not allow for independence and did not persuade Toussaint Louverture until some time later to <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> with the Spanish army.|$|E

25|$|In Oamaru, 225kilometres {{southwest}} of Christchurch, the earthquake caused {{part of a}} chimney on the St Kevin's College principal's residence to fall through the house, and caused the clock atop the Waitaki District Council building to stop at 4:36am. The earthquake also caused the Dunedin Town Hall clock and the University of Otago clocktower to <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> in Dunedin, some 350km away from the quake epicentre.|$|E
25|$|Hobbyist aquaria {{often do}} not have {{sufficient}} bacteria populations to adequately denitrify waste. This problem is most often addressed through two filtration solutions: Activated carbon filters absorb nitrogen compounds and other toxins, while biological filters provide a medium designed to enhance bacterial colonization. Activated carbon and other substances, such as ammonia absorbing resins, <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> when their pores fill, so these components {{have to be replaced}} regularly.|$|E
25|$|The {{salivary glands}} and tear glands have a {{radiation}} tolerance of about 30Gy in 2Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical {{head and neck}} cancer treatments. Dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (xerophthalmia) can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patient's quality of life. Similarly, sweat glands in treated skin (such as the armpit) tend to <b>stop</b> <b>working,</b> and the naturally moist vaginal mucosa is often dry following pelvic irradiation.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} five years, Butler worked on the series of novels that later {{become known as the}} Patternist series: Patternmaster (1976), Mind of My Mind (1977), and Survivor (1978). In 1978, she was finally able to <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> at {{temporary}} jobs and live on her writing. She took a break from the Patternist series to research and write Kindred (1979), and then finished the series with Wild Seed (1980) and Clay's Ark (1984).|$|E
25|$|When 1 January 2000 arrived, {{there were}} {{problems}} generally regarded as minor. Consequences did not always result exactly at midnight. Some programs were not active at that moment and problems would only show up when they were invoked. Not all problems recorded were directly linked to Y2K programming in a causality; minor technological glitches occur on a regular basis. Some caused erroneous results, some caused machines to <b>stop</b> <b>working,</b> some caused date errors, and two caused malfunctions.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification theory {{predicts that}} when people {{interact}} with others, {{there is a general}} tendency for them to bring others to see them as they see themselves. This tendency is especially pronounced when they start out believing that the other person has misconstrued them, apparently because people compensate by working especially hard to bring others to confirm their self-views. People will even <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> on tasks to which they have been assigned if they sense that their performance is eliciting non-verifying feedback.|$|E
