5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{size of the}} two outer CO shells remains elusive, {{preliminary}} estimates suggest that one shell extends from about 1.5 to 4.0 arcseconds and the other expands as far as 7.0 arcseconds. Assuming the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU as the star radius, the inner shell would extend roughly 50 to 150 stellar radii (~300 to 800AU) with the outer one as far as 250 stellar radii (~1400AU). The Sun's heliopause is estimated at about 100 AU, so the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> outer shell would be almost fourteen {{times the size of}} the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the time}} of its {{discovery}} in 1905, there have been many attempts to estimate the population <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> species. Results varied greatly, but the more recent ones suggest a very reduced number of individuals. This coupled with a very restricted distribution have led to the listing of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as an endangered or threatened species. Humans frequently invade its habitat, though such disturbances have been greatly reduced by preventive measures. Recent efforts in conservation include perpetuating the extant population at a baseline size as well as maintaining captive populations.|$|E
5|$|The dusky woodswallow has a {{very large}} range. The {{population}} <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> bird {{has not yet been}} quantified or estimated. It is, however, expected to be as populous as other birds within its densest range labeled 'common'. Because of this, the dusky woodswallow is evaluated to be of Least Concern (LC). This classification may change with new evidence, so is not to be taken with complete accuracy.|$|E

5|$|The {{resonator}} {{shown in}} figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30GHz have been produced using cantilever varactors as the resonator elements. The <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> filter is around 4×3.5mm. Cantilever resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, {{can be used in}} the microwave bands. Extremely high Q resonators can be made with this technology; flexural mode resonators with a Q in excess of 80,000 at 8MHz are reported.|$|E
5|$|The right whales' two known predators are {{humans and}} orcas. When danger lurks, {{a group of}} right whales may cluster into a circle, and thrash their outwards-pointing tails. They may also head for shallow water, which {{sometimes}} proves to be an ineffective defense. Aside from the strongly-build tails and massive heads equipping with callosities, the sheer <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> animal is its best defense, although young calves are the most vulnerable to orca and shark attacks.|$|E
5|$|The sicklefin weasel shark is not {{dangerous}} to humans. It is caught by artisanal fishers throughout its range, mostly in drifting and bottom gillnets {{but also in}} bottom trawls and on longlines. The meat is eaten, the fins are used in shark fin soup, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. However, the small <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> shark limits its economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sicklefin weasel shark as Vulnerable, noting that it is naturally uncommon and resides in heavily fished regions. In addition, compared to the related Australian weasel shark it is less productive and thus less resilient to withstand fishing pressure.|$|E

5|$|Appian {{claims that}} Lucullus had {{embarked}} from Rome {{with only a}} single legion; upon entering Anatolia to make war against Mithridates, he added four more legions to his army. The overall <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> force consisted of 30,000 infantry and 1,600 cavalry. Following Mithridates' retreat to Armenia, Appian estimates Lucullus' invading force to be only two legions and 500 horsemen, although it is highly improbable {{that he would have}} undertaken the invasion of Armenia with such a small army. Historian Adrian Sherwin-White places the size of Lucullus' force to 12,000 seasoned legionaries (composed of three legions), and 4,000 provincial cavalry and light infantry. The Roman army was further bolstered by several thousand allied Gallic, Thracian, and Bithynian infantry and cavalry.|$|E

25|$|Diet has {{an effect}} on blood {{cholesterol}}, but the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> effect varies between individuals. Moreover, when dietary cholesterol intake goes down, production (principally by the liver) typically increases, so that blood cholesterol changes can be modest or even elevated. This compensatory response may explain hypercholesterolemia in anorexia. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that dietary cholesterol is associated with higher blood cholesterol. Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL. LDL and total cholesterol also increases by very high fructose intake.|$|E
