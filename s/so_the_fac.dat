The FAME trials investigated the safety and efficacy of <b>the</b> <b>FAc</b> implant [12]. This was a multicenter clinical trial involving 375 DME subjects treated with low-dose (0.2 [*]μg/day) and 393 subjects treated with high-dose (0.5 [*]μg/day) fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant. Both doses of <b>the</b> <b>FAc</b> implant significantly improved BCVA versus a sham control (n[*]=[*] 185) up to 3 [*]years after treatment was initiated [13]. There was a higher rate of cataract surgery in subjects treated with <b>the</b> <b>FAc</b> implants, but interestingly, the VA results after cataract removal were similar to those that were pseudophakic when recruited into the study. Elevated IOP surgery rates were 4.8, 8.1, and 0.5 % in low, high, and sham groups. Comparing the relative risk-to-benefit profile, the authors considered the low-dose intravitreal implant to be the better choice as similar efficacy outcomes could be achieved with a lower rate of adverse events.|$|R

The occurrence and polarities of <b>FACs</b> in <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere {{are different from those}} in the Southern Hemisphere. The average density and the standard deviation of <b>the</b> <b>FACs</b> that {{are most likely to be}} connected to the Earth are 4. 90 nA m− 2 and 2. 55 nA m− 2 in the Northern Hemisphere and 4. 21 nA m− 2 and 1. 80 nA m− 2 in the Southern Hemisphere, respectively. For investigating the mechanism of the north-south asymmetry, we mapped <b>the</b> <b>FACs</b> along <b>the</b> field line into the polar region. The footprints of <b>the</b> <b>FACs</b> also show a difference between the Southern and Northern hemispheres (as a function of mapped latitude). These characteristics suggest a north-south asymmetry of <b>the</b> <b>FACs</b> in <b>the</b> magnetosphere. Further investigation is needed to identify the causes of this asymmetry, although the configuration of the magnetosphere, the polar cap boundary, the conductivity in the ionosphere, or the various solar wind-magnetosphere interaction processes all may be contributors.

30|$|Here, {{we suggest}} the {{possibility}} that atmospheric gravity waves generated by the lower atmospheric disturbances, which are expected to exist globally and frequently, propagate upward and cause the ionospheric dynamo. The ionospheric dynamo currents {{must be accompanied by}} <b>the</b> <b>FACs,</b> because <b>the</b> dynamo region caused by the gravity wave is limited in the horizontal scale and the dynamo currents need to divert along a highly conductive geomagnetic field, forming <b>the</b> <b>FAC</b> system. That is, as an Alfvén wave with the polarized electric field propagates along the geomagnetic field line being accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>FAC,</b> resulting in a three-dimensional closure circuit of the ionospheric dynamo current. It should be noted that in our model, the generator of the ionospheric current is the acoustic wave or the internal gravity wave generated by the disturbance in the lower atmosphere. The temporal variation is assumed to be slow enough compared to the spatial variation divided by <b>the</b> CHAMP velocity, <b>so</b> that <b>the</b> temporal changes can be ignorable.

40|$|The current global {{agreement}} governing food aid—the Food Aid Convention (FAC) —will {{expire in}} 2007. It {{has come under}} heavy criticism as has the diffuse set of broader food aid governance institutions that has emerged in the last 50 years. These institutions are characterized by overlapping mandates, differing degrees of authority and legitimacy, varied levels of transparency in decisionmaking, and problematic representation of the major stakeholders. A number of issues are likely to arise {{during the course of}} negotiations over a new FAC. These include its objectives; the nature of commitments—whether to express them in tonnage, value, or nutritional terms; the level of commitments and their distribution among donor countries; monitoring and enforcement of commitments; representation on <b>the</b> <b>FAC</b> governing body among food aid donor- and recipient-country governments and civil society organizations; and the institutional “home” of <b>the</b> <b>FAC.</b> More specifically, there is debate over such questions as whether <b>the</b> new <b>FAC</b> should have an “instrument focus”—food aid—or a “problem focus” such as “food security” or “hunger. ” If the focus is on addressing hunger, should food aid under <b>the</b> <b>FAC</b> be restricted to emergencies only or should it pertain to broader food security issues? Should <b>the</b> <b>FAC</b> be a low-key forum for exchange of information or should it have some meaningful ways of monitoring commitments and encouraging compliance by both donors and recipients?
