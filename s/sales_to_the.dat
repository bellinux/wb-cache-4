5|$|According to Viacom CEO Philipe Dauman, {{one quarter}} of The Beatles: Rock Band {{inventory}} was sold during its first week of release, exceeding their expectations. Based on current sales projections, Dauman claimed that the Limited Edition Premium bundle of the game could be sold out by November. Dauman attributed some success of the game's <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> price reduction of the PlayStation 3, which occurred {{a few weeks before}} the release of The Beatles: Rock Band.|$|E

5|$|To {{fill the}} demand for other aircraft, {{especially}} smaller ones like the de Havilland Mosquito, the Air Ministry began looking at US manufacturers to supply the bombsight. Frederic Blin Vose of Sperry Gyroscope {{expressed an interest in}} the design and felt he could adapt the Mk. XIV to US production methods and have it in mass production rapidly. Sperry arranged for AC Spark Plug to take over manufacture, initially on a sub-contract basis and later for direct <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK.|$|E
5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to spread their network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the United States might try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police {{found no evidence of}} sexual abuse, but took the opportunity to collect customs duties and to attempt to clamp down on liquor <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

5|$|Lexus has {{not sold}} {{as well in}} Europe, where it suffers from smaller brand recognition, image, and a less-developed {{dealership}} network. In European markets, the Lexus LS has ranked behind Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW in flagship luxury car sales. Automotive analysts have suggested a possible rationale for the sales disparity, in that European buyers place less emphasis on vehicle reliability and have more brand loyalty to established domestic marques. In contrast, the Lexus LS has ranked second in <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mercedes-Benz S-Class (and ahead of rivals from BMW, Audi, and Jaguar) in markets outside Europe, such as South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Most Indonesians {{lived in}} fear and uncertainty, {{particularly}} {{a significant proportion of}} the population who supported the Dutch or who remained under Dutch control. The popular revolutionary cry 'Freedom or Death' was often interpreted to justify killings under claimed Republican authority. Traders were often in particularly difficult positions. On the one hand, they were pressured by Republicans to boycott all <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dutch; on the other hand, Dutch police could be merciless in their efforts to stamp out smugglers on which the Republican economy depended. In some areas, the term kedaulatan rakyat ('exercising the sovereignty of the people') – which is mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution and used by pemuda to demand pro-active policies from leaders – came to be used not only in the demanding of free goods, but also to justify extortion and robbery. Chinese merchants, in particular, were often forced to keep their goods at artificially low prices under threat of death.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{targeted}} a wider demographic profile {{with the}} first Nintendo DS (2004) than it had with the Game Boy line. Comparing 2008 life-to-date DS and DS Lite <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> best-selling game console, Sony's PlayStation 2, showed potential in further expanding the Nintendo DS gaming population—particularly in Europe and the United States. To further promote the product line while expanding its gaming population, Nintendo created the DSi. Iwata has said that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles, so to encourage each family member to buy an individual handheld, Nintendo added personalization features to the DSi.|$|E

50|$|After {{the success}} of BMW M {{products}} like BMW 3.0 CSL in racing venues and the growing market for high performance sports cars, M introduced cars for <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. The first official M-badged car for <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public was the M1, revealed at the Paris Motor Show in 1978. The M1, however, {{was more of a}} racecar in domestic trim than an everyday driver. The direction of the M cars changed with the 1979 release of the M535i, which was a high performance version of BMW’s popular 5 Series mid-size sedan.|$|R

5|$|Production of the {{left-hand}} drive European-spec i-MiEV began in October 2010. By {{the end of}} November 2010 cumulative production had reached 5,000 units at Mitsubitshi's Mizushima Plant. In May 2011 Mitsubishi announced a new production target of 25,000 i-MiEVs worldwide in fiscal year 2011. The carmaker also plans to export about 15,000 units overseas, mainly to Europe, where the company will promote <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European public sector, such as police departments and local governments. Production of the American-spec i electric car began in late October 2011. Since July 2009 Mitsubishi had manufactured more than 33,000 i-MiEVs and rebadge versions by March 2013, including more than 11,000 units rebadged in France as Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero, and sold in the European market.|$|E
5|$|Several Arabians, {{mostly of}} Polish breeding, were {{captured}} from Nazi Germany and imported to the U.S.A. following World War II. In 1957, two deaths in England {{led to more}} <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States: first from Crabbet Stud on the demise of Lady Wentworth, and then from Hanstead {{with the passing of}} Gladys Yule. As the tensions of the Cold War eased, more Arabians were imported to America from Poland and Egypt, and in the late 1970s, as political issues surrounding import regulations and the recognition of stud books were resolved, many Arabian horses were imported from Spain and Russia.|$|E

5|$|The Narragansett Pacer was {{the first}} horse breed {{developed}} in the United States, but is now extinct. It {{was developed in the}} United States during the 18th century and associated closely with the state of Rhode Island, and it had become extinct by the late 19th century. The Pacer was developed from a mix of English and Spanish breeds, although the exact cross is unknown, and they were known to and owned by many famous personages of the day, including George Washington. <b>Sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean and cross-breeding diminished the breed to the point of extinction, and the last known Pacer died around 1880.|$|E
5|$|In {{the debates}} {{leading up to}} World War I, a number of isolationist {{senators}} filibustered bills that Wilson considered important. The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months. Wilson and the bills' supporters requested that Marshall put a gag-order in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster. Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct arms <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> allies. Despite their victories, {{the small group of}} senators continued to lock up the senate to prevent any pro-war legislation from passing. In response, Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators. This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired. The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of all Senators, not only the ones voting.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposal}} of military {{equipment and materials}} was also a key priority {{after the end of}} the war. Equipment with civilian uses such as motor vehicles, clothing and housing were urgently needed to counter shortages in the civilian economy. The timing of equipment release had to be carefully planned, however, to avoid harming employment by creating surpluses of manufactured goods. Planning for the {{disposal of}} equipment began in 1943 and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission was established to oversee the sale or destruction of equipment on September 1944. Before the commission was established the Government decided that ex-military equipment would be offered to other government agencies before being made available to the public, that <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public were to be made on a 'as is, where is' basis and be processed through existing trade channels or public auction at 'fair market prices' and that payment was to be required in cash. Some special priorities were also established; farmers were to be given priority for motor vehicles, machine tools were to be allocated to ex-servicemen and training colleges and special consideration was to be given to the needs of the Red Cross and other overseas and domestic charitable associations.|$|E
