5|$|On October 8, 2005, at New Japan Pro Wrestling's (NJPW) Toukon Souzou New Chapter {{event in}} Tokyo, Japan, Brock Lesnar {{defeated}} Kazuyuki Fujita and Masahiro Chono in a Three Way {{match for the}} IWGP Heavyweight Championship. He held the title for 280 days, having three successful defenses, until he failed to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> scheduled title defense. NJPW thus stripped Lesnar of the championship on July 15, 2006. Lesnar cited visa issues along with NJPW owing him compensation for his reasons at failing to appear at the planned title defense. After this series of events, NJPW founder Antonio Inoki left NJPW and created a new promotion, the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF). Inoki then recognized Lesnar as the IWGP Heavyweight Champion due to Lesnar never having lost the championship in a match and Lesnar still maintaining physical possession of the title belt. NJPW recognized Lesnar as the IWGP 3rd Belt Champion and not the IWGP Heavyweight Champion, maintaining their stance on having stripped him of the title in 2006.|$|E

Club gave a glowing review, praising the Keith-Veronica dynamic, the conclusions to the story arcs, and the final sequence after it is revealed that Aaron is the murderer. [...] "It’s also an interesting choice to have the reveal come {{about two-thirds of the}} way through the episode, and have the episode end with a dramatic chase and fight scene. Veronica has so rarely been in direct personal danger that having Aaron Echolls chase and capture her, and having Keith <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brutal fight and rescue, is jarring.
