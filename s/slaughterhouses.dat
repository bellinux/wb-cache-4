5|$|The {{difficulty}} in purifying proteins {{in large quantities}} made them very difficult for early protein biochemists to study. Hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities, e.g., those of blood, egg white, various toxins, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from <b>slaughterhouses.</b> In the 1950s, the Armour Hot Dog Co. purified 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and made it freely available to scientists; this gesture helped ribonuclease A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{location}} of Aransas bay, shipping {{has always been a}} major industry. Following the Civil War, the meatpacking industry became a major source of income for ports on the bay, especially Rockport and Fulton, where numerous <b>slaughterhouses</b> were constructed. In the early years of meatpacking, cattle were slaughtered strictly for their hide since {{there was no way to}} refrigerate the meat. As a result, most of the left over cow parts not used as pig feed, were disposed in the bay. This changed in 1871, when an ice machine was installed in a packing plant. By this time, the meatpacking industry near Aransas Bay reached its prime. Prior to the decline of the industry in the area, in 1880, 93% of the beef from Texas <b>slaughterhouses</b> were processed in Rockport-Fulton. Along with fishing, oyster farming and most notably shrimping became major industries on the bay in the early 20th century. Shipbuilding also developed and reached its prime following the first World War. During World War II, the United States Navy took over several shipyards. In 1936, oil was discovered on the bay. By 1946, 13 wells were in operation. In 1990, 498,703 barrels were produced, part of the 77 million barrels produced between 1936 and 1990. Today, tourism is a prosperous industry. Numerous hotels are set up along the bay for individuals wanting to fish, bird or sight-see. A large concentration of hotels are located in Rockport, where the bay's only beach (Rockport Beach) is located.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} to meat was unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred {{for the quality}} of the meat and the Ardennais and closely related Auxois were considered to have some of the lowest quality meat. In addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French <b>slaughterhouses</b> were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse in prices then forced the National Stud to redirect its draft horse-related activities.|$|E
5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood {{strapped}} to the performers' bodies. Animal blood gathered from <b>slaughterhouses</b> was poured onto the floor to simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E

This trend reversed in 1983 when <b>slaughterhouse</b> worker wages fell below the average manufacturing wage. By 2002, <b>slaughterhouse</b> workers' wages were 24% below the average manufacturing wage.

30|$|I interviewed 20 {{people out}} of which we had 16 men who included: pastoralists, butchers, {{livestock}} buyers, veterinary officers, green offal cleaners, splitters, skinners, and those who slaughter the livestock at the <b>slaughterhouse.</b> I also managed to interview 4 women at the <b>slaughterhouse</b> among them were 2 veterinary officers, a single pastoralist woman and one butcher. The proportion of women was less because of their low rate of engagement in <b>slaughterhouse</b> operations as {{compared to that of}} men. This study collected qualitative data only and relied on convenient sampling in selecting informants. Literature on the actors and their roles, and the institutional settings and changes at the <b>slaughterhouse</b> was reviewed. Interviews using key informant interview guides were conducted with pastoralists, livestock buyers, butchers, veterinary officers and flayers as key stakeholders at the <b>slaughterhouse.</b> This elicited information on the specific objectives, establishing actors and their roles in pastoralism at the <b>slaughterhouse</b> and describing the institutional settings and changes in pastoralism. Another data collecting method used at the <b>slaughterhouse</b> was unstructured observations, to give insights into the design and the terrain of the <b>slaughterhouse</b> and the level of physical interactions eliciting economic and social relationships among actors and their roles.|$|R
5|$|Brick sewers {{had been}} built in London from the 17th century when {{sections}} of the Fleet and Walbrook rivers were covered for that purpose. In the century preceding 1856, over a hundred sewers were constructed in London, and at that date the city had around 200,000 cesspits and 360 sewers. Some cesspits leaked methane and other gases, which often caught fire and exploded, leading to loss of life, {{while many of the}} sewers were in a poor state of repair. During the early 19th century improvements had been undertaken in the supply of water to Londoners, and by 1858 many of the city's medieval wooden water pipes were being replaced with iron ones. This, combined with the introduction of flushing toilets and the rising of the city's population from just under one million to three million, led to more water being flushed into the sewers, along with the associated effluent. The outfalls from factories, <b>slaughterhouses</b> and other industrial activities put further strain on the already failing system. Much of this outflow either overflowed, or discharged directly, into the Thames.|$|E
5|$|Pilgrim {{numbers have}} greatly {{increased}} in recent years, {{which has led}} to numerous accidents and deaths due to overcrowding. The first major accident during Hajj in modern times occurred in 1990, when a tunnel stampede led to the death of 1,462 people. Afterwards, various crowd-control techniques were adopted to ensure safety. Because of large crowds, some of the rituals have become more symbolic. For example, it is no longer necessary to kiss the Black Stone. Instead, pilgrims simply point at it on each circuit around the Kaaba. Also, the large pillars used for pebble throwing were changed into long walls in 2004 with basins below to catch the stones. Another example is that animal sacrifice is now done at <b>slaughterhouses</b> appointed by the Saudi authorities, without the pilgrims being present there.|$|E

30|$|According to Fitzgerald (2010), the <b>slaughterhouse</b> is an {{institution}} where economic and geographic {{changes in the}} production of food, cultural attitudes towards killings, social changes in small communities and the changing sensibilities and relations between humans and livestock can be viewed. Juma (2015) similarly defines the <b>slaughterhouse</b> as a plant responsible for the slaughter of animals, and there are two types: the simple <b>slaughterhouse</b> that does very limited processing and the complex <b>slaughterhouse</b> that conducts extensive processing. Singh et al. (2014) regard a <b>slaughterhouse</b> as a facility where animals are butchered or killed for consumption as food products. In addition, Cook et al. (2017) view a <b>slaughterhouse</b> as a place where animals are slaughtered for food, mainly meat. GOK (2012) defines meat as any portion which is intended for human consumption, whether fresh, chilled or frozen or otherwise processed by any means whatsoever.|$|R
