5|$|Maximus' {{refusal to}} accept Monothelitism {{caused him to}} be brought to the {{imperial}} capital of Constantinople to be tried as a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he rejected as slander.|$|E
5|$|The Bebington Kop, simply {{referred}} to as the Kop, is a large single-tier, all-seater stand with a capacity of 5,696. Completed in 1995, it replaced the earlier open terrace (also called the Kop) which had <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> goal at the Bebington End. The Bebington Kop is also the biggest Kop stand in Non league football. Originally the Kop housed both home and away fans, split down the middle, and occasionally was handed entirely to the away fans. However, following the 2000 League Cup semi-final against Bolton, when the Kop was given entirely to the home fans, a campaign was begun to claim the Kop as a home end. From the 2000-01 season this became the case, with away fans housed in the Cowshed.|$|E
5|$|After the Liberation of Bulgaria and the {{establishment}} of the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia in 1878, Mutkurov settled in Eastern Rumelia, where he joined the provincial police or militia. He served first with the 1st Plovdiv Battalion and thereafter with the general staff. As an eminent man of arms in Eastern Rumelia, Mutkurov {{was one of the main}} leaders of the Bulgarian unification on 6 September 1885, the bloodless revolution that united the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. Mutkurov joined the Bulgarian Secret Revolutionary Central Committee which <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> unification. At the time a captain, along with Dimitar Rizov he was envoyed to the Bulgarian monarch Prince Alexander of Battenberg. The two were received by the prince in Shumen, where they notified him of the forthcoming events and requested his approval. The prince did not wish to be publicly involved in an anti-Ottoman revolution, and is unclear whether he at all believed a revolution was likely to break out in Eastern Rumelia so soon. During the revolution, Mutkurov commanded some of the troops that surrounded the residence of the provincial governor Gavril Krastevich and demanded his resignation.|$|E

5|$|In World War II, Southern Rhodesia again enthusiastically <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> UK, symbolically declaring war on Germany {{in support}} of Britain before any other colony or dominion. Over 26,000 Southern Rhodesians served in the Second World War, making the colony once more the largest {{contributor}} of manpower, proportional to white population, {{in all of the}} British Empire and Commonwealth. As in World War I, Southern Rhodesians were distributed in small groups throughout the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Dedicated Rhodesian platoons again served in the KRRC, and the Rhodesian African Rifles, raised in 1940, were in many ways a resurrection of the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Military aviation, already associated with the colony following the First World War, became a great Southern Rhodesian tradition during the Second, with the colony providing No. 44, No. 237 and No. 266 Squadrons and other personnel to the Royal Air Force, as well as training in Southern Rhodesia for 8,235 Allied airmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed over three {{days at the}} end of October and {{beginning}} of November 2002. It was supposed to take only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed their lines in front of a studio audience, the writing staff <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> cameras taking notes in the script and watching the audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped the cameras and added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed their lines properly.|$|E
5|$|The equestrians, {{the highest}} social class of all, served in mounted units known as equites. The first {{class of the}} richest {{citizens}} served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears (resembling hoplites), and provided {{the first line of}} the battle formation. The second class were armed similarly to the first class, but without a breastplate for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The second class stood immediately behind the first class when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The third and fourth classes were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> second class in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. The poorest of the propertied men of the city comprised the fifth class. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with slings and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.|$|E

The original timber church has also been demolished. St Paul's continues to function as the main church for the Parish of Proserpine.|$|E
25|$|The SPLC's {{identification}} and listings of hate groups and extremists {{has been the}} subject of controversy. Critics of the SPLC say that it chooses its causes with funding and donations in mind, and argue that people and groups designated as 'hate groups' are often targeted by protests that prevent them from speaking. The SPLC sometimes responds by reviewing its actions and removing people or organizations from hate listings, such as that of Ben Carson; however, it has <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> vast majority of its listings.|$|E

25|$|The French crown's {{increasing}} dominance {{over the}} Papacy {{culminated in the}} transference of the Holy See to Avignon in 1309. When the Pope returned to Rome in 1377, {{this led to the}} election of different popes in Avignon and Rome, resulting in the Papal Schism (1378–1417). The Schism divided Europe along political lines; while France, her ally Scotland and the Spanish kingdoms supported the Avignon Papacy, France's enemy England <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Pope in Rome, together with Portugal, Scandinavia and most of the German princes.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, the {{football}} team won the Lambert Cup, emblematic of supremacy in Eastern U.S. small-college football. That led to the team's first bowl invitation, to the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando, Florida, against Florida State University. But the Bulls {{would be allowed to}} participate only if backup defensive end Mike Wilson and starting halfback Willie Evans, who were black, did not play. The team <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> two, and refused the bowl offer; Buffalo did not receive another bowl invitation until the 2008 season when they won the MAC championship against previously undefeated Ball State.|$|E

An army barracks <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> pub, and for many years its soldiers were supplied with alcohol through a secret hole and passageway in the rear wall.

25|$|Creeling {{involved}} {{replacing the}} rovings bobbins {{in a section}} of the mule without stopping the mule. On very coarse counts a bobbin lasted two days but on fine count it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the creel. As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} Turkey had two {{competing}} governments in Constantinople and Ankara. The government in Constantinople supported the Turkish trials with {{more or less}} seriousness depending on the current government. While Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha (4 March - 2 October 1919 and again 5 April - 21 October 1920) <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> prosecuting body, the government of Grand Vizier Ali Riza Pasha (2 October 1919 - 2 March 1920) barely made a mention of the legal proceedings against the war criminals. The trials had also blurred the crime {{of participation in the}} Turkish National Movement with the crime of the Armenian Genocide, and ultimately resulted in increasing support for the government in Ankara that would be led later on by Atatürk.|$|E

25|$|Yet the dynasty rallied. Chinese {{generals and}} {{officials}} such as Zuo Zongtang led {{the suppression of}} rebellions and <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Manchus. When the Tongzhi Emperor came to the throne {{at the age of}} five in 1861, these officials rallied around him in what was called the Tongzhi Restoration. Their aim was to adopt western military technology in order to preserve Confucian values. Zeng Guofan, in alliance with Prince Gong, sponsored the rise of younger officials such as Li Hongzhang, who put the dynasty back on its feet financially and instituted the Self-Strengthening Movement. The reformers then proceeded with institutional reforms, including China's first unified ministry of foreign affairs, the Zongli Yamen; allowing foreign diplomats to reside in the capital; establishment of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service; the formation of modernized armies, such as the Beiyang Army, as well as a navy; and the purchase from Europeans of armament factories.|$|E
25|$|On 27 March 1986 {{the leading}} {{members of the}} Liverpool Labour Party were brought before the National Executive where their {{expulsion}} was being proposed. Heffer had accompanied Derek Hatton during his NEC hearing regarding the Liverpool District Labour Party. He joined a walk-out {{by members of the}} left which rendered the meeting inquorate. At later meetings he voted against expelling Militant members. His refusal to support those taking action against Militant led to Heffer losing his position on the Labour Party National Executive at the 1986 conference, a loss which Heffer took personally, and indicated the changed nature of the Labour Party, which Heffer anticipated in his letter to Whitty in 1986. The 47 Labour councillors who <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> deficit budget strategy were removed from office in 1987 and surcharged £106,000, with costs of £242,000, which they raised through donations from the trade unions and Labour Party members.|$|E
25|$|In early Christianity, the {{practice}} of praying towards the east {{did not result in}} uniformity in the orientation of the buildings in which Christians worshipped and did not mean that the priest necessarily faced away from the congregation, the meaning today commonly attached to the phrase ad orientem. The earliest churches in Rome had a façade to the east and an apse with the altar to the west; the priest celebrating Mass <b>stood</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> altar, facing east and so towards the people. According to Louis Bouyer, not only the priest but also the congregation faced east at prayer, a view strongly criticized {{on the grounds of the}} unlikelihood that, in churches where the altar was to the west, they would turn their backs on the altar (and the priest) at the celebration of the Eucharist. The view prevails therefore that the priest, facing east, would celebrate ad populum in some churches, in others not, in accordance with the churches' architecture.|$|E
