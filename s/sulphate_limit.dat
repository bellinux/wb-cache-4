These, however, are the subject of a number of constraints including, importantly, the capability to remove reduced sulphates from the treated stream and thus linearize the removal of sulphur compounds from the system. The removal of sulphide from acid mine drainage (AMD) treated effluent particularly in passive treatment has been a subject of interest at Golder Associates Africa (GAA). The results of these studies indicated that biological sulphide oxidation has potential for the removal of sulphide from passive AMD treatment systems (Molwantwa et al., 2007) such as integrated managed passive (IMPI) treatment systems. As an output of these studies, the linear flow channel reactor (LFCR) was developed and operated under controlled conditions.

Quantification of the dominant secondary metabolites from D. orbita is described, followed by a comparison of solvent extraction procedures and stability studies. The intra- and inter-day relative standard deviation (RSD) for tyrindoxyl sulphate was 0. 46 % and 0. 17 %, respectively. The quantification was linear for standards murexine, 6 -bromoisatin, and tyrindoxyl <b>sulphate.</b> The <b>limits</b> of detection were 0. 03, 0. 004, and 0. 07 mg/mL, respectively, and the limits of quantification were 0. 09, 0. 01, and 0. 22 mg/mL, respectively.

The reactor was initially operated at a SRT of 2. 6 days and loaded with hydrogen in excess while <b>sulphate</b> was <b>limiting</b> (H 2 /SO 4 ratio= 12. 6). Sulphate reduction, methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis occurred simultaneously. The sulphide formation rate attained a stable level of approximately 3 gCOD l− 1 day− 1; the methane and acetate formation rates increased from 2. 4 and 0. 5 gCOD l− 1 day− 1 to 3. 6 and 3. 1 gCOD l− 1 day− 1 in 9 days, respectively. When sulphate was in excess (H 2 /SO 4 ratio= 1. 9 – 4), SRB outcompeted MA and HB for H 2, independently of the applied SRT (2. 6 and 19. 8 days). However, the change from sulphate limitation to excess of sulphate resulted in a rapid drop of methanogenic activity at a SRT of 2. 6 days: methane production fell from 3. 6 to 0. 2 gCOD l− 1 day− 1 in 5 days. At a SRT of 19. 8 days, MA were outcompeted much more slowly: the methane production decreased from 1. 5 to 0. 1 gCOD l− 1 day− 1 in 40 days.

After removing the extraplasmatic Fe pool, half of the plants of each treatment (+S and -S) were transferred to a new Fe-free NS. Roots were collected 4 and 24 h from the beginning of Fe deprivation. Fe deprivation slightly increased root thiols content in both nutritive conditions (+S and -S). ATP sulphurylase activity was enhanced by sulphur deprivation, but greatly depressed when Fe and S were both omitted from the nutrient solution. O-Acetylserine sulphydrylase activity was also enhanced by S deprivation; this activity was increased by Fe starvation in +S plants, while it was unaffected by Fe nutrition in -S plants. S deprivation greatly increased uptake rates of (SO 42 -) -S- 35 (1. 9 +/- 0. 1 vs. 5. 2 +/- 0. 2 mumol g(- 1) root d. w. h(- 1)); furthermore, Fe deficiency increased (SO 42 -) -S- 35 uptake rates by 11 and 55 % in +S and -S plants, respectively.

40|$|The use of {{low quality}} fuels in power {{generation}} is typically motivated by a potential reduction in fuel costs or CO 2 emissions, the latter in case the fuel is based on biomass. These features make low quality fuels attractive {{at the same time}} as such fuels are usually problematic to use {{in power generation}} due to their fuel composition. One of the main issues is high temperature corrosion (HTC), caused by alkali containing chlorides and sulphates. The alkali chlorides are particularly problematic and these are formed from the alkali metals and chlorine when released during the combustion process. These chlorides form salts which are deposited on surfaces at relatively low temperatures, typically in the range 500 - 600 °C. The HTC problem is often related to combustion of biomass and it has a significant effect on the achievable thermal efficiency and/or maintenance cost of the power plant. However, when sulphur is present, the alkali metals may form sulphates instead of chlorides. Sulphate salts are typically less corrosive and are deposited at higher temperatures and the negative impact on the thermal efficiency is therefore less pronounced. The sulphur content in biomass is typically low compared to the content of alkali metals and chlorine. Therefore, sulphur has to be added if alkali sulphation should be significant. One option is to blend the biomass with another fuel with higher sulphur content, typically coal. In this way, co-combustion can increase the thermal efficiency of power plants using biomass and at the same time lower the use of fossil fuels. However, the current understanding of the chemistry related to the formation of alkali chlorides and <b>sulphates</b> is <b>limited</b> and needs to be improved for a better control of the HTC process when using low quality fuels for power generation, both in todays’ air-fired boilers as well as for future boiler technologies such as oxy-combustion...|$|R
40|$|The {{release of}} methane into the {{atmosphere}} through destabilization of clathrates is a positive feedback mechanism capable of amplifying global warming trends that may have operated {{several times in the}} geological past. Such methane release is a hypothesized cause or amplifier {{for one of the most}} drastic global warming events in Earth history, the end of the Marinoan ‘snowball Earth’ ice age, ~ 635 [*]Myr ago. A key piece of evidence supporting this hypothesis is the occurrence of exceptionally depleted carbon isotope signatures (δ^(13) C_(PDB) down to − 48 ‰; in post-glacial cap dolostones (that is, dolostone overlying glacial deposits) from south China; these signatures have been interpreted as products of methane oxidation at the time of deposition. Here we show, on the basis of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry, ^(87) Sr/^(86) Sr isotope ratios, trace element content and clay mineral evidence, that carbonates bearing the ^(13) C-depleted signatures crystallized more than 1. 6 [*]Myr after deposition of the cap dolostone. Our results indicate that highly ^(13) C-depleted carbonate cements grew from hydrothermal fluids and suggest that their carbon isotope signatures are a consequence of thermogenic methane oxidation at depth. This finding not only negates carbon isotope evidence for methane release during Marinoan deglaciation in south China, but also eliminates the only known occurrence of a Precambrian sedimentary carbonate with highly ^(13) C-depleted signatures related to methane oxidation in a seep environment. We propose that the capacity to form highly ^(13) C-depleted seep carbonates, through biogenic anaeorobic oxidation of methane using <b>sulphate,</b> was <b>limited</b> in the Precambrian period by low sulphate concentrations in sea water.

Materials and Methods: Analyses were performed using drug- free biological fluids (whole blood and urine). Specimens were spiked with chromatographically pure glimepiride. After hydrolysis with diluted hydrochloric acid at 50 - 60 °C for 15 - 20 min and a double extraction into chloroform, glimepiride was identified by thin-layer chromatography. Standard solution of glimepiride (1 mg/mL) and Sorbfil chromatographic plates were used for thin-layer chromatography. The thin-layer chromatography studies showed that the best mobile phase was chloroform:acetone (9 : 1), Rf value of glimepiride in five examinations was 0. 37 ± 0. 02. Visualization of glimepiride was achieved byspraying with Dragendorff’s, Bushard’s, or diphenylcarbazone-chloroform solution followed by mercuric <b>sulphate.</b> The <b>limit</b> of detection of pure glimepiride by thin-layer chromatography was 0. 5 p/mL, 1. 5 p g/mL in whole blood and 1. 0 p g/mL in urine.

However, the process of sulphate respiration is still incompletely understood. Several mechanisms of energy conservation have been proposed, but {{it is unclear how}} the different strategies contribute to the overall process. In order to obtain a deeper insight into the energy metabolism of sulphate-reducers whole-genome microarrays were used to compare the transcriptional response of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough grown with hydrogen/sulphate, pyruvate/sulphate, pyruvate with <b>limiting</b> <b>sulphate,</b> and lactate/thiosulphate, relative to growth in lactate/sulphate. Growth with hydrogen/sulphate showed the largest number of differentially expressed genes and the largest changes in transcript levels. In this condition the most up-regulated energy metabolism genes were those coding for the periplasmic [NiFeSe] hydrogenase, followed by the Ech hydrogenase. The results also provide evidence for the involvement of formate cycling and the recently proposed ethanol pathway during growth in hydrogen. The pathway involving CO cycling is relevant during growth on lactate and pyruvate, but not during growth in hydrogen as the most down-regulated genes were those coding for the CO-induced hydrogenase. Growth on lactate/thiosulphate reveals a down-regulation of several energy metabolism genes similar to what was observed in the presence of nitrite.

40|$|Microspore {{embryogenesis}} (ME) is {{a process}} in which the gametophytic pollen programme of the microspore is reorientated towards a new embryo sporophytic programme. This process requires a stress treatment, usually performed in the anther or isolated microspores for several days. Despite the universal use of stress to induce ME, very few studies have addressed the physiological processes that occur in the anther during this step. To further understand the processes triggered by stress treatment, we followed the response of anthers by measuring the expression of stress-related genes in two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars differing in their ME response. Genes encoding enzymes involved in oxidative stress (glutathione-S-transferase, GST; oxalate oxidase, OxO), in the synthesis of jasmonic acid (13 -lipoxygenase, Lox; allene oxide cyclase, AOC; allene oxide synthase, AOS) and in the phenylpropanoid pathway (phenylalanine ammonia lyase, PAL), as well as those encoding PR proteins (Barwin, chitinase 2 b, Chit 2 b; glucanase, Gluc; basic pathogenesis-related protein 1, PR 1; pathogenesis-related protein 10, PR 10) were up-regulated in whole anthers upon stress treatment, indicating that anther perceives stress and reacts by triggering general plant defence mechanisms. In particular, both OxO and Chit 2 b genes are good markers of anther reactivity owing to their high level of induction during the stress treatment.

40|$|Sulphate (SO 42 -) {{reduction}} {{rates are}} generally low in freshwater wetlands and are {{regulated by the}} scarce availability of the ion. Increased concentrations of this electron acceptor due to sulphur (S) pollution of groundwater and surface water may, however, lead to high sulphate reduction rates now regulated by the availability of appropriate electron donors. Due to variations in this availability, the response to S pollution (e. g. from surface water or groundwater) is expected to differ between soils. This hypothesis was tested in laboratory mesocosm experiments by comparing two wetland soil types with distinctly different humus profiles: a Hydromoder and a Rhizomull type. In the first type, {{expected to have a}} higher availability of degradable soilorganic matter (SOM), sulphate availability appeared to be rate <b>limiting</b> for <b>sulphate</b> reduction.

These differences in response could not, however, be attributed to differences in the various SOM fractions or in SOM densities. Eutrophication and free sulphide accumulation, two major biogeochemical problems caused by sulphate pollution, occurred in both types. The absolute extent of phosphorus mobilisation was determined by the concentration of this element in the soil (C/P ratio), while the level of sulphide accumulation was governed by the concentration of dissolved iron in the pore water. It was therefore concluded that neither the humus profile nor the concentrations of different SOM fractions in the soils are reliable indicators for the sensitivity of wetland types to S pollution...|$|R

This was {{with a view to}} establishing the capabilities of local strains of microorganisms on utilizing renewable and locally available substrates in polyhydroxybutyrate production. This involved hydrolysis of starch extracted from freshly harvested cassava tubers using enzyme-enzyme method of hydrolysis, followed by aerobic fermentation of Pseudomonas fluorescens on a mixture of the hydrolysate and nutrient media in a fermentor in batch cultures. The reducing sugar hydrolysate served as the carbon source and di-ammonium <b>sulphate</b> as the <b>limiting</b> nutrient. The reaction temperature, pH and agitation rate in the fermentor were maintained at 30 oC, 7. 5 and 400 rpm respectively. The biomass growth was measured by cell dry weight and the polyhydroxybutyrate content measured by gas chromatography. When the fermentation process was shut down after 84 hour, the substrate consumption by the organism was 9. 2 g/L to give a dry cell weight of 1. 75 g/L resulting in a biomass yield on substrate (Yx/s) of 0. 1902 g/g (19. 02 % wt/wt).

40|$|Barite {{mineralization}} {{in association}} with calcitic speleothem precipitates in cave structures in Silurian Aeronian carbonate rocks in Kalana quarry, Central Estonia, was studied. Barite mineralization in Kalana occurs in two generations – euhedral bladed-tabular barite zonal crystals from a few to 10  cm in size, growing on the limestone-dolomite wall-rock (generation I), and sparsely placed thin tabular crystals a few millimetres thick and up to 1  cm in size, growing on calcitic crusts (generation II). The barite crystals of generation I are frequently found embedded by paragenetically later calcitic botryoidal crusts. The Sr and S isotopic composition of barite crystals shows a trend of increasing Sr isotope ratios (from 0. 7114 to 0. 7120) and δ 34 S values (from 13 ‰ to 33 ‰) from the central parts towards the edges of zonal crystals. This suggests barite precipitation by mixing of two endmember fluids at varying ratios during barite formation: warm (up to 70  °C) reducing fluid bearing Ba, characterized by an elevated radiogenic Sr- and 34 S-enriched isotopic signal, and a cooler ambient fluid bearing an isotopically lighter dissolved sulphate, characterized by lower Sr isotope ratios. The excess of radiogenic 87 Sr in barite compared to Phanerozoic seawater values suggests Sr derived from a continental source, whereas sulphate was derived either from oxidized H 2 S or a modified seawater source. Gradual increase in δ 34 S values towards the outer zones could also indicate the 34 S enrichment due to bacterial sulphate reduction, {{even though there is}} no paired 34 S and 18 O enrichment of sulphate, characteristic of bacterial reworking.

Disposal of this wastewater into water courses is not recommended and yet is performed all over the world. Investigation of this wastewater found that there was a high concentration of sulphate which, in the presence of sulphate-reducing prokaryotes can cause sulphide corrosion of cement. The concentration of sulphate in the wastewater was approximately 2770 mg/L. It was also found that the wastewater pH was very low and discharge of the wastewater into the wastewater treatment works caused a negative impact on the overall quality of the final wastewater discharged to sea. It was found using FISH techniques that there were no sulphate-reducing prokaryotes present in the wastewaters but that a sulphate-reducing population existed on the sewer wall. An anaerobic contact process was designed to treat this wastewater targeting sulphate reduction to sulphide, to be converted into elemental sulphur and to increase the wastewater pH. The process did not achieve this aim and only approximately 20 - 30 % reduction in sulphate from the wastewater was achieved with little to no change in the pH. A 95 % reduction in sulphate concentration was needed in order to reach acceptable discharge <b>limits.</b> <b>Sulphate</b> reduction could not be carried out, even under ideal laboratory conditions. It was found that the barrier causing the digester failure was the high concentration of phenols present in the wastewater (3. 3 g/L) together with the production of high concentrations of volatile fatty acids (on average 13 g acetic/L).

40|$|Multiple sulphur (S) isotope ratios are {{powerful}} proxies {{to understand the}} complexity of S biogeochemical cycling through Deep Time. The disappearance of a sulphur mass independent fractionation (S-MIF) signal in rocks <~ 2. 4 Ga {{has been used to}} date a dramatic rise in atmospheric oxygen levels. However, intricacies of the S-cycle before the Great Oxidation Event remain poorly understood. For example, the isotope composition of coeval atmospherically derived sulphur species is still debated. Furthermore, variation in Archaean pyrite δ 34 S values has been widely attributed to microbial sulphate reduction (MSR). While petrographic evidence for Archaean early diagenetic pyrite formation is common, textural evidence for the presence and distribution of MSR remains enigmatic. We combined detailed petrographic and in-situ, high-resolution multiple S-isotope studies (δ 34 S and Δ 33 S) using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to document the S-isotope signatures of exceptionally well-preserved, pyritised microbialites in shales from the ~ 2. 65 Ga Lokammona Formation, Ghaap Group, South Africa. The presence of MSR in this Neoarchaean microbial mat is supported by typical biogenic textures including wavy crinkled laminae, and early-diagenetic pyrite containing < 26 ‰ μm-scale variations in δ 34 S and Δ 33 S = - 0. 21 ± 0. 65 ‰ (± 1 σ). These large variations in δ 34 S values suggest Rayleigh distillation of a <b>limited</b> <b>sulphate</b> pool during high rates of MSR.

We propose that the S-MIF signature of this secondary pyrite does not reflect contemporaneous atmospheric processes at the time of deposition; instead, it formed by the influx of later stage sulphur-bearing fluids containing an inherited atmospheric S-MIF signal and/or from magnetic isotope effects during thermochemical sulphate reduction.

Addition of acetate, lactate, propionate, butyrate, hydrogen and glutamate/serine (20 mM) to replicate slurries from each site resulted in stimulation of the corresponding population of sulphate-reducing bacteria and the in situ rates of sulphate reduction. The metabolism of the added substrates and changes in bacterial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were quantified. With the exception of acetate and hydrogen, added substrates were incompletely oxidised, producing a mixture of further substrates, which predominantly were sequentially oxidised, and resulted in the stimulation of a mixed population of sulphate-reducing bacteria. There were {{significant changes in the}} PLFA of slurries with added substrate compared to controls. Acetate was completely removed at all sites and the small increase in even chain PLFA together with the absence of stimulation of any other biomarker, indicated that acetate was oxidised by sulphate-reducing bacteria distinctly different from those using other substrates. A biomarker for Desulfobacter, 10 Methyl 16 : 0, was not stimulated in any of the acetate slurries or in slurries where acetate was produced. Biomarkers for the propionate utilizing Desulfobulbus sp (17 : 1 w 6, 15 : 1 w 6) were always stimulated in propionate slurries and also in lactate slurries, where partial lactate fermentation produced propionate and acetate. In lactate and glutamate / serine slurries from the Tay estuary and lactate and hydrogen slurries from Loch Etive the biomarker for Desulfovibrio sp (i 17 : 1 w 7) as well as those for Desulfobulbus were stimulated. This provides direct evidence for the significance of Desulfovibrio sp. within sediment slurries and demonstrates the competitive interaction between members of this genus and Desulfobulbus sp. for lactate, hydrogen and amino acid metabolism. At the estuarine site, <b>sulphate</b> reduction was <b>limited</b> at higher <b>sulphate</b> concentrations (about 3. 5 mM) than the Sea Loch sites (< 2 mM) and this had a significant effect on propionate and butyrate metabolism, as well as on methane production. These results demonstrate that although the sulphate-reducing bacterial population at each site could metabolise identical substrates, the types of sulphate-reducing bacteria involved and their sulphate thresholds were characteristically different...|$|R

As nitrogen dynamics in forest soils are complex and poorly understood, for simplicity and to allow comparison among lakes and their catchments, CLs (A) for both lakes and forest soils were calculated assuming that nitrate leaching from catchments will not change over time (i. e. a best case scenario). In addition, because soils {{in the region are}} shallow, base cation weathering rates for the representative sub-catchments were calculated for the entire soil profile and these estimates were also used to calculate critical loads for the lakes. These results were compared with critical loads obtained by the Steady State Water Chemistry (SSWC) model. Using the SSWC model, critical loads for lakes were between 7 and 19 meq m - 2 yr - 1 higher than those obtained from soil measurements. Lakes and forests are much more sensitive to acid deposition if forests are harvested, but two acid-sensitive lakes had much lower critical loads than their respective forested sub-catchments implying that acceptable acid deposition levels should be dictated by the most acid-sensitive lakes in the region. Under conditions that assume harvesting, the CL (A) is exceeded at two of the three lakes and five of the six sub-catchments assessed in this study. However, sulphate export from catchments greatly exceeds input in bulk deposition and, to prevent lakes from falling below the critical chemical <b>limit,</b> <b>sulphate</b> inputs to lakes must be reduced by between 37 % and 92 % if forests are harvested. Similarly, sulphate leaching from forested catchments that are harvested must be reduced by between 16 and 79 % to prevent the ANC of water draining the rooting zone from falling below 0 ?eq l - 1. These calculations assume that extremely low calcium leaching losses (9 ? 27 ?eq l - 1) from forest soils can be maintained without any decrease in forest productivity. Calcium concentrations in the three lakes have decreased by between ? 10 and 25 % over the past 20 years and calculations assume that calcium concentrations in lakes can fall to around 30 % of their current values without any harmful effects on biota. Both these assumptions require urgent investigation. Keywords: acid deposition, calcium, critical loads, forests, harvesting, lakes</p...|$|R
