40|$|In {{this article}} we report the results on over 750 linear {{regressions}} based on a <b>single</b> <b>descriptor,</b> using some twenty molecular properties of alkanes and some forty distinct molecular descriptors. It is shown that, among the numerous descriptors, less than a dozen descriptors outperform all the others. Hence, while the search for graph invariants has been fruitful, few of the constructed descriptors show sufficiently novel characteristics and have displayed sufficiently different behavior in correlations with physico-chemical properties. At the same time, we find that some properties {{are more susceptible to}} a successful single-descriptor regression analysis, while few properties remain difficult to characterize by a <b>single</b> <b>descriptor.</b> At the end of this report, we have listed a few challenges to be considered by those involved in structure-property-activity studies. We have drawn attention to some properties of alkanes (octanes in particular) for which better regression results are warranted. We also recommend that the performance of novel indices be compared with the known results, like those reported here. If a novel index shows a better behavior with respect to any of the properties already reported in the literature, they certainly deserve publicity. If an index shows a performance comparable to some existing descriptors, they ought to have other advantages in order to replace the existing descriptors. The burden of »proof« ought to be on the »inventor« of a novel topological index. Vague statements that an index may show promise in structure-property studies ought {{to be replaced by a}} comparative study, such as shown here for octanes. While the present paper answers the questions which are the best single simple descriptors for correlations of octane physico-chemical properties, our restriction to the use of a <b>single</b> <b>descriptor</b> in structure-property correlations neither signifies that we expect all properties to be well represented by simple regressions, nor that the best single descriptors will necessarily remain the dominant descriptor in multiple regression analysis...|$|E

40|$|The local {{descriptors}} {{have been}} the backbone {{of most of the}} computer vision problems. Most of the existing local descriptors are generated over the raw input images. In order to increase the discriminative power of the local descriptors, some researchers converted the raw image into multiple images with the help some high and low pass frequency filters, then the local descriptors are computed over each filtered image and finally concatenated into a <b>single</b> <b>descriptor.</b> By doing so, these approaches do not utilize the inter frequency relationship which causes the less improvement in the discriminative power of the descriptor that could be achieved. In this paper, this problem is solved by utilizing the decoder concept of multi-channel decoded local binary pattern over the multi-frequency patterns.

In the past, many descriptors have been proposed which aid object categorization even in such adverse conditions. Each descriptor has its own merits and de-merits. Some descriptors are invariant to transformations while the others are more discriminative. Past research has shown that, employing multiple descriptors rather than any <b>single</b> <b>descriptor</b> leads to better recognition. The problem of learning the optimal combination of the available descriptors for a particular classification task is studied. Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework has been developed for learning an optimal combination of descriptors for object categorization. Existing MKL formulations often employ block l- 1 norm regularization which is equivalent to selecting a single kernel from a library of kernels. Since essentially a <b>single</b> <b>descriptor</b> is selected, the existing formulations maybe sub- optimal for object categorization. A MKL formulation based on block l-infinity norm regularization has been developed, which chooses an optimal combination of kernels as opposed to selecting a single kernel. A Composite Multiple Kernel Learning(CKL) formulation based on mixed l-infinity and l- 1 norm regularization has been developed. These formulations end in Second Order Cone Programs(SOCP). Other efficient alter- native algorithms for these formulation have been implemented. Empirical results on benchmark datasets show significant improvement using these new MKL formulations...|$|E

Systems built this way are able to return images that are globally similar to the query image, but can not return images that contain some of the objects {{that are in the}} query. As opposed to this traditional coarse-grain recognition scheme, recent advances in image processing make fine-grain image recognition possible, notably by computing local descriptors that can detect similar objects in different images.

Potential contributing factors concerning the low reproducibility of CFAE-guided ablation outcomes in persAF therapy have been explored, such as inconsistencies in automated CFAE classification performed by different systems, the co-existence {{of different types}} of atrial electrograms (AEGs), and insufficient AEG duration for CFAE detection. First, we show that CFAE classification may vary for the same individual, depending on the system being used and settings being applied. Revised thresholds are suggested for the indices calculated by each system to minimize the differences in CFAE detection performed independently by them. Second, our results show that some AEGs are affected by stepwise persAF ablation, while others remain unaffected by it. Different types of AEGs might correlate with distinct underlying persAF mechanisms. <b>Single</b> <b>descriptors</b> measured from the AEGs, such as sample entropy and dominant frequency, were not able to discriminate the different types of AEGs individually, but multivariate analysis using multiple descriptors measured from the AEGs can effectively discriminate the different types of AEGs.

40|$|Deep {{learning}} {{is well known}} as a method to extract hierarchical representations of data. This method has been widely implemented in many fields, including image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Over the past decade, deep learning has made a great progress in solving face recognition problems due to its effectiveness. In this thesis a novel deep learning multilayer hierarchy based methodology, named Local Binary Pattern Network (LBPNet), is proposed. Unlike the shallow LBP method, LBPNet performs multi-scale analysis and gains high-level representations from low-level overlapped features in a systematic manner. The LBPNet deep learning network is generated by retaining the topology of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and replacing its trainable kernel with the off-the-shelf computer vision descriptor, the LBP descriptor. This enables LBPNet to achieve a high recognition accuracy without requiring costly model learning approach on massive data. LBPNet progressively extracts features from input images from test and training data through multiple processing layers, pairwisely measures the similarity of extracted features in regional level, and then performs the classification based on the aggregated similarity values. Through extensive numerical experiments using the popular benchmarks (i. e., FERET, LFW and YTF), LBPNet has shown the promising results. Its results out-perform (on FERET) or are comparable (on LFW and FERET) to other methods in the same categories, which are <b>single</b> <b>descriptor</b> based unsupervised learning methods on FERET and LFW, and <b>single</b> <b>descriptor</b> based supervise learning methods with image-restricted no outside data settings on LFW and YTF, respectively.

To this end we use a model-based detector of gene expression periodicity to divide genes into classes depending on their behavior in experiments using different synchronization methods. While computational inference of gene regulatory circuits typically relies on expression similarity (clustering) in order to find classes of potentially co-regulated genes, this method instead takes advantage of known time profile signatures related to the studied process. Results We explain the regulatory mechanisms of the inferred periodic classes with cis -regulatory descriptors that combine upstream sequence motifs with experimentally determined binding of transcription factors. By systematic statistical analysis we show that periodic classes are best explained by combinations of <b>descriptors</b> rather than <b>single</b> <b>descriptors,</b> and that different combinations correspond to periodic expression in different classes. We also find evidence for additive regulation in that the combinations of cis -regulatory descriptors associated with genes periodically expressed in fewer conditions are frequently subsets of combinations associated with genes periodically expression in more conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach retrieves combinations that are more specific towards known cell-cycle related regulators than the frequently used clustering approach. Conclusion The results illustrate how a model-based approach to expression analysis may be particularly well suited to detect biologically relevant mechanisms. Our new approach makes it possible to provide more refined hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms of the cell cycle and it can easily be adjusted to reveal regulation of other, non-periodic, cellular processes. </p...|$|R
