40|$|Removal {{of plates}} is a {{procedure}} commonly performed by orthopaedic surgeons and <b>stripped</b> <b>screws</b> {{are probably the}} most common problem encountered during this procedure. <b>Stripped</b> <b>screws</b> are caused by slippage between the screwdriver and the screw. Due to the inherent difficulty in removing such screws, surgeons should be knowledgeable in techniques for their removal and should be equipped with the proper instruments to expedite the procedure. There are few published articles about such techniques. This report describes a technique for removal of plates with <b>stripped</b> <b>screws.</b> The tip of a <b>stripped</b> <b>screw</b> is approached from the far cortex and then reamed with a trephine reamer {{in the direction of the}} screw until both cortices are cleared. The plate is then removed with <b>stripped</b> <b>screws</b> attached. All the removals utilizing this technique to date have been successful with no complications, and this method is safe, efficient and technically easy to learn...|$|R
30|$|Several {{steps were}} taken to help {{maintain}} uniformity of the tested constructs and strengthen {{the validity of the}} data. Non-locked screws have the potential to lose fixation during implantation by stripping out. A pilot study was thus performed to evaluate the torque at which peripheral non-locked <b>screws</b> <b>stripped</b> (documented as a sharp drop in measured torque) within the bone model and lost fixation. All of the peripheral non-locked screws were then implanted within the torque limits observed, ensuring that each screw placed provided similar fixation. Additionally, the orientation of the baseplate was controlled such that the screw orientation remained constant, preventing variability in rigidity based on the orientation of the locked and non-locked screws. Finally, the central screw baseplates were implanted with an identical maximum torque to ensure that uniform compression was achieved with each tested model.|$|R

40|$|AB Objectives: Bone rivets were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} method to fasten plates during internal fixation of fractures when screw anchorage may be inadequate. This study examined whether such rivets allow proper fracture healing without eliciting adverse bone remodelling and whether they can be removed safely. Methods: A proximal diaphyseal fracture of the tibia was stabilized with a conventional plate (low-contact dynamic compression plate, Synthes) in 10 sheep. The distal fragment was anchored using bicortical screws, and the proximal fragment (1 - 2. 5 mm thick cortex) with 3 rivets following <b>screw</b> <b>stripping.</b> Postoperative care included immediate weight bearing and biweekly radiographs. After 12 weeks, implants were removed from 6 sheep and the tibial strength measured. Tibiae with empty and filled rivet holes (at 12 and 24 weeks) were examined histologically. Results: In all sheep, secondary bone healing was observed without length and angulation deformities. All fracture gaps were bridged and filled with new bone. The average torsional strength after 12 weeks was 75 +/- 11 % of the intact tibia (mean +/- SD), and failure never occurred through an empty rivet hole. After 12 weeks, there was intensive cortical remodelling at the rivets correlating with slight to moderate nonprogressive periosteal radiolucency around 55 % of the rivets. However, there was also endosteal appositional bone growth at 85 % of the rivets. There was no observable macroscopic or microscopic osseous damage after implant removal. After 24 weeks, remodelling activity had decreased and was noted only sporadically. Conclusions: In this study, the efficacy of bone rivets for the internal fixation of a fracture with plates, where anchorage of screws may be difficult and/or insufficient, was demonstrated...|$|R

Licensed under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] analysis of bone is an innovative technique that uses sequential image data to analyze bone mechanics under a given loading regime. This paper presents {{the development of a}} novel device capable of performing step-wise screw insertion into excised bone specimens, within the microCT environment, whilst simultaneously recording insertion torque, compression under the screw head and rotation angle. The system is computer controlled and screw insertion is performed in incremental steps of insertion torque. A series of screw insertion tests to failure were performed (n= 21) to establish a relationship between the torque at head contact and stripping torque (R 2 = 0. 89). The test-device was then used to perform step-wise screw insertion, stopping at intervals of 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % between screw head contact and <b>screw</b> <b>stripping.</b> Image data-sets were acquired at each of these time-points as well as at head contact and post-failure. Examination of the image data revealed the trabecular deformation as a result of increased insertion torque was restricted to within 1 mm of the outer diameter of the screw thread. Minimal deformation occurred prior to the step between the 80 % time-point and post-failure. The device presented has allowed, for the first time, visualization of the micro-mechanical response in the peri-implant bone with increased tightening torque. Further testing on more samples is expected to increase our understanding of the effects of increased tightening torque at the micro-structural level, and the failure mechanisms of trabeculae...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{level to}} which bone screws are {{tightened}} is determined subjectively by the operating surgeon. It {{is likely that}} the tactile feedback that surgeons rely on is based on localized tissue yielding, which may predispose the screw–bone interface to failure. A limited number of studies have investigated the ratio between clinical tightening torque and stripping torque. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure, for the first time, the ratio between yield torque (Tyield) and stripping torque (Tmax) during screw insertion into the cancellous bone and to compare these torques with clinical levels of tightening reported in the literature. Additionally, a rotational limit was investigated as a potential end point for screw insertion in cancellous bone. Methods: A 6. 5 -mm outer diameter commercial cancellous bone screw was inserted into human femoral head specimens (n = 89). Screws were inserted to failure, while recording insertion torque, compression under the screw head, and rotation angle. Results: The median, interquartile ranges, and coefficient of variation were calculated for each of the following parameters: Tyield, Tmax, Tyield/Tmax, slope, Tplateau, and rotation angle. The median ratio of Tyield/Tmax and rotation angle was 85. 45 % and 96. 5 degrees, respectively. The coefficient of variation was greatest for the rotation angle compared with the ratio of Tyield/Tmax (0. 37 vs. 0. 12). Conclusions: The detection of yield may be a more precise method than the rotation angle in cancellous bone; however, bone–screw constructs that exhibit a Tyield close to Tmax may be more susceptible to stripping during insertion. Future work can identify factors that influence the ratio of Tyield/Tmax may help to reduce the incidence of <b>screw</b> <b>stripping.</b> Melissa K. Ryan, Aaron A. Mohtar, John J.

40|$|The {{removal of}} nonretrievable implant {{components}} represents {{a challenge in}} implant dentistry. The mechanical approach involves the risk of damaging the implant connection or the bone-to-implant interface. This case report describes a cryo-mechanical approach for the safe removal of a nonretrievable implant component. A patient had an implant surgically placed in a private practice. When the patient returned to the restorative dentist to make a definitive impression, the healing abutment could not be loosened. The patient was referred to the Division of Fixed Prosthodontics (University of Bern, Switzerland), where the <b>stripped</b> <b>screw</b> hole was enlarged with a special drill from a service kit of the implant provider. Although an extraction bolt was screwed into the opening and the torque ratchet was activated, the healing abutment would not loosen. A novel approach was attempted whereby the healing abutment was cooled with dry ice (CO 2). The cooling effect seemingly caused shrinkage of the healing abutment and a reduction of the connection forces between the implant and the nonretrievable component. The approach of creating an access hole {{for the application of}} reverse torque via the extraction bolt in combination with the thermal effect led to the successful removal of the blocked component. Neither the implant connection nor the bone-to-implant interface was damaged. The combined cryo-mechanical procedure allowed the implant to be successfully restored...|$|R

Our new technique consists of removing the problematic locking screw by cutting the plate {{on both sides of the}} screw hole and using the screw head-plate hole unit for removal. We analyzed all these patients for the location of the plate, number of locking screws, time of implant removal since the initial surgery, reason for removal of the plate, nature of the difficulties encountered during surgery, and any perioperative complications. A total of 43 (17. 34 %) screws were difficult to remove. Twenty screws were found to be stripped, 15 were jammed and 8 were broken. Fourteen of the 20 <b>stripped</b> <b>screws</b> and all 15 jammed screws were removed using our technique.

40|$|Background: Biomechanical {{studies have}} shown C 2 pedicle screw {{to be the most}} robust in insertional torque and pullout strength. However, C 2 pedicle screw {{placement}} is still technically challenging. Smaller C 2 pedicles or medial localization of the vertebral artery may preclude safe C 2 pedicle screw placement in some patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the pullout strength of spinous process screws with pedicle screws in the C 2. Materials and Methods: Eight fresh human cadaveric cervical spine specimens (C 2) were harvested and subsequently frozen to - 20 °C. After being thawed to room temperature, each specimen was debrided of remaining soft tissue and labeled. A customs jig as used to clamp each specimen for screw insertion firmly. Screws were inserted into the vertebral body pairs on each side using one of two methods. The pedicle screws were inserted in usual manner as in previous biomechanical studies. The starting point for spinous process screw insertion was located at the junction of the lamina and the spinous process and the direction of the screw was about 0 ° caudally in the sagittal plane and about 0 ° medially in the axial plane. Each vertebrae was held in a customs jig, which was attached to material testing machine (Material Testing System Inc., Changchun, China). A coupling device that fit around the head of the screw was used to pull out each screw at a loading rate of 2 mm/min. The uniaxial load to failure was recorded in Newton′st dependent test (for paired samples) was used to test for significance. Results: The mean load to failure was 387 N for the special protection scheme and 465 N for the protection scheme without significant difference (t = − 0. 862, P = 0. 403). In all but three instances (38 %), the spinous process pullout values exceeded the values for the pedicle screws. The working distances for the spinous process screws was little shorter than pedicle screws in each C 2 specimen. Conclusion: Spinous process screws provide comparable pullout strength to pedicle screws of the C 2. Spinous process screws may provide an alternative to pedicle screws fixation, especially with unusual anatomy or <b>stripped</b> <b>screws...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to achieve adequate screw fixation for plate constructs in fractures with poor quality bone or in metaphyseal bone with extensive bone loss or comminution[7][17]. Furthermore, rescuing or augmenting failed screw fixation in inadequate bone with various cement products has yielded mixed results when tested with pure axial pullout loading[20][21]. In most cases, plate/screw constructs experience both vertical (translational) and horizontal (pullout) forces during physiologic loading[17][20][21]. The increased use of locked screws in plate constructs has also changed the loading patterns of bone screws. For this study, a novel “toggle-out” testing method was developed to more realistically simulate in-vivo loading of screw-plate constructs. Our objective was to compare the fixation of locked and non-locked screws in simulated cancellous bone of three different densities and to determine the effectiveness of augmentation of the screw fixation using either PMMA or a resorbable Calcium Phosphate cement in both <b>stripped</b> and oversized <b>screw</b> holes. Polyurethane foam blocks of 12. 5, 20, and 30 lb/ft 3 densities representing ostoporotic, normal, and high density cancellous bone respectively (Sawbones, Pacific Research Laboratories, Vashon Island, WA) were used as the bone surrogate for this study. Holes were drilled into the blocks perpendicular to a single face for placement of screws. All screws tested were 4 mm diameter, 32, 34, or 36 mm length stainless steel cancellous bone screws (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ). The holes were either 2. 5 mm diameter pilot holes, 4. 0 mm diameter (to simulate a <b>stripped</b> <b>screw</b> hole), or 12 mm diameter (bone loss / void). In the 4 mm stripped holes and the 12 mm holes, various cements were used to augment the screw fixation. The cements used were PMMA (Simplex, Stryker) and Calcium Phosphate Cement (Trabexus, Vivorté). After placement of the screws or after the cement had set for 24 hours, the blocks were mounted on a load frame (MTS Corp) for cyclic testing. The load fixture allowed screws to be configured either as locked screws or non-locked screws with respect to the plate. Along with cyclic transverse loading, a constant axial pullout force of 20 N was applied to each screw during testing. Cyclic “toggle” loading was applied for 1000 cycles at each of ± 25, ± 50, ± 100, and ± 200 N, or until failure by pullout or screw breakage. The average total displacement (positive and negative combined) value for each test was recorded over the last ten load cycles. Under all conditions, the locked screws exhibited significantly less displacement than the non-locked screws (p screws to be set up as locked screws for half of the test conditions. Locking screws exhibited less displacement than non-locking screws across all test samples (P= 0. 00). This study therefore supports the use of a locking-style cancellous screw in poor quality bone or when cement augmentation of large holes is warranted. The behavior in stripped holes was quite interesting and erratic. The non-locking screws easily pulled out in most cases, but the locking screws were able to survive more cycles. Also, the higher density bone made cement augmentation to prevent pullout more difficult because the cement (especially CaP) does not interdigitate with the high density material. Cement augmentation of large defects and stripped holes in poor quality bone {{has the potential to be}} successful regardless of the type of cement used because locking screws were significantly more stable than non-locking screws...|$|R
