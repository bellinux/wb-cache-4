Selcal (<b>selective</b> <b>calling)</b> controller, as {{intermediate}} equipment between selcal and radio station, {{is designed to}} achieve the software automation and remote control in aviation. The whole system adopts msp- 430 microcontroller as hardware core and C language as the method of software realization. This paper focuses on hardware connection and design to introduce the electrical design and software flow of selcal controller.. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE Selcal, also know as ground-air <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> device, {{has been used by}} land station for <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> of aircraft. Each aircraft has a unique <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code, when the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> device calls an aircraft, the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> code, which consists of two connected audio pulse, shall be entered firstly. Two single tones that transmitted simultaneously are contained in each pulse. Selcal code will be transmitted by the shortwave radio station when the CALL push-button is pressed. When this code is received by the appropriate aircraft, the communication between radio station and aircraft is established. Therefore voice transmission connection between the ground and the aircraft can be achieved by using a handle. Fig. 1 Conventional model of <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> syste...|$|R
50|$|Tone squelch, {{or other}} forms of <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> is {{sometimes}} used to solve interference problems. Where more than one user is on the same channel (co-channel users), <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> addresses a subset of all receivers. Instead of turning on the receive audio for any signal, the audio turns on only {{in the presence of the}} correct <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code. This is akin to the use of a lock on a door. A carrier squelch is unlocked and will let any signal in. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> locks out all signals except ones with the correct key to the lock (the correct code).|$|R
50|$|In {{conventional}} systems, {{units are}} separated into groups by <b>selective</b> <b>calling.</b> Radios are usually segmented into customers with each customer {{on a separate}} <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code. Systems may use continuous tone-coded squelch system for this purpose. A disadvantage is that conventional systems require the user to disable <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> (to monitor,) {{in order to see}} if another company is talking before using the channel. Conventional systems are usually analog FM.|$|R
5000|$|A general option {{setting for}} all MDC systems is to enable or disable an {{acknowledgement}} (ack) data packet. For example, following a <b>selective</b> <b>call,</b> the called radio replies with an ack. This data [...] "handshake" [...] confirms the called radio is powered on, has received and decoded the call. The encoder beeps {{to confirm the}} call got through to the target. In computer-aided dispatch, the encoder/decoder may pass the ack to the dispatch computer system, flagging the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> as having been received by the mobile radio or automatically marking the time of call. The disadvantage of using an ack on busy channels is that more air time is used: roughly double the air time used by the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> data alone. The ack packet takes roughly {{the same amount of}} air time as the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> itself.|$|R

50|$|In a conventional, analog {{two-way radio}} system, a {{standard}} radio has noise squelch or carrier squelch which allows a radio to receive all transmissions. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{is used to}} address a subset of all two-way radios on a single radio frequency channel. Where more than one user is on the same channel, (co-channel users,) <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> can address a subset of all receivers or can direct a call to a single radio. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> features fit into two major categories: individual calling and group calling. Individual calls generally have longer time-constants: it takes more air-time to call an individual radio unit than to call {{a large group of}} radios.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., MMSIs are {{primarily}} used for digital <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> and for assigning Inmarsat identities.|$|R
50|$|Four {{different}} {{techniques are}} commonly used. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{can be regarded}} as a form of in-band signaling.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Basic {{base station}} {{elements}} {{used in a}} remote-controlled installation. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> options such as CTCSS are optional.|$|R
50|$|In non-critical uses, <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{can also}} be used to hide the {{presence}} of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as inexpensive police scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the strong signals present in urban environments. The interference will still be present. It will still degrade system performance but by using <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> the user will not have to hear the noises produced by receiving the interference.|$|R
5000|$|In the US, Federal Communications Commission rules require {{users of}} <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{to monitor the}} channel (i.e. switch to carrier squelch) before transmitting. In other words, the user must monitor (listen) {{to make sure the}} channel is not in use by someone on another <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code before transmitting. To enforce this rule, base {{stations}} often have a monitor switch on the microphone. The push-to-talk button is split into two segments. One segment turns the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> off. The other segment of the button transmits. A mechanical interlock prevents the transmit button from being pressed until the monitor button is down. This is called, [...] "compulsory monitor before transmit." [...] In mobile radios, microphones are stored in a hang-up box. When the microphone is pulled out of the hang-up, the radio reverts to carrier squelch, (the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> feature is disabled). The user automatically monitors—verifies no one else is using the channel—by pulling the mike out of the hang-up box. Hand-held radios sometimes have LED indicators that show when the channel is in use.|$|R
50|$|Automatic number {{identification}} {{is also used}} to describe the functions of two-way radio <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> that identify the transmitting user.|$|R
50|$|ALE {{evolved from}} older HF radio <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> technology. It {{combined}} existing channel-scanning <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> concepts with microprocessors (enabling FEC decoding and quality scoring decisions), burst transmissions (minimizing co-channel interference), and transponding (allowing unattended operation and incoming-call signalling). Early ALE systems {{were developed in}} the late 1970s and early 1980s by several radio manufacturers. The first ALE-family controller units were external rack mounted controllers connected to control military radios, and were rarely interoperable across vendors.|$|R
50|$|In uses where missed <b>calls</b> are allowable, <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{can also}} hide the {{presence}} of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the unwanted signals on nearby channels in urban environments. The interference will still be present and will still degrade system performance but by using <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> the user {{will not have to}} hear the noises produced by receiving the interference.|$|R
50|$|In {{designing}} a system, {{it is important}} to pick <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> tones that do not conflict with remote control tones in use.|$|R

5000|$|Control {{examples}} - For example, function A may be <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode, while function B is the vibrate function. Function C monitors channel 2. D is {{the mode}} {{that is similar}} to a scanner. When the pager is turned on, eight short beeps are heard along with flashing of both LEDs. Holding down the reset button in <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode will monitor the channel for any transmission on that channel at that time, or pure static as the squelch is bypassed.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> systems {{experience}} falsing. In other words, the decoder activates when a {{valid signal}} is not present. Falsing {{may come from}} a maintenance problem or poor engineering.|$|R
50|$|Trunked radio {{systems have}} {{built-in}} unit ID and <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> features. Each trunked system {{has its own}} unique features. See the article for a specific system to learn more.|$|R
5000|$|Minitor pagers, {{depending}} on the model and application, can operate in the VHF Low Band, VHF High Band, and UHF frequency ranges. They are alerted by using two-tone sequential <b>Selective</b> <b>calling,</b> generally following the Motorola Quick Call II standard. In other words, the pager will activate when a particular series of audible tones are sent over the frequency (commonly {{referred to as a}} [...] "page") the pager is set to. For example, if a Minitor is programmed on VHF frequency channel 155.295 MHz and set to alert for 879 Hz & 358.6 Hz, it will disregard any other tone sequences transmitted on that frequency, only alerting when the proper sequence has been received. The pager may be reset back into its <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode by pressing the reset button, or it can be programmed to reset back into <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode automatically after a predetermined amount of time, to conserve battery power.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} {{backward}} compatible with digital <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> systems, allowing shore-based GMDSS systems to inexpensively establish AIS operating channels and identify and track AIS-equipped vessels, and {{is intended to}} fully replace existing DSC-based transceiver systems.|$|R
50|$|Digital <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> or DSC is a {{standard}} for sending pre-defined digital messages via the medium-frequency (MF), high-frequency (HF) and very-high-frequency (VHF) maritime radio systems. It is a core part of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS).|$|R
50|$|A GMDSS {{system may}} include {{high-frequency}} (HF) radiotelephone and radiotelex (narrow-band direct printing) equipment, with calls initiated by digital <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> (DSC). Worldwide broadcasts of maritime safety information {{can also be}} made on HF narrow-band direct printing channels.|$|R
50|$|Two-way radio systems using digital {{modulation}} schemes such as TDMA can embed unit ID and <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> into the data stream multiplexed {{in parallel with}} the voice. See the article pertaining to a specific system to learn more.|$|R
50|$|Motorola {{uses the}} term mode to refer to {{channels}} on some conventional two-way radio models. In this use, a mode consists of a radio frequency channel and all channel-dependent options such as <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> channel scanning, power level, and more.|$|R
50|$|The Motorola Minitor is a portable, analog, receive only, voice pager {{typically}} {{carried by}} fire, rescue, and EMS personnel (both volunteer and career) to alert of emergencies. The Minitor, slightly {{smaller than a}} pack of cigarettes, is carried on a person and usually left in <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode. When the unit is activated, the pager sounds a tone alert, followed by an announcement from a dispatcher alerting the user of a situation. After activation, the pager remains in monitor mode much like a scanner, and monitors transmissions on that channel until the unit is reset back into <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode either manually, or automatically after a set period of time, depending on programming.|$|R
50|$|An area {{within the}} {{radiotelephone}} coverage {{of at least}} one VHF coast station in which continuous digital <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> (Ch.70/156.525 MHz) alerting and radiotelephony services are available. Such an area could extend typically 30 to 40 nmi km from the Coast Station.|$|R
50|$|Selcall (<b>selective</b> <b>calling)</b> {{is a type}} of squelch {{protocol}} used {{in radio}} communications systems, in which transmissions include a brief burst of sequential audio tones. Receivers that are set to respond to the transmitted tone sequence will open their squelch, while others will remain muted.|$|R
50|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{prevents}} the user from hearing others on a shared channel. It does not eliminate interference from co-channel users (other users {{on the same}} radio channel). If two users try to talk at the same time, the signal {{will be affected by}} the other party using the channel.|$|R
5000|$|Effective 1 August 2013, the U. S. Coast Guard {{terminated}} its radio {{guard of}} the international voice distress, safety and calling frequency 2182 kHz and the international digital <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> (DSC) distress and safety frequency 2187.5 kHz. Additionally, marine information and weather broadcasts transmitted on 2670 kHz terminated concurrently.|$|R
50|$|Some {{conventional}} radios scan {{more than}} one channel. That is, the receiver searches {{more than one}} channel for a valid transmission. A valid transmission may be a radio channel with any signal {{or a combination of}} a radio channel with a specific Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System (CTCSS) (or <b>selective</b> <b>calling)</b> code.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of addressed digital communications, some real-world analog communications systems performed a function very similar to the fictional CRM-114. Some aircraft radios used SELCAL (<b>selective</b> <b>calling),</b> which muted the receiver unless an assigned tone was received. Ground mobile radios used a similar system called CTCSS (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System).|$|R
5000|$|ITU-T Recommendation H.235.4, H.323 security: Direct and <b>selective</b> routed <b>call</b> security.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{two-way radio}} {{is used to}} {{communicate}} analog or digital data. Systems can be simplex or duplex and may employ <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> features such as CTCSS. In full-duplex systems, data can be sent real-time between two points. In simplex or half-duplex, data can be sent with a time lag between many points.|$|R
50|$|Many systems {{operate with}} the remote or mobile {{stations}} being able to hear all the calls being made. This {{may not always be}} satisfactory and a system of <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> may be required. There are several ways of achieving this, including Dual Tone Multiple Frequency (DTMF) signalling and Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System (CTCSS).|$|R
