5|$|True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham {{supported}} {{passage of}} the Eighteenth Amendment forbidding the import and sale of alcohol in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing women <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919, but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 1966, {{shortly after}} Singapore's independence, the President of Singapore {{appointed}} a Constitutional Commission helmed by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin {{to consider how}} the rights of racial, linguistic, and religious minorities in the nascent nation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected.</b> Singapore had just been ejected from Malaysia, and had experienced {{an extended period of}} racial and religious tension resulting from the Maria Hertogh riots. This experience reinforced the need for a multiracial society based on equality among races.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E

50|$|In 2009 it was {{reported}} that part of the forest had been allocated to the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA).

5|$|The {{businessman}} and politician William Smith was appointed Lord Warden in 1891, but died in Walmer Castle {{during his first}} visit here in October of that year. Smith had proposed that the historical artefacts in the castle <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> from being removed by later Lord Wardens and suggested that government pass an Indenture of Heirlooms Bill. The government carried out the plan after Smith's death, protecting almost 70 pieces of furniture and 50 artworks at the castle and forbidding them being moved from the castle without the Secretary of State for War's approval. Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, became the next Lord Warden; with adequate legal protection now in place, the 3rd Duke of Wellington suggested returning his grandfather's possessions to the castle, but Lady Salisbury declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} within individual populations of B.cuneata are unusually high {{for a rare}} and endangered species, but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River, an ephemeral saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both B.cuneata and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions {{as a barrier to}} the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to diverge through genetic drift. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested {{on both sides of the}} river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based risk analysis found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size. This leads to the conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected.</b>|$|E
5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on {{the southern end of}} Amami, so that area <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected.</b> Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting. Some have even been found to roost in caves and {{possibly}} housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain. Tracking the species by radio signals, {{it was found that the}} species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals. Recent years have seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts to identify those which <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.|$|E

25|$|Photosensitivity {{reactions}} {{are characterized by}} severe {{inflammation of the skin}} with depigmentation and ulceration. In some cases (Type I), pigments are excreted through urine or deposited in hard tissues such as bones and teeth, causing discolouration.

25|$|Genetic {{distance}} {{is useful for}} reconstructing the history of populations.

25|$|In 2007, Khamenei {{requested}} that government officials speed up Iran's move towards economic privatization. Its last move towards such a goal was in 2004, when Article 44 {{of the constitution}} was overturned. Article 44 had decreed that Iran's core infrastructure should remain state-run. Khamenei also suggested that ownership rights <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> in courts {{set up by the}} Justice Ministry; the hope was that this new protection would give a measure of security to and encourage private investment.|$|E
25|$|Although its {{strongly}} conservative {{views on}} theology and ethics {{might seem to}} make the LCMS politically compatible with Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the U.S., the LCMS largely eschews political activity, partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the Two Kingdoms (see above), which repudiates the primarily Calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of God that informs much, if not most, of U.S. evangelical understanding of politics and Christianity. However, both LCMS and Evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> by law since conception.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{controversial}} nature, {{different countries}} vary {{in the discussion}} of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement.
