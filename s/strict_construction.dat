5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of <b>strict</b> <b>construction</b> he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the law}} on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E

25|$|Not all fly ashes meet ASTM C618 requirements, {{although}} {{depending on}} the application, {{this may not be}} necessary. Ash used as a cement replacement must meet <b>strict</b> <b>construction</b> standards, but no standard environmental regulations have been established in the United States. 75% of the ash must have a fineness of 45µm or less, and have a carbon content, measured by the loss on ignition (LOI), of less than 4%. In the U.S., LOI must be under 6%. The particle size distribution of raw fly ash tends to fluctuate constantly, due to changing performance of the coal mills and the boiler performance. This makes it necessary that, if fly ash is used in an optimal way to replace cement in concrete production, it must be processed using beneficiation methods like mechanical air classification. But if fly ash is used also as a filler to replace sand in concrete production, unbeneficiated fly ash with higher LOI can be also used. Especially important is the ongoing quality verification. This is mainly expressed by quality control seals like the Bureau of Indian Standards mark or the DCL mark of the Dubai Municipality.|$|E

25|$|Under a <b>strict</b> <b>construction</b> of {{the meaning}} of Asceticism, it is an error to assume that its history may be {{extended}} to embrace also certain rites in vogue among devotees to fetishism and nature worship. Mutilations, the sacrifice of the hair, dietary observances and prohibitions, which abound in all forms of religion at a certain stage of development, do not spring from the notion of the sinfulness of the natural instincts and of life. Nor is the sacrificial scheme in any way connected with Asceticism. The idea of privation is foreign to it. If the offering was a gift to the Deity and as such entailed upon the offerer the parting with something of value, the expectation which animated him was invariably that of receiving rich return. But whatever theory must be accepted in explanation of the various rites of mutilation, and of the sacrificial ritual, certain it is that Judaism from the beginning set its face most sternly against the one, and materially restricted the other. Mutilations for whatever purpose and of whatever character were absolutely prohibited. Funeral horrors and superstitions were not tolerated. The Levitical code restricted sacrifices to one place. The priests only were entrusted with the office at the altar. And, if the Prophets are the truest expounders of the ideals and ideas of the religion of Israel, even the sacrificial and sacerdotal system, with its implications of extraordinary and precautionary cleanliness and physical abstemiousness, was of little vital moment.|$|E

40|$|In my thesis, I {{argue for}} an {{ellipsis}} in the <b>strict</b> AN&A <b>construction</b> in Old English, {{which is also}} known as the postposed and-adjective construction (Fischer, 2012) or the postnominal ‘and adjective’ construction (Haumann, 2003). This construction is a case of a prenominal adjective modifying a noun followed by a single postnominal adjective. By ‘strict’, I mean those cases of AN&A where the construction only has one single referent and does not refer to two distinct referents. I argue that an ellipsis approach is a likelier explanation for the syntax of the <b>strict</b> AN&A <b>construction</b> than the extraposition approach. While Fischer (2012) follows the extraposition approach, my approach resembles the one in Haumann (2003), wherein she proposes that the second adjective is accompanied by a null prominal (pro). The extraposition explanation has certain weaknesses, such as the limitations created by the Coordinate Structure Constraint (CSC), which prohibits the movement of a conjunct in a coordination structure. The extraposition approach is thus, unlike the ellipsis approach, a theoretical cost for coordination theory. This then leaves us with one option which is less desirable due to the theoretical cost for the theory of coordination, extraposition, and another option which is more desirable, ellipsis, as it would be a solution without the need for any extra rules. If OE has an ellipsis rule independently of AN&A, it would be plausible that ellipsis is behind the <b>strict</b> AN&A <b>construction</b> and not extraposition. Given that this is true, there would be no need to create an extra rule for extraposition to allow it to circumvent CSC. To support the ellipsis approach, I used a corpus to locate examples of Noun Phrase Ellipsis (NPE) outside of the AN&A construction in OE. The existence of NPE outside of AN&A and the problems with the extraposition approach thus support the ellipsis approach...|$|R

6000|$|In {{the case}} of the war between the States {{it would have been the}} exact truth if the South had said,--"We do not want to live with you Northern people any longer; we know our {{institution}} of slavery is obnoxious to you, and, as you are growing numerically stronger than we, it may at some time in the future be endangered. So long as you permitted us to control the government, and with the aid of a few friends at the North to enact laws constituting your section a guard against the escape of our property, we were willing to live with you. You have been submissive to our rule heretofore; but it looks now as if you did not intend to continue so, and we will remain in the Union no longer." [...] Instead of this the seceding States cried lustily,--"Let us alone; you have no constitutional power to interfere with us." [...] Newspapers and people at the North reiterated the cry. Individuals might ignore the constitution; but the Nation itself must not only obey it, but must enforce the <b>strictest</b> <b>construction</b> of that instrument; the construction put upon it by the Southerners themselves. The fact is the constitution did not apply to any such contingency as the one existing from 1861 to 1865. Its framers never dreamed of such a contingency occurring. If they had foreseen it, the probabilities are they would have sanctioned the right of a State or States to withdraw rather than that there should be war between brothers.|$|R
6000|$|If a <b>strict</b> <b>construction</b> of {{the words}} [...] "all Evangelical Christians" [...] be insisted on, {{we are at a}} loss to see where the {{committee}} could draw the dividing line between what might be offensive and what allowable. The Society publish tracts in which the study of the Scriptures is enforced and their denial to the laity by Romanists assailed. But throughout the South it is criminal to teach a slave to read; throughout the South no book could be distributed among the servile population more incendiary than the Bible, if they could only read it. Will not our Southern brethren take alarm?

Or are tracts to be distributed only to those who will find their doctrine agreeable, and are the Society's colporteurs to be instructed that a Temperance essay is the proper thing for a total-abstinent infidel, and a sermon on the Atonement for a distilling deacon? If the aim of the Society be only to convert men from sins they have no mind to, and to convince them of errors to which they have no temptation, they might as well be spending their money to persuade schoolmasters that two and two make four, or geometricians that there cannot be two obtuse angles in a triangle.

Admitting the first part of their proposition, we deny the conclusion they seek to draw from it. They are guilty of a glaring anachronism in assuming the same opinions and prejudices to have existed in 1825 which are undoubtedly influential in 1858. The Anti-slavery agitation did not begin until 1831, and the debates in the Virginia Convention prove conclusively that six years after the foundation of the Tract Society, the leading men in that State, men whose minds had been trained and whose characters had been tempered in that school of action and experience which was open to all during the heroic period of our history, had not yet suffered such distortion of the intellect through passion and such deadening of the conscience through interest, as would have prevented their discussing either the moral or the political aspects of Slavery, and precluded them from uniting in any effort to make the relation between master and slave less demoralizing to the one and less imbruting to the other.|$|E
40|$|My thesis, "Love and Violence in Transracial/national Adoption," {{examines}} a New York Times special transracial adoption blog series, "Relative Choices," to critically interrogate how {{love and}} violence operate in adoption discourse. In doing so, it explores two main questions: How have transracial/national adoptions been posited {{in the past}} and how does that inform current articulations? Second, how would a global/historical framework help rethink transracial/national adoptions beyond one based on the local/present? Specifically, I am interested in how a global/historical framework, on a larger level, disrupts our understandings of narratives of love, inclusion and progress and, on an individual family or particular level, how does such a framework challenge the <b>strict</b> <b>constructions</b> of the family, and then lastly, on both levels how does it reveal the productive violence at play? I argue that the normative narrative of adoption discourse has shifted from assimilation overdrive to the embracement of colorblindness and liberal multiculturalism through claims of inclusion, progression, and revolution. The condition of possibility for these assertions is mobilized by the ability of many adoptive supporters, parents and even adoptees to strategically place adoption in a local/ present framework. This positioning individualizes, depoliticizes, ahistoricizes transracial/national adoption, and it enables love to operate as the encompassing and guiding principle for adoption. While the concept and role of love is no doubt integral to the act (commitment) and process of adoption, its presence and hypervisibility obscures how the global and historical play important roles in shaping adoption. Specifically, the local/present framework erases and obfuscates the productive and political symbolic violence of transracial/national adoption...|$|R

6000|$|Inextricably {{confused}} {{with the question of}} Slavery, and essential {{to an understanding of the}} motives and character of the Southern people as distinguished from their politicians, is the doctrine of State Rights. On this topic also Mr. Greeley furnishes all the data requisite to a full understanding of the matter. The dispute resolves itself substantially into this: whether the adoption of the Constitution established a union or a confederacy, a government or a league, a nation or a committee. This also is a question which can only be determined by a knowledge of what the Convention of 1787 intended and accomplished, and the States severally acceded to,--it being of course understood that no State had a right, or at the time pretended any right, to accept the Constitution with mental reservations. On this subject we have ample and unimpeachable testimony in the discussions which led to the calling of the Convention, and the debates which followed in the different conventions of the States called together to decide whether the new frame of government should be accepted or rejected. The conviction that it was absolutely necessary to remodel the Articles of Confederation was wrought wholly by an experience of the inadequacy of the existing plan (under which a single State could oppose its veto to a law of Congress), from, the looseness of its cohesion and its want of power to compel obedience. The principle of coercive authority, which was represented as so oppressively unconstitutional by the friends of Secession in the North as well as the South four years ago, was precisely that which, as its absence had brought the old plan to a dead-lock, was deemed essential to the new. The formal proposal for a convention, originated by Hamilton, was seconded by one State after another. Here is a sample of Virginian public sentiment at that time, from the [...] "instructions to their representatives," [...] by several constituencies: [...] "Government without coercion is a proposition at once so absurd and self-contradictory that the idea creates a confusion of the understanding; it is form without substance, at best a body without a soul." [...] Oliver Ellsworth, advocating the adoption of the Constitution in the Convention of Connecticut, says: [...] "A more energetic system is necessary. The present is merely advisory. It has no coercive power. Without this, government is ineffectual, or rather is no government at all." [...] Earlier than this Madison had claimed [...] "an implied right of coercion" [...] even for the Confederate Congress, and Jefferson had gone so far as to say that they possessed it [...] "by the law of nature." [...] The leading objections to the new Constitution were such as to show the general belief that the State sovereignties were to be absorbed into the general government in all matters of national concern. But the unhappy ingenuity of Mr. Jefferson afterwards devised that theory of <b>strict</b> <b>construction</b> which would enable any State to profit by the powers of the Constitution so long as it was for her interest or convenience, and then, by pleading its want of powers, to resolve the helpless organization once more into the incoherence of confederacy. By this dexterous legerdemain, the Union became a string of juggler's rings, which seems a chain while it pleases the operator, but which, by bringing the strain on the weak point contrived for the purpose, is made to fall easily asunder and become separate rings again. An adroit use of this theory enabled the South to gain one advantage after another by threatening disunion, and led naturally, on the first effective show of resistance, to secession. But in order that the threat might serve its purpose without the costly necessity of putting it in execution, the doctrine of State Rights was carefully inculcated at the South by the same political party which made belief in the value of the Union a fanaticism at the North. On one side of Mason and Dixon's line it was lawful, and even praiseworthy, to steal the horse; on the other, it was a hanging matter to look over the fence.|$|E
