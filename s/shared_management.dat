5|$|Once again, Gephart {{appeared}} on the scene to save the furnace. With the backing of Philadelphia and New York investors, he formed the Nittany Iron Company, which bought and rehabilitated the furnace, returning it to blast on June 5, 1902, under Frank H. Clemson (former chief of mining at Gephart's Bellefonte Furnace Company). Other organizers included Lorenzo Terbal Munson, Gephart's brother-in-law (who was associated with Bellefonte Glass and the Bellefonte Iron and Nail Works), Archer Brown, and William Sampson. However, prosperity did not return to the ironmaking business. The furnace was idle for two months in 1904. As steel production in open hearth furnaces became increasingly commonplace (a method better suited for iron made from Lake Superior ore, while Bessemer converters functioned best with Centre County ore), Nittany Furnace found it increasingly difficult to operate at a profit. The death of Gephart on February 14, 1905 also dealt a blow to the company, which thereafter <b>shared</b> <b>management</b> with the Bellefonte Furnace Company.|$|E

[...] [...] This regional organisation, founded in order to hamper the Mali Federation, was designed with three major functions: to allow <b>shared</b> <b>management</b> of certain public services, such as the port of Abidjan or the Abidjan–Niger railway line; to provide a solidarity fund accessible to member countries, 90% of which was provided by Côte d'Ivoire; and to provide funding for various development projects through low-interest loans to member states (70% of the loans were supplied by Côte d'Ivoire). In 1966, Houphouët-Boigny even offered to grant dual citizenship to nationals from member countries of the Conseil de l'Entente, but the proposition was quickly abandoned following popular protests.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fishery managers, economists, {{industry}} advocates, {{and some}} environmental public interest groups are currently promoting catch shares (or {{the allocation of}} exclusive portions of the total allowable catch) {{as a means to}} address both environmental and economic fishery management problems. At the same time, a vocal opposition to catch <b>share</b> <b>management</b> has developed among some industry stakeholders, academics, and other public interest groups. Over {{the course of the last}} 20 years, while the debate has percolated, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (known henceforth as the Council) has incrementally developed and overseen the implementation of five major catch <b>share</b> <b>management</b> programs for the fisheries it governs. This article draws on the experiences in the North Pacific fisheries to shed light on several facets of the debate over the efficacy of catch <b>share</b> <b>management</b> and suggests that catch <b>share</b> <b>management</b> is most effective and beneficial to stakeholders...|$|R

2500|$|Frakes has {{identified}} five core {{components of the}} Common Heritage of Humanity concept. First, {{there can be no}} private or public appropriation; no one legally owns common heritage spaces. Second, representatives from all nations must manage resources contained in such a territorial or conceptual area on behalf of all since a commons area is considered to belong to everyone; this practically necessitating a special agency to coordinate <b>shared</b> <b>management.</b> Third, all nations must actively share with each other the benefits acquired from exploitation of the resources from the commons heritage region, this requiring restraint on the profit-making activities of private corporate entities; this linking the concept to that of global public good. Fourth, there can be no weaponry or military installations established in territorial commons areas. Fifth, the commons should be preserved for the benefit of future generations, and to avoid a [...] "tragedy of the commons" [...] scenario. Academic claims have been made that where the principle requires the establishment of an international resource management regime, prior to establishment of such a regime a moratorium on resource exploitation should be enforced. Such a position {{does not appear to have}} been supported by most states during the respective drafting negotiations.|$|E

40|$|Construction {{knowledge}} can be communicated and reused among project managers and jobsite engineers to alleviate problems on a construction jobsite and reduce the time and cost of solving problems related to constructability. This paper proposes a new methodology for the sharing of construction knowledge by using Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology. The main characteristics of BIM include illustrating 3 D CAD-based presentations and keeping information in a digital format and facilitation of easy updating and transfer of information in the BIM environment. Using the BIM technology, project managers and engineers can gain knowledge related to BIM and obtain feedback provided by jobsite engineers for future reference. This study addresses the application of knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>management</b> using BIM technology and proposes a BIM-based Knowledge <b>Sharing</b> <b>Management</b> (BIMKSM) system for project managers and engineers. The BIMKSM system is then applied in a selected case study of a construction project in Taiwan to demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing knowledge in the BIM environment. The results demonstrate that the BIMKSM system {{can be used as}} a visual BIM-based knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>management</b> platform by utilizing the BIM technology...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – To propose and {{evaluate}} a novel management structure that encourages knowledge sharing across an organization. Design/methodology/approach – The extant {{literature on the}} impact of organizational culture and its link to management structure is examined and used to develop a new knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>management</b> structure. Roadblocks to implementing a new management structure and methods for overcoming these impediments are discussed. The efficacy of the proposed management structure is evaluated empirically by examining its effect on organizations that have implemented portions of the proposed structure. Findings – The foundational ideas behind the proposed knowledge management organizational structure and the structure itself have been implemented in parts at various organizations located both in the USA and internationally. While the full management structure model has not been evaluated, the portions implemented in various organizations have enabled these organizations to assume leading roles in their respective industries. Research limitations/implications – The proposed knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>management</b> structure has not been fully implemented under controlled circumstances. The empirical evaluation is performed on portions of the proposed model, thus the full impact of the proposed management structure may well exceed the described benefits and additional structural‐shift roadblocks may limit the realization of the proposed benefits. Practical implications – The proposed knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>management</b> structure gives managers a practical way to approach cross organizational knowledge sharing, which is frequently identified as a theoretical benefit of knowledge management. Means for diminishing or circumventing recognized impediments to organizational change are described to further facilitate the implementation of the proposed cross‐organizational knowledge sharing structure. Originality/value – The proposed knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>management</b> structure is organized around knowledge‐based teams of knowledge workers, but further extends this concept to include larger knowledge groups to transform an organization into a knowledge‐based organization. If an organization 2 ̆ 7 s functional structure can be successfully transformed, then this enables the maximization of competitive advantage realized through knowledge management initiatives, more specifically through knowledge <b>sharing.</b> Upper level <b>management,</b> who are responsible for organizational change are the primary audience, though the principals described may be implemented through a more grass roots approach by lower level management...|$|R
