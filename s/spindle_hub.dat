40|$|Due {{to their}} {{structural}} dynamics, rotationally periodic structures (RPS) {{have always been}} an area of interest for engineers and scientists. RPS is found in almost all industries and could be as large as jet turbines to as small as hard disk drives. We come across with RPS on daily routine like washing machine tub, small gears in home appliances and brakes in automobile etc. With such an influence in our life, an RPS dynamic response to the environment is crucial to keep them working and hence {{is the focus of}} the thesis. The research involves three major responses on rotationally periodic structures (RPS) namely vibration, thermal and shock. Hard disk drives and integrally bladed rotors (IBR) has been selected as research models. On vibratory response in rotationally periodic structures, effects on structural designs and free vibrations of integrated bladed rotor (IBR) have been investigated in this research. The migration of natural frequencies is characterized through parametric studies considering changes in blade angle and blade thickness of an underlying uniform axis-symmetric rotor. Recurring coupled repeated doublet modes, defined as replica modes, have been observed in this study by characterizing blade vibrations in-phase or out-of-phase to disk vibrations. Veering and clustering of replica modesâ€™ natural frequencies are observed with respect to the blade design parameters. Existence of replica modes has been verified via experimental studies. Fourier content for the low frequency replica component is found to be sensitive and tuneable to blade angle design. For the thermal response of RPS, structural thermal analysis of spindle disk assembly used in hard disk drives (HDDs) was adopted. With the view toward understanding the underlying physics and to minimize the corresponding repeatable run-out (RRO) of track following position error signal (PES) in high track per inch (TPI) magnetic disk drives, analytical representations of thermal expansion mismatch between disk and <b>spindle</b> <b>hub</b> structure formulated in form of operators and finite element analysis (FEA) are employed. Parametric studies with analysis taken at different operational temperatures suggested that RRO can be minimized significantly when location of spindle notch is properly located. RRO harmonics resulted from the thermal expansion mismatch and structure misalignments are studied and concluded with simple algebraic expression related to number of fasteners used in the disk-spindle assembly. On shock response of RPS, head gimbal assembly (HGA) in HDD was analysed. Experimental observation of de-bonding phenomena between head gimbal assembly (HGA) and suspension for a commercial 3. 5 -inch enterprise HDD under non-operational 250 G shock test was performed. In this research the experimental observation and numerical finite element studies were conducted to understand the effect on the mechanical failure of HGA when it is subjected to non-operational shock in the parked position on the ramp. Different design modifications were adapted to withstand shock waves. It was observed that by changing flexure angle in HGA, shock stress can be reduced. FEA simulation results have been presented to verify the findings. The research findings in this thesis can be implemented in the industry where RPS has been widely used, as for example the new replica modes discovery in bladed rotors can also been applied on small scales like as on hard drive, where no. of blades can be replaced by no. of fasteners and the spinning hard drive will be benefited by studying its vibrations with concentration on replica modes. Furthermore, the serendipitous finding of HDD platters expansion under thermal stress can be beneficial in actually storing more data per inch as it has been recently used in TAMR (thermally assisted magnetic recording) technology. Gears, brakes, washing machines to name a few can get supported from the findings in the thesis where controlling vibrations, shock and heat is crucial...|$|E

50|$|In {{automotive}} suspension, a {{steering knuckle}} {{is that part}} which contains the wheel <b>hub</b> or <b>spindle,</b> and attaches to the suspension components. It is variously called a steering knuckle, <b>spindle,</b> upright or <b>hub,</b> as well.|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} {{the results of}} the {{investigations}} on forged <b>spindles</b> and <b>hubs</b> for commercial vehicles are presented by which the accuracy of the fatigue life prediction using conventional local strain approach was proved. The data for the life prediction were determined on the test specimens taken out from the components. These data and the tests on components and test specimens under service-like stress-time histories are described. Two different stress-time histories were used; one having varying mean value (spindles) and the other having a constant mean value (hubs). The results show that a reliable fatigue life prediction with the conventional local strain approach is not achieved; especially for the load time history with the mean value variation the predicted life is extremely overestimated. A comparison of the life prediction with different procedures is presented and evaluated...|$|R
50|$|The wheel was {{constructed}} in sections which were floated up the Thames on barges and assembled lying flat on piled platforms in the river. Once the wheel was complete it was lifted into an upright position by a strand jack system made by Enerpac. It was first raised at 2 degrees per hour until it reached 65 degrees, then left in that position for a week while engineers prepared for {{the second phase of}} the lift. The project was European with major components coming from six countries: the steel was supplied from the UK and fabricated in The Netherlands by the Dutch company Hollandia, the cables came from Italy, the bearings came from Germany (FAG/Schaeffler Group), the <b>spindle</b> and <b>hub</b> were cast in the Czech Republic, the capsules were made by Poma in France (and the glass for these came from Italy), and the electrical components from the UK.|$|R
5000|$|The dish of a wheel {{measures}} {{the amount of}} asymmetry between the rim and the hub flanges. To accommodate a large cassette, more space is needed on the drive side of the axle; this increases the complexity of manufacturing and truing the wheel. Tandem rear wheels tend to run a wider hub/axle to allow the right-side hub flange to be further right of wheel center and thus reduce the total dish of the wheel. Some modern tandems use a 160mm wide axle which allows a wheel that is completely [...] "dishless" [...] (i.e. symmetric). The disadvantage is this may increase the Q-factor of the stoker's cranks and may also cause [...] "heel-strike" [...] of the stoker's shoes on the chain stays. Others use shorter axles (often 145mm wide) thereby trading a little decrease in {{the strength of the}} wheel for the advantage of a similar decrease in the bending moment of the axle <b>spindle.</b> Rear <b>hubs</b> may also be threaded on the left side to allow the use of a drum brake.|$|R
25|$|After a disk is inserted, a catch or lever at {{the front}} of the drive is {{manually}} lowered to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging, engage the <b>spindle</b> clamping <b>hub,</b> and in two-sided drives, engage the second read/write head with the media. In some 5Â¼-inch drives, insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever. This enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal. Newer 5Â¼-inch drives and all 3Â½-inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted, doing the opposite with the press of the eject button. On Apple Macintosh computers with built-in floppy drives, the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive. The user could drag the image of the floppy drive to the trash can on the desktop to eject the disk. In the case of a power failure or drive malfunction, a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened paper clip into a small hole at the drive's front panel, just as one would do with a CD-ROM drive in a similar situation.|$|R
40|$|By {{fatigue tests}} under {{simulated}} {{operational loading conditions}} on forged spindels, hubs and axles of commercial vehicles {{as well as on}} test specimens taken from the components, the accuracy of the fatigue life prediction using conventional local strain approach was controlled. The material data for the life prediction were determined on the specimens machined out of the critical areas of the components. For the component tests service-like stress-time histories with mean stress variation (<b>spindle)</b> and without (<b>hub)</b> as well as load time histories with a Gaussian frequency distribution (axle, spindle) were used. The comparison of the calculated fatigue life of the components, based on the material data, with the experimentally obtained life shows, that a reliable fatigue life prediction with the conventional local strain approach is not achieved. The accuracy of the fatigue life prediction should be improved by a systematic, phenomenologic description of the decisive effects...|$|R
40|$|The Suspension Solutions {{design team}} has {{completely}} designed built and tested an {{independent rear suspension}} system for the 2008 FSAE car. The car currently features a solid rear axle, and the task of converting it to incorporate an interchangeable rear suspension has been undertaken in order to quantify {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each design philosophy. The car has been properly tested with both the solid axle and independent rear suspension side-by-side, however more testing is suggested. After pushing both setups to their limits on a 50 ft diameter skid pad, the test results were quantified, and a final comparison between the two design philosophies was tabulated. From our limited testing we can easily conclude that an IRS FSAE car, at minimum, can match the performance of the previous solid axle setup, while being 22 lbs heavier. We suspect its performance advantage to become apparent with additional testing however. More subjectively, it was found that the IRS handled more predictably and was easier for novice drivers to control and drive. Our results help quantify {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each system and can be used by future FSAE teams to make more informed design decisions. Our independent rear suspension design includes an unequal length A-Arm configuration, new rear uprights, <b>spindles</b> and <b>hubs,</b> a Torsen differential, and an additional steel space frame to connect all of the listed components to the CP 08 chassis. Our initial analysis shows that a performance edge between the two competing systems is dependent on the overall weight of each system and our preliminary testing results help confirm this analysis...|$|R
40|$|The 4 "t"h meeting aims to {{exchange}} {{the experience and}} knowledge of engineers during several presentations and discussions about new developments required for a reliable, time and cost reducing validation of the wheel/hub assembly. Tremendous development of the wheel performance, described by {{the ratio of the}} rated load (kg) versus the wheel weight (kg) had taken place during the last 5000 years. Starting from the ratio of 3 for wooden 2 -piece-disc-wheels in Mesopotamia it needed nearly 1000 years to increase the ratio to approx 5 at light-weight spoke wheels for fighting carriages, found in the grave of king Tutenchamon in Egypt. Modern light alloy wheels of commercial vehicles reach values up to 160 kg/kg. Additionally the comlex design of the modern systems for cars and commercial vehicles comprising wheel, brake, <b>hub,</b> bearing, <b>spindle</b> and <b>hub</b> carrier, including different materials and their treatment, fasteners, press-fits, require an appropriate testing procedure. The variable loading conditions, caused by operational wheel forces, brake and torque moments including heating, may result in changing tolerances and press-fits during operation and consequently in different damage mechanisms. This can be simulated in the Biaxial Wheel Test Machine, whereby corresponding load programs are necessary. An overview about all biaxial test machines in usage at the end of 1999 is shown in the introduction. The total number is 17 for cars, 7 for commercial vehicles and 1 for trains. The six presentations of this meeting were consequently concentrated on: (a) recommendations for a standardization of load programs of the German Wheel Committee, (b) the simulation of brake and torque events and (c) the possibility for a numerical stress analyses and fatigue life assessment.
