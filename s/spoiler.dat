5|$|Stephanie Brown was {{formerly}} known as <b>Spoiler</b> and then as the first in-continuity female Robin until her apparent death in 2006. Following her return to comics in 2009, she {{assumed the role of}} Batgirl. She maintained this position until 2011, the relaunch of the DC imprint under The New 52. The character reappeared in the DCU in Batman #28, as <b>Spoiler.</b>|$|E
5|$|V-Series: {{introduced}} in October 2006, the Commodore V featured air conditioning, a sports-oriented body kit including 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear <b>spoiler</b> and colour-matched wing mirrors and exterior door handles.|$|E
5|$|Lumina: {{debuted in}} June 2007 with a luxury theme {{including}} the Berlina grille {{and the original}} Calais V seven-spoke alloy wheels. Specified identically to the V-Series with exception to the rear <b>spoiler,</b> the Lumina saw the addition of rear parking sensors and Bluetooth connectivity.|$|E
50|$|Airliners {{are almost}} always fitted with <b>spoilers.</b> <b>Spoilers</b> are used to {{increase}} descent rate without increasing speed. Their use is often limited, however, as the turbulent airflow that develops behind them causes noise and vibration, which may cause discomfort to passengers. <b>Spoilers</b> may also be differentially operated for roll control instead of ailerons; Martin Aircraft was the first company to develop such <b>spoilers</b> in 1948. On landing, however, the <b>spoilers</b> are nearly always fully deployed to help slow the aircraft. The increase in form drag created by the <b>spoilers</b> directly assists the braking effect. However, the real gain comes as the <b>spoilers</b> cause a dramatic loss of lift and hence {{the weight of the}} aircraft is transferred from the wings to the undercarriage, allowing the wheels to be mechanically braked with less tendency to skid.|$|R
50|$|Control was {{achieved}} with elevons and <b>spoilers.</b> The control system included both long-span (inboard) and short-span (outboard) <b>spoilers,</b> with the smaller outboard <b>spoilers</b> activated first. This system gave a smoother and more graceful control of yaw than would a single-spoiler system.|$|R
40|$|The {{conflicts}} {{of the past}} three decades have shown that the major problems which peace processes face are the <b>spoilers.</b> <b>Spoilers</b> are warring parties and their leaders who believe that peaceful settlement of disputes threatens their interests, power and their reputation; therefore, they use all means to undermine or completely spoil the process. <b>Spoilers</b> of peace processes can be inside or outside of the process and are characterized as limited, greedy or total <b>spoilers.</b> Their motives for spoiling can be different, such as: political, financial, ethnic, security, etc. Furthermore, it is important to emphasise that <b>spoilers</b> are not only rebels and insurgents, but can often be governments, diasporas, warlords, private military companies, etc. In order to counteract the <b>spoilers,</b> the international community has adopted and implemented three methods: inducement, socialization and coercion. Often all three methods are used to convince the <b>spoilers</b> to negotiate, accept and implement peace agreements. Hence, this paper will examine the methods used to deal with peace process <b>spoilers</b> through an assessment of the strategies employed, impact, success and failures. This paper will also argue that {{the success or failure of}} the peace process depends on the method(s) used to deal with <b>spoilers.</b> If the right method is chosen, with a persisten...|$|R
5|$|Other {{possible}} medal contenders included Andriy Serdinov of Ukraine, {{who had won}} the Olympic {{bronze medal}} in 2004, and Venezuelan Albert Subriats, a bronze medalist at the 2007 World Championships and seen as a potential <b>spoiler,</b> if he could match or improve on his 51.82 time, in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies played <b>spoiler</b> in 1987. The Mets went 13–5 {{against the}} Phillies in 1987 and outscored Philadelphia 94–56. However, the Phillies won {{two of three}} in September to hurt the Mets' chances of winning the {{division}} significantly.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of , Cassandra, acting under her mentor's orders {{in the event of}} his death, handed over the Batgirl mantle to Stephanie Brown, the former <b>Spoiler</b> and Robin. After declining an offer from Tim Drake to reclaim the Batgirl mantle from Stephanie, Cassandra rejoined the Batman Family under the new {{identity}} of Blackbat. She currently acts as the Hong Kong representative of Batman Inc.|$|E
50|$|The goal of many <b>spoilers</b> used in {{passenger}} vehicles {{is to reduce}} drag and increase fuel efficiency. Passenger vehicles can be equipped with front and rear <b>spoilers.</b> Front <b>spoilers,</b> found beneath the bumper, are mainly used to decrease the amount of air going underneath the vehicle to reduce the drag coefficient and lift.|$|R
5000|$|On {{low drag}} {{aircraft}} such as sailplanes, <b>spoilers</b> {{are used to}} disrupt airflow over the wing and greatly reduce lift. This allows a glider pilot to lose altitude without gaining excessive airspeed. <b>Spoilers</b> are sometimes called [...] "lift dumpers". <b>Spoilers</b> {{that can be used}} asymmetrically are called spoilerons and can affect an aircraft's roll.|$|R
40|$|<b>Spoilers</b> on {{tail boom}} {{significantly}} improve yaw control in both {{right and left}} sidewinds. <b>Spoilers</b> are two thin plates extending outward, perpendicular to curvature of boom, distance of about 6 percent of total depth of tail boom. Along-the-boom dimensions of <b>spoilers</b> are {{as long as possible}} without interfering with such existing critical parts as tail rotor. Further enhancement, <b>spoilers</b> made retractable and automatically deployable as required. Concept applicable to all single-rotor helicopters. Applied as simple economical addition to existing helicopters or incorporated into new helicopter designs...|$|R
5|$|For the 2013 {{model year}} revision, Aston made minor {{changes to the}} {{bodywork}} by adapting designs from the Virage, including enlarging the recessed headlight clusters with bi-xenon lights and LED daytime strips, widening the front splitter, updating the grille and side heat extractors, updating the LED rear lights with clear lenses and integrating a new rear <b>spoiler</b> with the boot lid.|$|E
5|$|Stephanie Brown, {{formerly}} the <b>Spoiler</b> and briefly the fourth Robin, {{takes up the}} mantle of Batgirl after Cassandra Cain gives Brown her costume under Batman's order. Eventually, Barbara Gordon approves of Brown as her newest successor — and she gives Brown her own Batgirl costume and becomes her mentor for a period. Brown is the fourth in-continuity Batgirl and the second Batgirl to star in her own ongoing Batgirl comic book series.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for <b>spoiler</b> operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
50|$|These whale tail car <b>spoilers</b> of the Porsche 911 {{caught on}} as a fashion statement, and the term {{has been used}} to refer to large rear <b>spoilers</b> on a number of automobiles, {{including}} Ford Sierra RS, Focus, Chevrolet Camaro, and Saab 900. Whale tail <b>spoilers</b> also appear at the rear of tricycles, trucks, boats, and other vehicles.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{conceptual}} and optical {{design for the}} Next Linear Collider post-linac collimation system. Energy collimation and passive protection against off-energy beams are achieved in a system with large horizontal dispersion and vertical betatron functions. Betatron collimation is performed in a relatively low-beta (FODO-like) lattice in which only thin <b>spoilers</b> intercept particles near the beam core, while thick absorbers maintain a large stay-clear from the beam. Two possible schemes for the <b>spoilers</b> are considered: {{one in which the}} <b>spoilers</b> are capable of tolerating a certain number of damaging interceptions per collider run ("consumable" <b>spoilers),</b> and one in which the <b>spoilers</b> are potentially damaged on every machine pulse and are self-repairing ("renewable" <b>spoilers).</b> The collimation efficiency of the system is evaluated, considering both halo particles which are rescattered into the beam and muon secondaries which are passed to the interaction region. We conclude that the new design is a promising candidate for the NLC post-linac system. Comment: 3 pages 3 figures presented at LINAC 2000 conferenc...|$|R

5|$|The Fine Brothers have {{a popular}} series where they spoil {{a variety of}} topics ranging from books to films to video games. The first episode of their <b>Spoiler</b> series, 100 Movie Spoilers in 5 Minutes – (Movie Endings Ruined), was {{uploaded}} on YouTube on November 11, 2008. With over 2.7million video views as of July 28, 2014, the episode is also the most popular of the series. The brothers also uploaded a video containing spoilers of the first seven Harry Potter films in roughly seven minutes on July 13, 2011. The Fine Brothers spoiled 47 years in roughly 6 minutes of the popular series, Doctor Who, and released subsequent sequels in preparations for the premieres of series 8 & 9 respectively. Other TV shows that have had <b>spoiler</b> videos made about them have included Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and Orange Is the New Black. Additionally, the Fine Bros put up a video each month spoiling 50 viral videos that have circulated on YouTube and other sources during the previous month.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Navy {{became the}} first team other than Hopkins to defeat Maryland since 1954. That same year marked the start of Navy's eight-year {{national}} championship streak that lasted through 1967. That season, Navy beat Maryland 10–8, before traveling to Homewood Field. There, Johns Hopkins upset Navy, 9–6, {{for the first time}} in their last ten meetings. The Blue Jays and Terrapins met for the season finale where Hopkins needed a victory to win the national title outright. Maryland acted as a <b>spoiler,</b> however, and beat Johns Hopkins, 9–5, to take a share of the championship. Hopkins went on to win or share the next four national titles.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{with the}} passing of Bob Sheppard, public address {{announcer}} for the Yankees, on July 11 at the age of 99, and principal owner and managing partner of the Yankees, George Steinbrenner, at the age of 80, both teams opened the second half at their respective stadiums with a moment of silence for Steinbrenner and Sheppard. The Red Sox, struggling to get out of third place, failed to make the playoffs {{for the second time in}} five years, but played <b>spoiler</b> during the final series of the season, knocking the Yankees out of first place in the American League East, relegating them to the wild-card for the 2010 season.|$|E

5|$|Marking a {{high point}} in terms of sales, the last-of-the-series VL Commodore sold in record numbers, finally {{managing}} to outsell the Ford Falcon in the private sector. The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and {{would be the last}} of the mid-size Commodores. Designers distanced the Commodore further away from its Opel origins, by smoothing the lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail <b>spoiler.</b> A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.|$|E
5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates <b>spoiler</b> operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear <b>spoiler,</b> body kit appendages, and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.|$|E
25|$|The Northern genre is a subgenre of Westerns {{taking place}} in Alaska or Western Canada. Examples include several {{versions}} of the Rex Beach novel, The <b>Spoilers</b> (including 1930's The <b>Spoilers,</b> with Gary Cooper, and 1942's The <b>Spoilers,</b> with Marlene Dietrich, Randolph Scott and Wayne); The Far Country (1954) with James Stewart; North to Alaska (1960) with Wayne; and Death Hunt (1981) with Charles Bronson.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{have used}} differentially controlled <b>spoilers</b> or spoilerons to provide roll instead of conventional ailerons. The {{advantage is that}} the entire trailing edge of the wing may be devoted to flaps, providing better low speed control. The Northrop P-61 Black Widow used <b>spoilers</b> in this manner, in conjunction with full span zap flaps and some modern airliners use <b>spoilers</b> to assist the ailerons.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the facilities and test procedures {{used in a}} series of wind-tunnel and full-scale flight investigations of the effectiveness of flight <b>spoilers</b> currently existing on wide-bodied transport jet aircraft when used as trailing vortex hazard alleviation devices.

It is concluded that the existing flight <b>spoilers</b> on the B- 747 are effective as trailing vortex attenuators...|$|R
5|$|HSV E Series 3 or E3 {{commenced}} {{sales in}} 2011. Model {{changes for the}} E series 3 include an option for LPI system (for an extra $5990) allowing the vehicle to run on LPG and unleaded petrol; the LPI system is not available on the ClubSport R8 Tourer. Cosmetic changes include a new <b>spoiler</b> and revised exhaust tips. HSV E Series 3 models reach 0-100kmp in 5.8 seconds. The HSV E Series 3 introduced the new HSV Enhanced Driver Interface; {{it has the same}} interface as the Holden IQ (found in VE Series II Commodores) but with added function. The system allows users to access the car's computer and monitor fuel consumption, stability, g-force and vehicle dynamics. Other functions include data logging options, digital gauge displays, stopwatch, driver and racing options, along with controls for the Grange's Bi-Modal exhaust and Side Blind-Zone Alert. The HSV Enhanced Driver Interface and satellite navigation is standard across the E series 3 range.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{entered the}} game having been {{knocked out of}} the running for the Atlantic Division title the {{previous}} week, but able to play <b>spoiler</b> for Boston College. The Eagles were playing to earn a berth to the ACC Championship Game for the second consecutive year. Additionally, competing within a closely contested ACC, Maryland could have greatly improved its standing for bowl selection with an eighth win. The Eagles were the fifth ranked team to face Maryland. The Terrapins were, to that point, 4–0 against top-25 opposition and the only team to beat four ranked opponents in 2008. Boston College was fielding second-string quarterback Dominique Davis in his first career appearance. He replaced starter Chris Crane, who had suffered a broken collarbone the previous week.|$|E
5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a roller bearing to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of <b>spoiler</b> ailerons and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft's poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in the Ames Research Center 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel to determine how porosity of wing <b>spoilers</b> on a B- 747 airplane would affect the rolling moments imposed on an aircraft following in the wake. It was found that <b>spoilers</b> with 40 percent porosity and hole diameter to thickness ratio of 1. 1 were just as effective in reducing the rolling moment imposed on the follower as solid <b>spoilers,</b> for the case of two <b>spoilers</b> per wing panel (6. 4 percent semispan each) with a following model whose span was 20 percent of the span of the generator. When a larger following model was tested, whose span was 50 percent of that of the generator, {{the effectiveness of the}} two <b>spoilers</b> per wing was substantially reduced...|$|R
50|$|Airbus {{aircraft}} with fly-by-wire control utilise wide-span <b>spoilers</b> for descent control, spoilerons, gust alleviation, {{and lift}} dumpers. Especially on landing approach, the full width of <b>spoilers</b> {{can be seen}} controlling the aircraft's descent rate and bank.|$|R
50|$|From their {{performance}} study and simulator tests, the NTSB {{concluded that the}} <b>spoilers</b> must have been extended to at least the flight detent position during the rapid descent that preceded the stall. It was thus likely that when the Captain attempted to level off and then to go-around, the crew failed to immediately retract the <b>spoilers</b> which {{made it all the}} more difficult to recover from the stall before ground impact. Although the <b>spoilers</b> were found to be fully retracted in the wreckage, it was possible that the <b>spoilers</b> could have retracted on their own {{as a result of the}} impact forces and loss of hydraulic pressure.|$|R
