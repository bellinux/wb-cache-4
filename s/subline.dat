40|$|We have {{isolated}} from Chinese hamster ovary cells, 30 <b>sublines</b> resistant to vincristine, doxorubicin or etoposide and 43 <b>sublines</b> evading treatment {{with a pair}} of these drugs. Isolated in one step and under low selective pressure, <b>sublines</b> were 3 - to 25 -fold more resistant to their selecting drug(s) than the parental cells. Possible P-glycoprotein-associated multidrug resistance was investigated through pgp gene copy number and mRNA expression level. DNA topoisomerase II alteration was evaluated from the ability of nuclear extracts to form cleavable complexes. Vincristine (all <b>sublines)</b> and doxorubicin (6 / 7 <b>sublines)</b> preferentially selected for pgp gene amplification and mRNA overexpression, whereas selection with etoposide resulted in a decrease of cleavable complex formation in 11 out of 13 <b>sublines.</b> A common pgp gene-mediated resistance was found in the 13 doxorubicin plus vincristine-selected <b>sublines,</b> whereas {{all but one of the}} 12 etoposide plus vincristine-resistant <b>sublines</b> displayed both pgp mRNA overexpression and decreased ability to form cleavable complexes. Among the 18 doxorubicin plus etoposide selected <b>sublines,</b> five exhibited a decreased ability to form cleavable complexes only, six exhibited pgp mRNA overexpression only and six exhibited both alterations. Overall, drug resistance could not be attributed to either mechanism in three of the 73 <b>sublines.</b> We conclude that under low selective pressure it is possible to find a combination of drugs which require simultaneous selection of more than one resistance mechanism; such cells emerge with very low frequency...|$|R

We have found that the protein is directed toward lysosomes in the <b>sublines,</b> where it is degraded. This defect in the secretory pathway correlates with loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids from cellular lipids, and with the lack of expression of endophilin-I and CtBP/BARS, enzymes that regulate vesicle fission by catalyzing the acylation of arachidonate into lysophosphatidic acid.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore whether 99 mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile(MIBn is {{suitable}} for elucidation of multidrug resistance and prediction ofpotentiation of antitumor agents by MDRI inhibitors in malignant tumor cells. Tumor cells (RG 2 and C 6 gliomas, Walker 256 mammary carcinoma) were continuouslyincubated with low dose vincristine to induce and maintain multidrug resistance. MTT assays demonstrated significant increases of surviving fractions in all vincristne(VCR) -resistant <b>sublines</b> as compared with those of drug-naive cell lines. Double-labelaccumulation studies (99 mTc-MIBI, 14 C-TdR) were performed in all drug-naive celllines and VCR-resistant <b>sublines.</b> In all VCR-resistant <b>sublines,</b> RT-PCR revealed higherexpression of MDRI mRNA as compared with drug-naive cell lines. 99 mTc-MIBIaccumulation in VCR-resistant <b>sublines</b> expressing higher levels of MDRI mRNA wassignificantly lower than in drug-naive cell lines expressing lower levels of MDRI mRNA. However, there were no significant differences in cell proliferation as measured by 14 CTdRaccumulation rate. 99 mTc-MIBI accumulation is negatively correlated with MDRImRNA levels among drug-naive cell lines and VCR-resistant <b>sublines.</b> These findingsindicated that the development of drug resistance was associated with enhanced 99 mTcMIBIextrusion. After pretreatment with MDRI inhibitors (verapamil, cyclosporin A,FK 506), surviving fractions of all VCR-resistant <b>sublines</b> significantly decreased ascompared with those of non-treated VCR-resistant <b>sublines.</b> MTT assays revealedenhanced effects on VCR cytotoxity following pretreatment with MDRI inhibitors. ggmTc-MIBI accumulation significantly increased after one-hour pretreatment withMDRI inhibitors in all VCR-resistant <b>sublines.</b> In contrast, there were no significantdifferences in MDRI mRNA levels between non-treated and MDRI inhibitor-treatedVCR-resistant <b>sublines.</b> MDRI inhibitors had no significant effects on cell proliferationas measured by 14 C-TdR accumulation rate. These findings indicated that MIBI-dependentmechanisms allowing VCR extrusion were functionally inhibited by MDRI inhibitors. ggmTc-MIBI may be a suitable imaging agent for detecting MDRI-mediated drugresistance and for monitoring therapeutic effects of MDRI inhibitors in malignanttumors. ggmTc-MIBI SPECT is expected to provide more definitive criteria for monitoringmultidrug resistance and for predicting potentiation of antitumor agents by MDRI inhibitors in patients with malignant brain tumors...|$|R

The {{analysis of the}} spectra revealed that the structure-sensitive Raman lines ν 19 and ν 10 can be decomposed consistently into two <b>sublines</b> for all excitation wavelengths and temperatures. In the resonance region of the QO and QV bands, the 0 - 1 and 0 - 0 resonances in the excitation profiles of the low-frequency (LF) <b>sublines</b> of ν 19 and ν 10 are red-shifted by (150 (30) cm- 1 {{with respect to the}} <b>sublines</b> that are at higher frequencies (HF). In accordance with experimental and theoretical results, this indicates that the LF <b>sublines</b> of ν 19 and ν 10 result from a nonplanar conformer, whereas the HF <b>sublines</b> correspond to an almost planar conformer. The existence of this known conformational equilibrium in solution is further corroborated by the van’t Hoff behavior of the intensity ratios ILF/IHF of the <b>sublines</b> of ν 19 and ν 10. From the straight lines in the van’t Hoff plot, we calculate that the nonplanar conformer in solution is energetically favored by about 3. 0 kJ/mol...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{molecular}} basis of resistance of multiple human leukaemia CCRF-CEM <b>sublines</b> to the novel antifolates ZD 9331, GW 1843, AG 2034, PT 523 and edatrexate, which use the reduced folate carrier (RFC) as their main cellular uptake route and that target different folate-dependent enzymes. Antifolate-resistant <b>sublines</b> established by stepwise and single-step selections displayed up to 2135 -fold resistance to the selection drug, and up to 2323 -fold cross-resistance to various hydrophilic antifolates. In contrast, these <b>sublines</b> were up to 17 - and 20 -fold hypersensitive to the lipophilic antifolates AG 377 and trimetrexate, respectively. The total reduced folate pool of these antifolate-resistant <b>sublines</b> shrunk by 87 - 96 %, resulting in up to 42 -fold increased folic acid growth requirement. These <b>sublines</b> lost 92 - 97 % of parental [(3) H]methotrexate influx rates. Genomic PCR single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and sequencing revealed {{that most of these}} drug-resistant <b>sublines</b> harboured RFC mutations that surprisingly clustered in two confined regions in exons 2 and 3. The majority of these mutations resulted in frame-shift and/or premature translation termination and lack of RFC protein expression. The remaining mutations involved single amino acid substitutions predominantly residing in the first transmembrane domain (TMD 1). Some RFC-inactivating mutations emerged during the early stages of antifolate selection and were stably retained during further drug selection. Furthermore, some <b>sublines</b> displayed a markedly decreased or abolished RFC mRNA and/or protein expression. This constitutes the first demonstration of clustering of multiple human RFC mutations in TMD 1, thereby suggesting that it plays a functional role in folate/antifolate binding and/or translocation. This is the first molecular characterization of human RFC-associated modalities of resistance to various novel antifolates in multiple leukaemia <b>sublines...</b>|$|R

The Dox resistance was accompanied by cross-resistance to vincristine (Vcr), Vp- 16 and for U 1285 - 100 also to cisplatinum. <b>Sublines</b> of U 1690 - 40 and U 1285 - 100, cultured in absence of Dox for 4 months were only partially reversed with respect to Dox resistance. Neither the parental nor the most Dox resistance <b>sublines</b> had detectable levels of mdr 1 RNA but a small fraction of cells in all cell lines stained weakly positive for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Verapamil (Ver) at 5 microM reversed the Dox resistance completely and partly in the U 1690 and U 1285 <b>sublines,</b> respectively, but did not increase the cellular accumulation of Dox. The cytoplasmic free Ca 2 + concentration (Ca 2 +i) was close to 100 nM in both parental cell lines but elevated in the U 1285 - 100 and U 1690 - 40 <b>sublines</b> by 21 and 44 %, respectively, and in U 1285 - 250 and U 1690 - 150 by 51 and 91 %, respectively. The partly reverted <b>sublines</b> still showed significant but smaller elevations in Ca 2 +i of 10 - 30 %. Ver was without acute or long term effects of Ca 2 +i in the U 1285 - 100 and U 1690 - 40 <b>sublines.</b> Selection for Dox resistance in SCLC may thus result in atypical multidrug-resistance characterised by absence of P-gp overexpression and atypical cross-resistance.

In the resistant <b>sublines,</b> upregulation of both TGFα and EGFR mRNA was observed. In an apparent contrast with upregulated growth factor and receptor gene expression, the drug resistant <b>sublines</b> displayed a reduced growth rate. Defects in the EGFR signaling pathway cascade were found in all examined drug resistant <b>sublines,</b> including altered EGF-induced Shc, Raf- 1, or mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Induction of c-fos mRNA expression by EGF was impaired in the <b>sublines</b> compared to parental MCF- 7 cells. In contrast, the induction of the stress-activated protein kinase activity was similar in both parental and drug resistant cells. Evaluating {{the link between the}} reduced growth rate and drug resistance, serum starvation experiments were performed. These studies demonstrated that a reduced proliferative activity resulted in a marked reduction in sensitivity to cytotoxic agents in the parental MCF- 7 cells. We propose that the altered EGFR levels frequently observed in drug resistant breast cancer cells are associated with perturbations in the signaling pathway that mediate a reduced proliferative rate and thereby contribute to drug resistance...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} biomarkers {{for effective}} treatment in early-phase clinical trials of spondylarthritis (SpA), by analyzing which synovial features can be reliably identified {{in patients with}} SpA. METHODS: Synovial biopsies were performed at weeks 0 and 12 in 20 SpA patients treated with infliximab, 20 treated with etanercept, and 12 who were not treated. Primary clinical outcome measures were patient and physician global assessment of disease activity. Extensive histologic evaluation included assessment of lining layer hyperplasia, vascularity, markers of cellular infiltration, and metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the lining and <b>sublining</b> layers. RESULTS: Changes in levels of CD 163 (resident tissue macrophages) in the lining, and CD 163, MMP- 3, and myeloid-related protein 14 (MRP- 14; infiltrating myeloid cells) in the <b>sublining</b> correlated significantly with changes in the primary clinical outcomes. Comparison between responders (n = 35) and nonresponders (n = 17) showed differences {{in the degree of}} change in the levels of CD 163 in the lining and CD 163, MMP- 3, and CD 3 in the <b>sublining,</b> whereas trends in change in the levels of MRP- 8 and MRP- 14 in the lining and <b>sublining</b> were similar in the 2 groups. Accordingly, the highest differences in standardized response means (SRMs) between the 2 groups were found for CD 163 in the lining, MMP- 3, CD 163, CD 3, and MRP- 8 in the <b>sublining,</b> and the level of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs). When comparing treated and untreated patients, high differences in SRMs were again found for CD 163 in the lining, MMP- 3, CD 163, and MRP- 8 in the <b>sublining,</b> and PMNs. These parameters performed prognostically as well as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and better than the C-reactive protein level. Class prediction analysis yielded a 90 % correct prediction using 8 synovial parameters, as follows: lining and <b>sublining</b> CD 163, MRP- 8, and MRP- 14, <b>sublining</b> MMP- 3, and PMNs. In validation analyses with independent samples, effective treatment was correctly predicted in 24 of 30 SpA patients and in 2 of 2 placebo-treated patients. CONCLUSION: Changes in synovial macrophage subsets, PMN levels, and MMP- 3 expression reflect response to treatment in SpA. The ability of these parameters to correctly identify effective therapy makes them interesting biomarkers for use in early-phase clinical trials in Sp...|$|R
40|$|The cells used in {{this study}} are <b>sublines</b> of a {{transformed}} mouse L cell line (designated H 2) that carries the herpes simplex virus (HSV) gene for thymidine kinase (tk) as well as other viral genetic information acquired after exposure of the parental Ltk- cells to UV-irradiated HSV type 1. These <b>sublines</b> of the H 2 cell line were isolated by cloning under nonselective conditions and were shown to express widely different levels of viral tk. Selective media were used to isolate phenotypically tk- and tk+ variants in sequence from one of the clonal derivatives. As previously reported, superinfection of the tk+ cell lines with tk- HSV type 1 resulted in enhancement of tk activity. A new finding was that viral tk activity could be induced by superinfection in at least 30 % of cells from the phenotypically tk- <b>sublines,</b> indicating that a functional viral tk gene was retained in a significant proportion of the cells. Experiments were designed to test for the presence of regulatory factors that could influence tk expression in the nonsuperinfected <b>sublines</b> of H 2. Absence of freely diffusible regulatory factors was indicated by the finding that the fusion of phenotypically tk- and tk+ cells and untransformed cells in appropriate combinations did not affect the levels of tk detected. Moreover, there was no evidence for the presence in phenotypically tk+ transformed cells of HSV-specific regulatory factors that could influence expression of tk from a superinfecting viral genome. Phenotypically tk+ <b>sublines</b> of H 2 were found to differ from the phenotypically tk- <b>sublines</b> and from untransformed cells in that the tk+ cells synthesized viral proteins earlier and produced greater yields of infectious HSV progeny after superinfection with wild-type tk+ virus. We can conclude that the absence of tk expression in the tk- H 2 <b>sublines</b> cannot be accounted for by rearrangements or loss of DNA sequences encoding the enzyme itself or of sequences necessary for induction of the gene by superinfecting HSV. Moreover, it appears that the expression of tk in the tk+ H 2 <b>sublines</b> correlates with the presence of some factor that can enhance (or the absence of some factor that can depress) HSV replication and gene expression...|$|R
