We focus on two aspects of the problem. First, we investigate the estimation of the agent 2 ̆ 7 s location by using nonlinear sensing modalities, in particular that of range-only sensing, and formulate a control strategy based on improving this estimation using one or more robots working to independently gather information. Second, we develop methods to plan and <b>sequence</b> <b>robot</b> deployments that will establish and maintain line-of-sight chains for communication between the independent agent and the fixed base station using a minimum number of robots. These methods will lead to feedback control laws that can realize this plan and ensure proper navigation and collision avoidance. ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{important}} {{trends in}} developing innovative and efficient approaches for improving plant productivity are cellular manufacturing and robotics. The proliferation of robot technology is {{an outcome of}} increasing industrial automation especially in engineering and electronics. Robots offer substantial gains in manufacturing productivity, particularly when integrated into an automated system. Robotic cells involve the use of robots to feed machines in manufacturing cells. The factors affecting the performance of such systems include <b>sequencing</b> <b>robot</b> moves, <b>sequencing</b> parts, buffering, and cell design. This thesis addresses the problem of <b>sequencing</b> <b>robot</b> moves in a two machine manufacturing cell {{in the presence of}} a buffer. We develop cycle time formulae using a state space approach. We adopt analytical methods for determining the optimal cycle time of a two-machine robotic cell with a single buffer producing identical parts. We also evaluate the effectiveness of buffering in reducing the cycle time. We extend our research to the robotic cell producing multiple part types. We consider the production of a quantity known as minimal part set (MPS) for multiple part types, to be compatible with the recent trend toward just-in-time manufacturing. Our objective is to identify optimal <b>robot</b> move <b>sequences</b> for a pre-determined arrangement of parts in a minimal part set. We accomplish our goal by developing a branch-and-bound algorithm. We also provide a comparative analysis for scenarios with and without a buffer to establish the usefulness of a buffer...|$|R
40|$|Research in Human-Robot {{interaction}} {{stresses the}} importance of non verbal behaviours in order to enforce credibility and believability in robots. When using small and cheap entertainment robots, verbal cues are very limited, gaze and facial gestures can be absent, whereas body gestures comprise – {{as a matter of fact}} – only stereotyped behaviours. The main contribution of this article is an evaluation study about the effects of pure body gestures when entertainment robots are observed by humans in an interaction process. Robots are required to execute a sequence of behaviours, as if they were playing on a stage. To this aim, a model for composing behaviour primitives for entertainment humanoid robots using AND/OR graphs is presented. Both single and multi robot scenarios are considered. The framework can <b>sequence</b> <b>robot</b> behaviours using complex scripts, which can be easily programmed using standard ontology-based knowledge representation mechanisms. Procedures are used to operate on the ontology representation in order to execute behaviours in a fully hierarchical and recursive fashion.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{systematic}} generation of simple and composite schedules {{for a large}} class of manufacturing cells is presented. The generated schedules can easily be transformed into timed Petri net models, and these models evaluated using one of methods developed for analysis of timed Petri nets, for example, invariant analysis. Performance characterization (the cycle time or the throughput) obtained in this way {{can be used for}} optimization of the cell's performance. 1. INTRODUCTION Manufacturing cells (or robotic cells) are groups of machines with a robot that performs cyclic sequences of pickup, move, load, unload and drop operations, transporting the manufactured parts from one machine of the cell to another [1, 2]. This cyclic <b>sequence</b> of <b>robot</b> activities is called a schedule.

Denoting τ _i ^a as the arriving time of a robot at P_i, the waiting time must be c^w=| τ _α ^a - τ _β ^a | to satisfy the constraint EC 2. If τ _α ^a < τ _β ^a, robot R_k waits for c^w at the inspection position of P_α until robot R_s arrives at the inspection position of P_β; otherwise robot R_s waits for c^w at the inspection position of P_β until robot R_k arrives at the inspection position of P_α. The “best” position is the position that provides the least waiting time for performing this cooperative task, which is calculated by enumerating all possible positions of the task <b>sequences</b> of <b>robots</b> R_s.

Two skilled operators manually controlled the robot, {{and they can}} obtain robot state information by observing monitor and {{communicate with each other}} to cooperatively control robot. We hope the arms will not contact with the ground during the experiment of CCM mode. In real world, the violent collisions between robot parts and ground may break robot, and therefore we should avoid these kind of collisions. In consideration of the collision is inevitable if all of the four arms in lower position, we lifted rear arms during our experiment. Because the front arms will not collide with ground, to reduce the interference of COG position caused by lifting arms, we keep the front arms in the original positions.

Just one operator controlled robot movement direction, while the gait adjusting and step climbing were automatically controlled by system. Both of CCM and CLM were tested five times.|$|R

In addition, the difference between the traveling sequences of active and passive sub-crawlers lies {{in the manner in which}} the rear sub-crawlers are utilized. Passive sub-crawlers can only rotate using gravity; consequently, no downward power to lift the robot body is generated. Adopting passive sub-crawlers has many advantages. It can reduce the number of high-torque motors, reduce the robot weight, and save energy. The relationship between the traversing condition and the sub-crawlers’ restricting angle is reported in another paper.|$|R
