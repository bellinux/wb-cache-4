40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Problem: The current {{national}} {{focus on}} college student success highlights {{the need to}} increase the graduation rates of students of color. To date, qualitative research has shown benefits from Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> such as higher levels of student achievement, engagement and involvement, validation, mattering, {{and a sense of}} belonging for students of color. However, quantitative research examining the aggregate student data relating to Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>course</b> completion and college student success has not been conducted. Purpose: This quantitative study seeks to determine if there is a relationship between students of color completing Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> and graduating from a predominantly White institution. Setting: The research took place at a large, public research university in the Pacific Northwest. Methodology: Data for almost 5, 000 students of color were obtained from the Registrar; SPSS was used to run chi-square tests for independence for three research questions: 1. Is there an association between students of color completing Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> and graduating? 2. Is there an association between the number of Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> completed by students of color and graduation? 3. Is there an association between students of color completing Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> and time-to-degree? Findings: A statistically significant association between completing Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> and graduating was found for students of color; students who did not complete Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> graduated at lower rates and those who completed Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> graduated at higher rates. Taking zero Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> and taking one Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>course</b> were the most significant contributors to the finding of an association, although in some cases completing two and three or more courses was also related. The association held when looking at students who did not graduate and those who graduated in more than four years, although there was not a significant association between completing Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> and graduating in four years or less. Conclusions: An association does not equal causation, yet the association found between students of color completing Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> and graduating shows that it is possible that Ethnic <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> are contributing to student success, as has been found in previous research. Additional research is needed to further understand the association that was found...|$|R

Since the Mexican American <b>studies</b> <b>course</b> {{was the only}} course in Arizona to be banned, {{it became clear that}} the bill had targeted the one course. This lead the court to find the bill to be partially unconstitutional as it did not require similar Mexican American <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> outside of the Tucson Unified School District to cease teaching the courses. The bill also did not ban African American <b>Studies</b> <b>courses</b> that were being taught.|$|R

500|$|Eager {{to further}} his education, Ross entered the Preparatory Department at Baylor University (then in Independence, Texas) in 1856, {{despite the fact}} that he was several years older than most of the other students. He {{completed}} the two-year <b>study</b> <b>course</b> in oneyear. Following his graduation, he enrolled at Wesleyan University in Florence, Alabama. The Wesleyan faculty originally deemed his mathematics knowledge so lacking, they refused his admittance; the decision was rescinded after a professor agreed to tutor Ross privately in the subject. At Wesleyan, students lived with prominent families instead of congregating in dormitories, thus giving them [...] "daily exposure to good manners and refinement". Ross lived with the family of his tutor.|$|E
500|$|After the United States {{entered the}} {{conflict}} in December 1941, Fortune began assembling plans for the post-war period, believing it would mark the dawning of the Age of Aquarius. In the spring of 1942 the Fraternity recommenced the Guild's Sunday services, and in March 1943 Fortune announced a new <b>study</b> <b>course</b> for aspiring members. As part of her plans for the post-war period, Fortune began mooting the idea of bringing together all of Europe's occultists to pool their knowledge. She also began discussing the possibility of uniting occult groups with the Spiritualist movement, writing articles that were more favourable towards Spiritualist mediums than she had previously been and meeting with Charles Richard Cammell, the editor of Light—the magazine of the College of Psychic Studies—who then published a favourable article about her. By at least 1942, Fortune corresponded with the prominent occultist and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley, praising him as [...] "a genuine adept" [...] despite the many differences between their respective occult philosophies. She later visited him {{at his home in}} Hastings, with Crowley's assistant Kenneth Grant noting that the pair got along well.|$|E
40|$|This article {{assesses the}} {{relationship}} between enrollment in Black <b>studies</b> <b>courses,</b> political ideology, and self-esteem in Black college students. Although {{a number of studies}} have focused on racial identity and self-esteem, few have investigated how a race-first political consciousness among African Americans develops and whether it is related to healthier psychological outcomes. To elucidate {{the relationship between}} Black nationalism, Black <b>studies</b> <b>courses,</b> and self-esteem, 231 students from an historically Black college in the Southeast are sampled. Preliminary analysis indicates enrollment in Black <b>studies</b> <b>courses</b> is related to nationalism and self-esteem. However, subsequent regression analysis controlling for classification indicates enrollment in Black <b>studies</b> <b>courses</b> is not a significant predictor of self-esteem or Black nationalism. Black nationalism predicted self-esteem, and older African American students reported higher nationalism scores. The findings suggest early exposure to Black <b>studies</b> <b>courses</b> among students may prove beneficial and predictive of psychological well-being in African American college students...|$|R

The policy of the Nambassa Trust was to attempt to create an ambiance which would dispel all religious factionalism, so that philosophical labels could dissipate enabling people of all religious persuasion to share in their most common fundamental of traits, their humanity. In maintaining Nambassa's nonsectarian and open door policy on religious philosophy, workshops were conducted on: Hinduism, Hare Krishna, Bible scholarship and born again Christianity, Roman Catholic Church, [...] Judaism, Ananda Marga, Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Krishna-Haribol, Sufism, Esoteric Christianity, shamanism, Wicca, and Zen.|$|E
