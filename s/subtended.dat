5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram <b>subtended</b> by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers {{may be used}} {{to provide}} {{accurate}} distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter <b>subtended</b> by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a supermassive black hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.|$|E

50|$|This {{derivation}} {{corresponds to}} the Third Theoremas chronicled by Copernicus following Ptolemy in Almagest. In particular if the sides of a pentagon (<b>subtending</b> 36° at the circumference) and of a hexagon (<b>subtending</b> 30° at the circumference) are given, a chord <b>subtending</b> 6° may be calculated. This was a critical step in the ancient method of calculating tables of chords.|$|R

25|$|If {{a central}} angle and an inscribed angle {{of a circle}} are <b>subtended</b> by the same chord and {{on the same side}} of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.|$|E

25|$|Two {{types of}} single-arch dams are in use, namely the constant-angle and the constant-radius dam. The constant-radius type employs the same face radius at all {{elevations}} of the dam, {{which means that}} as the channel grows narrower towards {{the bottom of the}} dam the central angle <b>subtended</b> by the face of the dam becomes smaller. Jones Falls Dam, in Canada, is a constant radius dam. In a constant-angle dam, also known as a variable radius dam, this <b>subtended</b> angle is kept a constant and the variation in distance between the abutments at various levels are taken care of by varying the radii. Constant-radius dams are much less common than constant-angle dams. Parker Dam on the Colorado River is a constant-angle arch dam.|$|E
25|$|In geography, the {{location}} of any point on the Earth can be identified using a geographic coordinate system.

25|$|In {{astronomy}} a {{phase curve}} describes {{the brightness of}} a reflecting body {{as a function of}} its phase angle. The brightness usually refers the object's absolute magnitude, which, in turn, is its apparent magnitude at a distance of one astronomical unit from the Earth and Sun.

25|$|Vehicles {{that are}} {{approaching}} an intersection {{from beyond the}} <b>subtended</b> angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT) limit may be perceived with subjective constancy by the stopped driver; which means the oncoming vehicle cannot be reliably distinguished between moving or parked or give insight to time-to-collision, {{though they may be}} traveling at such an imprudent speed as to pose an immediate hazard. An entering driver must have fair notice that his or her contemplated conduct is forbidden by such hazard for it to be illegal.|$|E
25|$|The parsec {{is defined}} as being equal {{to the length of}} the longer leg of an {{extremely}} elongated imaginary right triangle in space. The two dimensions on which this triangle is based are its shorter leg, of length one astronomical unit (the average Earth-Sun distance), and the <b>subtended</b> angle of the vertex opposite that leg, measuring one arcsecond. Applying the rules of trigonometry to these two values, the unit length of the other leg of the triangle (the parsec) can be derived.|$|E

25|$|Willebrord Snellius (1580–1626) {{found the}} {{mathematical}} law of refraction, {{now known as}} Snell's law, in 1621. Subsequently René Descartes (1596–1650) showed, by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes' law), that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42° (i.e. the angle <b>subtended</b> at the eye by {{the edge of the}} rainbow and the rainbow's centre is 42°). He also independently discovered the law of reflection, and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.|$|E
25|$|Flowers {{occur in}} the {{dome-shaped}} head characteristic of B.ser. Dryandra. These occur {{at the end of}} branches, either alone or in clusters, and are <b>subtended</b> by leaves. They are orange-yellow in colour, and up to three centimetres in diameter. Each head contain from 50 to 70 flowers, arranged in a ring about a central hollow, in the manner normally associated with members of the former series Dryandra ser. Niveae. This is surrounded by a great many involucral bracts that are narrow and taper to a long point.|$|E
25|$|The eye has acuity {{limits for}} {{detecting}} motion. Forward motion {{is limited by}} the <b>subtended</b> angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT), and horizontal and vertical motion acuity are limited by lateral motion thresholds. The lateral motion limit is generally below the looming motion limit, and for an object of a given size, lateral motion becomes the more insightful of the two, once the observer moves sufficiently far away from the path of travel. Below these thresholds subjective constancy is experienced in accordance with the Stevens' power law and Weber–Fechner law.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{the mean}} {{pressure}} distributions and Strouhal numbers on partially grooved cylinders with different groove <b>subtend</b> angles were made over a Reynolds number range of 2. 0 × 104 to 1. 3 × 105 which was within the subcritical regime of smooth cylinder. The Strouhal number, pressure distributions, and their respective coefficients {{were found to be}} a function of the groove <b>subtend</b> angles. In general, a progressive shift of the flow regime to lower Reynolds number was observed with higher <b>subtend</b> angle and a <b>subtend</b> angle of 75 deg was found for optimum drag reduction. With the configuration of asymmetrical groove surface, lower drag, and higher lift coefficients were obtained within the same Reynolds number range. Wake traverse and boundary layer results of the asymmetric grooved cylinder indicated that the flows at the smooth and groove surfaces lied within different flow regimes and a downward shift of the wake. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|While {{alternative}} versions {{had been}} developed before him, by Eduard Jäger von Jaxtthal and others, Snellen developed his eponymous eye chart in 1862 to measure visual acuity, which rapidly become the global standard. The most significant innovation was his use {{of what he called}} optotypes, specially designed characters generated on a 5x5 grid, rather than using standard fonts. They provide a physical standard measure that could be used when printing the chart. Standard vision was measured as the ability to correctly read a line of optotype characters when they <b>subtended</b> 5 minutes of arc and were separated by 1 minute of arc.|$|E
25|$|Paeonia daurica is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant {{belonging to the}} peony family. It has slender carrot-shaped roots, leaves mostly consisting of nine leaflets, with one flower per stem. The flower is <b>subtended</b> by none to two leafy bracts, and has two or three sepals, five to eight petals, and many stamens. The subspecies vary in the colour of the petals (white, light yellow, pink, red), {{the size and shape}} of the leaflets, and the hairiness of the leaflets and the carpels. Paeonia daurica can be found from the Balkans to Iran, and the Crimea to Lebanon, with the centre of its distribution in the Caucasus. It is also cultivated as an ornamental.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of effort}} has been put into {{controlling}} cell selectivity. For example, {{attempts have been made}} to modify and optimize the physicochemical parameters of the peptides to control the selectivities, including net charge, helicity, hydrophobicity per residue (H), hydrophobic moment (μ) and the angle <b>subtended</b> by the positively charged polar helix face (Φ). Other mechanisms like the introduction of D-amino acids and fluorinated amino acids in the hydrophobic phase are believed to break the secondary structure and thus reduce hydrophobic interaction with mammalian cells. It has also been found that Pro→Nlys substitution in Pro-containing β-turn antimicrobial peptides was a promising strategy for the design of new small bacterial cell-selective antimicrobial peptides with intracellular mechanisms of action. It has been suggested that direct attachment of magainin to the substrate surface decreased nonspecific cell binding and led to improved detection limit for bacterial cells such as Salmonella and E. coli.|$|E
