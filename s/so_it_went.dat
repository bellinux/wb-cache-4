25|$|On 29 April 1979, Fylkesbilene {{opened its}} {{combined}} bus station and train station at Steinkjer Station. It {{was the first}} such combined station in Norway, having cost NOK3.7 million. In 1981, Fylkesbilene bought Arne Bruem's concessions and buses that operated the town bus in Steinkjer. From 1 September 1985, the infrastructure was upgrade and higher frequency introduced. The yellow Buster buses were introduced on the town routes in 1991. A garage was opened in Kolvereid in 1979, costing NOK1.5 million. From 15 September 1983, Fylkesbilene started distribution of food produce from the cooperatives Namdalsmeieriet, Bøndenes Salgslag and Gartnerhallen to food stores in Namdalen, in a cooperation to reduce transport costs. In Verdalsøra, the company opened a bus station at Verdal Station on 1 October 1983 for NOK2 million. In 1985, the bus route from Ytre Namdal was moved, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to Grong instead of Namsos.|$|E

Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Johnson clinched his fifth pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 31.049. He was joined on the grid's front row by Scott Speed. Marcos Ambrose qualified third, Martin took fourth and Stewart started fifth. Harvick, Newman, Greg Biffle, Bill Elliott and Bowyer completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Kurt Busch, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twelfth, while Jeff Gordon set the twentieth fastest time. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Dave Blaney, Mike Skinner, Max Papis and David Stremme.

500|$|The film's story {{originated}} from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind {{over a period}} of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only [...] "a feeling" [...] and the title Blue Velvet, Lynch told Cineaste in 1987. The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. [...] "I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else... The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect," [...] Lynch remarked in an interview. The third idea was Bobby Vinton's classic rendition of the song Blue Velvet and [...] "the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time." [...] Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that [...] "there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> away for a while." ...|$|E

The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. Adermann scored 19 points, more than any other player in the match, and was a key factor in Germany winning 58-44. [...] "Most of my shots weren’t even any crazy shots or any outside shots,” Adermann said. [...] "They were the same shots I took in the others games, but I played more in this game, and I had many more easy opportunities getting into the paint." [...] "I’m always one of the shooters, but I think Australia underestimated me and didn’t defend me {{as well as some of}} the other girls.

2500|$|Chemical {{substitution}} or modification in the three-aromatic-ring {{backbone of}} the DATA compounds had substantial effect on the activity. R120393, a DATA analog, was designed with a chloroindole part in wing I to expand interactions with the side chain of conserved W229 of the polymerase primer grip loop. R120393 had similar effect as R106168 against most of the NNRTI-resistant mutants. [...] The cloroindole part interacted with the hydrophobic core of the pocket and influenced the binding mode of the R120393 <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> deeper into the pocket compared to the wing I position of other DATA analogs. Crystal structures showed that the DATA compounds could bind the NNIBP in different conformations. The capability to bind in multible modes made the NNRTIs stronger against drug-resistance mutations. Variability between the inhibitors could be seen when the chemical composition, size of wing I and the two linker groups connecting the rings were altered. The potency of the NNRTIs changed when the triazine nitrogen atoms were substituted with carbons.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{remained}} tied 1–1 {{through the}} ninth inning, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to extra innings. In {{the top of}} the 11th, Briggs led off with a line drive single up the middle, which Cliff Bell attempted to catch, hurting his hand. After Bell walked Stephens, Kansas City brought in Drake as a relief pitcher. The next batter, Carr, singled to left-center and Briggs attempted to score from second, but was out on George Johnson's throw to the plate. According to The Chicago Defender, [...] "in tagging Briggs, he [...] pulled him two feet off and away from the plate for an out. The crowd rose enmasse to cheer. It was indeed a great play as well as a great peg by Johnston." [...] However, the next batter, Mackey, singled to center and scored Stephens from second, giving Hilldale the lead. In the bottom of the inning, McNair reached with one out on an infield single. He then stole second, and Moore tripled to right, scoring McNair. But when the next batter, Joseph, hit a ground ball to third, Judy Johnson was able to bluff Moore back to third before throwing Joseph out. Hawkins then grounded out to short, ending the inning with a 2–2 tie.|$|E

Finally, after five grueling rounds, Hug was ruled the victor by split decision. In the final, he went up against Mike Bernardo, the South African power puncher who had knocked him out twice previously. It was not to be three-in-a-row for Bernardo, however, as a combination of fatigue and Hug's low kicks began to wear him down in the second round. Bernardo went down from a roundhouse kick to his left thigh but got back to his feet only for Hug to deliver one of the most spectacular stoppages of the 1990s, landing the [...] "Hug Tornado" [...] on Bernardo's already-injured left leg to put him away and clinch the coveted K-1 World Grand Prix Championship.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 October 1924, {{just four}} days before the election, the Daily Mail {{reported}} that a letter had come into its possession which purported to be a letter sent from Grigory Zinoviev, the President of the Communist International, to the British representative on the Comintern Executive. The letter was dated 15 September and so before the dissolution of parliament; it stated that it was imperative for the agreed treaties between Britain and the Bolsheviks to be ratified urgently. The letter said that those Labour members who could apply pressure on the government should do <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>went</b> on to say that a resolution {{of the relationship between the}} two countries would [...] "assist in the revolutionising of the international and British proletariat ... make it possible for us to extend and develop the ideas of Leninism in England and the Colonies". The government had received the letter before the publication in the newspapers and had protested to the Bolsheviks' London chargé d'affaires and had already decided to make public the contents of the letter with details of the official protest but had not been swift-footed enough. [...] Historians mostly agree the letter was a forgery, but it closely reflected attitudes current in the Comintern. In any case, it had little impact on the Labour vote, which actually increased. It was the collapse of the Liberal Party that led to the Conservative landslide. However, many Labourites for years blamed their defeat on the Letter by misunderstanding the political forces at work. Despite all that had gone on, the result of the election was not disastrous for Labour. The Conservatives were returned decisively gaining 155 seats for a total of 413 members of parliament. Labour lost 40 seats but held on to 151. The Liberals lost 118 seats (leaving them with only 40) and their vote fell by over a million. The real significance of the election was that the Liberals, whom Labour had displaced as the second largest political party in 1922, were now clearly the third party.|$|E
