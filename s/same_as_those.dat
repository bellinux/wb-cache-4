5|$|No coins {{were issued}} {{with the name}} of Æthelred or Æthelflæd on them, but in the 910s silver pennies were minted in west Mercian towns with unusual {{ornamental}} designs on the reverse and this may have reflected Æthelflæd's desire to distinguish specie issued under her control from that of her brother. After her death, west Mercian coin reverses were again the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> on coins produced in Wessex.|$|E
5|$|One {{of these}} two queens might have been Reptynub, the only known consort of Nyuserre.

Pieces of relief from the tomb of vizier Ptahshepses give the titles of a queen and while her name is lost, these titles are the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> that Reptynub bore, leading Egyptologists to propose that these refer to her.|$|E

These colours were purple over green, in a diamond shape, although a border of gray in an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval shape designated the battalion as part of the 8th Division.|$|E
5|$|Planetary geologists have {{measured}} the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in {{samples from the}} Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun, {{believed to be the}} <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> of the primordial solar nebula. Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Primera Junta {{was finally}} established. It was {{composed}} by president Cornelio Saavedra, members Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, Domingo Matheu and Juan Larrea, and secretaries Juan José Paso and Mariano Moreno. The rules governing it were roughly the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> issued the day before, {{with the additional}} provisions that the Cabildo would watch over {{the members of the}} Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and the ringing of bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.|$|E

5|$|The brigade's next {{operation}} {{was scheduled for}} early September 1944. Codenamed Comet, the plan called for the 1st Airborne Division's three brigades to land in the Netherlands and capture three river crossings. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave and finally the River Rhine at Arnhem. The objective of the 4th Parachute Brigade would be the bridge at Grave. Planning for Comet was well advanced when on the 10September the mission was cancelled. Instead, a new operation, Market Garden, was proposed whose objectives were the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> of Comet but would this time {{be carried out by}} three divisions of the 1st Allied Airborne Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} and longest arc was Fraternité; {{the faintest}} was Courage. The normal optical {{depths of the}} arcs are estimated to lie in the range 0.03–0.09 (0.034±0.005 for {{the leading edge of}} Liberté arc as measured by stellar occultation); the radial widths are approximately the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> of the continuous ring—about 30km. The equivalent depths of arcs vary in the range 1.25–2.15km (0.77±0.13km for the leading edge of Liberté arc). The fraction of dust in the arcs is from 40% to 70%. The arcs in the Adams ring are somewhat similar to the arc in Saturn's G ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem had}} already been solved by Pontecorvo in 1968. In 1959, a {{powerful}} accelerator (that was never built) was being designed, and he began considering experiments that could be performed with it. He contemplated a project investigating muons. Julian Schwinger had hypothesised that particles experience the weak interaction through exchanging W bosons. The W boson would not be discovered until 1983, but a problem immediately surfaced. Gerald Feinberg pointed out that this implied that some interactions {{that had never been}} observed should occur, but conceded that this was only true if the neutrinos associated with electrons were the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> associated with muons.|$|E

5|$|Upon formation, the {{battalion}} was {{placed under the}} command of Lieutenant Colonel John Crawford, who had previously served in the Militia and commanded the Sydney University Regiment and the 4th Battalion. The colours initially chosen for {{the battalion}}'s Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> of the 17th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were black over green, in a diamond shape, although a border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; this was later changed, though, following the unit's involvement in the fighting at Tobruk, when it adopted a 'T'-shaped UCP.|$|E
5|$|According to Newman and Bressett, {{the manner}} in which the 1804 dollars were {{produced}} is proof that none were struck in 1804. They note that the Castaing machine's edging dies utilized an 'H' that was undersized in relation to the other letters, the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> used on Draped Bust dollars throughout the regular production of those coins. However, the edge lettering on all Class I 1804 dollars is deformed and partially obliterated, meaning that they were not struck in an open-collared coinage press as was used in 1804, but one which used a steel collar that was not introduced to the Mint until 1833. The deformation of the edge lettering was caused by pressure pushing the coinage metal against the steel collar containing the coin blank. Additionally, many 1804 dollars were struck in proof finish, a technique which was first employed at the Mint in 1817.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/8th Battalions, the 2/5th formed the 17th Brigade, and was {{assigned}} to the 6th Division, the first infantry division formed as part of the 2nd AIF. The colours chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>those</b> of the 5th Battalion. These colours were black over red, in a horizontal rectangular shape, although a border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion consisted of four rifle companies, from 'A' to 'D', each consisting of three platoons. These companies were supported by a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company with six specialist platoons: signals, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administrative and mortars. The battalion also had a regimental aid post attached. The battalion's personnel assembled between November 1939 and April 1940, undertaking basic training in Australia before embarking for the Middle East on 14 April 1940 aboard the transport HMT Ettrick from Port Melbourne.|$|E
