5000|$|The Flexon's <b>spring</b> <b>tongue</b> had two advantages; the {{application}} of force was progressive, and the boot returned to its neutral position when the force was released in a smoothly controlled or [...] "dampened" [...] manner (this characteristic would endear the boot to downhill racers, who didn't want to be surprised by a lively return when encountering bumps). The key was {{to ensure that the}} flexing force remained under control even with extreme bending. The result was a smooth flex that started off soft and progressively stiffened, which also eliminated Lange-bang.|$|E

Good general agreement is found below about 80 km, but above 80 km the CIRA 1986 models show discrepancies, including: (1) no <b>spring</b> <b>tongue</b> of weak westward flow at latitudes 20 - 70 deg; (2) too strong an eastward flow at 20 - 52 deg in summer; (3) too great reversal heights at 35 - 43 deg N in summer; and (4) too strong (by a factor of 2) summer and winter jets at 65 - 70 deg N...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The Middle and West Forks of Little Sheep Creek in the {{southern}} Tendoy Range have incised valleys across Cenozoic structural features exposing strata that {{range in age from}} the Mississippian to the Neoene. Paleozoic strata are 1, 349 m thick and belong to the Mission Canyon Limestone, the Big Snowy, Amsden, Quadrant, and Priosphoria FormationS. The Scott Peak Formation of the White Knob Group of Idaho is allochtononous and forms the upper plate of the Medicine Lodge thrust. Paleozoic and Triassic strata of the thesis area represent sedimentation across a transition zone between a stable craton to the east and the Cordilleran miogeosyncline to the west. Regional unconformities are recognized locally {{at the top of the}} Mission Canyon Limestone and the Phosphoria and Thaynes Formations, but not at the top o the Big Snowy, Amsden, or Quadrant Formations, Mesozoic strata have a total thickness of 1, 404 m and belong to the Dinwoody, Woodside, and Thaynes Formations, the newly recognized Gypsum <b>Spring</b> <b>Tongue</b> of the Twin Creek Formation, the Sawtooth and Rierdon Formations of the Ellis Group, the Morrison and Kootenai Formations, the Colorado Shale, and the Beaverhead Formation. Cenozoic strata are represented by the newly named Round Timber limestone (informal) of the Medicine Lodge beds (Miocene) and the Edie School rhyolite (Pliocene). Detailed stratigraphic and petrographic analyses were made of the Triassic Dinwoody, Woodside, and Thaynes Formations, the Jurassic Gypsum <b>Spring</b> <b>Tongue,</b> and the Niocene Round Timber limestone in order to determine environments of deposition. The limestones, calcareous siltstones, and silty limestones of the Dinwoody and Thaynes Formations were deposited in a shallow marine shelf environment as a result of two transgressive pulses separated by an Early Traissic regression. The Triassic seas had transgressed eastward onto the craton from the miogeosyncline. The Dinwoody arid Thaynes fauna indicate normal salinities and open marine conditions; the widespread regional distribution of the limestone-siltstone facies indicates broad equable conditions for sedimentation. Deposition was primarily a tractive process genarated by storm-driven, tidal, and long-shore currents within a maximum depth of approximately 50 m. The Early Triassic regressive phase is represented by the deposition of the variegated siltstone, sandstone, limestone, and dolomite of the Woodside Formation in a tidal flat environment. The Gypsum <b>Spring</b> <b>Tongue</b> consists of interbedded variegated siltstone, sandstone, limestone, dolomite, and limestone conglomerate that were deposited in a tidal flat and restricted marginal marine environment extending east from southwestern Montana and eastern Idaho across Wyoming arid southern Montana. The Middle Jurassic sea transgressed South across the North American continent. The Miocene Round Timber limestone was deposited in a fresh-water lake in which calcite was being deposited as encrustations on the green algae Chara and as a precipitate directly from solution. The folding and faulting within the thesis area are the result of cratonic and miogeosynclinal responses to Cretaceous-Early Tertiary orogenesis. A southwestward-plunging anticline has been refolded into northeastward-yielding, overturned, doubly-plunging folds oriented northwest-southeast. High angle reverse faults of minor displacement have occurred along the southeastern limb of Garfield anticline and within the axis of the Seybold syncline. Post-Laramide relaxation of compressional forces has caused north- and northwest-oriented normal faults that transect earlier structures. Sandstone and limestone of the Scott Peak Formation of the White Knob Group were implaced along the Medicine Lodge thrust...|$|E

I was simply determined to be utterly open with him, even though I seemed to myself like the dark picture {{of a man in}} a bog struggling to grope his way out. I dipped my fingers into a vase of wallflowers, wetted the gum, sealed down the envelope, and wrote on it this address: Mr ----, Lodging at a cottage near the Farm, North-west of Wanderslore, Beechwood, Kent. And I prayed heaven for its safe delivery.|$|R
50|$|Hummingbirds {{drink with}} their tongues by rapidly lapping nectar. Their tongues have tubes which run down their lengths {{and help the}} {{hummingbirds}} drink the nectar. While capillary action {{was believed to be}} what drew nectar into these tubes, high-speed photography has revealed that the tubes open down their sides as the tongue goes into the nectar, and then close around the nectar, trapping it so it can be pulled back into the beak. The tongue, which is forked, is compressed until it reaches nectar, then the <b>tongue</b> <b>springs</b> open, the rapid action traps the nectar and the nectar moves up the grooves, like a pump action, with capillary action not involved. Consequently, tongue flexibility enables accessing, transporting and unloading nectar.|$|R

If you had a tribe of Red Indians on the {{frontier}} of your settlement, would you take the less guard against them, because you did not put them there? Not in our parish, and what of that? They are in our county; they are in England. Has man the right, has man the power in the sight of God to draw any imaginary line of demarcation between Englishman and Englishman, especially when that line is drawn between rich and poor? England knows no line of demarcation, save the shore of the great sea; and even that her generosity is overleaping at this moment at the call of mere humanity, in bounty to sufferers by the West Indian hurricane, and by the Chicago fire. Will you send your help across the Atlantic; and deny it to the sufferers at your own doors? At least, if the rich be confined by an imaginary line across, the poor on the other side will not--they will cross it freely enough; and what they will bring with them will be concern enough of ours. Would it not be our concern if there was small- pox, scarlet fever, cholera among them? Should we not fear lest that might hurt us? Would you not bestir yourselves then? And do you not know that it is among such people as these that pestilence is always bred? And if not, is not the pestilence of the soul more subtle and more contagious than any pestilence of the body? What is the spreading power of fever to the spreading power of vice, which <b>springs</b> from <b>tongue</b> to tongue, from eye to eye, from heart to heart?

It is well termed Earth-tongue, for it <b>springs</b> in a <b>tongue</b> shape from the ground, black and glutinous." [...] Margaret Mary Plues, 1863 The club-shaped fruitbodies, which have a distinct blackish head and a more lightly colored stipe (dark brown), grow to heights ranging from 1.5 to 5 cm. The head is up to 0.7 cm tall and ranges in shape from fuse-shaped to narrowly ellipsoidal to nearly cylindrical, and is somewhat compressed on the sides. The nearly black, somewhat waxy head has a vertical groove down the middle. The stipe has a glutinous, dark grey-brown surface.The spores are smooth and cylindrical, sometimes with a slight swelling in the middle, and sometimes slightly curved; they measure 59-65 by 4-5 µm. G. glutinosum spores have between two and seven septa, although three is most typical in mature specimens. The thin-walled asci (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, eight-spored, and typically measure 200-265 µm long by 12-16 µm wide. Ascospores occupy about the upper two-thirds to three-quarters of the ascus, leaving a hyaline (transparent) base. The paraphyses, hyaline at the base and brown in the upper regions, are 4-11 µm wide, and longer than the asci. Cells {{at the end of}} the paraphyses are pear-shaped (piriform) or spherical, brownish, and measure 8-10 µm wide. The sticky material on the stipe is a gelatinous matrix made of a layer of paraphyses.|$|R
6000|$|Bartley {{hung over}} the boy with such a terror in his soul as he had never had before. He {{believed}} that he had killed him, and in this conviction came with the simultaneity of events in dreams the sense of all his blame, of which the blow given for a blow seemed the least part. He was not so wrong in that as he was wrong in what led to it. He did not abhor in himself so much the wretch who had struck his brother down as the light and empty fool who had trifled with that silly hoyden. The follies that seemed so amusing and resultless in their time had ripened to this bitter effect, {{and he knew that}} he, and not she, was mainly culpable. Her self-betrayal, however it came about, was proof that they were more serious with her than with him, and he could not plead to himself even the poor excuse that his fancy had been caught. Amidst the anguish of his self-condemnation the need to conceal what he had done occurred to him. He had been holding Bird's head in his arms, and imploring him, [...] "Henry! Henry! wake up!" [...] in a low, husky voice; but now he turned to the door and locked it, and the lie by which he should escape <b>sprang</b> to his <b>tongue.</b> [...] "He died in a fit." [...] He almost believed it as it murmured itself from his lips. There was no mark, no bruise, nothing to show that he had touched the boy. Suddenly he felt the lie choke him. He pulled down the window to let in the fresh air, and this pure breath of heaven blew into his darkened spirit and lifted there a little the vapors which were thickening in it. The horror of having to tell that lie, even if he should escape by it, all his life long, till he was a gray old man, and to keep the truth forever from his lips, presented itself to him as intolerable slavery. [...] "Oh, my God!" [...] he spoke aloud, [...] "how can I bear that?" [...] And it was in self-pity that he revolted from it. Few men love the truth for its own sake, and Bartley was not one of these; but he practised it because his experience had been that lies were difficult to manage, and that they were a burden on the mind. He was not candid; he did not shun concealments and evasions; but positive lies he had kept from, and now he could not trust one to save his life. He unlocked the door and ran out to find help; he must do that at last; he must do it at any risk; no matter what he said afterward. When our deeds and motives come to be balanced at the last day, let us hope that mercy, and not justice, may prevail.|$|R
