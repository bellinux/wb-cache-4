50|$|The University of Minnesota Extension Service {{recommends}} {{three types}} of timber bridges for wilderness lands, and suggest that a licensed engineer be hired to insure the bridge design is safe and appropriate for the site. Using fallen trees, <b>stringer</b> <b>bridges</b> can be built. Wood laminated by stress, glued, dowels, or nails lumber are good for panel bridges. New lumber and wood scavenged from buildings and railroad ties {{can be used to}} build <b>stringer</b> <b>bridges.</b> A licensed engineer can help operators design a safe, appropriate timber bridge.|$|R

50|$|The bridge {{construction}} {{is significant because}} {{it was one of}} the first truly long single-span bridges constructed in the state. Recent (at the time) improvements in I-beam fabrication allowed the construction of steel <b>stringer</b> <b>bridges</b> of extended length. Since construction, the bridge has been essentially unaltered.|$|R
5000|$|The County Road C117-Pike River Bridge is in {{excellent}} condition, and is essentially unaltered from {{when it was}} built. The bridge {{was one of the}} first trunkline bridges built that used the Michigan State Highway Department's steel stringer configuration. Of the 22 total trunkline bridges the department listed in its 1913-14 biennial report, almost half were <b>stringer</b> <b>bridges,</b> and of these Pike River Bridge is the only one to remain undemolished and unaltered. This bridge is thus significant as an early unaltered example of this important bridge structural type used in the Upper Peninsula's trunkline system.|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} an evaluation and design manual for strengthening and replacing low volume steel stringer and timber <b>stringer</b> <b>bridges.</b> An advisory panel consisting of county and municipal engineers provided {{direction for the}} development of the manual. NBI bridge data, along with results from questionnaires sent to county and municipal engineers were used to formulate the manual. Types of structures shown to have the greatest need for cost-effective strengthening methods are steel stringer and timber <b>stringer</b> <b>bridges.</b> Procedures for strengthening these two types of structures have been developed. Various types of replacement bridges have also been included so that the most cost effective solution for a deficient bridge may be obtained. The key results of this study is an extensive compilation, which can be used by county engineers, of the most effective techniques for strengthening deficient existing bridges. The replacement bridge types included have been used in numerous low volume applications in surrounding states, as well as in Iowa. An economic analysis for determining the cost-effectiveness of the various strengthening methods and replacement bridges is also an important part of the manual. Microcomputer spreadsheet software for several of the strengthening methods, types of replacement bridges and for the economic analysis has been developed, documented and presented in the manual. So the manual, Chp. 3 of the final report, can be easily located, blue divider pages have been inserted to delineate the manual from the rest of the report...|$|R

50|$|The MSHD {{standardized}} {{the designs}} of steel <b>stringer</b> <b>bridges</b> in 1905-06 and plate girder bridges in 1907-08. However, {{it was not until}} 1926, the year this bridge was built, that the department began encasing the steel girder webs in concrete. Why they did so is not entirely clear, and indeed the department abandoned the practice of encasing interior girders soon after. However, they continued encasing the exterior beams in concrete, and continued using the concrete balusters pioneered with this bridge design, and this bridge can be considered a prototype for numerous, similar bridges built by the department in the next decade. The Tahquamenon River Bridge is one of only two remaining bridges of this type in Michigan.|$|R
50|$|In 1913, {{the state}} of Michigan passed the State {{trunkline}} Act, which authorized {{the creation of a}} series of trunkline highways throughout Michigan. One such line was a north-south route through the western counties of Michigan's Upper Peninsula (Keweenaw, Houghton, Ontonagon, and Gogebic counties), tying the northern tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula to the UP's main east-west trunkline. The planned trunkline crossed both the Pike and Snake rivers near Chassell along {{the eastern side of the}} Keweenaw. The Michigan State Highway Department designed two 38 ft steel <b>stringer</b> <b>bridges,</b> designated trunkline bridges number 8 and 9, to cross the two rivers. The contract to build the two bridges was awarded to the Houghton-based Smith-Byers-Sparks Company in 1913, and the company completed construction of the bridges the next year.|$|R

5|$|The 1866 {{construction}} was considerably stronger, {{compared to the}} two previous spans, due to major renovations. The old cables that snapped {{had been replaced by}} newer, stronger ones.

40|$|In 1998, Transportation Technology Center, Inc. (TTCI), a {{subsidiary}} of the Association of American Railroads, collaborated with Texas A&M University on a program of testing timber railroad <b>bridge</b> <b>stringers</b> as part of the AAR’s Bridge Life Extension program. Included in this effort were static and dynamic tests on southern pine; Douglas fir, and glued-laminated stringers. Despite the current trend of replacing timber bridges with steel, concrete, or culvert and fill, they still comprise about one-third the inventory of Class 1 railroads. On average, these bridges are more than 40 years old, and many are currently subjected to heavy axle load operation. Replacement of these bridges is gradual, with various measures being employed to extend their useful service lives. Although other components can also determine load capacity of a timber <b>bridge,</b> <b>stringers</b> are the main elements that carry bending loads. Field observations are indicating that some older timber stringers are showing signs of distress under heavy axle loading.
