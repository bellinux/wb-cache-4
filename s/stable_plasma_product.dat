40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} effect of a plasma column ejected from solid {{titanium}} by localized microwaves in an ambient air atmosphere. Nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (titania) are found to be directly synthesized in this plasma column maintained by the microwave energy in the cavity. The process is initiated by a hotspot induced by localized microwaves, which melts the titanium substrate locally. The molten hotspot emits ionized titanium vapors continuously into the <b>stable</b> <b>plasma</b> column, which may last for more than a minute duration. The characterization of the dusty plasma obtained is performed in-situ by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), optical spectroscopy, and microwave reflection analyses. The deposited titania nanoparticles are structurally and morphologically analyzed by ex-situ optical and scanning-electron microscope observations, and also by X-ray diffraction. Using the Boltzmann plot method combined with the SAXS results, the electron temperature and density in the dusty plasma are estimated as ∼ 0. 4 [*]eV and ∼ 1019 [*]m− 3, respectively. The analysis of the <b>plasma</b> <b>product</b> reveals nanoparticles of titania in crystalline phases of anatase, brookite, and rutile. These are spatially arranged in various spherical, cubic, lamellar, and network forms. Several applications are considered for this process of titania nano-powder production...|$|R

According to this hypothesis, the flare phenomenon represents a combination of flare plus a <b>stable</b> active region <b>plasma.</b> A small amount of hot flare plasma will dominate the total emission, and the calculated isothermal plasma parameters will trend towards those of the hot flare plasma, so that a decrease in emission measure will be inferred.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{appearance}} and rapid evolution of BSE in UK cattle {{in the mid}} 1980 s, with compelling data supporting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) as its human manifestation, pose a potentially severe threat to public health. Three clinical cases and one asymptomatic case of vCJD infection {{have been reported in}} UK recipients of non-leucodepleted red cell transfusions from donors subsequently diagnosed with vCJD. Plasma from both these and other donors who later developed vCJD has contributed towards plasma pools used to manufacture clotting factor concentrate. The United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors' Organisation (UKHCDO) Surveillance Study has detected asymptomatic vCJD postmortem in a haemophilic patient treated with UK <b>plasma</b> <b>products</b> including two batches of clotting factor linked to a donor who subsequently developed vCJD. Over 4000 bleeding disorder patients treated with UK <b>plasma</b> <b>products</b> are recorded on the UKHCDO National Haemophilia Database. The risk of vCJD transmission by <b>plasma</b> <b>products</b> is not known. However, public health precautions have been implemented since 2004 in all UK inherited bleeding disorder patients who received UK-sourced <b>plasma</b> <b>products</b> between 1980 and 2001 to minimize the possible risk of onward vCJD transmission. We evaluate vCJD surveillance and risk management measures taken for UK inherited bleeding disorder patients, report current data and discuss resultant challenges and future directions...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Pain affects many cancer {{patients}} in advancing stages, lowering {{the level of}} their quality of life. Morphine has long been the “gold standard” for the treatment of cancer pain; however, its side effects, particularly sedation and cognitive impairment at high doses, have encouraged the use of “opioid rotation”. The transdermal fentanyl patch has advantages over oral morphine, with reduced side effects and increased convenience in practical usage. The side effects were reduced in patients who changed to the fentanyl patch, but rescue analgesia was often needed because of the decrease of fentanyl release from the patch, especially on patch replacement day. To maintain a <b>stable</b> fentanyl <b>plasma</b> level before patch replacement, we have established a three-cycle fentanyl patch system and reported that it provided appropriate pain control. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the individual variability of plasma fentanyl concentration in a three-cycle fentanyl patch system. Case Report: The gynecologic {{cancer patients}} were treated using the three-cycle fentanyl patch system. Blood samples were taken from the patients and plasma fentanyl concentration was analyzed. A <b>stable</b> <b>plasma</b> fentanyl level was observed, and good pain control was achieved in each patient using the three-cycle fentanyl patch system.

40|$|In today’s {{blood bank}} {{environment}} several <b>plasma</b> <b>products</b> {{are available for}} transfusion. In 2006, 77. 2 % of the plasma transfused in the USA was fresh frozen plasma (FFP). 1 This product is prepared from whole blood or apheresis donations and is frozen within 8 hours of collection. 2 Once thawed, plasma contains all clotting factors at physiological levels although there is considerable variability between donors in their level of individual clotting factors. 3 However, since anti-HLA antibodies are often implicated in causing transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), 4 and because multiparous females are often sensitized to HLA antigens, 5 many donor centers are diverting the plasma component of female donations to fractionation.

40|$|Abstract Background Fibrinogen (FIB) is an {{important}} source of fibrin, which plays a crucial role in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) extravasation and distant metastasis development. We hypothesize it 2 ̆ 019 s <b>stable</b> final <b>product,</b> <b>plasma</b> D-dimer, may be associated with CTCs appearance and can reflect the metastatic phenotype in cancer patients. Methods We first verified our hypothesis in different murine gastric cancer metastasis models in vivo, plasma D-dimer and fibrinogen as well as its degradation products were directly examined in three metastasis immune-deficient mouse models and in controls. Next, we gathered and analyzed the result of plasma D-dimer levels and CTCs numbers in 41 advanced primary gastric cancer (GC) patients. A follow-up study was conducted in these patients. Results In three in vivo murine metastasis models, plasma D-dimer levels were extremely elevated in a hematogenous and intraperitoneal murine model of metastasis compared with a subcutaneous tumor model and the control group, supporting our previous hypothesis. While in 41 GC patients, the result displayed that plasma D-dimer levels were remarkably increased in patients with distant metastases, especially in visceral metastases patients. Additionally, linear association was shown between D-dimer level and CTCs numbers (R 2 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 688, p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001), additionally, plasma D-dimer represent a better survival predictor than CTCs. Conclusions Plasma D-dimer is an essential accompaniment of CTCs in GC that is easy to measure and lower in cost, and can be used in the detection of hematogenous metastasis...|$|R

The aim of this extension trial {{was to investigate the}} true capacity of these <b>plasma</b> <b>products</b> to restore baseline levels of coagulation factors and inhibitors after plasma depletion in comparison to haemodilution induced by infusion of albumin solution. Materials and methodsFourteen healthy subjects, who completed both plasma transfusion periods, underwent an additional plasmapheresis (600 [*]mL) followed by an infusion of 1200  mL albumin (3. 125 %) in a third period. ResultsThe fibrinogen levels, as well as other clotting factors (FII, FV, FVII and FXI), decreased by 10 % after plasmapheresis, and subsequent infusion of albumin solution further aggravated this drop in clotting factors to approximately 20 – 25 %. The clotting factors with a long half-life were not even restored 24 hours after infusion of albumin solution, whereas those with a short half-life were replenished by endogenous synthesis within 24 hours. In contrast, transfusion of either <b>plasma</b> <b>product</b> rapidly restored all clotting parameters and inhibitors (protein S and plasmin inhibitor) immediately after transfusion.
