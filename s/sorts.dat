40|$|<b>Sorting</b> is an {{important}} and widely studied issue, where the execution time and the required resources for computation is of extreme importance, especially if it is dealing with real-time data processing. Therefore, {{it is important to}} study and to compare in details all the available <b>sorting</b> algorithms. In this project, an intensive investigation was conducted on five algorithms, namely, Bubble <b>Sort,</b> Insertion <b>Sort,</b> Selection <b>Sort,</b> Merge <b>Sort</b> and Quick <b>Sort</b> algorithms. Four groups of data elements were created for the purpose of comparison process among the different <b>sorting</b> algorithms. All the five <b>sorting</b> algorithms are applied to these groups. The worst time complexity for each <b>sorting</b> technique is then computed for each <b>sorting</b> algorithm. The <b>sorting</b> algorithms were classified into two groups of time complexity, O (n 2) group and O(nlog 2 n) group. The execution time for the five <b>sorting</b> algorithms of each group of data elements were computed. The fastest algorithm is then determined by the estimated value for each <b>sorting</b> algorithm, which is computed using linear least square regression. The results revealed that the Merge <b>Sort</b> was more efficient to <b>sort</b> data from the Quick <b>Sort</b> for O(nlog 2 n) time complexity group. The Insertion <b>Sort</b> had more efficiency to <b>sort</b> data from Selection <b>Sort</b> and Bubble <b>Sort</b> for O (n 2) group. Bubble <b>Sort</b> was the slowest or it was less efficient to <b>sort</b> the data. In conclusion, the efficiency of <b>sorting</b> algorithms can be ranked from highest to lowest as Merge <b>Sort,</b> Quick <b>Sort,</b> Insertion <b>Sort,</b> Selection <b>Sort</b> and Bubble <b>Sort...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Sorting</b> is a {{commonly}} used operation in computer science. In {{addition to its}} main job of arranging lists or arrays in sequence, <b>sorting</b> is often also required to facilitate some other operation such as searching, merging and normalization or used as an intermediate operation in other operations. A <b>sorting</b> algorithm consists of comparison, swap, and assignment operations[1 - 3]. There are several simple and complex <b>sorting</b> algorithms that are being used in practical {{life as well as}} in computation such as Quick <b>sort,</b> Bubble <b>sort,</b> Merge <b>sort,</b> Bucket <b>sort,</b> Heap <b>sort,</b> Radix <b>sort</b> etc. But the application of these algorithms depends on the problem statement. This paper introduces MQ <b>sort</b> which combines the advantages of quick <b>sort</b> and Merge <b>sort.</b> The comparative analysis of performance and complexity of MQ <b>sort</b> is done against Quick <b>sort</b> and Merge <b>sort.</b> MQ <b>sort</b> significantly reduces complexity and provides better performance than Quick <b>sort,</b> Merge <b>sort...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{computer}} science,especially for the algorithmic {{theory of}} information,the research of <b>sorting</b> algorithm {{is very important}} thema and from computational experiments,the quick <b>sort</b> algorithm,which is discoverd by Hoare[2]is known as fastest ones. However,the worst complexity of this <b>sorting</b> method is very large and for the <b>sort</b> of special data,which include much same data,its performance is less than other <b>sorting</b> method,for example merge <b>sort.</b> So,in this note,first,we analyse the complexity of quick <b>sort</b> and merge <b>sort</b> form theoritical aspect and show that quick <b>sort</b> algorithm is faster than merge <b>sort</b> algorithm,when each data are different. Secondly,we introduce the hash <b>sort</b> algorithm,which can <b>sort</b> numbers very fast. The complexity of <b>sorting</b> n numbers is O(n) and it is smaller than O(n log n),which is the complexity of quick <b>sort</b> or merge <b>sort.</b> Strictly saying,hash <b>sort</b> algorithm is not a <b>sorting</b> algorithm,since it treats only numbers. In this note,we apply the idea of hash <b>sort</b> to general data and propose an algorithm that dividing given general data into the sets of same data. Finally,we use this technic to quick <b>sort</b> algorithm and propose a new <b>sorting</b> method whose worst complexity is faster than that of quick <b>sort...</b>|$|R

Although {{there is a huge}} number of <b>sorting</b> algorithms, <b>sorting</b> problem has attracted a great deal of research; because efficient <b>sorting</b> is important to optimize the use of other algorithms. This paper presents two new <b>sorting</b> algorithms, enhanced selection <b>sort</b> and enhanced bubble <b>Sort</b> algorithms. Enhanced selection <b>sort</b> is an enhancement on selection <b>sort</b> by making it slightly faster and stable <b>sorting</b> algorithm. Enhanced bubble <b>sort</b> is an enhancement on both bubble <b>sort</b> and selection <b>sort</b> algorithms with O(nlgn) complexity instead of O(n 2) for bubble <b>sort</b> and selection <b>sort</b> algorithms. The two new algorithms are analyzed, implemented, tested, and compared and the results were promising...|$|R
