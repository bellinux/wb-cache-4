40|$|Herbicides are {{currently}} pivotal to control weeds and sustain food security. Herbicides must efficiently kill weeds while being as harmless {{as possible for}} crops, even crops taxonomically close to weeds. To increase their selectivity toward crops, some herbicides are sprayed in association with safeners that are bioactive compounds exacerbating herbicide-degrading pathways reputedly specifically in crops. However, exacerbated herbicide metabolism is also a key mechanism underlying evolved non-target-site-based resistance to herbicides (NTSR) in weeds. This {{raised the issue of}} a possible role of safeners on NTSR evolution in weeds. We investigated a possible effect of the respective field rates of the two broadly used safeners cloquintocet-mexyl and mefenpyr-diethyl on the sensitivity of the troublesome global weed Lolium sp. (rye-grass) to the major herbicides inhibiting acetolactate-synthase (ALS) pyroxsulam and iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron, respectively. Three Lolium sp. populations were studied in three series of experiments. The first experiment series compared the frequencies of plants surviving application of each herbicide alone or in association with its <b>safener.</b> <b>Safener</b> co-application caused a net increase ranging from 5. 0 to 46. 5 % in the frequency of plants surviving the field rate of their associated herbicide. In a second series of experiments, <b>safener</b> effect was assessed on individual plant sensitivity using vegetative propagation. A reduction in sensitivity to pyroxsulam and to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron was observed for 44. 4 and 11. 1 % of the plants in co-treatment with cloquintocet-mexyl and mefenpyr-diethyl, respectively. A third series of experiments investigated <b>safener</b> effect on the expression level of 19 Lolium sp. NTSR marker genes. Safeners showed an enhancing effect on the expression level of 10 genes. Overall, we demonstrated that cloquintocet-mexyl and mefenpyr-diethyl both reduced the sensitivity of Lolium sp. to their associated ALS-inhibiting herbicide and most likely exacerbated herbicide-degrading secondary metabolism pathways. This suggests that genetic variation for <b>safener</b> response is present in Lolium sp. Thus, a possible, uninvestigated way to NTSR evolution could be selection for increased responsiveness to <b>safener</b> action. Delivering safeners exclusively to the crop could mitigate the risk for NTSR evolution in weeds...|$|E

40|$|The {{functions}} of plant glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) under normal growth conditions are poorly understood, but their activity as detoxification enzymes has been harnessed in agriculture for selective weed control. Herbicide <b>safeners</b> protect monocot crops from herbicide injury but have {{little effect on}} weedy monocot or dicot species. Protection by <b>safeners</b> is associated with expression of herbicide-metabolizing enzymes including GSTs, but the basis for selective action of <b>safeners</b> between monocots and dicots is not known. To address this question we have studied the response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to various <b>safeners.</b> Benoxacor, fenclorim, and fluxofenim did not protect Arabidopsis from herbicide injury but did induce RNA expression of the glutathione-conjugate transporters encoded by AtMRP 1, AtMRP 2, AtMRP 3, and AtMRP 4. These <b>safeners</b> also induced the organ-specific expression of AtGSTU 19 and AtGSTF 2, two previously characterized Arabidopsis GSTs from different classes of this enzyme family. RNA hybridization, immunoblot, and reporter gene analyses indicated expression of AtGSTU 19 induced by <b>safeners</b> predominated in roots. To test the hypothesis that increased expression of AtGSTU 19 would be sufficient to provide tolerance to chloroacetamide herbicides, a chimeric gene was produced containing the open reading frame for this GST driven by a constitutive promoter. Plants containing this transgene had a modest increase in AtGSTU 19 protein, predominantly in roots, but this {{had no effect on}} tolerance to chloroacetamide herbicides. The localized induction of GSTs by <b>safeners</b> in roots of Arabidopsis may explain why these compounds are unable to provide herbicide tolerance to dicot plant species...|$|R

Both <b>safeners</b> induced an increase in cysteine and glutathione. In labeling experiments using 35 SO 42 −, roots of plants cultivated {{in the presence of}} <b>safeners</b> contained an increased level of radioactivity in glutathione and cysteine as compared with controls. A significant increase in uptake of sulfate was only detected in the presence of CGA 154281. One millimolar N,N-diallyl- 2, 2 -dichloroacetamide applied to the roots for 6 days increased the activity of adenosine 5 ′-phosphosulfate sulfotransferase about 20 - and threefold in the roots and leaves, respectively, compared with controls. CGA 154281 at 10 micromolar caused a sevenfold increase of this enzyme activity in the roots, but did not affect it significantly in the leaves. A significant increase in ATP-sulfurylase (EC 2. 7. 7. 4) activity was only detected in the roots cultivated in the presence of 10 micromolar CGA 154281. Both <b>safeners</b> had no effect on the activity of sulfite reductase (EC 1. 8. 7. 1) and O-acetyl-l-serine sulfhydrylase (EC 4. 2. 99. 8).

The individual and combined effects of the sulfonylurea herbicide nicosulfuron and the <b>safener</b> isoxadifen-ethyl on the growth and selected physiological processes of maize were evaluated. Bioassays showed that the EC 50 values of nicosulfuron and nicosulfuron plus isoxadifen-ethyl for maize cultivar Zhengdan 958 were 18. 87 and 249. 28 mg kg- 1, respectively, and were 24. 8 and 275. 51 mg kg- 1, respectively, for Zhenghuangnuo No. 2 cultivar. Evaluations of the target enzyme of acetolactate synthase showed that the I 50 values of nicosulfuron and nicosulfuron plus isoxadifen-ethyl for the ALS of Zhengdan 958 were 15. 46 and 28. 56 μmol L- 1, respectively, and were 0. 57 and 2. 17 μmol L- 1, respectively, for the acetolactate synthase of Zhenghuangnuo No. 2. The <b>safener</b> isoxadifen-ethyl significantly enhanced tolerance of maize to nicosulfuron. The enhanced tolerance of maize to nicosulfuron {{in the presence of}} the <b>safener,</b> coupled with the enhanced injury observed in the presence of piperonyl butoxide, 1 -aminobenzotriazole, and malathion, suggested cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases may be involved in metabolism of nicosulfuron. We proposed that isoxadifen-ethyl increases plant metabolism of nicosulfuron through non-P 450 -catalyzed routes or through P 450 monooxygenases not inhibited by piperonyl butoxide, 1 -aminobenzotriazole, and malathion. Isoxadifen-ethyl, at a rate of 33 mg kg- 1, completely reversed the effects of all doses (37. 5 - 300 mg kg- 1) of nicosulfuron on both of the maize cultivars. When the two compounds were given simultaneously, isoxadifen-ethyl enhanced activity of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and acetolactate synthase activity in maize.

40|$|AbstractSafeners are agrochemicals which enhance {{tolerance}} to herbicides in cereals including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by elevating {{the expression of}} xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes, such as glutathione transferases (GSTs). When wheat plants were spray-treated with three <b>safener</b> chemistries, namely cloquintocet mexyl, mefenpyr diethyl and fenchlorazole ethyl, an apparently identical subset of GSTs derived from the tau, phi and lambda classes accumulated in the foliage. Treatment with the closely related mefenpyr diethyl and fenchlorazole ethyl enhanced seedling shoot growth, but this effect was not determined with the chemically unrelated cloquintocet mexyl. Focussing on cloquintocet mexyl, treatments were found to only give a transient induction of GSTs, with the period of elevation being dose dependent. Examining the role of <b>safener</b> metabolism in controlling these responses, {{it was determined that}} cloquintocet mexyl was rapidly hydrolysed to the respective carboxylic acid. Studies with cloquintocet showed that the acid was equally effective at inducing GSTs as the ester and appeared to be the active <b>safener.</b> Studies on the tissue induction of GSTs showed that whilst phi and tau class enzymes were induced in all tissues, the induction of the lambda enzymes was restricted to the meristems. To test the potential protective effects of cloquintocet mexyl in wheat on chemicals other than herbicides, seeds were pre-soaked in safeners prior to sowing on soil containing oil and a range of heavy metals. Whilst untreated seeds were unable to germinate on the contaminated soil, <b>safener</b> treatments resulted in seedlings briefly growing before succumbing to the pollutants.

40|$|Commercialised {{herbicide}} safeners (also {{known as}} protectants or antidotes) are synthetic chemicals {{used to enhance}} herbicide tolerance in cereal crops. They do this by causing an up-regulation in xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes such as glutathione transferases (GSTs). Seedlings of wheat (Triticum aestivum cv ‘Einstein’) were sprayed with the safeners cloquintocet mexyl, fenchlorazole ethyl and mefenpyr diethyl. All three compounds caused an identical up regulation of GSTs from the phi, tau and lambda classes, despite their differences in chemistry. Using cloquintocet mexyl as a classic wheat <b>safener</b> treatment, {{it was found that}} GST induction was both dose and time dependent. Safening was found {{to be associated with the}} rapid hydrolysis of the parent ester to cloquintocet acid. When the free acid was tested, the GST-induction response obtained was identical to that determined with the parent ester, suggesting that cloquintocet itself is the active <b>safener.</b> GST induction was found to be tissue specific within the wheat shoots, with the lambda GSTs being preferentially expressed in the meristematic tissue. Proteomic 2 D gel analysis revealed that the tau TaGSTU 3 was a major up-regulated GST. In addition, six GSTs that were previously shown in literature to be up-regulated by herbicide safeners in wheat were cloned, expressed and characterized as the respective recombinant enzymes and renamed to bring them in line with existing nomenclature. The GSTs cloned included TaGSTU 3, TaGSTU 6, TaGSTF 4, TaGSTF 10 and TaGSTL 1. Metabolism studies showed that following the hydrolysis of cloquintocet mexyl, no further down- stream metabolites could be identified and none of the up-regulated GSTs showed any activity toward the <b>safener.</b> However TaGSTU 3 was found to bind and be inhibited by cloquintocet free acid as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. <b>Safener</b> treatment also led to a transient inhibition of GST activity in crude wheat extracts after spraying the seedlings. In addition to the induction of GSTs, <b>safener</b> treatments also resulted in an enhanced growth of wheat seedlings. The work presented in this thesis confirms that very different compounds can induce apparently identical downstream events at the level of GST enhancement and that these induction events underpin wider changes in plant physiology. ...|$|E

Pendimethalin also reduced rice shoot biomass more than oxadiazon, which was compounded by early soil saturation after herbicide application. Pretilachlor with <b>safener</b> was the only herbicide that exhibited low phytotoxic symptoms on rice plants and did not reduce leaf, stem, root, and shoot biomass of rice.

Herbicide safeners are compounds that enhance the herbicide-detoxifying activity of GSTs and other proteins in grass crops but not in target weeds. Little is known about how safeners induce detoxification systems in plants. In this study, Arabidopsis was evaluated as a model to study <b>safener</b> response mechanisms in higher plants, {{in an attempt to}} understand the basis for GST regulation by safeners. ^ In the current study, several safeners were shown to induce the expression of specific Arabidopsis GSTs at the RNA and protein levels, and to enhance GST activity against herbicides and model substrates. However, all safeners did not induce the same profile of GSTs in Arabidopsis, suggesting multiple pathways are involved in the regulation of GST expression by safeners. ^ When GSTs from safener-treated plants were purified by affinity chromatography and displayed by 2 -D SDS-PAGE, a 26 kD protein that was induced by a number of safeners was identified as a novel GST, AtGSTU 19. When expressed in E. coli, AtGSTU 19 had high activity with model substrates and conjugated several chloroacetamide herbicides to GSH at rates similar to those reported for herbicide-metabolizing GSTs in sorghum and maize. Based on its activity and abundance in protein extracts, it is likely that AtGSTU 19 accounts for {{a large proportion of the}} increase in GST activity following <b>safener</b> treatment. Levels of AtGSTU 19 RNA and protein increased predominantly in roots in response to safeners that are used in cereal crops to reduce chloroacetamide injury. ^ The tissue-specific expression of AtGSTU 19 was examined in vivo using transgenic lines that carrying a GFP reporter gene driven by the AtGSTU 19 promoter. Low basal expression of the reporter in roots was observed in untreated plants, while expression was induced moderately in shoots and highly in roots of safener-treated plants. The effect of overexpressing AtGSTU 19 in Arabidopsis on herbicide tolerance was investigated. The results suggest that localization of GST expression to certain plant tissues is an important factor determining <b>safener</b> efficacy. ^ Finally, a proteomic analysis of the Arabidopsis GST family examined the expression of eight abundant GSTs, including AtGSTU 19, before and after <b>safener</b> treatment. MS-MS was used to identify differentially-labeled tryptic peptides derived from GST proteins in control and safener-treated plants. Differences in the abundance of these peptides indicated that expression of specific GSTs changed in response to safener-treatment. ^ This work establishes Arabidopsis as a model to study the regulation of GSTs by safeners, and offers an explanation for differences in <b>safener</b> action between cereal crops and weeds. ...|$|E
40|$|Thiencarbazone-methyl {{is a new}} {{herbicide}} for {{the selective}} control of grasses and broadleaf weeds primarily in corn. The active ingredient belongs to the chemical class of sulfonly-amino-carbonyl-triazolinones (SACT) and acts as an inhibitor of the ALS-enzyme. The compound offers cross spectrum activity against grasses and broadleaf weeds and can be applied at the pre-emergence and the post-emergence timing. The use rate depends on the application timing and may vary from 22 – 45 g a. i. /ha in pre-emergence applications and 10 – 15 g a. i. /ha in post-emergence applications. Sequential treatments are possible {{as long as the}} maximum seasonal dose of 45 g a. i. /ha is not exceeded. In commercial corn herbicides, TCM is always combined with <b>safener</b> technology such as the novel <b>safener</b> cyprosulfamide and with other herbicidal active ingredients. In pre-emergence applications, the primary herbicidal mixpartner is isoxaflutole. In herbicides designed for postemergence use, TCM is co-formulated with foramsulfuron, iodosulfuron or tembotrione. The commercial herbicides composed of TCM and CSA plus sulfonylurea or triketone partners have demonstrated high weed control success in conventional and herbicide-tolerant corn production systems. Depending on the product, the potential for one pass weed control has been confirmed. Control of perennial grasses like Sorghum halapense and Elymus repens together with control of problem weeds like Polygonum convolvulus and suppression of Cirsium arvense and Convolvulus arvensis appear to be among the most attractive features of TCM-based herbicides under European conditions. High crop tolerance of herbicides combining two or three highly active ingredients in one commercial product is ensured by the novel <b>safener</b> cyprosulfamide which can protect corn via root uptake and via leaf uptake from herbicide damage...|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the differential susceptibility of five wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties to the herbicide fenoxaprop-p-ethyl, as well as the performance of mefenpyr-diethyl on minimizing herbicide injury and on lipid contents. Varieties BRS 49, CD 104, CEP 24, IAPAR 78 and Rubi were sprayed with fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (69 g ha¹), fenoxaprop-p-ethyl + mefenpyr-diethyl (69 g + 18. 75 g ha- 1), or mefenpyr-diethyl (18. 75 g ha- 1). Plants were evaluated visually for injury at 7 and 14 days after treatment (DAT). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity was assayed in aerial parts at 7 DAT, and lipid content was measured at 14 DAT. Varieties CEP 24, IAPAR 78 and Rubi were more tolerant to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl than BRS 49, and CD 104 rapidly recovering from the slight phytotoxicity symptoms produced by the herbicide. Mefenpyr-diethyl prevented crop injury associated with the herbicide. GST activity did not correlate directly with fenoxaprop-p-ethyl detoxification. However, lipid content was related to the susceptibility of wheat to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl treatment...|$|R
30|$|The {{environmental}} risk assessment of plant protection products (PPP) in the European Union (EU) relates to the individual active substances [1]. Depending {{on the outcome of}} the EU risk assessment, an active substance (a.s.) may be included in the positive list (the Annex I of the directive 91 / 414 /EEC). Only PPP containing a.s. included in this Annex I can be authorized {{at the level of the}} member states. This principle is retained in the new EU regulation 1107 / 2009 [2], which repeals directive 91 / 414 /EEC and shall apply from June 2011. The new regulation applies not only to PPP and their a.s., but also to other substances contained in commercial PPP, namely <b>safeners,</b> synergists, co-formulants, and adjuvants [2]. The four last component groups are hereafter designated additives. PPP generally represent a mixture of at least one a.s. combined with a number of different formulation additives [3]. The application of a specific PPP does therefore typically result in a potential exposure of non-target organisms to a mixture of chemicals. In addition to formulation additives, PPP can contain two or more active substances. These so-called combination products thereby constitute the specific case of mixtures of pesticidal a.s. that are deliberately released into the environment.|$|R
40|$|Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene {{expression}} was examined in several Triticum species, differing in genome constitution and ploidy level, to determine genome contribution to GST expression in cultivated, hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Two tandemly duplicated tau class GST genes (TtGSTU 1 and TtGSTU 2) were isolated {{from a single}} bacterial artificial chromosome clone in a library constructed from the diploid wheat and D genome progenitor to cultivated wheat, Triticum tauschii. The genes are very similar in genomic structure and their encoded proteins are 95 % identical. Gene-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed differential transcript accumulation of TtGSTU 1 and TtGSTU 2 in roots and shoots. Expression of both genes was induced by herbicide <b>safeners,</b> 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and abscisic acid, in the shoots of T. tauschii; however, expression of TtGSTU 1 was always higher than TtGSTU 2. In untreated seedlings, TtGSTU 1 was expressed in both shoots and roots, whereas TtGSTU 2 expression was only detected in roots. RNA gel-blot analysis of ditelosomic, aneuploid lines that are deficient for 6 AS, 6 BS, or 6 DS chromosome arms of cultivated, hexaploid bread wheat showed differential genome contribution to safener-induced GST expression in shoots compared with roots.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of herbicide resistance {{is an important}} topic in plant protection and agricultural practice. Safeners are commonly used in herbicides to protect crops against herbicidal damage. Although {{no effect on the}} weed control is expected, it has been theorized that the rate of {{evolution of}} non-target site resistance (NTSR) in weeds in cereals may be enhanced by use of herbicide products containing safeners. One of the most important safeners in cereals is mefenpyr-diethyl. Therefore, the possible influence of mefenpyr on herbicide resistance was studied in cooperative trials between Bayer CropScience (BCS, F-Höchst) and FH Bingen. The trials tested in parallel different herbicide resistant black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides (Huds.)) biotypes under greenhouse conditions. The biotypes where chosen due to known NTSR against Atlantis WG® (4 highly resistant and 5 moderately resistant) as well as two susceptible biotypes. The populations were treated with the following three herbicide/safener regimes in six concentrations adjusted according to the anticipated biotype resistance levels. (1) mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron + without <b>safener</b> formulation, (2) mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron + constant mefenpyr concentration (45 g/ha), (3) mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron + varying mefenpyr concentrations (ratio 5 : 1 : 15). The treatments were applied in post-emergence based on mesosulfuron to iodosulfuron ratios in Atlantis WG® (5 : 1). The trials were assessed visually (% effect) and by fresh weight. Dose-response curves were performed and ED 50 values for each treatment and biotype were calculated. Results showed a varying effect of safeners which was in the most cases negligible. Depending on the biotypes mostly no impact on the <b>safener</b> was found for herbicide resistance. In conclusion, the trials from Bingen and F-Höchst gave evidence, that there is no significant and consistent influence of the <b>safener</b> mefenpyr on evolution of NTSR black-grass...|$|E

40|$|Background: Azoles play an {{important}} role in the management of Aspergillus diseases. Azole resistance is an emerging global problem in Aspergillus fumigatus, and may develop through patient therapy. In addition, an environmental route of resistance development has been suggested through exposure to 14 a-demethylase inhibitors (DMIs). The main resistance mechanism associated with this putative fungicide-driven route is a combination of alterations in the Cyp 51 A-gene (TR 34 / L 98 H). We investigated if TR 34 /L 98 H could have developed through exposure to DMIs. Methods and Findings: Thirty-one compounds that have been authorized for use as fungicides, herbicides, herbicide <b>safeners</b> and plant growth regulators in the Netherlands between 1970 and 2005, were investigated for cross-resistance to medical triazoles. Furthermore, CYP 51 -protein homology modeling and molecule alignment studies were performed to identify similarity in molecule structure and docking modes. Five triazole DMIs, propiconazole, bromuconazole, tebuconazole, epoxiconazole and difenoconazole, showed very similar molecule structures to the medical triazoles and adopted similar poses while docking the protein. These DMIs also showed the greatest cross-resistance and, importantly, were authorized for use between 1990 and 1996, directly preceding the recovery of the first clinical TR 34 /L 98 H isolate in 1998. Through microsatellite genotyping of TR 34 /L 98 H isolates we were able to calculate that the first isolate would have arisen in 1997, confirming the results of the abovementioned experiments. Finally, we performed induction experiments t...|$|R
40|$|This {{concept paper}} for a {{guidance}} document provides a first draft {{based on the}} outcome of a BfR workshop* on how evaluation of endocrine effects of active substances, <b>safeners</b> or synergists to be used in plant protection products might be conducted. Its development has become necessary in the context of Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market of the European Community. Even though the criteria developed and the data set used as a basis for toxicological analysis of such substances are considered to be specific for plant protection products, it is recognized that a guidance document once developed might also have implications for other classes of substances such as biocides or chemicals under REACh. It is recommended that the proposed measures should be tested upon a certain number of plant protection products to examine their applicability and to facilitate improvement of the framework. Concerning specific scientific criteria for the assessment of endocrine disrupting properties, a tiered approach for decision making is proposed reflecting single steps of the regulatory decision process on substances with endocrine disrupting properties for their use in plant protection products. In a first step all available data are evaluated in an endpoint-based manner. In a second step mechanisms of toxicity are analysed if present. Human relevance of these mechanisms of toxicity is examined in a third step. The fourth step consists of a decision. In this context two options are proposed which may be regarded as alternatives, representing to some extent complementary procedures: An exposure-based approach and a classification-based manner. *[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Glutathione S-transferase (GST) {{refers to}} one of the major detoxifying enzymes that plays an {{important}} role in different abiotic and biotic stress modulation pathways of plant. The present study aimed to a comprehensive genome-wide functional characterization of GST genes and proteins in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). The whole genome sequence analysis revealed the presence of 90 GST genes in tomato, the largest GST gene family reported till date. Eight segmental duplicated gene pairs might contribute significantly to the expansion of SlGST gene family. Based on phylogenetic analysis of tomato, rice, and Arabidopsis GST proteins, GST family members could be further divided into ten classes. Members of each orthologous class showed high conservancy among themselves. Tau and lambda are the major classes of tomato; while tau and phi are the major classes for rice and Arabidopsis. Chromosomal localization revealed highly uneven distribution of SlGST genes in 13 different chromosomes, where chromosome 9 possessed the highest number of genes. Based on publicly available microarray data, expression analysis of 30 available SlGST genes exhibited a differential pattern in all the analyzed tissues and developmental stages. Moreover, most of the members showed highly induced expression in response to multiple biotic and abiotic stress inducers that could be harmonized with the increase in total GST enzyme activity under several stress conditions. Activity of tomato GST could be enhanced further by using some positive modulators (<b>safeners)</b> that have been predicted through molecular docking of SlGSTU 5 and ligands. Moreover, tomato GST proteins are predicted to interact with a lot of other glutathione synthesizing and utilizing enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione synthetase and γ-glutamyltransferase.
