50|$|The {{engines that}} {{appeared}} in the early 90's also swapped the cast metal <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>cover</b> for a cheaper (and less regarded) plastic version. Those used round tooth cambelts while the later used square (with a plastic pre-tensioner). There are also subtle differences between the crankshaft, and visible difference in the pattern of the SFi airbox.|$|E
50|$|The 20XE {{came into}} {{production}} in 1987. The engine {{was designed by}} Dr Fritz Indra, who was head of Advanced Engine Development for Opel in Germany from 1985 to 1989. The engine was originally intended for race application, hence Cosworth's involvement. Commonly refer to this engine as the 'Red Top' (or just 'XE') because of {{the appearance of the}} red L-shaped <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>cover</b> (black colours were available too; the rocker cover was available in silver only). At the time of its launch, this engine was something of a milestone unit in Europe and was widely used in motorsport in many specialist race versions.|$|E
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} Mark 2 Astra was launched, they {{introduced}} the GTE using a 1.8-litre 115 bhp {{lifted from the}} Mark 1 GTE, but this was quickly dropped in favour of a 124 bhp 2.0 litre unit due to poorer than expected performance. All GTE models featured an all electronic dash with digital speedometer. Analogue instruments were an optional extra, but were very rarely selected over the digital dash. In 1988 Vauxhall's twin-camshaft version of the engine, the C20XE known as the [...] "red top" [...] (due to the red <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>cover),</b> was fitted to the GTE and instantly created a stir with the motoring press because of its performance. When this engine was originally released in Europe and the UK it developed 156 bhp and 150 ft lbs of torque in standard form. A few years later the GTE 16v, now subject to stricter emissions regulations, was fitted with a catalytic converter and a new exhaust manifold, which robbed the engine of 6 bhp, and 5 ft lbs of torque, and added [...]5 of a second to the 0-60 mph time, raising it from 7.0 seconds to 7.5 seconds. In 1990 the [...] "leather edition" [...] limited-edition was launched, and an allocation of around 250 examples sold only through London dealerships. This special edition came with Bordeaux paint work, and crossed spoke alloy wheels. It was {{also known as the}} [...] "London Edition" [...] and featured in a single sheet brochure printed in April 1990. Between the brochure being printed, and the time they hit the road the [...] "Leather Edition" [...] acquired some extra dealer fit decals to help them stand out further from the standard 16 valve GTE. These decals comprise a small three colour flash on the tail gate next to the GTE badge, and the same colours under the bumper strips on the sides near the rear arch. A silver strip was also added adjacent to this. The colours used were that of the GM racing teams, and once fitted these cars also became known as the [...] "Champion" [...] Edition. As the official name would suggest they came with Recaro seats and door cards clad in Connolly Leather. Although the [...] "Leather Edition" [...] was not in any way connected to John Clelands 1989 BTCC win in the Astra 16 valve, it is believed by many that the [...] "Champion" [...] name, and the GM motor sport coloured decals, in some way paid homage to Clelands Championship win 6 months earlier.|$|E
5000|$|GM used cast {{aluminum}} cylinder heads featuring 4 valves per cylinder. The heads used dual overhead cams driven through the [...] "maintenance-free" [...] cam-drive chain case. The cams act directly on hydraulic lifters {{on the ends}} of the valves and are fed with a lubrication passage drilled through the cylinder head lengthwise. The intake valves are inclined at 25°, while the exhaust valves are canted to 7° with center-mounted platinum-tipped <b>spark</b> <b>plugs.</b> The cam <b>covers</b> are magnesium for light weight and sound damping.|$|R
5000|$|Bartlett was a {{geologist}} who {{was interested in}} <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> and contributed greatly to the motor vehicle world, being the first to invent insulating materials for <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> using alumina ceramics. When <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> insulators were first invented, {{they were made of}} porcelain and molded on a potter's wheel, and thus, were prone to break easily. She has been credited to have discovered that high alumina metls, containing approximately 0.35 percent lithium oxide precipitated zeta alumina, and over the course of her career, gained 7 patents in connection with her work. Bartlett left her position at General Motors Corporation to work on The Manhattan Project, a research project for nuclear weapons at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but later returned. Dr. Bartlett's essential work on <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> improved the overall capabilities of motor vehicles. Alumina insulator material allows plugs to handle high heat and voltage within the <b>spark</b> <b>plug,</b> enabling vehicles to operate in a more clean and, in turn, more efficient manner. By encasing the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> Dr. Bartlett had made possible for them to become quite durable. Prior to the design changes, <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> would get <b>covered</b> in byproduct spewed by the engine. You would have to manually clean them every 70 to 150 kilometers for the vehicle to function effectively.|$|R
500|$|The Badmotorfinger logo {{consists}} of a jagged, cyclone-like design. In {{the center of the}} logo is a triangle with the album's title, containing a <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> The album's <b>cover</b> art was illustrated by guitarist Mark Dancey from the Sub Pop band Big Chief. Thayil suggested the title Badmotorfinger as a joke on the Montrose song [...] "Bad Motor Scooter". Regarding the title, Thayil said, [...] "It was sort of {{off the top of my}} head. I simply like it because it was colorful. It was kinda aggressive, too... It conjures up a lot of different kinds of images. We like the ambiguity in it, the way it sounded and the way it looked." ...|$|R
5000|$|The wire {{from each}} <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> is {{just long enough}} to reach the distributor, without excess. Each end of a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> wire has a metal {{terminal}} that clips onto the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> and distributor, coil, or magneto. There are dedicated <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> wire pliers, tools designed for removing the terminal from a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> without damaging it.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> {{is said to}} be [...] "hot" [...] if it is {{a better}} heat insulator, keeping more heat in the tip of the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> A <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> {{is said to be}} [...] "cold" [...] if it can conduct more heat out of the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> tip and lower the tip's temperature. Whether a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> is [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "cold" [...] is known as the heat range of the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> The heat range of a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> is {{typically}} specified as a number, with some manufacturers using ascending numbers for hotter plugs, and others doing the opposite - using ascending numbers for colder plugs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Cycle-resolved {{measurements}} of the fuel concentration near a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> in both a commercial spark-ignition piston engine and a commercial rotary engine were performed. An in situ laser infrared (IR) absorption method was developed using a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor and a 3. 392 -μm He–Ne laser as the light source. This wavelength coincided with the absorption line of hydrocarbons. The newly developed IR <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor had a higher signal-to-noise ratio than its previous version due to the optimization of its quartz lens and two optical fibers. The new sensor provided quantitative cycle-resolved fuel concentration measurements around the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> with a high temporal resolution. At lean preset air/fuel (A/F) ratios, fuel was mixed with the surrounding air gradually near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> Strong mixture inhomogeneities were measured during the compression stroke; the magnitude of these inhomogeneities decreased throughout the compression stroke. There was {{a strong correlation between}} the fuel concentration measured with the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor and the combustion characteristics during the initial combustion period, which occurred faster when conditions were slightly richer than stoichiometric near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> The indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) was slightly related to the A/F ratio near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> It was possible to measure the cycle-resolved A/F ratio near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> and investigate its cycle-to-cycle fluctuations t...|$|R
