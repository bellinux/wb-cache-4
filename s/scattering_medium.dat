25|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{an established}} {{medical imaging technique}} that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images from within optical scattering media (e.g., biological tissue). Optical coherence tomography is based on low-coherence interferometry, typically employing near-infrared light. The use of relatively long wavelength light allows it to penetrate into the <b>scattering</b> <b>medium.</b> Confocal microscopy, another optical technique, typically penetrates less deeply into the sample but with higher resolution.|$|E
25|$|Off-axis HPIV uses {{separate}} beams {{to provide}} the object and reference waves. This setup is used to avoid speckle noise form being generated from interference of the two waves within the <b>scattering</b> <b>medium,</b> which would occur if they were both propagated through the medium. An off-axis experiment is a highly complex optical system comprising numerous optical elements, and the reader is referred to an example schematic in Sheng et al. for a more complete presentation.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} issues degrade the quality of HPIV results. The first class of issues {{involves}} the reconstruction itself. In holography, the object wave of a particle is typically assumed to be spherical; however, due to Mie scattering theory, this wave is a complex shape which can distort the reconstructed particle. Another issue {{is the presence of}} substantial speckle noise which lowers the overall signal-to-noise ratio of particle images. This effect is of greater concern for in-line holographic systems because the reference beam is propagated through the volume along with the scattered object beam. Noise can also be introduced through impurities in the <b>scattering</b> <b>medium,</b> such as temperature variations and window blemishes. Because holography requires coherent imaging, these effects are much more severe than traditional imaging conditions. The combination of these factors increases the complexity of the correlation process. In particular, the speckle noise in an HPIV recording often prevents traditional image-based correlation methods from being used. Instead, single particle identification and correlation are implemented, which set limits on particle number density. A more comprehensive outline of these error sources is given in Meng et al.|$|E

It is based on an effective model of the scatter process. This model depends on only four parameters which are determined experimentally and remain independent of the geometry and of the dimensions of the <b>scatter</b> <b>medium.</b> The method uses the data from the peak events and does not need additional energy windows on the scattered events.

Furthermore, {{the sensitivity of the}} scattering coefficients with respect to changes in the permittivity and permeability distributions is investigated. In the linearized case, explicit formulas for reconstructing permittivity and permeability distributions from the scattering coefficients is proposed. They relate the exponentially ill-posed character of the inverse <b>medium</b> <b>scattering</b> problem at a fixed frequency to the exponential decay of the scattering coefficients.

Recently, the use of three heads for coincidence imaging has been suggested. The three heads can be placed in different configurations to achieve optimal sensitivity profiles. Two of these configurations are U-shape and triangular. As the average angle of incidence of the photons will differ for each configuration, {{it is expected that}} the resolution properties will be different Resolution will be degraded by angle of incidence effects, non-colinearity of the photons, and, for axial resolution, rebirming of the list mode data to two-dimensional projections.

We complete the characterization of scatter by extending optical transfer matrix methods into the time domain, allowing any spatiotemporal input state at one end to be mapped directly to its corresponding spatiotemporal output state. We have measured the optical transfer function of a multimode fiber in its entirety; it consists of 420 modes in/out at 32768 wavelengths, the most detailed complete characterization of multimode waveguide light propagation to date, {{to the best of}} our knowledge.
