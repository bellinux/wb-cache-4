5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined the tight schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a dimple, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.|$|E
25|$|The swift {{manner in}} which Hughes had been sacked and {{replaced}} after just winning a match was decried by some media outlets. Some in the press disagreed, but many rated Hughes as the best young British manager and had viewed him as the ideal choice to build a Manchester City winning dynasty. Despite this, Mancini is a year younger and possessed the experience of winning silverware {{and the ability to}} build a team, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> successfully at Inter.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank he kept in her room. To keep her quiet he bared his teeth and barked and growled at her like a wild dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not like he made these noises outside the door, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously {{consider the possibility that}} Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E

The story, and Cernan's relationship with his daughter in general, was later adapted into [...] "Tracy's Song" [...] by pop-rock band No More Kings.

500|$|Other notable {{children}} of Terry (from the Thorpe marriage) included Sir Francis William Terry, High Sheriff of Yorkshire from 1945 to 1946, and Frances Harriet Terry, wife of cricketer Charles Wright, who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University between 1882 and 1885 and for Nottinghamshire between 1882 and 1899. Wright {{is considered to}} be the first cricket captain to declare an innings closed, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in 1890 against Kent. [...] Joseph was also a close friend of Sir Frederick Milner, MP for the City of York constituency from 1883 to 1885.

500|$|The main {{theme of}} the novel is drugs, which Faulks said came partly from the {{timeframe}} of the novel and partly from Fleming not using it as a major theme: [...] "1967, the summer of love... Drugs were first coming to public notice. The Stones were busted, and there was that famous leader in The Times. And, you know, {{what are we talking about}} now all the time? Drugs. It's still very resonant. And there's little about drug-dealing in Fleming. It's not <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in any depth." [...] Faulks also wanted to broaden the aspect of the story compared to Fleming: [...] "The book is set during the Cold War and I wanted it to not just be a crime story but to also have a political background. I was also determined that although the book is set in 1967, I wanted the issues that it touches on to still be alive to us today".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{failing to}} score a century for his club side (<b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not rectify until the 1923–24 season), Ponsford was called up to {{represent}} Victoria against the visiting England team in February 1921—his first-class cricket debut. His selection was controversial; the leading personality in Victorian cricket and national captain, [...] "The Big Ship" [...] Warwick Armstrong, had been dropped. Armstrong's omission sparked a series of angry public meetings protesting against the perceived persecution of Armstrong by administrators. While making {{his way to the}} Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) for the match, Ponsford had to walk through demonstrators carrying placards that denounced his selection at the expense of Armstrong. Without Armstrong, the Victorians were comfortably beaten by Johnny Douglas's English team by seven wickets. Batting down the order, Ponsford made six in the first innings and 19 in the second innings. Later that month, Ponsford made his maiden first-class century, scoring 162 against Tasmania at the NTCA Ground in Launceston, despite batting low in the order, at number eight.|$|E
500|$|Guests were {{expected}} to dress to high standards, with men wearing evening suits and the women wearing [...] "gowns with silk gloves reaching the elbow". All women in full evening dress received an orchid or gardenia corsage, compliments of the Stork Club. A requirement for all men was a necktie; {{those who were not}} wearing one were either lent one or had to buy one to gain admittance. Although African Americans were not explicitly barred from entry, there was a mutual understanding that they were not welcome. Billingsley insisted on orderly conduct for all of his Stork Club guests; fighting, drunkenness, or rowdiness were prohibited. He ran the club on the principle of it being a place where people could have a good time and that it was somewhere he could bring his own family without worrying that they would see or hear <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want them to. Billingsley closely controlled the seating placement system in the club. Unescorted women were not allowed to enter the club after 6:00 p.m; this was a protective measure for men who may have been out with someone other than their wives.|$|E

500|$|Gough and Millar {{had five}} months for casting, but their primary {{focus was on}} finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They {{received}} Kristin Kreuk's audition tape {{for the role of}} Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity {{to be part of the}} show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be [...] "Superman in high school", <b>something</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script if he came in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was [...] "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was [...] "the guy".|$|E
