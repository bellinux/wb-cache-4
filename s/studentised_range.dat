40|$|We {{consider}} the unbalanced one-way layout for comparing 3 treatment effects {{which can be}} assumed to satisfy the simple ordering m 1 m 2 m 3. This problem arises often in the comparison of three dose levels in medical trials, for example. The one-sided <b>studentised</b> <b>range</b> test provides a set of simultaneous confidence intervals for the ordered pairwise differences mj - mi, i 0 {{while at the same}} time providing two-sided finite confidence intervals. Consequently, this new procedure has the advantage of allowing the same directional inferences as the one-sided <b>studentised</b> <b>range</b> test while additionally providing upper bounds on the differences among the treatment effects...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the power function}} of the <b>Studentised</b> <b>range</b> test for comparing the means of normal populations in the one-way fixed effects analysis of variance model. The main results provide rigorous proofs of certain least favourable configurations of population means. These results are important in the calculation of the sample sizes required to guarantee power levels under certain restrictions on the ranges of the population means...|$|E

In particular, the statistical test was performed to evaluate any significant difference between the same class of motion under different conditions (i.e. different predator abundances and perceptive distances) and between the five motion strategies in the same simulation scenario. ANOVA was corroborated by a post hoc multiple comparison test using Tukey's honestly significant difference method (Hochberg and Tamhane 1987), a single-step procedure using the <b>studentised</b> <b>range</b> statistic to compare all pairs of means.|$|E
40|$|A {{consensus}} is emerging that continuous (or metric) measures {{can be useful}} in phylogenetic systematics. Many of the methods for coding such characters, how- ever, employ elements that are arbitrary and therefore should be excluded from use in cladistic analysis. The continued use of such potentially inappropriate methods can be attributed to either their simplicity or the availability of computer programs specifically designed to produce data matrices using these methods. Conversely, one of the most suitable methods, homogeneous subset coding (HSC), is underused, probably {{due to the lack of}} a suitable software implementation for this somewhat complex procedure. This paper describes TaxMan, a Web-based facility for the coding of continuous data using HSC. Data are entered using a form accessible via any internet browser and are automatically converted to a matrix suitable for input into tree-searching software. This implementation of the HSC technique provides an uncomplicated procedure for the incorporation of metric data in phylogenetic systematics. The algorithmic implementation of the HSC procedure, and interpolation of the <b>Studentised</b> <b>range</b> and maximum modulus distributions required by it, is described in detail in appendices.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori causes chronic (type B) gastritis. The 'intestinal' form of {{gastric cancer}} arises against a {{background}} of chronic gastritis, and prospective epidemiological studies have shown that H pylori is a major risk factor for this. An increase in mucosal cell proliferation increases the likelihood of a neoplastic clone of epithelial cells emerging where there is chronic epithelial cell injury associated with H pylori gastritis. In vitro bromodeoxyuridine labelling of endoscopic antral biopsy specimens was used to measure mucosal cell proliferation in H pylori associated gastritis before and after therapy for H pylori triple infection. Cell proliferation was increased in H pylori associated gastritis patients compared with normal controls and patients with H pylori negative chronic gastritis (p = 0. 0001; Tukey's <b>Studentised</b> <b>range).</b> There was no difference in antral epithelial cell proliferation between duodenal ulcer and non-ulcer subjects infected with H pylori (p = 0. 62; Student's t test). Antral mucosal cell proliferation fell four weeks after completing triple therapy, irrespective of whether or not H pylori had been eradicated (p = 0. 0001). At retesting six to 18 months later (mean = 12 months), however, those in whom H pylori had not been successfully eradicated showed increased mucosal proliferation compared with both H pylori negative subjects at a similar follow up interval and all cases (whether H pylori positive or negative) four weeks after completion of triple therapy (p = 0. 024). These findings suggest that H pylori infection causes increased gastric cell proliferation and in this way may play a part in gastric carcinogenesis...|$|E
