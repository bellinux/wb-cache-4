5000|$|Hoff joined Intel in 1968 as {{employee}} number 12, and {{is credited with}} {{coming up with the}} idea of using a [...] "universal processor" [...] rather than a variety of custom-designed circuits in the architectural idea and an instruction set formulated with Stanley Mazor in 1969 for the Intel 4004—the chip that started the microprocessor revolution in the early 1970s. Development of the <b>silicon-gate</b> design methodology and the actual chip design was done by Federico Faggin, who also led the project during 1970-1971.|$|E
50|$|Fairchild Semiconductor {{was also}} {{home of the}} first <b>silicon-gate</b> IC {{technology}} with self-aligned gates, the basis of all modern CMOS computer chips. The technology was developed by Italian physicist Federico Faggin in 1968. In 1970, he joined Intel {{in order to develop}} the first single-chip central processing unit (CPU) microprocessor, the Intel 4004, for which he received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2010. The 4004 was designed by Busicom's Masatoshi Shima and Intel's Ted Hoff in 1969, but it was Faggin's improved design in 1970 that made it a reality.|$|E
5000|$|At Fairchild Faggin also {{designed}} the world's first commercial integrated circuit using Silicon Gate Technology with self aligned MOSFET transistors: the Fairchild 3708. The 3708 was an 8-bit analog multiplexer with decoding logic, replacing the equivalent Fairchild 3705 that used metal-gate technology. The 3708 was 5 times faster, had 100 times less junction leakage and {{was much more}} reliable than the 3705, demonstrating the superiority of SGT over metal-gate MOS. See also: Faggin, F., Klein T. (1969). [...] "A Faster Generation of MOS Devices With Low Threshold Is Riding The Crest of the New Wave, <b>Silicon-Gate</b> IC's." [...] Electronics, Sept. 29, 1969.|$|E
50|$|The 8008 was {{implemented}} in 10 μm <b>silicon-gate</b> enhancement-mode PMOS logic. Initial versions could work at clock frequencies up to 0.5 MHz. This was later {{increased in the}} 8008-1 to a specified maximum of 0.8 MHz. Instructions took between 5 and 11 T-states, where each T-state was 2 clock cycles.Register-register loads and ALU operations took 5T (20 μs at 0.5 MHz), register-memory 8T (32 μs), while calls and jumps (when taken) took 11 T-states (44 μs).The 8008 was a little slower in terms of instructions per second (36,000 to 80,000 at 0.8 MHz) than the 4-bit Intel 4004 and Intel 4040. The fact that the 8008 processed data 8 bits {{at a time and}} could access significantly more RAM still gave it a significant speed advantage in most applications. The 8008 had 3,500 transistors.|$|E
50|$|The self-aligned gate {{is used to}} {{eliminate}} the need to align the gate electrode to the source and drain regions of a MOS transistor during the fabrication process. With self-aligned gates the parasitic overlap capacitances between gate and source, and gate and drain are substantially reduced, leading to MOS transistors that are faster, smaller and more reliable than transistors made without them. After the early experimentation with different gate materials (aluminum, molybdenum, amorphous silicon) the industry almost universally adopted self-aligned gates made with polycrystalline silicon, the so-called Silicon Gate Technology (SGT), which had many additional benefits over the reduction of parasitic capacitances. One important feature of SGT was that the silicon gate was entirely buried under top quality thermal oxide (one of the best insulators known), {{making it possible to}} create new device types, not feasible with conventional technology or with self-aligned gates made with other materials. Particularly important are charge coupled devices (CCD), used for image sensors, and non-volatile memory devices using floating <b>silicon-gate</b> structures. These devices dramatically enlarged the range of functionality that could be achieved with solid state electronics.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, bipolar {{junction}} transistors were a hundred {{times as fast as}} the (p-channel) MOS transistors then used and were much more reliable, but they also consumed much more power, required more area, and demanded a more complicated manufacturing process. MOS ICs were considered interesting but inadequate for supplanting the fast bipolar circuits in anything but niche markets, such as low power applications. One {{of the reasons for the}} low speed was that MOS transistors had gates made of aluminum which led to considerable parasitic capacitances using the manufacturing processes of the time. The introduction of transistors with gates of polycrystalline silicon (that became the de facto standard from the mid-1970s to early 2000s) was an important first step in order to reduce this handicap. This new self-aligned <b>silicon-gate</b> transistor was introduced by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor in early 1968; it was a refinement (and the first working implementation) of ideas and work by John C. Sarace, Tom Klein and Robert W. Bower (around 1966-67) for a transistor with less parasitic capacitances that could be manufactured as part of an IC (and not only as a discrete component). This new type of pMOS transistor was 3-5 times as fast (per watt) as the aluminum-gate pMOS transistor, and it needed less area, had much lower leakage and higher reliability. The same year, Faggin also built the first IC using the new transistor type, the Fairchild 3708 (8-bit analog multiplexer with decoder), which demonstrated a substantially improved performance over its metal-gate counterpart. In less than 10 years, the silicon gate MOS transistor replaced bipolar circuits as the main vehicle for complex digital ICs.|$|E

Results are compared to conventional E/D logic. Two specific design regions are pointed out: low power and high speed.

40|$|The {{microelectronics}} technology {{falls within}} the boundaries of that definition. Carbon nanotube (CNT) is a promising alternative material for the future nanoelectronics. Owing to the unique properties of CNTs and the maturity of CMOS IC technology, the integration of the two technologies will take advantages of both. In this work, we demonstrate a new local <b>silicon-gate</b> carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNFET) by combining the in situ CNT growth technology and the SOI technology. The proposed CNFET structure has realized individual device operation, batch fabrication, low parasitics and better compatibility to the CMOS process at the same time. The configuration proposes a feasible approach to integrate the CNTs to CMOS platform for the first time, which makes CNT a step closer to application. The CNFETs show advanced DC characteristics. The ambipolar conductance and the scaling effect of the CNFETs have been analyzed based on the SB modulated conductance mechanism. Investigation of radio-frequency (RF) characteristics of CNTs is essential for their application. RF transmission characteristics of the semiconducting and metallic CNTs are investigated to the frequency of 12 GHz using the full two-port S-parameter methodology for the first time. Without the effect of the parasitics, the signal transmission capability of the CNTs maintains at a constant level and shows no degeneration even at a high frequency of 12 GHz. An empirical RLC element model has been proposed to fit the RF response of the CNT array. Capacitive contact is reported between the CNTs and the metal electrodes. We also explore the high-frequency properties of the local <b>silicon-gate</b> CNFET as an active device by measuring its S parameters using a common-source configuration.
