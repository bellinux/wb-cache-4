5000|$|Built on a 55-ground plot, the {{building}} was of enclosed construction with glass facings at front and rear. The building consists of 15 floors—13 levels with 2 basement floors. The building is of RCC-framed construction designed for central air conditioning, designed {{in the shape of}} well-proportioned box with <b>strip</b> <b>glass</b> façade. The air conditioning plant is in the sub-basement floor. The top floor of {{the building}} reaches a height of 44 meters, and the total height of the building is 177 feet. The total floor area of the building is 1,26,000 sq ft. The building stands on 521 pneumatic caisson piles that run to a depth of 35 ft below the ground. The building was built at a cost of [...] 8.7 million in 1959. The building consumed about 26,000 sq ft of special glass that was treated with infra-red rays, stove enameled and made water resistant with synthetic enamel paint. About 1,000 tons of steel and 3,000 tons of cement were used {{in the construction of the}} building.|$|E

50|$|In May 2006, Lane {{produced}} Borealis for the General Motors Renaissance Center in Detroit, USA, {{which is}} believed to be the largest glass sculpture in existence. The work was inspired by the Aurora Borealis, a spectacle that Lane references in the refraction of light through the numerous <b>strips</b> of <b>glass.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Lane made Parting of the Waves for Canary Wharf Plc, East London. The {{work is a}} 4m high, 10m long {{ribbon of}} glass running {{each side of the}} north entrance. It was {{constructed}} from 2000 narrow <b>strips</b> of <b>glass,</b> which are locked into place by their own weight.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, the Mirage Motel {{was renamed}} as the Glass Pool Inn to avoid {{confusion}} with Steve Wynn's new Mirage resort, also {{located on the}} Las Vegas <b>Strip.</b> The <b>Glass</b> Pool Inn was closed in September 2003, and demolished a year later for a project that ultimately did not materialize.|$|R
50|$|Masking tape is {{also used}} in long <b>strips</b> on larger <b>glass</b> panes in {{situations}} where the glass might be shattered, harming those in the vicinity.|$|R
50|$|The {{top part}} of the tower is {{completely}} glass. Below this, the tower consists of <b>strips</b> of <b>glass</b> set within pre-cast concrete panels. The pre-cast concrete panels were painted in varying tones of beige after the construction. The reason for this was unknown, however in December 2006 these patches were painted over in a single colour.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} bench-scale {{experiments}} {{was carried out}} to determine the rate and efficiency with which benzene and p-xylene, components of gasoline, could be removed from an unsaturated soil by air <b>stripping.</b> <b>Glass</b> columns, 30 cm in length, were packed with soil and wetted to volumetric moisture contents of 10 and 18 percent. Air saturated {{with one of the}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was used to load the column. Clean air was used to strip the contaminant from the soil. Benzene and p-xylene concentrations in the soil water and air were reduced four orders of magnitude after a few hours (2 - 8) of stripping. Benzene was removed faster than p-xylene. Air flow was the rate-limiting step early in the stripping, however slow desorption from the soil became rate-limiting as the stripping progressed. As moisture content increased the rate of removal of both contaminants decreased...|$|R
50|$|When {{the bead}} making {{industries}} in India began making chevron beads during the 1980s, the star beads made in Purdalpur, {{one of the}} glass bead making centers, were made {{without the use of}} a mould, from prepared sections of hot <b>strips</b> of <b>glass</b> that were fused together to form a cane. Because of this method of manufacture, the points of the stars of these beads typically have slight indentations.|$|R
5000|$|Bruce Guenther, Portland Art Museum's chief curator, {{was looking}} for a new piece to become a major focal point for a {{retrospective}} of Moje's work, the resulting work was a suite of four panels [...] "Choreographed Geometry," [...] also known as the [...] "Portland Panels." [...] This work was created at the Bullseye Factory and was constructed from thousands of hand cut <b>strips</b> of <b>glass,</b> each panel measures 6 × 4 feet.|$|R
25|$|Lace patterns: <b>Strips</b> of {{coloured}} <b>glass</b> were twisted with a contrasting coloured {{thread of}} glass before being fused together. This {{was a popular}} method in the early period, but appears to {{have gone out of}} fashion by the mid-1st century AD.|$|R
50|$|At the end {{of three}} minutes, or when all the {{obstacles}} were cleared, the exit opened. The final <b>glass</b> <b>strip</b> {{on the far side}} of the exit was worth 30 points. This challenge had 150 total points available and a four-minute time limit.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} design stage {{consisted of a}} vast ring ellipsoid, whose major perimeter was about 640 metres. The base consisted of a bench of white granite, on which rested the socket in red plaster. The same materials were formed at 45° planes, that mark three <b>strips</b> of <b>glass</b> for lighting indoors, crowned by a white railing. Over this, large windows overlooked, restricted by concrete pillars that supported the terminal swing, projecting more than three metres, with an inclination of 45 degrees.|$|R
50|$|The 16 finalists {{moved into}} the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, and after meeting the judges for the first time, had a runway {{challenge}} over a narrow <b>strip</b> of <b>glass</b> submerged in a pool. They later arrived on set for their first photo shoot, where {{it was revealed that}} the judges had decided to eliminate Jessie based on her poor performance at the challenge. The remaining models shot the series' opening sequence and promotional stills. At elimination, Elektra became the second contestant to leave the competition.|$|R
50|$|Teagarden {{appeared}} in the movies Birth of the Blues (1941), The <b>Strip</b> (1951), The <b>Glass</b> Wall (1953), and Jazz on a Summer's Day (1960), the latter a documentary film of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. He recorded for RCA Victor, Columbia, Decca, Capitol, and MGM Records.|$|R
50|$|In {{the morning}} light {{it became clear that}} many if not nearly all {{properties}} in the Colony would need some repair. Many parallel blinds and shutters had been <b>stripped</b> from windows, <b>glass</b> was broken, roof tiles had been blown away, and walls were stripped of plaster.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} {{exceptionally}} slender with only 1400 m2 of {{gross floor area}} per floor, because of a zoning regulation limiting the total building floor area to twelve times the property area. Its façade is more ornamental {{than that of the}} average International style tower, with horizontal <b>strips</b> of <b>glass</b> curtain wall alternating with spandrels of various types of stone, including green slate that was quarried in Wales. The building was fully renovated in 1991, and the highly visible CIBC logo at the top was redesigned in 2004 and again in 2013.|$|R

50|$|Consequently, {{the use of}} the {{building}} was intentionally ignored - not fought against. Eisenman grudgingly permitted a handful of compromises, such as a bathroom, but the staircase lacks a handrail, there is a column abutting the kitchen table, and a <b>glass</b> <b>strip</b> originally divided the bedroom, preventing the installation of a double beds.|$|R
40|$|Two masonry types with {{irregular}} texture are analysed {{to evaluate}} mechanical properties, sources of vulnerability and to design proper strengthening interventions. Direct surveying, laboratory and in situ tests {{were performed to}} evaluate morphological characteristics and mechanical properties. Experimental values were compared with results obtained from analytical and FEM homogenizations, which exploited automated image segmentation process to determine volume fractions and description of the Reference Volume Element. <b>Strips</b> of <b>Glass</b> Fabric-Reinforced Cementitious Matrix and transversal bars were considered and tested as strengthening solutions to overcome irregular masonries limits derived from multi-leaf structure highlighting levels of capacity improvement...|$|R
5000|$|Jiggles {{was torn}} down in 2014, in a {{campaign}} led by mayor Lou Ogden, {{to make way for}} a Cabela's store as part of the Nyberg Rivers shopping complex. The complex's spokesperson said he wished Jiggles would have shut down sooner but [...] "they did not cooperate". The <b>strip</b> club's <b>glass</b> front doors, with included [...] "art", and the bouncer's chair were secured and donated to the Tualatin Historic Society (THS) for sale. THS quipped, [...] "Ideas for their next life have been many, but not on the list is permanent display at the heritage center." ...|$|R

[...] Wilson took up several of his <b>strips</b> of <b>glass.</b> When the {{audience}} recognized these familiar mementos of Pudd'nhead's old time childish [...] "puttering" [...] and folly, the tense and funereal interest vanished out of their faces, and the house burst into volleys of relieving and refreshing laughter, and Tom chirked up and joined in the fun himself; but Wilson was apparently not disturbed. He arranged his records {{on the table before}} him, and said: ...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} use of CO 2 laser to induce <b>glass</b> <b>strip</b> peeling off to form microchannels on soda lime gass substrate. The strip peeling {{exhibits}} a strong dependence on the energy deposition rate on the glass surface. In spite of the vast difference in the combination of laser power and scanning speed, when {{the ratio of the}} two makes the energy deposition rate in the range 3. 0 - 6. 0 [*]J/(cm 2 [*]s), the temperature rising inside glass will be above the strain point and reach the softening region of the glass. As a result, <b>glass</b> <b>strip</b> peeling is able to occur and form microchannels with dimensions of 20 - 40 [*]μm in depth and 200 - 280 [*]μm in width on the glass surface. Beyond this range, higher energy depsotion rate would lead to surface melting associated with solidification cracks and lower energy deposition rate causes the generation of fragment cracks...|$|R
6000|$|He had a rich {{abundance}} of idle time, {{but it never}} hung heavy on his hands, for he interested himself in every new thing that was born into the universe of ideas, and studied it, and experimented upon it at his house. One of his pet fads was palmistry. To another one he gave no name, neither would he explain to anybody what its purpose was, but merely {{said it was an}} amusement. In fact, he had found that his fads added to his reputation as a pudd'nhead; there, he was growing chary of being too communicative about them. The fad without a name was one which dealt with people's finger marks. He carried in his coat pocket a shallow box with grooves in it, and in the grooves <b>strips</b> of <b>glass</b> five inches long and three inches wide. Along the lower edge of each strip was pasted a slip of white paper. He asked people to pass their hands through their hair (thus collecting upon them a thin coating of the natural oil) and then making a thumb-mark on a <b>glass</b> <b>strip,</b> following it with the mark of the ball of each finger in succession. Under this row of faint grease prints he would write a record on the strip of white paper--thus: ...|$|R

50|$|Commodore Theatre is a {{historic}} movie theater located at Portsmouth, Virginia. It was built in 1945, and is an Art Deco style, 1,000-seat theater building. The two-story front facade features a plain mass of yellow pressed brick decorated with horizontal stripes of brown brick on the upper level with a central pavilion of curved-top vertical pylons of Indiana limestone and decorative <b>strips</b> of <b>glass</b> block. The lower level of the facade is composed of Indiana limestone ashlar veneer with a base of black marble. A dominant element of the auditorium is the pair of restored murals on the side walls representing the progress of America and the commerce and industry of Hampton Roads.|$|R
30|$|The overall visual {{transmission}} {{characteristics of}} the FB 720 solar control glazing are highly dependent on the transparency and reflectivity of the different materials in the <b>strips.</b> Although the <b>glass</b> usually provides good visibility, it is not totally transparent. Visibility through the glass depends on {{the contrast between the}} exterior and interior lighting. However, this variability produces some interesting aesthetic features because the attractive appearance changes throughout the day.|$|R
50|$|The Diablo range also {{received}} an updated interior. Instead {{of the traditional}} flat dashboard with a separate upright instrument binnacle, as in many Italian sports cars of the era (and the previous Diablo), the new dash was an integrated wave-shaped design. A thin <b>strip</b> of black <b>glass</b> {{ran the length of}} the dash and contained various instrument indicator and warning lamps. This aesthetic design was inspired by Bang & Olufsen Hi-Fi products.|$|R
60|$|The {{holidays}} {{were indeed}} {{very different from}} school. They were free, they were spacious, and though he never knew it in these words--they had an element of beauty. In his memory of his boyhood they shone like <b>strips</b> of stained <b>glass</b> window in a dreary waste of scholastic wall, they grew brighter and brighter as they grew remoter. There came a time at last and moods when he could look back to them with a feeling akin to tears.|$|R
500|$|Outside {{the library}} is a [...] tall steel and brick clock tower. The tower has one clock face {{on each of the}} four sides, a copper roof, and glass running down each side towards the 18 ton base. The glass {{consists}} of vertical panels created by taking <b>strips</b> of bent <b>glass</b> and weaving them together. There are inscriptions of various quotes in the exposed portions of the concrete on the tower. Lawrence Halperin was responsible for the landscaping designs of the library.|$|R
