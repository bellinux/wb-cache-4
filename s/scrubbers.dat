5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 <b>scrubbers</b> are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the <b>scrubbers.</b> Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 <b>scrubbers.</b> In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E
5|$|The {{reduction}} of sulphur emissions {{had been an}} important factor since the station was in the design stages, as {{it was one of}} the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station. The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for washing the flue gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over <b>scrubbers</b> of steel and timber in the flue ducts. The gases were subject to continuous washing, and with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide, sulphur dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid. Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world. This method of washing was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than the gases would be to the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Many {{gasification}} plants use <b>scrubber</b> {{systems for}} the removal of tars from producer gas. The cost of the <b>scrubber</b> liquid represents a considerable part of the operating cost, which could be decreased by regenerating the spent <b>scrubber</b> liquid by separating it from ash residues and heavy tars. In this study, different types of spent <b>scrubber</b> liquids were regenerated using a centrifuge. The effect of centrifugation time (1. 5 – 10 min) and sample temperature (50 – 90 °C) on the separation efficiency was studied. Based on the results, the separation of tars from the <b>scrubber</b> liquids can be ranked as follows: diesel > RME > linoleic acid > linseed oil > rapeseed oil > motor oil. This ranking correlates to the viscosity of the different <b>scrubber</b> liquids, with the separation efficiency increasing with decreasing <b>scrubber</b> liquid viscosity. The best separation efficiency was achieved for <b>scrubber</b> liquids with low viscosity at 90 °C and 10 min of centrifugation time. The results obtained indicate that centrifugation can be used for the regeneration of spent <b>scrubber</b> liquid...|$|R

40|$|Pharmaceutical {{processes}} involving {{difficult to}} control off-gases are often transferred from the laboratory to the pilot plant without {{development and implementation of}} efficient gas <b>scrubber</b> operations. Two case studies are presented which involve effective <b>scrubber</b> design for mitigation of low boiling point volatile organic compounds (VOCs) based on scale-up from a laboratory bubble column to a pilot plant packed column, including: (1) a toluene/methanesulfonic acid (MSA) <b>scrubber</b> system to mitigate isobutylene emissions from tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) deprotection reactions, and (2) an aqueous ethanolamine <b>scrubber</b> system specifically to remove methyl bromide liberated during a demethylation process. On-line vapor phase mass spectrometry (MS) was used as a tool to aid in <b>scrubber</b> development, monitor reaction off-gas generation, and quantify <b>scrubber</b> efficiency on both laboratory and pilot plant scales to ensure safe and environmentally benign processes. The scale-up methodology involved determining the required pilot plant packed column superficial liquid velocity based on an equivalent physical liquid phase mass transfer coefficient (kL) for the laboratory bubble column. Utilizing an equivalent kL value upon scale-up resulted in essentially the same <b>scrubber</b> efficiency for both the isobutylene and methyl bromide <b>scrubber</b> systems. The acceptable isobutylene and methyl bromide loading rates for the pilot plant <b>scrubber</b> were determined based on the respective laboratory scale gas absorption rates for a fast, irreversible first order reaction of isobutylene in toluene and methyl bromide in ethanolamine. The <b>scrubber</b> design methodology was applied to a third case study involving an aqueous oxone <b>scrubber</b> system for mitigating dimethyl sulfide vapors/odors, such that pilot plant hydrodynamic factors and potential processing scale were determined based on laboratory results. Utilization of the <b>scrubber</b> design methodology eliminated the need for pilot plant experiments prior to scale-up. ...|$|R

40|$|Past {{studies with}} blowing face {{ventilation}} systems {{have shown that}} using a machine-mounted <b>scrubber</b> and water sprays can reduced methane levels at the face. The current research was conducted {{to determine how the}} sprays and <b>scrubber</b> interact to reduce methane levels, and what spray configurations provide the best face ventilation when used with a <b>scrubber.</b> Testing was conducted in a ventilation test gallery designed to simulate a full-scale mine entry. In the entry, a model mining machine, equipped with a simulated dust <b>scrubber</b> and water spray systems, was located at the face of a 6. 1 m (20 ft) box cut. Face ventilation was provided by a blowing curtain located 12. 2 m (40 ft) from the face. Methane released from a manifold at the face was measured at six locations near the face to compare the ventilation effectiveness of the spray systems while operating with and without the <b>scrubber.</b> Airflow movement across the face was affected by the spray configuration and <b>scrubber</b> operation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of the addition of an air <b>scrubber</b> to an already existing delay line and whether it would scrub {sup 11 }CO{sub 2 }. There were three main objectives of this study.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this conducted research is to study the iodine removal efficiency in a self-priming venturi <b>scrubber</b> for submerged and non-submerged operating conditions experimentally and theoretically. The alkaline solution is used as an absorbent, which is prepared by dissolving sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium thiosulphate (Na 2 S 2 O 3) in water to remove the gaseous iodine (I 2) from the gas. Iodine removal efficiency is examined at various gas flow rates and inlet concentrations of iodine for submerged and non-submerged operating conditions. In the non-submerged venturi <b>scrubber,</b> only the droplets take part in iodine removal efficiency. However, in a submerged venturi <b>scrubber</b> condition, the iodine gas is absorbed from gas to droplets inside the venturi <b>scrubber</b> and from bubbles to surrounding liquid at the outlet of a venturi <b>scrubber.</b> Experimentally, {{it is observed that}} the iodine removal efficiency is greater in the submerged venturi <b>scrubber</b> as compare to a non-submerged venturi <b>scrubber</b> condition. The highest iodine removal efficiency of 0. 99 ± 0. 001 has been achieved in a submerged self-priming venturi <b>scrubber</b> condition. A mathematical correlation is used to predict the theoretical iodine removal efficiency in submerged and non-submerged conditions, and it is compared against the experimental results. The Wilkinson et al. correlation is used to predict the bubble diameter theoretically whereas the Nukiyama and Tanasawa correlation is used for droplet diameter. The mass transfer coefficient for the gas phase is calculated from the Steinberger and Treybal correlation. The calculated results for a submerged venturi <b>scrubber</b> agree well with experimental results but underpredicts {{in the case of the}} non-submerged venturi <b>scrubber...</b>|$|R
