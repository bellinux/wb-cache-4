25|$|Genie's {{language}} acquisition also refined existing hypotheses and {{gave rise to}} additional hypotheses about what parts of language the right hemisphere could acquire after the critical period.

This further convinced the scientists that Genie's {{language acquisition}} was abnormal because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> after the critical period, and therefore was processing language in the right hemisphere of her brain.|$|E
