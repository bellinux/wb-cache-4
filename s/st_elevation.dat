25|$|Acute {{coronary}} syndrome (ACS) is a syndrome (set {{of signs}} and symptoms) due to decreased blood {{flow in the}} coronary arteries such {{that part of the}} heart muscle is unable to function properly or dies. The most common symptom is chest pain, often radiating to the left shoulder or angle of the jaw, crushing, central and associated with nausea and sweating. Acute coronary syndrome is usually caused by one of three problems: <b>ST</b> <b>elevation</b> myocardial infarction (STEMI, 30%), non <b>ST</b> <b>elevation</b> myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, 25%), or unstable angina (38%).|$|E
50|$|The {{administration}} of class Ia, Ic, and III drugs increases the <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation,</b> as does fever.

25|$|<b>ST</b> <b>elevation</b> {{myocardial}} infarctions {{have different}} characteristic ECG findings {{based on the}} amount of time elapsed since the MI first occurred. The earliest sign is hyperacute T waves, peaked T-waves due to local hyperkalemia in ischemic myocardium. This then progresses over a period of minutes to elevations of the ST segment by at least 1nbsp&mm. Over a period of hours, a pathologic Q wave may appear and the T wave will invert. Over a period of days the <b>ST</b> <b>elevation</b> will resolve. Pathologic q waves generally will remain permanently.|$|E
25|$|ECG {{findings}} {{associated with}} pulmonary emboli may suggest worse prognosis since the six findings identified with RV strain on ECG (heart rate > 100 beats per minute, S1Q3T3, inverted T waves in leads V1-V4, <b>ST</b> <b>elevation</b> in aVR, complete right bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation) {{are associated with}} increased risk of circulatory shock and death.|$|E
25|$|If an MI is {{presented}} with ECG {{evidence of an}} <b>ST</b> <b>elevation</b> known as STEMI, or if a bundle branch block is similarly presented, then reperfusion therapy is necessary. In {{the absence of an}} <b>ST</b> <b>elevation,</b> a non-ST elevation MI, known as an NSTEMI, or an unstable angina may be presumed (both of these are indistinguishable on initial evaluation of symptoms). ST elevations indicate a completely blocked artery needing immediate reperfusion. In NSTEMI the blood flow is present but limited by stenosis. In NSTEMI the same thrombolytics are used as for STEMI, but they are also often stabilised with antiplatelets and anticoagulants. If the condition stays stable a cardiac stress test may be offered, and if needed subsequent revascularization will be carried out to restore a normal blood flow. If the blood flow becomes unstable an urgent angioplasty may be required. In these unstable cases the use of thrombolytics is contraindicated.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the electrocardiographic (ECG) features associated with acute left main coronary artery (LMCA) obstruction. BACKGROUNDPrediction of LMCA obstruction is important with regard to selecting the appropriate treatment strategy, because acute LMCA obstruction usually causes severe hemodynamic deterioration, resulting in a less favorable prognosis. METHODSWe studied the admission 12 -lead ECGs in 16 consecutive patients with acute LMCA obstruction (LMCA group), 46 patients with acute left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) obstruction (LAD group) and 24 patients with acute right coronary artery (RCA) obstruction (RCA group). RESULTSLead aVR <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> (> 0. 05 mV) occurred with a significantly higher incidence in the LMCA group (88 % [14 / 16]) than in the LAD (43 % [20 / 46]) or RCA (8 % [2 / 24]) groups. Lead aVR <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> was significantly higher in the LMCA group (0. 16 ± 0. 13 mV) than in the LAD group (0. 04 ± 0. 10 mV). Lead V 1 <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> was lower in the LMCA group (0. 00 ± 0. 21 mV) than in the LAD group (0. 14 ± 0. 11 mV). The finding of lead aVR <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> {{greater than or equal}} to lead V 1 <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> distinguished the LMCA group from the LAD group, with 81 % sensitivity, 80 % specificity and 81 % accuracy. A ST segment shift in lead aVR and the inferior leads distinguished the LMCA group from the RCA group. In acute LMCA obstruction, death occurred more frequently in patients with higher <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> in lead aVR than in those with less severe <b>elevation.</b> CONCLUSIONSLead aVR <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> with less <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> in lead V 1 is an important predictor of acute LMCA obstruction. In acute LMCA obstruction, lead aVR <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> also contributes to predicting a patient’s clinical outcome...|$|R
25|$|Idiopathic {{ventricular}} fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1% {{of all cases}} of out-of-hospital arrest, as well as 3%-9% of the cases of {{ventricular fibrillation}} unrelated to myocardial infarction, and 14% of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients {{under the age of}} 40. It follows then that, {{on the basis of the}} fact that ventricular fibrillation itself is common, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation accounts for an appreciable mortality. Recently described syndromes such as the Brugada Syndrome may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias. In the Brugada syndrome, changes may be found in the resting ECG with evidence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and <b>ST</b> <b>elevation</b> in the chest leads V1-V3, with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the significance of exercise induced <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> in patients with previous myocardial infarction, we have studied 156 patients, 26 months (mean) after myocardial infarction.

There {{was no significant difference in}} the extent of coronary disease or abnormalities of left ventricular function between patients with exercise induced <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> that was noted to occur in leads with Q waves and those with <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> plus depression or those with ST segment depression alone. Patients without exercise induced ST segment changes had fewer coronary arteries involved than those who developed ST segment changes. Nineteen patients with exercise induced <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> alone underwent coronary artery bypass surgery; in 11 this resulted in complete abolition of the exercise induced <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> and was associated with symptomatic relief and patent grafts without alteration of left ventricular function.

During the recovery phase, the sensitivity of U wave inversion was 82 % in V 4 and 65 % in V 5, though <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> was absent in both V 4 and V 5. Thus, inverted U waves without <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> often appear in marginal ischaemic zones or during the time of recovery from temporary ischaemia.

40|$|Objectives. We {{examined}} the modulatory effects of {{autonomic nervous system}} and antiarrhythmic drugs on the ST segment in patients with Brugada syndrome to gain an insight into the mechanism of <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation.</b> Background. Right bundle branch block, <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> and ventricular tachyarrhythmias define a distinct clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) syndrome (Brugada syndrome). However, the mechanism of <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> and the causes of this syndrome are unknown. Methods. The study included four patients in whom structural heart or coronary artery disease was excluded by noninvasive and invasive tests. High take-off <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> of either the coved or saddle-back type in precordial leads V 1, V 2 and V 3 was seen in all patients. Three patients experienced recurrent episodes of syncope or aborted sudden cardiac death, and the remaining patient had palpitation. Autonomic receptor stimulation and blockade and intravenous administration of antiarrhythmic drugs were performed during sinus rhythm while the 12 -lead ECG was recorded. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning and Holter monitoring were also performed. Results. Beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by intravenous isoproterenol consistently reduced (≥ 0. 1 mV) <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> at or 80 ms after the J point in all four patients. Selective alphaadrenoceptor stimulation by intravenous norepinephrine {{in the presence of}} propranolol or by intravenous methoxamine consistently augmented, whereas alpha-adrenoceptor blockade reduced, <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> in three patients. Intracoronary acetylcholine or intravenous edrophonium or neostigmine augmented <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> without inducing coronary spasm in three of four patients. Class IA antiarrhythmic drugs also consistently augmented (three patients), whereas class IB drugs had no effect on (two patients) <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation.</b> No abnormality was found on MIBG imaging or heart rate variability in three patients, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction is not a primary disease process. Class IA drugs had no effect on ST segment in three control patients, suggesting that the <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> seen in patients with Brugada syndrome in response to the drugs is not a nonspecific response. Conclusions. <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> in patients with Brugada syndrome was augmented by selective stimulation of alphaadrenoceptors or muscarinic receptors or by class IA drugs but was mitigated by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation or alphaadrenoceptor blockade. These responses might be explained by postulating the presence of an area of early repolarization or a local “depolarized” area in the ventricle causing <b>ST</b> segment <b>elevation</b> in this syndrome.
