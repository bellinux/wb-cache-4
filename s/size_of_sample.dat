The influence of the precursor salt nature and initial ferric concentration in the average particle size and magnetic properties of the obtained nanoparticles were investigated. Magnetite nanoparticles have received much attention due to the multiple uses in the biomedical field; for these purposes nanoparticles with monodisperse size distribution, superparamagnetic behavior and a combination between small average size and high saturation magnetization are required. The polyol conventional method allows synthesizing water-dispersible magnetite nanoparticles with these features employing iron (III) acetylacetonate as precursor salt. Although the particle <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> synthesized from the conventional polyol method (denoted CM) are larger than those <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> synthesized from the modified method (denoted MM), they display similar saturation magnetization.

We present a comparative study of 10 state-of-the-art sampling algorithms regarding their fault-detection capability and <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> sets. The former is important to improve software quality and the latter to reduce the time of analysis.

Furthermore, we observed that the limiting assumptions made in previous work influence the number of detected faults, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> sets, and the ranking of algorithms.
