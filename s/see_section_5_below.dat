Under the student information system used in the district during our study period, class ranks were calculated centrally. Both class rank and the total number of students enrolled were calculated {{at the end of each}} semester and given to the student records office, which then distributed transcripts to high school campuses. 9 However, this information is not stored by the district as part of its regular data system, and we instead calculate class rank based on course-level grade records (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>5</b> <b>below</b> for details).|$|E

30|$|As {{far as the}} {{imperfect}} CSI case is concerned, we restrict {{our attention}} to only block fading channels with F blocks and quasi-static fading with F[*]=[*] 1. The reason is that channel estimation {{is assumed to be}} obtained via a pilot-based approach for[23], which is clearly not compatible with fully interleaved Rayleigh fading. The channel gain is assumed to be constant over one block and is assumed to change independently from block to block. In our setting, a codeword covers F blocks, and the relay estimates the error probability of the whole codeword based on the knowledge of the channel gains of all blocks (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> <b>5</b> <b>below).</b> These channel gains are estimated via a pilot message, which is inserted {{at the beginning of each}} block, and transmitted via BPSK modulation.|$|E

Denote by modΛ the category of all finitely generated (right) Λ-modules and by indΛ the full subcategory in which every object is {{a representative of the}} isoclass of an indecomposable (right) Λ-module. We are interested in the existance of the Hall polynomial ϕMNLfor anL,M,N∈modΛ (for the definition, see 977113 or Section 1 below). In case Λ is directed, 7 has shown that Λ has Hall polynomials, and in case Λ is cyclic serial, the same result has also been obtained by 4. It has been conjectured in 8 that any representation-finitek-algebra has Hall polynomials. In this investigation, we shall show that if Λ is a representation-finite trivial extension algebra, then, for anyL,M,N∈modΛ withNindecomposable, Λ has the Hall polynomials ϕMLNand ϕMNL. Using these Hall polynomials, we can naturally structure the free abelian group with a basis indΛ, denoted byK(modΛ), into a Lie algebra and the universal enveloping algebra ofK(modΛ) ⊗ZQis just H(Λ) 1 ⊗ZQ, where H(Λ) 1 is the degenerated Hall algebra of Λ (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>5</b> <b>below)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{has four}} sections: 1. Section One {{provides}} a background to the book: {{why it has}} come about and why it is important. Both editors of the book are lecturers in the Bachelor of Learning Management (BLM) at Central Queensland University (CQU). Dimensions of Learning (DoL) is an integral component of the learning design within this undergraduate program (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>5</b> <b>below).</b> Keen {{to learn more about}} the DoL framework, they were frustrated by the lack of published information about it. Anecdotally, they knew that educational institutions that have implemented DoL have reported improved teacher capability, better classroom organization and climate, improved teacher pedagogy and as a result improved student outcomes, but there is very little in the literature to support this. This book is important because it demonstrates, for the first time, how DoL has been applied in primary, secondary and tertiary practice in Australia. Through the related experiences of its contributors, the book is a how to account that will provide invaluable guidance and insights for practitioners interested in implementing the framework. 2. Section Two gives an account of the framework in the Australian context. DoL is gathering momentum in Australia, particularly in Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. One of the major reasons for this is that educational institutions are responding to the identified lack of pedagogical skills among our teachers (Ainley, 2004; Education Queensland, 2001). DoL fills a pressing need for a research based-framework that informs how to teach. First introduced into Prince Alfred College in Adelaide in 1994 (see Chapter X), DoL is now used in a number of leading educational institutions, many of which have reported significant gains in student outcomes since implementing the framework. 3. Section Three outlines the implementation of DoL into the Education Faculty of Central Queensland University (CQU). This is the only tertiary institution that is known worldwide to use DoL as a primary feature of its pre-service teaching program the Bachelor of Learning Management (BLM). DoL was incorporated into the course structure of the program in 2003 to provide pre-service teachers with a practical framework for the delivery of pedagogy that achieves demonstrated learning outcomes in students (Smith, Lynch, & Mienczakowski, 2003). There is evidence that the success of the BLM in producing quality graduates is due, in part, to its adoption of DoL as an organizing framework (Ingvarson, Beavis, Danielson, Ellis, & Elliott, 2005). 4. Section Four outlines the organizational structure of the book and gives an overview of the chapters and their content. It introduces the reader to how DoL has influenced the practice of teaching (Marzano, 1992) ...|$|E

40|$|The context which {{occasions}} {{this study}} is the established multicultural reality of India and the developing multicultural spectrum of Scotland (<b>see</b> <b>Sections</b> 3. 2, 3. 3, 3. 4). The aims, objectives and/ or policies of the two governments (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> 3. <b>5)</b> - and the respective boards of education in the two countries (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> 3. 6) - provide the high idealistic foundations that such institutions stand for. The study uses the discourse analysis method (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> 4. 2 for definition) to evaluate how far the texts used by schools in India and Scotland reflect such high ideals – how far the texts contain multicultural markers (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>5.</b> 4 for definition) and how these markers are exploited through the exercises. The study takes into account even the materials containing multicultural markers that may not {{have anything to do with}} social injustice. It is a case study because, due to lack of time and space, the study takes into account only one representative book each from India and Scotland. The study is an endeavour to incorporate two features influenced by Norman Fairclough’s ideas (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>5.</b> 2 and <b>Section</b> 1. <b>5,</b> respectively) : one, a selective discourse analysis approach; and two, an interdisciplinary approach – interdisciplinary in the sense that it integrates discourse analysis, cultural studies and history. As part of the second approach, this study includes the following: first, critical discourse analysis (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> 4. 3 for definition) of a representative text – one out of the 108 texts from the two books; and second, two chapters – Chapters 2 and 3 – which elucidate on the following ideas and issues: multiculturalism; ethnicity, nation and state; ethnic compositions of the two states; history of multiculturalism in India and Scotland; the policies towards multiculturalism in India and Scotland; and objectives of the two respective boards of education.
