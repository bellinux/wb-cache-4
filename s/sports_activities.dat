5|$|By 1999, Lillehammer Olympiapark had {{an annual}} revenue of NOK20 million, {{of which a}} third came from the fund. Commercial {{activities}} contributed half the revenue, while the remaining fraction came from <b>sports</b> <b>activities.</b> Between 80 and 90 percent of the rental time went to <b>sports</b> <b>activities.</b> A report published by Lillehammer University College in 2007 concluded that all the 260 permanent jobs created in the Lillehammer area {{as a result of}} the Olympics were directly dependent on subsidies from the post-Olympic use funds. In the late 2000s, Lillehammer Olympiapark was using between NOK8 and 12 million per year. There was NOK25 million left in the fund in 2012, which was scheduled to be closed in 2014, after it has served for 20 years. Lillehammer Olympiapark started planning the organization of the venues in 2010. The company recommended that the subsidies be equally funded between Lillehammer Municipality, Oppland County Municipality and the Ministry of Culture. Specifically it recommended that the state take over ownership of the bobsleigh and luge track, while the county took partial ownership of Lillehammer Olympiapark. The state would thus continue to finance the track, which is the only such venue in Northern Europe, while the municipality and county finance the other four venues. The venues are recommended held to such a standard that they can host world cup and world championships in relevant sports.|$|E

40|$|Because {{sustained}} {{physical activity}} {{is important for}} a healthy life, this paper examined whether a greater diversity of <b>sport</b> <b>activities</b> during adolescence predicts higher levels of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) in adulthood. From <b>sport</b> <b>activity</b> participation reported by 17 -year-old twins, we formed five groups: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 + different <b>sport</b> <b>activities.</b> At follow-up in their mid-thirties, twins were divided into four activity classes based on LTPA, including active commuting. Multinomial regression analyses, adjusted for several confounders, were conducted separately for male (N= 1288) and female (N= 1770) participants. Further, conditional logistic regression analysis included 23 twin pairs discordant for both diversity of <b>sport</b> <b>activities</b> in adolescence and LTPA in adulthood. The diversity of leisure-time <b>sport</b> <b>activities</b> in adolescence had a significant positive association with adulthood LTPA among females.
