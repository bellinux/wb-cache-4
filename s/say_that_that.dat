500|$|The British Commonwealth Secretary George Thomson {{expressed}} outrage, accusing Beadle and {{the other}} judges of breaching [...] "the fundamental laws of the land", while Gibbs stated that since his position as Governor existed under the 1961 constitution he could only reject the ruling. An internal UK Foreign Office memorandum rejected Beadle's argument but recognised his belief that [...] "because {{of the effect of}} the effluxion of time, he was entitled to take a different view", and concluded that the Chief Justice's argument was [...] "sufficiently plausible to make it difficult to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> position is manifestly improper or that, in adopting it, Sir Hugh Beadle is manifestly guilty of misconduct." [...] Beadle explained in a 1972 interview: [...] "We had been doing our best to try and uphold the law and when the thing was in the revolutionary stage we dug our toes in, we wouldn't budge. But then as the government became more and more entrenched we had to apply the principle of law, which says that if a revolution succeeds the law changes with it. Yet because we accepted the inevitable we're blamed {{by a lot of people}} for being responsible for the revolution, which is a very different thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Former President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze, {{said that}} {{during his time}} in office, Russian jets {{on a regular basis}} bombed Georgian forces during the wars in the 1990s when Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke from central {{government}} control.

2500|$|In 1997, Scientology {{administrator}} Peggy Crawford said in {{a statement}} to The Commercial Appeal: [...] "We definitely believe in God and we believe in individuals as spiritual beings." [...] Professor Paul Blankenship of the Memphis Theological Seminary studied Scientology and commented on this view, saying [...] "They do not do a lot of talking about God or Jesus. It's more getting your mind cleared, and I could see how they could <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> could be compatible. Scientology has not really developed into a complete religious tradition. They may very well develop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there is}} no {{specific}} law that bans atheism, legal cases in which atheists {{have been charged with}} blasphemy for publicly expressing atheist points of view have raised the issue of whether it is de facto illegal to do so according to Pancasila, the state ideology. Some clerics invoke first Pancasila principle to argue that it is indeed illegal, while legal scholars <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> principle was adopted as a compromise between secular nationalist, Muslim and non-Muslim founding fathers, and not intended to ban atheism. Nonetheless, atheists as a group tend not to express their atheism publicly for fear of prosecution. In 2012, atheist civil servant Alexander Aan was sentenced to thirty months in prison for writing [...] "God doesn't exist" [...] on his Facebook page and sharing explicit material about the Prophet Mohammed online, sparking nationwide debate. Alexander's lawyers speculated that there were only 2,000 or so atheists in Indonesia, but stated that it was difficult to estimate due to the threat of imprisonment for open atheism.|$|E
