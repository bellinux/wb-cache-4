40|$|AbstractCiliates are {{unicellular}} organisms, some {{of which}} perform complicated rearrangements of their DNA. Template-guided recombination (TGR) is a formal model for the DNA recombination which occurs in ciliates. TGR {{has been the subject}} of much research in formal language theory, as it can be viewed as an operation on formal languages. In TGR, a <b>set</b> of <b>templates</b> serves as a parameter to a language operation which controls which rearrangements can take place; thus, a <b>set</b> of <b>templates</b> is itself a language. Recently, the concept of equivalence in TGR has been considered: given two <b>sets</b> of <b>templates,</b> do they define the same language operation? This paper considers the related question of minimality: given a <b>set</b> of <b>templates</b> T, what is the smallest <b>set</b> of <b>templates</b> (with respect to inclusion) equivalent to T? We show that the minimal <b>set</b> of <b>templates</b> is unique, and consider closure properties and decidability questions related to minimality. We define an operational characterization for equivalence which is useful for results on minimality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} theoretical {{properties of}} the template-guided recombination operation. In particular, we consider the decidability of whether two <b>sets</b> of <b>templates</b> are equivalent, that is, whether their action {{is the same for}} all operands. We give a language-theoretic characterization of equivalence which leads to decidability results for common language classes. In particular, we show a positive answer for regular <b>sets</b> of <b>templates.</b> For context-free <b>sets</b> of <b>templates,</b> the answer is negative. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} automatically generating Lexical Transfer Rules (LTRs) from word equivalences using transfer rule templates. Templates are skeletal LTRs, unspecified for words. New LTRs are created by instantiating a template with words, provided that the words belong to the appropriate lexical categories required by the template. We define two methods for creating an inventory of templates and using them to generate new LTRs. A simpler method consists of extracting a finite <b>set</b> of <b>templates</b> from a sample of hand coded LTRs and directly using them in the generation process. A further method consists of abstracting over the initial finite <b>set</b> of <b>templates</b> to define higher level templates, where bilingual equivalences are {{defined in terms of}} correspondences involving phrasal categories. Phrasal templates are then mapped onto <b>sets</b> of lexical <b>templates</b> with the aid of grammars. In this way an infinite <b>set</b> of lexical <b>templates</b> is recursively defined. New LTRs are created by parsing input words, matching a template at the phrasal level and using the corresponding lexical categories to instantiate the lexical template. The definition of an infinite <b>set</b> of <b>templates</b> enables the automatic creation of LTRs for multi-word, non-compositional word equivalences of any cardinality. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractÐThis work {{proposes a}} {{technique}} that improves fingerprint templates by merging and averaging minutiae of multiple fingerprints. The weighted averaging scheme enables the template to change gradually with time in line with changes of the skin and imaging conditions. The recursive nature of the algorithm greatly reduces the storage and computation requirements of this technique. As a result, the proposed template improvement procedure can be performed online during the fingerprint verification process. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

40|$|Data sources {{over the}} Web publish their query {{interfaces}} through forms or templates. Over time, the <b>set</b> of <b>templates</b> {{supported by a}} source changes due to new requirements or enhanced query-processing capabilities.

In this paper, we study the problem of verifying if a given template is redundant with respect to a given <b>set</b> of <b>templates.</b> We develop efficient algorithms to solve the problem. 1 Introduction Web data sources with limited query capabilities abound.
