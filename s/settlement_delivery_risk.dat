On the delivery day, the futures price converges to the spot price of the cheapest-to-deliver grade rather than {{to that of the}} par-delivery grade of the commodity, thereby imposing an additional <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> on hedgers. This paper derives the optimal production and futures hedging strategy for a risk-averse competitive firm facing <b>delivery</b> <b>risk.</b> We show that the option value of the multiple delivery specification induces the firm to produce more with than without the <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> if the firm gauges this value higher than the market. We further show that if the <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> is additively related to the commodity price risk, the firm optimally under-hedges its risk exposure. On the other hand, if the <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> is multiplicatively related to the commodity price risk, the firm may optimally choose an under- or over-hedge which we illustrate using a numerical example. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Different online factors impact online consumers’ behavior differently depending on the environment of different regions. Sweden {{is one of the}} developed and technologically advanced countries. To see the impact of different factors on consumers’ online shopping behavior, {{the purpose of this study}} is to analyse the factors that influence consumers’ online shopping behavior in Sweden’s context. One of the objectives of this research is to fill the gap of previous literature that did not much investigated the external online factors that influence consumers’ online shopping behavior in Sweden’s context. Thus, the focus lays on these five online factors: financial risk, product performance <b>risk,</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>risk,</b> trust and security, and website design. The empirical data was collected through a questionnaire survey and it was distributed among 100 respondents by hand and online. The findings of this research revealed that website design is the most influential and significant factor. While product performance risk, and trust & security have a significant impact to consumers’ online shopping behaviour, the study finds that the remaining factors financial <b>risk,</b> and <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> have no significant impact on consumers’ online shopping behavior...|$|R

Previous work using uterine electromyography (EMG) recordings {{has shown that}} they may provide a promising and objective way for predicting <b>risk</b> of preterm <b>delivery.</b> However, to date attempts at utilizing computational approaches to achieve sufficient predictive confidence, in terms of area under the curve (AUC) values, have not achieved the high discrimination accuracy that a clinical application requires. In our study, we propose a new analytical approach for assessing the <b>risk</b> of preterm <b>delivery</b> using EMG recordings which firstly employs Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to obtain their Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF). Next, the entropy values of both instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the first ten IMF components are computed in order to derive ratios of these two distinct components as features. Discrimination accuracy of this approach compared to those proposed previously was then calculated using six differently representative classifiers. Finally, three different electrode positions were analyzed for their prediction accuracy of preterm delivery {{in order to establish}} which uterine EMG recording location was optimal signal data. Overall, our results show a clear improvement in prediction accuracy of preterm <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> compared with previous approaches, achieving an impressive maximum AUC value of 0. 986 when using signals from an electrode positioned below the navel.

How can supply side risks of HUAWEI supply chain be mitigated? Purpose This paper describes supply side risks in HUAWEI in China, the types of risks identified, provides guidelines for assessment of these risks and suggestions for mitigation. Methodology In order to answer above research questions empirical data have been collected through observations, interviews at with logistics managers of HUAWEI in China, and from the official documents, annual reports and authentic web pages of the HUAWEI.  Theoretical framework has been built through scientific articles, peer reviewed journals, authentic web based documents, and textbooks. The information is then assessed and analyzed, which result in conclusion and recommendations for the company. Conclusion There can be four major risks identified on the supply side. Manufacturing risk, logistics risk, information risk and inventory risk. The manufacturing risk include risks related to production, skill, and quality. The logistics <b>risk</b> further include <b>delivery</b> <b>risk,</b> lead time risk, and transportation risk. Production risk and skill risk are critical {{and they can be}} avoided by enhancing risk awareness, evaluating production feasibility, strengthen staff training, investing in high skills, strengthening R&D, and analysis of the external environment. The quality and inbound <b>delivery</b> <b>risks</b> can be reduced through supplier inspection and establishing good supplier relations. Lead time risk and inventory risk can be reduced by vendor based managed inventory system and mass customization. Meanwhile, transportation risk can adopt risk transfer strategy.
