40|$|New {{computational}} {{procedures are}} proposed {{for evaluating the}} exhaust brake <b>specific</b> <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> of each pollutant species in internal combustion (IC) engines. The procedures start from the chemical reaction of fuel with combustion air and, {{based on the measured}} exhaust raw emissions THC, CH 4, NOx, CO, O 2, CO 2, calculate the volume fractions of the compounds in the exhaust gases, including those that are not usually measured, such as water, nitrogen and hydrogen. The molecular mass of the exhaust gases is then evaluated and the brake specific emissions can be obtained if the exhaust flow rate and the engine power output are measured. The algorithm can also be applied to the evaluation of air/fuel ratio from measured raw volume emissions of IC engines. The new procedures take the effects of various fuel and combustion air compositions into account, with particular reference to different natural gas blends {{as well as to the}} presence of water vapor, CO 2, Ar and He in the combustion air. In the paper, the algorithms are applied to the evaluation of air-fuel ratio and brake <b>specific</b> <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> in an automotive bi-fuel Spark Ignition (SI) engine with multipoint sequential port-fuel injection. The experimental tests were carried out in a wide range of steady-state operating conditions under both gasoline and compressed natural gas operations. The specific emissions calculated from the new procedures are compared to those evaluated by applying Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and International Standards Organization (ISO) recommended practices and the air-fuel ratio results are compared to those obtained either from directly measured air and fuel mass flow rates or from Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen (UEGO) sensor data. The sensitivity of the procedure results to the main engine working parameters, the influence of environmental conditions (in particular the effect of air humidity on NOx formation) and the experimental uncertainties are also determined...|$|E

Starting from the chemical reaction of fuel with air, from gaseous and smoke level measurements in the raw gases, the procedures calculate the volume fractions of oxygen in the combustion air and of compounds in the exhaust gases, including {{those that are not}} usually measured, such as water, nitrogen and hydrogen. The methods also take the effects of various fuel and combustion air compositions into account, {{as well as to the}} presence of water vapor, CO 2, Ar and He in the combustion air. The algorithms are applied to four different automotive engines under wide ranges of steady-state operating conditions: three turbocharged diesel engines featuring high-pressure cooled EGR systems, and an SI naturally aspirated bi-fuel engine running on either gasoline or CNG. The computed air-fuel ratios are compared to those obtained from directly measured air and fuel mass-flow rates as well as from more conventional UEGO sensor data. The mass emissions are worked out in terms of both brake <b>specific</b> <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> and emission indexes of each pollutant species, and the results are compared to those obtained by applying SAE and ISO recommended practices. The computed oxygen mass fraction of the inducted charge was then compared to that derived from direct measurement of O 2 concentration in inlet manifold.

40|$|A {{decentralized}} emission inventories {{are prepared}} for road transport sector of India in order to design and implement suitable technologies and policies for appropriate mitigation measures. Globalization and liberalization policies {{of the government in}} 90 's have increased the number of road vehicles nearly 92. 6 % from 1980 – 1981 to 2003 – 2004. These vehicles mainly consume non-renewable fossil fuels, and are a major contributor of green house gases, particularly CO 2 emission. This paper focuses on the statewise road transport emissions (CO 2, CH 4, CO, NOx, N 2 O, SO 2, PM and HC), using region <b>specific</b> <b>mass</b> <b>emission</b> factors for each type of vehicles. The country level emissions (CO 2, CH 4, CO, NOx, N 2 O, SO 2 and NMVOC) are calculated for railways, shipping and airway, based on fuel types. In India, transport sector emits an estimated 258. 10 Tg of CO 2, of which 94. 5 % was contributed by road transport (2003 – 2004). Among all the states and Union Territories, Maharashtra's contribution is the largest, 28. 85 Tg (11. 8 %) of CO 2, followed by Tamil Nadu 26. 41 Tg (10. 8 %), Gujarat 23. 31 Tg (9. 6 %), Uttar Pradesh 17. 42 Tg (7. 1 %), Rajasthan 15. 17 Tg (6. 22 %) and, Karnataka 15. 09 Tg (6. 19 %).

40|$|Increasing Vehicular {{population}} and deteriorating quality of air is the by-product of {{rapid growth of}} population in India. Undoubtedly on one hand transport sector {{plays a significant role}} in the overall development of a nation's economy, but on the other this sector accounts for a substantial and growing proportion of air pollution also. The urban expansion, industrialization, lack of services, energy and transport demands are leading to a vicious cycle of pollution. According to the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the main sources of emission are energy (26 %), transport (18 %), industry (19 %) and buildings (10 %) are the main sources of emissions. The road traffic accounts for about 80 % of the passenger traffic and 60 % of the goods. For vehicular motors emits various pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, nitric-oxide, carbon dioxide and several organic compounds which are responsible for the deterioration of the environment. In developing countries like India especially, increasing demand for private vehicles is outpacing the supply of transport infrastructure – including both road networks and public transit networks. The result is growing congestion and air pollution. The transport sector in India consumes about 16. 9 % fossil fuel based energy sources.

40|$|A {{leachate}} {{study was}} conducted at a large, operating, regional municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill near Seattle, Washington, to examine differences in composition and emission rates between old and new areas of the fill.

The two areas studied had average ages of 3. 7 and 16 years, and contained 5. 7 x 10 ^ 6 and 2. 04 x 10 ^ 6 tonnes of MSW, respectively. Variations in flow rate, total dissolved solids (TDS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), Fe, and Mn were monitored over a 3 -month period in the winter and spring of 1992. Increases in flow driven by precipitation caused gradually increasing leachate <b>mass</b> <b>emission</b> from the aged fill. The rate of <b>mass</b> <b>emission</b> increase with increasing flow from the new fill was more than three times higher than that from the old fill. Leachate flow through the old fill appeared more channelized, resulting in diluting effects with increasing percolation.

40|$|High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes were {{recently}} proposed for I- 85 in Atlanta {{as a way}} to relieve congestion and provide a reliable commute time for single occupant drivers that are willing to pay a toll. It is important to evaluate the air quality impacts of such a proposal to meet environmental regulations, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Transportation Conformity Regulations. The goal {{of this study is to}} understand how vehicle <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> change as a result of implementing HOT lanes on I- 85 in Atlanta. This is done by considering a number of factors affect <b>mass</b> vehicle <b>emissions,</b> such as vehicle activity, vehicle speeds, vehicle age distributions, and vehicle class distributions. These factors are incorporated into a base scenario, which models the current condition on I- 85 with HOV lanes, and a future scenario, which models the implementation of HOT lanes on this corridor. The base scenario mainly uses data from a data collection effort by Georgia Tech during the summer of 2007 on the I- 85 corridor, while the future scenario makes alterations to these data using information from other cities that have already implemented HOT lanes. The MOBILE-Matrix modeling tool, which was recently developed by Georgia Tech [16], was used to run the emissions analysis using the input factors from these data sources. This tool calculated <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> for five pollutants: HC, NOx, CO, PM 2. 5, and PM 10. The results show very small increases in <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> for NOx, CO, PM 2. 5, and PM 10, and very small decreases in <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> for HC. Therefore, the implementation of HOT lanes on I- 85 in Atlanta is unlikely to violate the Transportation Conformity Rule. For NEPA purposes, this analysis could be used to make the case that air quality impacts are not significant, and therefore further detailed analyses are not required. M. S.
