6000|$|Then Reuben Paine {{cried out}} again before his spirit passed: [...] "Have I {{followed}} the sea {{for thirty years}} {{to die in the}} dark at last? [...] Curse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind-- [...] I have gotten my death where I got my bread, but I dare not face it [...] blind. [...] Curse on the fog! Is there never a wind of all the winds I knew [...] To clear the smother from off my chest, and let me look at the blue?" [...] The good fog heard--like a splitten sail, to left and right she tore, [...] And they saw the sun-dogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore. [...] Silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the <b>steel-backed</b> tide, [...] And pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside. [...] O rainbow-gay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread, [...] And gold, raw gold, the spent shell rolled between the careless dead-- [...] The dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee, [...] And they saw the work their hands had done as God had bade them see! ...|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{flexibly}} mounted to isolate torque reactions. It was {{fitted with a}} statically and dynamically balanced three bearing crankshaft; big ends fitted with <b>steel-backed</b> white-metal liners; three bearing camshaft with <b>steel-backed</b> white-metal liners; air silencer; and automatic advance and vacuum control of the distributor with over-riding hand adjustment for varying grades of fuel.|$|E

According to the company document, [...] "A Liberty engine company had been engaged with rebuilding these for the Army ← It also built various drive shafts, extensions and gear chains for high power engines, on demand. Later its main business was the conversion of older Liberty engines to more powerful models, both for aircraft and marine use.|$|E

50|$|Plywood is the {{conventional}} material used in wood (timber) shear walls, but with {{advances in technology}} and modern building methods, other prefabricated options {{have made it possible}} to inject shear assemblies into narrow walls that fall at either side of an opening. Sheet steel and <b>steel-backed</b> shear panels in the place of structural plywood in shear walls has proved to provide stronger seismic resistance.|$|E
5000|$|In 1889, James Neill {{patented}} composite steel - <b>steel-backed</b> iron. He registered his composite {{steel products}} under the Eclipse trademark in 1909. The name {{was taken from}} the famous racehorse Eclipse, who even though he had died over a hundred years earlier was still famous for his dominating success. The phrase [...] "Eclipse first and the rest nowhere" [...] was still in such common use that Neill adopted it as a marketing slogan for his products.|$|E
50|$|The new model's Superpower {{engine is}} {{enlarged}} 13 per cent achieved by lengthening its stroke by 14 mm. Although the cubic capacity rose from 2810 cc to 3181 cc {{this did not}} affect the car's tax rating because the RAC formula takes no account of an engine's stroke. The only other changes from the engine of the Twenty 70 were the introduction of replaceable hardened steel valve seats and improved <b>steel-backed</b> main bearings for the crankshaft. The instrument panel now has a rheostat switch to vary the lighting at will.|$|E
50|$|First, {{the loose}} chain will reduce {{ignition}} timing accuracy, which usually results in noticeably rough running. Second, it may jump a tooth {{on the drive}} sprocket or break entirely, which almost always results in major damage to an interference engine. Third, the stretched chain can slap {{against the side of}} the timing cover and wear through the metal into the coolant passage behind the water pump, resulting in major damage to both the oil and cooling systems (sometimes mis-diagnosed as a head gasket failure). The damaged aluminum timing cover is difficult to repair effectively and is typically replaced after such an event. Aftermarket timing-chain kits for the 22R and 22RE typically include <b>steel-backed</b> guides that do not readily break even after the initial chain stretching has occurred, permitting the chain to run beyond the 100,000 mile point without further incident.|$|E
40|$|NOVELTY - A {{plain bearing}} shell (1) has a {{running-in}} layer containing a finely dispersed component (7) of concentration continuously decreasing {{from the shell}} apex (8) to the edge (9). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A plain bearing shell (1) has a backing with an electron beam vapor deposited metallic running-in layer containing a finely dispersed component (7) of atomic weight {{greater than that of}} the matrix material, the component concentration continuously decreasing from the apex region (8) to the edge region (9). An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of producing the above plain bearing shell, in which coating of the apex region is carried out at a gas pressure of 0. 1 - 5 Pa. Preferred Features: The finely dispersed component is tin, lead, bismuth and/or antimony. USE - Especially as a <b>steel-backed</b> plain bearing shell with an AlSnCu, AlSnPb or AlSnSi running-in layer. ADVANTAGE - The bearing layer exhibits good emergency and running-in properties combined with a high threshold load until the onset of seizure in its heavily loaded region (i. e. the vertex), only contains a high concentration of the relatively expensive finely dispersed component in this region and is simple to produce with uniform thickness over the entire bearing shell by the electron beam vapor deposition process...|$|E
