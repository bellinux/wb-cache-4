The study revealed severe sewage connections to storm drains; meanwhile, misconnections between surface water and storm drains were found to drive frequent non-stormwater pumping discharges at the outfall, producing a much larger volume of outfall flows in a short period. This paper presented a methodology to estimate quantities of inappropriate sewage flow, groundwater infiltration and river water backflow into the storm drains. It was concluded that inappropriate sewage discharge and groundwater <b>seepage</b> into storm <b>drains</b> were approximately 17, 860 m 3 /d (i. e., up to 51 % of the total sewage flow in the catchment) and 3624 m 3 /d, respectively, and surface water backflow was up to an average 28, 593 m 3 /d. On {{the basis of this}} work, end-of-storm pipe interceptor sewers of 0. 25 m 3 /s (i. e., 21, 600 m 3 /d) would be effective to tackle the problem of sewage connections and groundwater <b>seepage</b> to storm <b>drains.</b> Under this circumstance, the follow-up non-stormwater outfall pumping events indicate misconnections between surface water and storm drains, featuring pumping discharge equivalent to surface water backflow; hence the misconnections should be repaired. The information provided here is helpful in estimating the magnitude of non-stormwater flow entries into storm drains and designing the necessary pollution control activities, as well as combating city floods in storm events...|$|R

In this method, the pipe elements are regarded {{as a kind of}} material with high permeability coefficient and an equivalent hydraulic conductivity is assigned to them. Thus these pipe elements can be included in the conventional seepage calculation as other common elements. Moreover, the difficulty of giving water head boundary to the inner surface of pipes directly is avoided. According to the seepage calculation of the channel with large number of drain pipes in Huangyou part of the middle line in South-to-North water transfer project, the results show that, with drainage-piping, the pore water pressure in channel foundation is reduced significantly. 1...|$|R
30|$|To {{successively}} {{increase the}} tightness of the barrage-surrounding karst rock between 2009 and 2013 three grouting measures {{were carried out}} radial to the barrage and to a drilling depth of 15  m (Breiner et al. 2011). Hereby washout processes {{were meant to be}} prevented by hindering the water from flowing through the surrounding rock. The first measure was the general startup to implement the injection curtain. The second and third measures were of minor extent to locally reduce the occurring seepage water. In addition to the single layer grouting curtain a double layer drainage system was implemented to avoid an increase of the water pressure inside the hanging wall resp. cave roof above the machinery platform.

The slope consist of weathered tuffs with a clay layer {{on the surface of}} the failure. A hydrogeological study was carried out by saturated finite difference grid model, MODFLOW, for the slope at the Shum Wan Road area. From the ground-water model, it was found that the ground-water level reached three meters below the ground surface during failure. The model is sensitive to recharge and specific yield. The presence of the clay layer helped to maintain a high ground-water level. Stability analyses were performed using SLOPE/W. The result of stability analyses showed that the factor of safety, F, decreased due to the rising initial water table. On the 31 st of July, the factor of safety was 1. 41, and dropped down to 1. 01 on the 3 rd of August. The factor of safety again rose back to 1. 31 on the 8 th of August and it finally dropped down to 0. 99 on the morning of the 13 th of August. The present study showed that the antecedent rainfall had some influence on stability of the slope. The amount of water in the form of <b>seepage,</b> which <b>drained</b> out from the seepage surface from the lower part of the slope, is quantified and found to be 790 m 3.

40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects}} of retaining drain water with a weir on reducing acid flux from a drained coastal acid sulphate soil backswamp. Prior to weir construction, groundwater seepage to the ditch drain was the main hydrological pathway for acid flux. High hydraulic conductivity (3 ̆e 120 m per day) in the sulphuric horizons due to extensive macropores, combined with tidal modulation of drain water levels encouraged rapid seepage of acid groundwater. Most seepage occurred while the backswamp groundwater table was in a narrow elevation range, referred to as an ‘acid export window’. The acidity of drainage water was highly sensitive to the hydraulic gradient between the groundwater table and the adjacent drain water level. Acid flux rates from groundwater seepage were strongly positively correlated to effluent groundwater hydraulic gradients. The constructed weir was designed to reduce the magnitude of effluent groundwater gradients and retain shallow groundwater by maintaining high and stable drain water levels. This reduced groundwater <b>seepage</b> to the <b>drain</b> and increased the proportion of shallow groundwater lost from the system via evapotranspiration. The weir affected 60...|$|R

This study examined the effect of relief wells with different diameters at different distances downstream of a homogeneous earth dam using Seep/W software. Also the effect of upstream water level of reservoir on seepage flow to each well was carried out.

The optimum distance between relief wells to decrease uplift pressure was found to be 5 m.

40|$|Axisymmetric {{consolidation}} in a {{sand drain}} foundation {{is a common}} problem in foundation engineering. In unsaturated soils, the excess pore-water and pore-air pressures simultaneously change during the consolidation procedure; and the solutions {{are not easy to}} obtain. The present paper uses the differential quadrature method (DQM) for axisymmetric consolidation of unsaturated soils in a sand drain foundation. The radial <b>seepage</b> of sand <b>drain</b> foundation is considered based on the framework of Fredlund’s one-dimensional consolidation theory in unsaturated soils. With the use of Darcy’s law and Fick’s law, the polar governing equations of excess pore-air and pore-water pressures of axisymmetric consolidation are derived. By using DQM, the two governing equations are transformed into two sets of ordinary differential equations. Then the solutions of excess pore-water and pore-air pressures can be obtained by Rong-Kutta method. The DQM solution can be used to deal with the case of nonuniform initial pore-air and pore-water distributions. Finally, case studies are presented to investigate the behavior of axisymmetric consolidation of unsaturated soils. The convergence analysis and average degree of consolidation, the settlements in radial and vertical direction, and the effects of different initial excess pore pressure distributions are presented, and discussed in this paper...|$|R

In a small 3. 6 km 2 agricultural watershed in central Indiana, we investigated the export of organic matter (OM) via overland flow and tile <b>drain</b> <b>seepage</b> over a 16 -month period.

The fresh and the saline water meet at shallow depth, where a transition zone is found. This study investigates the mixing zone that is characterized by this salinity change, {{as well as by}} cation exchange processes, and which is forced by seepage and by rainfall which varies as a function of time. The processes are first investigated for a one-dimensional (1 D) stream tube perpendicular to the interface concerning salt and major cation composition changes. The complex sequence of changes is explained with basic cation exchange theory. It is also possible to show that the sequence of changes is maintained when a two-dimensional field is considered where the upward saline <b>seepage</b> flows to <b>drains.</b> This illustrates that for cation exchange, the horizontal component (dominant for flow of water) has a small impact on the chemical changes in the vertical direction. The flow’s horizontal orientation, parallel to the interface, leads to changes in concentration that are insignificant compared with those that are found perpendicular to the interface, and are accounted for in the 1 D flow tube. Near the drains, differences with the 1 D considerations are visible, especially in the longer term, exceeding 100 years. The simulations are compared with field data from the Netherlands which reveal similar patterns...|$|R
40|$|Granular {{filters are}} used in {{embankment}} dams to protect the dam core material from internal erosion, while <b>draining</b> <b>seepage</b> water to prevent saturation of the downstream embankment. In this thesis, a mathematical model is developed to describe the timedependent processes of filtration of non-cohesive base soils, modelling the rate of erosion and transport of particles into the filter. As particles are captured within the filter, {{they are able to}} retain progressively finer base soil particles until a self-filtration zone forms that is able to prevent any further erosion. The model predictions are verified with a series of laboratory tests in newly constructed, large scale filtration equipment, the largest of its kind in Australia. Erosion and filtration of a crack through a cohesive dam core is described by analytical modelling. The processes of erosion of the crack walls, transport of particles through the crack, and capture of the particles within the filter are combined to produce a timedependent model describing the sealing of a cracked core as a filter cake forms. The model is able to predict crack erosion for various filters and hydraulic conditions, and has been applied to several case studies to identify practical uses of the Extensive laboratory work examining erosion and filtration of cohesive base soils provides an improved understanding of the filtration process. Particles eroded from the walls of a pinhole were shown to be coarser than the original base soil particles, and these coarser particles influence filtration.

Each lake has its own unique species assemblage due to physical and chemical characteristics of the lake. The nine lakes are: Camp Lake, a 6-acre (2.4 ha) lake ringed by a floating sphagnum bog mat containing such plant species as white beak rush, narrow-leaved sundew, small cranberry, and grass pink orchid. Spence Lake, a 12-acre (4.9 ha), acidic bog lake that is the headwaters of Foster Creek. Conifer swamp surrounds {{the northern part of}} the lake, hardwood swamp surrounds the central part, while the southern part is largely a sedge meadow, impacted by beaver activity. Bass Lake #1, a 6-acre (2.4 ha) soft-water seepage lake, with at least one rare plant species present. Bass Lake #5, an 8-acre (3.2 ha), deep, hard-water seepage lake that is the main headwaters branch of Mud Creek.

40|$|Problem statement: Debris flows {{are very}} to {{extremely}} rapid flows of saturated granular soils. Two main types of debris flow are generally recognized: Open slope debris flows and channelized debris flows. The former is {{the results of}} some form of slope failures, the latter can develop along preexisting stream courses by the mobilization of previously deposited debris blanket. The problem to be addressed is {{the influence of the}} mode of initiation on the subsequent mechanism of propagation. In particular the role of pore water pressure on debris flow mobility in both types was debated. Approach: Laboratory flume experiments were set up in order to analyze the behavior of debris flows generated by model sand slope failures. Failures were induced in sand slopes by raising the water level by <b>seepage</b> from a <b>drain</b> located at the top end of the flume, and by rainfall supplied by a set of pierced plastic pipes placed above the flume. Video recordings of the tests were performed to analyze debris flow characteristics. Results: In all the tests the sand water mixture flows were unsteady and non uniform and sand deposition along the channel bed was a relevant phenomenon. The flows were characterized by a behavioral stratification of the sand water mixture along the flow depth. Back analyzed pore water pressure were just in excess to the hydrostatic condition. The reliability of the experimental results was checked by comparison with other flume experiment data. Conclusion: Debris flow behavior was influenced by the mode of initiation, the inclination of the channel and grain size of the soils. These factors affected the attained velocities and the pore water pressure values. The mobility of debris flows was not always enhanced by high excess pore water pressure values...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigations}} of the tile drain water composition in areas with a clayey soil consisted of taking two or more samples of drain water at 30 farms in the sea-clay regions of the Netherlands from 1992 to 1995. The drain-water composition was {{used to describe the}} significant effects of the weather (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) and the distribution of travel times in the soil on the drain-water composition. The effect of nitrate leaching from arable land (and orchards) provided with tile drains assumed linear relationships with the N load, depending on the texture of the soil (sand, loam, clay) and groundwater depth (Gt). The N leaching was 10 % to 25 % of the load for deep-water levels, after taking into account a possible reduction by the oxidation of sulfide compounds, or the occurrence of <b>seepage</b> water in <b>drain</b> discharge. The leaching of nitrate from grassland is generally less than from arable land. Reduced leaching was also observed after growing grass seedlings on arable land in the year before sampling. The leaching from grassland {{is a function of the}} load (after subtracting uptake by vegetation), of the soil type and of groundwater depth. The leaching of phosphate in clay regions has no direct relationship to surface loading, yet the crops grown differed. Phosphate concentrations in drain water discharged from arable land had relatively constant values of 0. 10 mg. l- 1 (as ortho-P). Leaching from recent grassland was roughly 0. 20 mg. l- 1 (as ortho-P), while leaching from older permanent meadows had a relatively high value of 0. 40 mg. l- 1 (as ortho-P) and greater. The number of cases investigated was too small to make significant conclusions on phosphate leaching from grassland...|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{from our}} {{analysis}} above, {{we see that}} the travel times in a homogeneous and anisotropic soil being drained by a network of equally spaced ditch drains underlain by an impervious stratum and receiving a steady rainfall or irrigation recharge are inversely correlated with the recharge rate and the directional conductivities of the soil. An increase in the depth of an aquifer increases the travel times and same is the observation when the spacing between ditches is made to increase. The nature of the underlying layer of a uniformly recharged ditch drainage system also appear to have a pivotal role in deciding the travel time distributions in the considered subsurface space; the presence of a gravel substratum just above an impervious barrier causes the travel times to reduce drastically in comparison to situations where the underlying layer is being composed of the impervious layer alone. A high vertical conductivity of the layers has a tendency to uncoil the streamlines and push them downward, whereas a high horizontal conductivity of the layers exhibits a tendency to wound and flatten them. Thus, an increase in the vertical conductivity of the layers would result in relatively deeper areas of the soil profile being covered by the flow lines, whereas an increase in the horizontal conductivity of the layers would result in relatively shallower areas being covered by the flow lines. Further, a high anisotropy ratio of a uniformly recharged ditch drainage system causes the travel times to decrease and a low anisotropy ratio of the soil causes the travel times to increase, provided all the other flow parameters of the problem are kept the same. In case of a partially penetrating ditch drainage system receiving water from a ponded field, the streamlines have been observed to be poorly distributed along the flow profile with most of the <b>seepage</b> to the <b>drains</b> being confined to locations close to the drains. Compared to such a flow system, streamlines for a uniformly recharged ditch drainage system have been observed to be more uniformly distributed. However, in both the systems, the travel times of particles originating from locations away from the drains have been seen to be much higher than those originating from locations close to the drains. By subscribing a high value of the width of the ditch drains, the proposed iterative method {{can also be used to}} study travel times of water particles from a flooded field to a stream or river in a watershed. Thus, the method proposed here can also be used for predicting migration time of pollutants to a stream or river from its surroundings through subsurface flow in a watershed. It is also worth noting that the proposed procedure totally eliminates the necessity of evaluation of any integrals while determining the solute travel times in a subsurface system and may thus, in comparison to the existing methods, prove to be relatively simple to apply for working out the solute travel time distributions in many hydro-geo situations.|$|R
40|$|Granular {{filters are}} used in {{embankment}} dams to prevent core materials from internal erosion, while <b>draining</b> <b>seepage</b> water to prevent saturation of the downstream embankment. Current filter design criteria based on particle size ratios are not valid for cohesive soils, which provide significant resistance to erosion due to cohesion. Relying on this, filters are designed for many dams using coarse gravels with pore sizes {{in the range of}} 5 - 10 mm. Performances of dams in field condition are reported satisfactory except when very large sizes gravels are used, leading to insufficient compaction of clay with gravel and the likely problem of reduced particle contact. The problem of 2 ̆ 7 crack 2 ̆ 7 is identified in the impervious core. Generally this type of cracking has not been a consideration at the design stage and thus subsequent failures are detected. To mitigate this, filter gradations are reduced to pore sizes between 0. 3 - 5 mm. The erosion of soils and performance of filters or dam structure in general all depend on the actual field condition existing in the core: intact or cracked. In the case of intact core, soil erosion is insignificant and filter gradations are much wider, however, those perform successfully. Where a crack develops in the core, the seepage pressure is large, erosion is significant (the eroded particles are in the range of 10 microns), and filter gradations are narrow. The proposed analytical models reveal that the critical hydraulic gradient is a key indicator in designing filters for cohesive dam cores. For a particular soil in an intact core, the required critical hydraulic gradient for destabilization of soil particles is significantly high (around 1000) and thus filter gradations are wider. In a cracked core, however, the seepage condition can be quite severe, the critical hydraulic gradient is comparatively small (around 100), and the required filter gradations are thus narrower. The predicted results are verified by experimental modeling and also by comparing them with the results of previously proposed models. Experimental investigations have been carried out using compacted clay with a central pinhole representing a crack. Both the analytical and experimental results show that the effective cohesion (C) in intact core and the critical shear stress (Tc) in cracked core are the key governing factors respectively in evaluating the critical hydraulic gradient. Filter properties, such as pore sizes, also have a significant influence. In addition, the critical hydraulic gradient varies with effective stresses due to the weight of overlying layers. When filter pores are small, there is potential for the filters to become clogged, since porosity and subsequent permeability are too low. Clogging is a specific characteristic of interface of base and filters where filter pores are blocked by eroded base particles. This leads to improper drainage, which is responsible for high pore pressures in the core thus promoting failure of the dam. Another aspect of this thesis is to investigate clogging in granular filters due to the flow of clay slurry generated from crack walls. According to laboratory tests, clogged filters are identified based on the gradual decrease in flowrate and permeability over 5 hours of testing period, without attaining a constant value. The experimental results indicate that the uniformity coefficient, porosity and subsequent permeability of filters are the main factors in evaluating clogging...|$|R
