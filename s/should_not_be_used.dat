5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; midazolam <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for longer than 72 hours due to risks of tachyphylaxis, {{and the possibility of}} development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as neurological complications. Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological complications.|$|E
5|$|The Churches of Christ {{generally}} {{combine the}} lack of any historical evidence that the early church used musical instruments in worship and the belief that there is no scriptural support for using instruments in the church's worship service to decide that instruments <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> today in worship. Churches of Christ have historically practiced a cappella music in worship services.|$|E

5|$|The onion eelworm (Ditylenchus dipsaci), a tiny {{parasitic}} soil-living nematode, causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young {{plants are}} killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for growing onions again {{for several years}} and should also be avoided for growing carrots, parsnips, and beans, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.|$|E
5|$|Unless {{a person}} has medical {{problems}} preventing movement, after a person starts anti-coagulation therapy bed rest <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to treat acute deep vein thrombosis. There are clinical benefits associated with walking and no evidence that walking is harmful, but people with DVT are harmed by bed rest except when it is medically necessary.|$|E

5|$|Given with {{chloroquine}} or quinine, clindamycin {{is effective}} and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, {{and is the}} treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as an antimalarial by itself, although {{it appears to be}} very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy {{is often}} given {{together}} with chemotherapy, {{and may be}} used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{had issued}} {{commemorative}} coins between 1892 and 1954, {{as a means}} for fundraising for organizations deemed worthy of federal support. A sponsoring organization would be designated in the authorizing legislation, and was permitted to buy up the issue at face value, selling it to the public at a premium, and pocketing the difference. Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.|$|E
50|$|In {{seizures}} {{related to}} toxins, {{up to two}} doses of benzodiazepines should <b>be</b> <b>used.</b> If this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> effective pyridoxine <b>is</b> recommended. Phenytoin <b>should</b> generally <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term {{brightness}} is {{also sometimes}} <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for this concept. The SI system {{states that the}} word brightness <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> so <b>used,</b> but <b>should</b> instead refer only to psychophysics.|$|R

5|$|The {{procedure}} <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{without a}} medical indication, such {{as with a}} reason to expect {{that a person is}} at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis. This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other indications that the patient may have this condition. A common example of overuse of this procedure is the practice of performing ultrasonography routinely on patients without indication after knee or hip replacement.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. No cure {{for the common}} cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b> Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|Workers who {{experience}} acute {{low back pain}} {{as a result of}} a work injury may be asked by their employers to have x-rays. As in other cases, testing is not indicated unless red flags are present. An employer's concern about legal liability is not a medical indication and <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to justify medical testing when it is not indicated. There should be no legal reason for encouraging people to have tests which a health care provider determines are not indicated.|$|E

5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E

The draught camel can plough at around , and <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for more than six hours a day four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon.

5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|Later botanists, such as Philip Miller in 1754, divided cacti {{into several}} genera, which, in 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu placed in his newly created family Cactaceae. By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus's name Cactus {{had become so}} {{confused}} as to its meaning (was it the genus or the family?) that it <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical congress rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria was the type genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, conserve the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual {{situation in which the}} family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.|$|E
5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts {{with water to}} produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, {{but this is not}} an important risk because it is not very soluble in water.|$|E
