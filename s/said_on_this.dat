500|$|The {{series was}} renewed {{for a fourth}} season on March 3, 2016, earlier than usual for the series. Executive {{producer}} Jed Whedon <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>this,</b> [...] "We're thrilled to know going into the end of [...] with certainty {{that we will be}} returning, because we can build our story accordingly." [...] Executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen also noted that logistics for hiring directors for the season in advance would be easier, [...] "which is a very nice privilege to have...that's a luxury." [...] The end of the episode [...] "What If..." [...] features an onscreen tribute to Bill Paxton, who died in February 2017 and had portrayed John Garrett in the series' first season. The series paid additional tribute to Paxton in [...] "All the Madame's Men" [...] with promos during The Bakshi Report news segment showcasing John Garrett as a fallen American hero. The end of [...] "World's End" [...] features a similar onscreen tribute to Powers Boothe, who died in May 2017 and had portrayed Gideon Malick in the series' third season.|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>this,</b> [...] "if someone told you that concept, you'd {{think it was a}} great thing to have happen {{at the beginning of the}} show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|When President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva {{took office}} in January 2003, he chose Gil as Brazil's new Minister of Culture, only the second black person {{to serve in the}} country's cabinet. The {{appointment}} was controversial among political and artistic figures and the Brazilian press; a remark Gil made about difficulties with his salary received particular criticism. Gil is not a member of Lula's Workers' Party and did not participate in creating its cultural program. Shortly after becoming Minister, Gil began a partnership between Brazil and Creative Commons. As Minister, he has sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gives grants to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities. Gil has since asserted that [...] "You've now got young people who are becoming designers, who are making it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods. It's a different vision of the role of government, a new role." [...] Gil has also expressed interest in a program that will establish an Internet repository of freely downloadable Brazilian music. Since Gil's appointment, the department's expenditures have increased by over 50percent. In November 2007 Gil announced his intention to resign from his post due to a vocal cord polyp. Lula rejected Gil's first two attempts to resign, but accepted another request in July 2008. Lula <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion that Gil was [...] "going back to being a great artist, going back to giving priority to what is most important" [...] to him.|$|E

However, when Peggy Carter makes guest appearances on the series through flashbacks, McCreary quotes Christopher Lennertz's Agent Carter theme. McCreary <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>this,</b> [...] "I was excited {{for the opportunity to}} incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [...] Universe together as a coherent whole ...

Furthermore, he said that it was necessary for him to return to participate in the MDC's struggle, despite describing it as [...] "a stupid decision" [...] for him to do so. Biti also <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion that talks on a national unity government had collapsed because the MDC insisted on having Tsvangirai as President and excluding Mugabe from the arrangement, while ZANU-PF insisted on Mugabe remaining President. He also expressed disappointment with regional efforts to resolve the situation and doubted that the UN would be able to resolve it, saying that Zimbabweans were [...] "on their own – and the sooner we realise it, the better".|$|E
2500|$|The Labour Party {{strongly}} opposed the rearmament programme. Clement Attlee said on 21 December 1933: [...] "For our part, we are unalterably opposed to {{anything in the}} nature of rearmament". On 8 March 1934 Attlee said, after Baldwin defended the Air Estimates, [...] "we on our side are out for total disarmament". On 30 July 1934 Labour moved a motion of censure against the government because of its planned expansion of the RAF. Attlee spoke for it: [...] "We deny the need for increased air arms...and we reject altogether the claim of parity". Sir Stafford Cripps also <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion that it was fallacy that Britain could achieve security through increasing air armaments. On 22 May 1935, the day after Hitler had made a speech claiming that German rearmament offered no threat to peace, Attlee asserted that Hitler's speech gave [...] "a chance to call a halt in the armaments race". Attlee also denounced the Defence White Paper of 1937: [...] "I do not believe the Government are going to get any safety through these armaments".|$|E
2500|$|Overwatchs {{diversity}} also {{extends to}} other character facets. Blizzard {{has said that}} some of the characters have LGBT identities; Metzen said that the inclusion of LGBT characters was not [...] "to be a data point or feel contrived in any way", but instead to have these identities [...] "play out organically". Tracer was the first identified as one of the LGBT characters via one of the promotional online comics. Blizzard <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> reveal [...] "as with any aspect of our characters' backgrounds, their sexuality is just one part of what makes our heroes who they are. From the very beginning of our work on Tracer's story, it just felt right to make this an aspect of her character." [...] Blizzard reiterated their goal to have a diverse cast with Tracer's reveal, stating, [...] "from the beginning, we've wanted the universe of Overwatch to feel welcoming and inclusive, and to reflect the diversity of our players around the world." [...] Similarly, the character of Symmetra is considered autistic by the development team, with Kaplan saying, [...] "we think she does a great job of representing just how awesome someone with autism can be".|$|E

2500|$|Complying with Curtin's directive, albeit reluctantly, Blamey {{arrived in}} Port Moresby on 23 September 1942 {{with only a}} small {{personal}} staff. [...] It was a situation which Blamey felt was quite reasonable but with which Rowell saw significant difficulties. [...] Rowell's objections were that the circumstances of Blamey's presence in his headquarters would ultimately undermine the good conduct of its operation by forcing it to serve two masters. [...] McCarthy's reporting of the initial situation suggests that Blamey, while maintaining his position, was conciliatory and empathetic toward Rowell's concerns. Allen recounts that Rowell's objection was not to Blamey using his headquarters {{as much as the}} expectation that he (Rowell) was expected to be Blamey's chief-of-staff. Horner observes that this was much how the headquarters subsequently operated under Herring. [...] Underpinning the events that followed was bad blood between them stemming from Blamey's conduct in the Middle East and Greece. Perhaps, more importantly, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in Blamey's lack of support by way of resolve to oppose the decision to send Blamey to New Guinea. [...] In at letter to [...] Major General Cyril Clowes at Milne Bay, Rowell <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>this,</b> [...] "Either I am fit to command the show or I am not." ...|$|E
2500|$|The homilies {{contained}} in Midrash Tanḥuma A {{begin with the}} words [...] "As the Scriptures say" [...] or sometimes [...] "As it is written." [...] Then follow a verse (in most cases taken from the Hagiographa), its explanation, and a homily on the particular passage of the Pentateuch referred to. Several of the homilies on the first, third, and fourth books of the Pentateuch begin with brief halakic dissertations bearing on the passages to which the homilies refer. The halakic treatises consist of a question introduced with the words [...] "Yelammedenu rabbenu" [...] (May our teacher instruct us), and of a reply beginning with the phrase [...] "Kak shanu rabbotenu" [...] (Thus have our teachers instructed us); the replies are always taken from either a mishnah or a baraita. Many of the homilies close with words of hope and encouragement regarding {{the future of the}} Jews; but several of them are abbreviated and not entirely completed, this curtailment being apologized for in the words [...] "Much more might be <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> subject, but we shall not tire you" [...] (Noaḥ. xxvi. 27b), or [...] "This passage has been elucidated by several other interpretations and expositions, but in order not to tire you we quote only that which is necessary for to-day's theme" [...] (Ḥuḳḳat xvi. 57a).|$|E
2500|$|You {{note that}} I and President Joseph Fielding Smith {{and some of}} our early church leaders have said and written about this {{doctrine}} and you asked if the doctrine of blood atonement is an official doctrine of the Church today. If by blood atonement is meant the atoning sacrifice of Christ, the answer is Yes. If by blood atonement is meant the shedding of the blood of men to atone in some way for their own sins, the answer is No. We do not believe that it is necessary for men in this day to shed their own blood to receive a remission of sins. This is said with a full awareness of what I and others have written and <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> subject in times past. In order to understand what Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Charles W. Penrose and others have said, we must mention that there are some sins for which the blood of Christ alone does not cleanse a person. [...] These include blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (as defined by the Church) and that murder which is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice. [...] However, and this cannot be stressed too strongly, this law has not been given to the Church at any time in this dispensation. [...] It has no application whatever to anyone now living whether he is a member or a non-member of the Church.|$|E
