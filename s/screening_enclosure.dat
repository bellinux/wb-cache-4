The enclosure and absorber are modeled using TLM modeling techniques and the performance is determined by comparison with theoretical normalized site attenuation of free space.

40|$|We {{present results}} of finite element {{analysis}} for simple test structures which demonstrate clearly that the measurement situation is complex. The test structure consists of an open geometry parallel plate capacitor within a <b>screened</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Indeed, the presence of earthed objects, even at considerable distances, is shown {{to have a significant}} effect on the field geometry close to the source. These simulations are compared with field measurements made using an ultra-high input impedance sensor, the Electric Potential Sensor. A single experimentally determined calibration factor is all that is required to achieve excellent agreement between experimental measurements and the results of the simulations. Given this, the sensor is capable of mapping accurately, and in a non-perturbative manner, the spatial potential both within and outside of the test structure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor many organisms, {{choosing}} an appropriate nest {{site is a}} critical component of reproductive fitness. Here we examine nest site selection in the solitary, resource defense polygynous bee, Anthidium manicatum. Using a wood-framed <b>screen</b> <b>enclosure</b> outfitted with food sources, nesting materials, and bamboo trap nests, we show that female bees prefer to initiate nests in sites located high above the ground. We also show that nest sites located at higher levels are less likely to contain spiderwebs, suggesting an adaptive explanation for nest site height preferences. We report size differences between this study's source populations in Boston, Massachusetts and Brooklyn, New York; male bees collected in Boston have smaller mean head widths than males collected in Brooklyn. Finally, we argue that methods for studying captive populations of A. manicatum hold great promise for research into sexual selection, alternative phenotypes, recognition systems, and the evolution of nesting behavior...|$|R
40|$|Germplasm {{collections}} of {{vegetatively propagated crops}} are usually maintained as plants in fields or potted in greenhouses or <b>screened</b> <b>enclosures.</b> Safety duplication of these collections, as duplicate plants or separate collections, is costly and requires large amounts of space. Cryopreservation techniques which were recently developed for long-term storage of pear germplasm may offer an efficient alternative to conventional germplasm collection maintenance. Pear (Pyrw L.) germplasm may now be stored as seeds (species), dormant buds or pollen from field-grown trees, or shoot tips from in vitro-grown plants (cultivars). Pear germplasm may now be cryopreserved and stored for long periods (> 100 yr) utilizing slow-freezing or vitrification of in vitro-grown shoot-tips. Dormant bud freezing, pollen, and seed cryopreservation of other lines are being developed to complete the base collection for Pyru. s. This cryopreserved collection provides base (long-term) storage for the field-grown pear germplasm collection at the National Clonal Germplasm Repository, Corvallis, Oregon. Key words: cryopreservation; genebank; liquid nitrogen storage; Pyrw; slow freezing; vitrification. INTRODUCTION crops are grown as fielg collections at a second site, maintained in greenhouses, or held as in vitro collections. Cryopreservation is the newest addition to the germplasm storage system. It is a goal of many national germplasm systems to store base {{collections of}} clonal material in liquid nitrogen (LN).

40|$|While {{experiments}} are vital for understanding how ecological systems operate, different philosophies exist concerning how experiments {{should be conducted}} (e. g., Petranka 1989, Dunham and Beaupre 1998, Resetarits and Fauth 1998, Skelly and Kiesecker 2001; also see the special features in Herpetologica [1989; 45 : 111 – 128] and Ecology [1996; 77 : 663 – 705, see Dahler and Strong 1996]). Recently, Skelly (2002) asked how experimental venue (i. e., cattle tanks set up as mesocosms in a field setting vs. <b>screened</b> <b>enclosures</b> placed into natural ponds) influences competitive interactions between two species of larval anurans (Pseudacris crucifer and Rana sylvatica) and how results from the two venues match a standard of realism. He observed that density affected competitive interactions among larval anurans in mesocosms but not in enclosures and concluded that enclosures were more realistic because the observed size of tadpoles measured in the field was more similar {{to the size of}} tadpoles predicted by the enclosure experiment than by the mesocosm experiment. Although an empirical examination of venue is valid, we believe that this study has serious flaws and claims differences between venues that erroneously devalue the use of mesocosms. Our goal is to reinterpret the results from Skelly (2002) in light of its design, point out methodological/statistical issues associated with his study, and argue that both venues can make meaningful contributions to the field of ecology if they are designed correctly with regard to the questions being asked and the specific population of interest...|$|R
50|$|The tornado moved {{northeast}} at 50 mi/h km/h {{across the}} Everglades, entering northwest Dade County and then southwest Broward County. Subsequently, the tornado struck {{the communities of}} Sunrise, Lauderhill, North Lauderdale, Margate, Pompano Beach, and Lighthouse Point. It first hit several homes and a recreation center in Sunrise, causing extensive damage. As it moved through Sunrise, the tornado downed power poles, wires, <b>screen</b> <b>enclosures,</b> trees, and mailboxes. Doors at the Sunrise city hall were blown open, allowing debris inside that covered {{the first floor of}} the building. Damage was widespread throughout the city, particularly along and near Oakland Park Boulevard. At least three funnel clouds were reported in Sunrise, and at least one tornado touchdown was alleged. Windows were broken in hundreds of homes, while trees and power lines were prostrated. The mayor of the town of Sunrise, John Lomelo, declared a state of emergency in the town at 8:15 a.m., upon hearing of damage to city hall and across the city. Next, the tornado blew a porch from a home in Lauderhill. In North Lauderdale, the tornado damaged 30 to 40 homes in a four-block area, blowing awnings loose and uprooting trees. In Margate, the tornado affected the 600 and 700 blocks along SW 51st Avenue. A home was unroofed, another home lost most of its roof, and trees and power lines were downed. The tornado tore a bedroom door from its hinges, broke glass, and snapped a 40 ft tall Norfolk Island pine tree in half.|$|R
5000|$|The graves in Mehrauli in the precincts of Zafar Mahal, built {{within a}} marble <b>screen</b> <b>enclosure</b> by Jahandar Shah {{for his father}} Bahadur Shah I and others who followed, is a minor {{reflection}} {{of the history of}} the place. Shah Alam II who had the misfortune of being blinded by Ghulam Qadir, the Rohilla leader was buried here. He was considered a [...] "puppet ruler", first under the Marathas and later under the British. His son Akbar Shah II was also buried here. Mirza Fakruddin son of the last emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, who died early ushered the end of the Moghul regime, was also buried here. But Bahadur Shah Zafar who had identified the location for his grave (sardgha - the vacant land for burial) was the most unfortunate (ill fated) as he was deported to Rangoon and was buried there. The exiled emperor died in November 1862. He was buried with great urgency in the night itself with “lantern light” in presence of his few family members under the direction of a British officer. The grave was initially unmarked but later a Tablet was erected at the location but only in the 20th century. His mazar (grave) has at last become a shrine and the local Burmese and also visitors from India and Pakistan consider him a Pir (saint). It is also said that the nationalist leader of India, founder of the Indian National Army, Subhas Chandra Bose took a formal oath at this grave to free India from foreign rule.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} investigating possible {{effects of}} exposure to the ambient radio frequency (RF) background on aspen seedlings was conducted in rural Colorado at an altitude of 1, 700 meters, on a north-facing slope in the Little Thompson River Valley. The location was 0. 5 km distant from any RF source, including electrical power lines. In the spring 2007, three treatment enclosures were established: RF shielded (Faraday-caged), mock-shielded, and unshielded. Nine aspen seedlings in gallon pots were placed in each treatment enclosure. All factors: light level, humidity, airflow and temperature were monitored and maintained at equal levels between the shielded and mock-shielded environments. The un-caged seedlings were exposed to higher light level (full sun), had higher airflow, and generally lower humidity, since they were not in a <b>screened</b> <b>enclosure.</b> After two months, the RF-shielded group had produced 74 % more active lead length and 60 % more leaf area than the mock-shielded group, though both groups produced nearly the same number of leaves. Differences in growth and morphology between the mock-shielded and unshielded groups were slight. In early October 2007, the shielded group’s leaves turned a range of bright fall colors, and those leaves were substantially free of leaf fungus. At the same time, in the two exposed groups, leaves were green-yellow and a high percentage of leaf area was affected by leaf fungus. These results suggest that the manmade RF environment may be adversely affecting growth, dormancy, and resistance to fungus in aspen seedlings. Inhibition of growth in aspen caused by exposure to the RF background would limit their ability to take up CO 2 and sequester carbon. This RF interaction with plants may, therefore, be indirectly contributing to the ongoing increase in atmospheric CO 2...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the plane itself is {{significant}} as it implies that immanence cannot simply be conceived as the within, but also as the upon, {{as well as the}} of. A lobster is not simply within a larger system, but folds from that very same system, functioning and operating consistently upon it, with it and through it, immanently mapping its environment, discovering its own dynamic powers and kinetic relations, as well as the relative limits of those powers and relations. Thus, without a theoretical reliance on transcendent principles, categories or real divisions producing relative breaks or <b>screens</b> of atomistic <b>enclosure,</b> the {{concept of the}} plane of immanence may replace nicely any benefits of a philosophical transcendentalism: [...] "Absolute immanence is in itself: it is not in something, to something; it does not depend on an object or belong to a subject. ... When the subject or the object falling outside the plane of immanence is taken as a universal subject or as any object to which immanence is attributed, ... immanence is distorted, for it then finds itself enclosed in the transcendent." ...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{quadrupole}} resonance (NQR) {{a highly}} promising new technique for bulk explosives detection: relatively inexpensive, more compact than NMR, but with considerable selectivity. Since the NQR frequency is insensitive to long-range variations in composition, mixing explosives with other materials, {{such as the}} plasticizers in plastic explosives, makes no difference. The NQR signal strength varies linearly {{with the amount of}} explosive, and is independent of its distribution within the volume monitored. NQR spots explosive types in configurations missed by the X-ray imaging method. But if NQR is so good, why it is not used everywhere? Its main limitation is the low signal-to-noise ratio, particularly with the radio-frequency interference that exists in a field environment, NQR polarization being much weaker than that from an external magnetic field. The distinctive signatures are there, but are difficult to extract from the noise. In addition, the high selectivity is partly a disadvantage, as it is hard to build a multichannel system necessary to cover a wide range of target substances. Moreover, substances fully <b>screened</b> by metallic <b>enclosures,</b> etc. are difficult to detect. A workshop was held at St Petersburg in July 2008 in an attempt to solve these problems and make NQR the universal technique for the detection of bombs regardless of type. This book presents the essentials of the papers given there...|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} potential sensor is a novel, ultra high impedance sensor, previously {{developed at the}} University of Sussex. These sensors have been applied {{to a range of}} applications, including electrophysiology, non destructive testing of composite materials and novel nuclear magnetic resonance NMR probes. Some of these measurements can be made in a strongly coupled (≥ 100 pF) mode, where the coupling capacitance is reasonably large and well dened, and ambient noise is therefore less problematic. However for many applications, there exists a requirement for this coupling to be much weaker. This weak and poorly dened coupling creates substantial problems with ambient noise often causing sensors to saturate and become unusable. In the past, therefore, these measurements have all been made inside electrically <b>screened</b> rooms and <b>enclosures.</b> The work discussed in this thesis explores the possibility of operating these sensors outside of electrically screened environments. A number of techniques for resilience against noise are explored and experiments to fully analyse and characterise the performance of the sensors are discussed. As a result of this work, further results are then shown for a number of experiments carried out in a busy lab environment, in the presence of noise sources, and with little or minimal screening used. In this case, data is shown for the collection of remote cardiac and respiratory data, imaging of the spatial distribution of charge on insulating materials, detecting electric eld disturbances for movement sensing and early results for a microscopic XY scanning application...|$|R

Rekonstrukcijom građevine godine 1990. obnovljen je prostorni ambijent pa se pristupilo i restauraciji zdenca na izvornu mjestu. Tom su prilikom provedena istraživanja dijelova starokršćanske piscine i svih elemenata romaničkoga zdenca. Autor opisuje njihov izvorni oblik s osvrtom na funkciju dijelova te visoku zanatsku kulturu i tehnička rješenja u postavljanju i međusobnu povezivanju elemenata romaničkoga zdenca. The author {{publishes the}} {{architectural}} sketches {{of the early}} Christian baptistery in Zadar {{on the basis of}} research and the remains. and the original sketches of the baptistery dating from 1916. Furthermore, he considered the early Christian and Romanesque font. The latest research has determined that the basin has two long and two short extensions. The steps were probably in the long one, which was destroyed with the construction of the foundations of the Romanesque font. According to typological characteristics, the early Christian extension may be said to date from the 5 th century, which is when the baptistery was done. The structure of the Romanesque font was placed on the above mentioned foundations reaching {{to the bottom of the}} early Christian baptistery, its height reaching beyond the floor level by the height of the round stylobate. The font consists of two octagonal rings. While the inner one functions as holy water stone basin, the outer one is its decorative <b>screen,</b> made as <b>enclosure.</b> Between these two rings there used to be a four-leaf "shell", that is, a small font basin made for individual baptisms. The font was damaged in World War Il, and the elements of the outer ring were put togather only in 1974 for the Permanent exibition of church art in Zadar. Elements of the inner ring were deposited as archaeological material, while the damaged font foundation, its stylobate and the baptistery floor, remained in situ. The entire font was reconstructed in 1991. A scheme, according to which it was possible to restore the entire baptistery was carved in the foundation. Iron spikes and cooper hooks, stopped by molten lead, were important parts of the structure. Another important technical solution in putting up the structure were concealed joints made of waterproof mortar, which was also used to make the bottom of the stone basin. In the restored interior of the nave stands the Romanesque font, erected in a splendid symbiosis of architectural form and liturgical act, which was established as early as in the 5 th century, when the baptistery with the crossshaped basin, buried in the floor, was built, and then in the 12 th century, when, at the site of the early Christian basin, a new one, in the shape of an octagonal wreath raised on the stylobate of circular steps, was constructed...|$|R
