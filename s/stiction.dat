25|$|In 1995 and 1998 Maclay et al. {{published}} the first models of a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) with Casimir forces. While not exploiting the Casimir force for useful work, the papers drew {{attention from the}} MEMS community due to the revelation that Casimir effect needs to {{be considered as a}} vital factor in the future design of MEMS. In particular, Casimir effect might be the critical factor in the <b>stiction</b> failure of MEMS.|$|E
25|$|Many PID loops {{control a}} {{mechanical}} device (for example, a valve). Mechanical maintenance {{can be a}} major cost and wear leads to control degradation {{in the form of}} either <b>stiction</b> or a deadband in the mechanical response to an input signal. The rate of mechanical wear is mainly a function of how often a device is activated to make a change. Where wear is a significant concern, the PID loop may have an output deadband to reduce the frequency of activation of the output (valve). This is accomplished by modifying the controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband before the actual output will change.|$|E
25|$|The unfurling of the arrays {{started at}} 15:06 UTC, {{beginning}} with the channel 1B array. Commanding the unit from the station, Philips paused at the halfway point, and allowed the array {{to rest in the}} sun for approximately 45 minutes, and then completed the extension. After successfully extending the 1B array, the astronauts started the 3B array extension at 16:35 UTC. The 3B array was expected to be more difficult to extend, as it had been packed in the blanket box for eight years. As with the first, a pause at halfway was performed to allow the arrays to heat up in the sun. While some <b>stiction</b> was seen, once the final extension began all the slats flattened out, and the arrays were fully deployed at 17:17 UTC. The addition of the final set of solar panels brings the station's power output to 120 kilowatts, and doubles the scientific power to 30 kilowatts. The station's surface area of the arrays is just under one acre, or 38,400 square feet.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{objects are}} in resting contact, that is, in collision, but neither {{bouncing}} off, nor interpenetrating, {{such as a}} vase resting on a table. In all cases, resting contact requires special treatment: If two objects collide (a posteriori) or slide (a priori) and [...] their relative motion is below a threshold, friction becomes <b>stiction</b> and both objects are arranged in the same branch of the scene graph.|$|E

50|$|In {{the context}} of hard disk drives, <b>stiction</b> refers to the {{tendency}} of read/write heads {{to stick to the}} platters. <b>Stiction</b> is a result of smoothness and is exacerbated by humidity and other liquids condensing at the head-disk interface. Once the heads have stuck to the platters, the disk can be prevented from spinning up and can cause physical damage to the media and the slider. Other forces considered as responsible for <b>stiction</b> include electrostatic forces.|$|E
50|$|Contact {{interface}} degradation poses a reliability {{issue for}} ohmic cantilever RF MEMS switches, whereas dielectric charging beam <b>stiction,</b> {{as shown in}} Fig. 5(a), and humidity induced beam <b>stiction,</b> as shown in Fig. 5(b), pose a reliability issue for capacitive fixed-fixed beam RF MEMS switches. <b>Stiction</b> is {{the inability of the}} beam to release after removal of the drive voltage. A high contact pressure assures a low-ohmic contact or alleviates dielectric charging induced beam <b>stiction.</b> Commercially available ohmic cantilever RF MEMS switches and capacitive fixed-fixed beam RF MEMS switches have demonstrated lifetimes in excess of 100 billion cycles at 100 mW of RF input power. Reliability issues pertaining to high-power operation are discussed in the limiter section.|$|E
5000|$|Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) {{are used}} {{in a number of}} {{different}} applications and have become increasingly more prevalent in nanoscale applications. However, due to their small size they run into problems with <b>stiction,</b> caused by capillary condensation among other forces. Intense research in the area of Microelectromechanical systems has been focused on finding ways to reduce <b>stiction</b> in the fabrication of Microelectromechanical systems and when they are being used. Srinivasan et al. did a study in 1998 looking at applying different types of Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to the surfaces of Microelectromechanical systems in hopes of reducing <b>stiction</b> or getting rid of it altogether. [...] They found that using OTS (octadecyltrichlorosilane) coatings reduced both types of <b>stiction.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Around 1995 IBM pioneered a {{technology}} where a landing zone on the disk {{is made by}} a precision laser process (Laser Zone Texture = LZT) producing an array of smooth nanometer-scale [...] "bumps" [...] in a landing zone, thus vastly improving <b>stiction</b> and wear performance. This technology is still largely in use today, predominantly in desktop and enterprise (3.5-inch) drives. In general, CSS technology can be prone to increased <b>stiction</b> (the tendency for the heads {{to stick to the}} platter surface), e.g. as a consequence of increased humidity. Excessive <b>stiction</b> can cause physical damage to the platter and slider or spindle motor.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stiction</b> is a {{commonly}} used term when diagnosing diesel fuel powered engines. The Ford Powerstroke 6.0-L and 7.3-L engines {{are the most}} prevalent to experience cold start or injector <b>stiction</b> issues. The 7.3-L was produced between 1994 and 2003, while the 6.0-L was produced between 2003 and 2007. Both engines were manufactured by Navistar International and incorporated the HEUI injector system. These injectors use the engine oil to lubricate themselves and over time the sticky friction build up causes the injector to malfunction and fail. Alternatively to replacing injectors with new units, products are available that rid the injector, turbos and transmission of <b>stiction</b> and prevent build up. Leading engineers in the field have found in their research that 9 out of 10 failing injectors in diesel trucks are cases of <b>stiction,</b> and once removed are still in optimal working condition. [...] <b>Stiction</b> is also the same threshold at which a rolling object would begin to slide over a surface rather than rolling at the expected rate (and {{in the case of}} a wheel, in the expected direction). In this case, it's called [...] "rolling friction" [...] or μr.|$|E
50|$|Many {{components}} will lock {{together with}} <b>stiction</b> {{even though they}} have sufficient theoretical clearance.|$|E
50|$|In {{situations}} where two surfaces with areas below the micrometer range come into close proximity (as in an accelerometer), they may adhere together. At this scale, electrostatic and/or Van der Waals and hydrogen bonding forces become significant. The phenomenon of two such surfaces being adhered {{together in this}} manner is also called <b>stiction.</b> <b>Stiction</b> {{may be related to}} hydrogen bonding or residual contamination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stiction</b> {{refers to}} the {{characteristic}} of stop and start type motion as a force overcomes static friction and causes a part to accelerate under dynamic friction, but the force cannot {{keep up with the}} speed of the moving part so the part tends to stop again until the force catches up, and it happens repeatedly. <b>Stiction</b> is a problem for the design and materials science of many moving linkages. This is particularly the case for linear sliding joints, rather than rotating pivots. Owing to simple geometry, the moving distance of a sliding joint in two comparable linkages is longer than the circumferential travel of a pivoting bearing, thus the forces involved (for equivalent work) are lower and <b>stiction</b> forces become proportionally more significant. This issue has often led to linkages being redesigned from sliding to purely pivoted structures, just to avoid problems with <b>stiction.</b> An example is the Chapman strut, a suspension linkage developed by Colin Chapman of Lotus cars.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stiction</b> or {{adhesion}} {{between the}} substrate (usually silicon based) and the microstructure occurs during the isotropic wet etching of the sacrificial layer. The capillary forces {{due to the}} surface tension of the liquid between the microstructure and substrate during drying of the wet etchant cause the two surfaces to adhere together. Separating the two surfaces is often complicated due to the fragile nature of the microstructure. <b>Stiction</b> is often circumvented {{by the use of}} a sublimating fluid (often supercritical CO2, which has extremely low surface tension) drying process where the liquid phase is bypassed. CO2 displaces the rinsing fluid and is heated past the supercritical point. As the chamber pressure is slowly released the CO2 sublimates thereby preventing <b>stiction.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Stiction</b> causing {{moving parts}} to stick; an {{external}} impulse sometimes restores functionality. Non-stick coatings, reduction of contact area, and increased awareness mitigate {{the problem in}} contemporary systems.|$|E

50|$|Ducati updated {{the bike}} with Öhlins front forks, which {{featured}} a titanium nitride coating on the stanchions to minimise <b>stiction.</b> An aluminum rear subframe and other detail modifications reduced the bike's weight even further.|$|E
5000|$|Torque is {{required}} to rotate the tool, the amount of which {{will depend on the}} down force and friction coefficient (sliding friction) and/or the flow strength of the material in the surrounding region (<b>stiction).</b>|$|E
50|$|Any solid objects {{pressing}} {{against each other}} (but not sliding) will require some threshold of force parallel {{to the surface of}} contact in order to overcome static cohesion. <b>Stiction</b> is a threshold, not a continuous force.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stiction</b> {{happens with}} the human body in {{situations}} where two surfaces press together to the point any lubrication is excluded, such as in ball joints for hip replacements or in post-operative patients using smooth plastic dilators.|$|E
50|$|The screw turns 360° in one {{revolution}} and with well made screws (minimal <b>stiction)</b> and a user with a sensitive touch, 1° movements can be achieved. Thus, with the ultra fine adjusters sub-micrometre motions are attainable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stiction</b> is {{the static}} {{friction}} {{that needs to}} be overcome to enable relative motion of stationary objects in contact. The term is a portmanteau of the term [...] "static friction", perhaps also influenced by the verb [...] "stick".|$|E
50|$|Chapman did use MacPherson struts for {{the front}} {{suspension}} of the Lotus 17. These were unsuccessful, owing to the <b>stiction</b> problems that Chapman had worked to avoid with the sliding drive shaft joint. A wishbone conversion kit was later developed by ex-Lotus engineer Len Terry.|$|E
5000|$|Guide-post surface finish. Too rough, abraded {{the back}} of the tape. Too smooth, tape adheres to the guide through <b>stiction,</b> which causes speed flutter on the tape. The right surface {{treatment}} was found to be lapidary tumbler, a recipe of abrasive and burnishing compound.|$|E
5000|$|The {{focus on}} negative-stiffness {{isolators}} {{has been on}} developing systems with very low resonant frequencies (below 1 Hz), so that low frequencies can be adequately isolated, which is critical for sensitive instrumentation. All higher frequencies are also isolated. Negative-stiffness systems {{can be made with}} low <b>stiction,</b> so that they are effective in isolating low-amplitude vibrations.|$|E
50|$|Updates in 2000 saw {{the wheels}} change and get updated to all new Marchesini wheels. The front forks were also {{titanium}} nitrided to reduce <b>stiction.</b> The spokes also {{changed from the}} three-spoke rim style of the 916 to a new five-spoke scheme. In 2001 another overhaul saw the 996 rear shock absorber change from a Showa to an Öhlins.|$|E
5000|$|Stiction: after a {{time the}} head may not [...] "take off" [...] when started up as it tends {{to stick to the}} platter, a {{phenomenon}} known as <b>stiction.</b> This is usually due to unsuitable lubrication properties of the platter surface, a design or manufacturing defect rather than wear. This occasionally happened with some designs until the early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stiction</b> {{may also}} {{manifest}} itself on computer tapes (9 track tape etc.). The magnetic {{surface of the}} tape would be heated against the read head in the tape deck, and when the tape stopped moving would cool slightly and [...] "glue" [...] onto the read head. This could be avoided by configuring the software so that the tape could be read continuously.|$|E
50|$|Another problem {{sometimes}} {{found in}} old Eagles with hard disks is <b>stiction.</b> Hard disk read/write heads from that era {{rested on the}} platter when turned off, and may adhere to {{where they have been}} sitting with greater force than the drive motor can exert on starting. An experienced technician may be able to coax the head free without destroying the hard disk or losing data.|$|E
50|$|The Blish Lock is a breech locking {{mechanism}} designed by John Bell Blish based upon his observation that under extreme pressures, certain dissimilar metals will resist movement {{with a force}} greater than normal friction laws would predict. In modern engineering terminology, it is an extreme manifestation {{of what is now}} called static friction, or <b>stiction.</b> His {{locking mechanism}} was used first in the Thompson submachine gun.|$|E
50|$|Unlike contact-roller bearings, an {{air bearing}} (or air caster) {{utilizes}} {{a thin film}} of pressurized air to provide an exceedingly low friction load-bearing interface between surfaces. The two surfaces don't touch. Being non-contact, air bearings avoid the traditional bearing-related problems of friction, wear, particulates, and lubricant handling, and offer distinct advantages in precision positioning, such as lacking backlash and <b>stiction,</b> {{as well as in}} high-speed applications.|$|E
