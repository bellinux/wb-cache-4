40|$|Observations on the {{formation}} of the Antarctic ozone hole in the upper atmosphere are summarized, and the mechanism responsible for the ozone depletion in the spring is examined. It is shown that the sequence of events begins with the absorption of H 2 O, N 2 O 5, HCl, and ClONO 2 on the cloud ice particles in the winter and chemical reactions among absorbed chemicals which release (HNO 3) s, Cl 2, HOCl, and ClNO 2. With the return of sunlight in the spring, the clouds evaporate, and the Cl 2, HOCl, and ClONO 2 molecules are destroyed by sunlight to form Cl atoms. These attack ozone, producing a reduction of ozone that accounts for the bulk of the ozone decrease observed by the ground-based ozone monitors. Data on the ozone concentration for the period between 1957 through 1987 indicate that the <b>southern</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> has been intensifying since 1975 as the amount of man-made chlorine increases...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this award was to build a scalable and extensible Earth System Model {{that can be used}} to study climate change science. That objective has been achieved with the public release of the Community Earth System Model, version 1 (CESM 1). In particular, the development of the CESM 1 atmospheric chemistry component was substantially funded by this award, as was the development of the significantly improved coupler component. The CESM 1 allows new climate change science in areas such as future air quality in very large cities, the effects of recovery of the <b>southern</b> hemisphere <b>ozone</b> <b>hole,</b> and effects of runoff from ice melt in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Results from a whole series of future climate projections using the CESM 1 are also freely available via the web from the CMIP 5 archive at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Many research papers using these results have now been published, and will form part of the 5 th Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is to be published late in 2013...|$|R

It is also a strong indicator of the underlying quality of the stratospheric dynamics of a climate model. We investigate the simulation of the zonal asymmetry in ozone in the NIWA-UKCA atmosphere–ocean chemistry–climate model using elliptical diagnostics, a methodology used {{for the first time in}} this subject area. During spring, the region most depleted in ozone is displaced from the pole toward South America based on ERA-Interim and the model output. The model correctly simulates the direction of this displacement but significantly underestimates its magnitude. The model shows that as ozone becomes increasingly depleted over the late 20 th century this asymmetry in the ozone distribution moves west, before moving east as polar ozone recovers over the course of the 21 st century. Comparison with model runs in which ozone-depleting substances are held fixed at pre-ozone-hole levels shows that this shift is primarily a function of the magnitude of ozone depletion, although increases in greenhouse gases also have some effect...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} 11 sets {{of ozone}} analyses from 7 different data assimilation systems. Two are {{numerical weather prediction}} (NWP) systems based on general circulation models (GCMs); the other five use chemistry transport models (CTMs). These systems contain either linearised or detailed ozone chemistry, or no chemistry at all. In most analyses, MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) ozone data are assimilated. Two examples assimilate SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography) observations. The analyses are compared to independent ozone observations covering the troposphere, stratosphere and lower mesosphere during the period July to November 2003. Through most of the stratosphere (50 hPa to 1 hPa), biases are usually within ± 10 % and standard deviations less than 10 % compared to ozonesondes and HALOE (Halogen Occultation Experiment). Biases and standard deviations are larger in the upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere, in the troposphere, the mesosphere, and the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> region. In these regions, some analyses do substantially better than others, and this is mostly {{due to differences in}} the models. At the tropical tropopause, many analyses show positive biases and excessive structure in the ozone fields, likely due to known deficiencies in assimilated tropical wind fields and a degradation in MIPAS data at these levels. In the <b>southern</b> hemisphere <b>ozone</b> <b>hole,</b> only the analyses which correctly model heterogeneous ozone depletion are able to reproduce the near-complete ozone destruction over the pole. In the upper-stratosphere and mesosphere (above 5 hPa), some ozone photochemistry schemes caused large but easily remedied biases. The diurnal cycle of ozone in the mesosphere is not captured, except by the one system that includes a detailed treatment of mesospheric chemistry. In general, similarly good results are obtained no matter what the assimilation method (Kalman filter, three or four dimensional variational methods, direct inversion), or system (CTM or NWP system) and this in part reflects the generally good quality of the MIPAS ozone observations. Analyses based on SCIAMACHY total column are almost as good as the MIPAS analyses; analyses based on SCIAMACHY limb profiles are worse in some areas, due to problems in the SCIAMACHY retrievals. Using the analyses as a transfer standard, and treating MIPAS observations as point retrievals, it is seen that MIPAS is ~ 5 % higher than HALOE in the mid and upper stratosphere and mesosphere (above 30 hPa), and of order 10 % higher than ozonesonde and HALOE in the lower stratosphere (100 hPa to 30 hPa) ...|$|R

During the last decade, thermal infra-red (TIR) sensors have demonstrated their enhanced capability in capturing both the spatial and temporal variability of the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> during the polar night, in contrast to instruments measuring in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) range of the spectrum which need sunlight to operate.

Comparisons between IASI and ozone sonde measurements were also found to be in good agreement with the percentage difference between both ozone profile measurements being less than ± 30 % over the altitude range of 0 – 40 km.

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims to {{summarise}} the current performance of ozone data assimilation (DA) systems, to show {{where they can}} be improved, and to quantify their errors. It examines 11 sets of ozone analyses from 7 different DA systems. Two are numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems based on general circulation models (GCMs); the other five use chemistry transport models (CTMs). The systems examined contain either linearised or detailed ozone chemistry, or no chemistry at all. In most analyses, MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) ozone data are assimilated; two assimilate SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography) observations instead. Analyses are compared to independent ozone observations covering the troposphere, stratosphere and lower mesosphere during the period July to November 2003. Biases and standard deviations are largest, and show the largest divergence between systems, in the troposphere, in the upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere, in the upper-stratosphere and mesosphere, and the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> region. However, in any particular area, apart from the troposphere, at least one system can be found that agrees well with independent data. In general, none of the differences can be linked to the assimilation technique (Kalman filter, three or four dimensional variational methods, direct inversion) or the system (CTM or NWP system). Where results diverge, a main explanation is the way ozone is modelled. It is important to correctly model transport at the tropical tropopause, to avoid positive biases and excessive structure in the ozone field. In the <b>southern</b> hemisphere <b>ozone</b> <b>hole,</b> only the analyses which correctly model heterogeneous ozone depletion are able to reproduce the near-complete ozone destruction over the pole. In the upper-stratosphere and mesosphere (above 5 hPa), some ozone photochemistry schemes caused large but easily remedied biases. The diurnal cycle of ozone in the mesosphere is not captured, except by the one system that includes a detailed treatment of mesospheric chemistry. These results indicate that when good observations are available for assimilation, the first priority for improving ozone DA systems is to improve the models. The analyses benefit strongly from the good quality of the MIPAS ozone observations. Using the analyses as a transfer standard, it is seen that MIPAS is ~ 5 % higher than HALOE (Halogen Occultation Experiment) in the mid and upper stratosphere and mesosphere (above 30 hPa), and of order 10 % higher than ozonesonde and HALOE in the lower stratosphere (100 hPa to 30 hPa).
