5|$|Bell led Stokes {{in a poll}} {{conducted}} early in the race, 33% to 17%, before O'Malley declared his candidacy. By late August, Bell <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> the polls to third place, with O'Malley and Stokes tied. Bell and O'Malley began airing television commercials supporting their campaigns in early August, while Stokes did not begin to air commercials until September. O'Malley also advertised on the radio.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test of {{the series}} at Nottingham, Davidson removed Cowdrey before his ankle <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> a {{footmark}} during the first innings and a bone was chipped. He was carried off with figures of 1/22 and his ankle plastered. The injury was such that {{he was unable to}} bat even with the assistance of a runner and was absent. This injury sidelined him until August.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc {{had many}} {{problems}} with diabetes {{toward the end}} of his life. While visiting his son in Atlanta, Georgia, LeDuc <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> the shower. As a result of the injuries, he developed an infection that ultimately led to his death. He died of a lung infection on May 1, 1999 in Atlanta. After his death, the revelation that he and Paul LeDuc were not related caused a minor scandal on talk shows in Quebec.|$|E

5|$|The only goal of {{the game}} {{followed}} shortly thereafter. Curtis went on a run for Cardiff, who passed it forward near the box to Ferguson. He shot the ball towards the goal, but it had little power and was easily picked up by Lewis. However, as he did so, the ball squirmed out of Lewis' hands and <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> between {{the crook of his}} left elbow and body. With a couple of Cardiff City forwards closing in, Lewis tried to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it into the net with his elbow. Arsenal sought to attack immediately after the kick off, but despite it looking promising, Brain was caught offside. Cardiff countered, and possibly could have had a second goal, but Curtis chose to shoot himself rather than pass to Davies, who would have been presented with an open goal had he received the ball as Lewis was out of position. The match ended with a victory for Cardiff City by one goal to nil. The King presented the trophy to Cardiff's captain Keenor, and medals to each of the players from both teams.|$|E

25|$|Even so, Velázquez's {{power within}} the PRI <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s as his own health declined. While in the past every President of Mexico {{consulted}} Velázquez before picking his successor, Velázquez was not consulted {{in the selection of}} Luis Donaldo Colosio as the PRI's presidential candidate in 1994. Even after Colosio's assassination Velázquez was only told that Ernesto Zedillo was the new Presidential candidate a few minutes before the formal announcement.|$|E

25|$|Peat {{is common}} {{on the islands}} and has {{traditionally}} been exploited as a fuel. Uncontrolled exploitation of this natural resource led to peat <b>slips</b> <b>in</b> 1878 and 1886.

30|$|Thus, the 2010 {{event was}} similar to the {{previous}} long-term Bungo Channel slow <b>slips</b> <b>in</b> terms of both extent and magnitude.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the share of women graduates in computer science dropped by between 2 and 13 percentage points over this period for all countries reporting data.|$|E
25|$|In a new development, on 19 June 2014, Mubarak <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> the {{bathroom}} {{at the military}} hospital in Cairo where he is being held and broke his left leg, also fracturing his left thighbone, requiring surgery. Mubarak is serving a three-year sentence for corruption and is also awaiting retrial regarding the killing of protesters during his regime. At one time, his release was ordered. However, Mubarak has remained at the military hospital since January 2014 due to his ongoing health issues.|$|E
25|$|A {{statue in}} his honour, created by {{sculptor}} Bruce Wolfe, was erected in Pittsburgh on March 7, 2012, outside of Consol Energy Center. The statue is modelled after a {{play in a}} 1988 game against the New York Islanders where Lemieux <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> between Islanders defencemen Rich Pilon and Jeff Norton to score a goal in a 5–3 Penguins victory. Both Pilon and Norton (the latter of which would later play for the Penguins during Lemieux's comeback season), {{as well as the}} Islanders, are unbranded on their portion of the statue.|$|E

25|$|Deliveries to {{operational}} units began in August 1917. Jasta 10 {{was the first}} recipient of the new aircraft, followed by Jasta 4. While markedly better than the earlier Roland designs, the D.III was generally considered inferior to the Albatros D.III and D.V. German pilots variously criticized the Pfalz’s heavy controls, low speed, lack of power, or low rate of climb compared to the Albatros. The D.III <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> turns, leading to crashes when unwary pilots turned at very low altitudes. Moreover, the Pfalz stalled sharply and spun readily. Recovery from the resulting flat spin was difficult, though some pilots took advantage of this trait to descend quickly or evade enemy aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Smallville's season seven, {{along with}} many other American {{television}} shows, was {{caught in the middle of}} a contract dispute between the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE), Writers Guild of America, west (WGAw) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The dispute led to a strike by the writers, which has caused this season to end prematurely with only twenty episodes being produced, instead of the standard twenty-two episodes. The strike also forced The CW to push back airdates on several episodes, and cost Allison Mack her directorial debut. Smallvilles Season seven <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> the ratings, averaging 3.7 million viewers weekly, and the series ranked as the 175th most-watched television series, out of 220, for the 2007–08 television year.|$|E
25|$|On lap four, {{the engine}} in Jody Scheckter's Tyrrell blew, {{and the oil}} dumping onto the circuit caused Alan Jones and Mark Donohue to crash. Three laps later, Hunt also <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> the oil and crashed. The top three had become Andretti, Watson, and Stommelen. Watson's car {{suffered}} from vibrations and dropped out. Andretti's rear suspension lasted only seven more laps before it failed, causing him to crash out of the lead. Jean-Pierre Jarier and Brambilla stopped to change tyres, whilst Tom Pryce and Tony Brise tangled. Stommelen was now in the top spot, followed by Pace, Ronnie Peterson, Jochen Mass, and Ickx. On lap 24, Peterson was out after he tangled with François Migault while trying to lap the Frenchman.|$|E

25|$|Lilly Ledbetter was a {{supervisor}} at Goodyear Tire and Rubber's plant in Gadsden, Alabama, from 1979 until her retirement in 1998. For {{most of those}} years, she worked as an area manager, a position largely occupied by men. Initially, Ledbetter's salary was {{in line with the}} salaries of men performing substantially similar work. Over time, however, her pay <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority. By the end of 1997, Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts was stark: Ledbetter was paid $3,727 per month; the lowest paid male area manager received $4,286 per month, the highest paid, $5,236.|$|E
25|$|On {{repairing}} to his diocese {{he found}} his palace and cathedral in ruins, and was immediately involved in numerous lawsuits in his endeavours to recover the alienated lands of the see, {{in which he was}} generally unsuccessful. In 1664 he published The Persecution and Oppression of John Bale, Bishop of Ossory, and of Griffith Williams, that was called to the same Bishopric (London, 4to), an animated autobiography, to which he appended a description of the distressed condition of the clergy of his diocese. Some statements in the appendix drew down the censure of the upper house of convocation at Dublin, and he was reduced to plead that they had inadvertently <b>slipped</b> <b>in.</b> He spent considerable sums in restoring his cathedral and repairing the damage wrought by the rebels.|$|E
25|$|Darius Just had {{previously}} helped novice writer Giles Devore produce a breakthrough novel. Just credits himself with ruthlessly editing Devore's original drafts and forcing the young author to turn an incoherent mess into a masterwork. Having gained {{fame and fortune}} with his first book, a bestseller, Devore attends the ABA convention to promote his second book, which he wrote without Just's help. Just volunteers to run an errand for Devore – collecting a parcel for him and taking it to his hotel room – but he forgets to do so until the next day. Entering Devore's hotel room, Just discovers Devore dead in the bathroom, apparently having <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> the shower and hit {{his head on the}} faucets. Others take this to be a tragic accident and nothing more, but Just suspects murder, based on Devore's compulsive tidiness and the disarray in which Just found the room. He interviews Devore's ex-wife, who tells him that the parcel contained Devore's monogrammed pens.|$|E
