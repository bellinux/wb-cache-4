40|$|Abstract Spectral {{inherent}} {{optical properties}} (IOPs) have been measured at Crater Lake, OR, an extremely clear <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>lake.</b> Indeed Pure water IOPs are major {{contributors to the}} total IOPs, and thus {{to the color of}} the lake. Variations in the spatial distribution of IOPs were observed in June and September 2001, and reflect biogeo-chemical processes in the lake. Absorption by colored dissolved organic material increases with depth and between June and September in the upper 300 m. This pattern is consistent with a net release of dissolved organic materials from pri-mary and secondary production through the summer and its photo-oxidation near the surface. Waters fed by a tributary near the lake’s rim exhibited low levels of absorption by dissolved organic materials. Scattering is mostly dominated by organic particulate material, though inorganic material is found to enter the lake from the rim following a rain storm. Several similarities to oceanic oligotrophic regions are observed: (a) The Beam attenuation correlates well with par-ticulate organic material (POM) and the rela-tionship is similar to that observed in the open ocean. (b) The specific absorption of colored dissolved organic material has a value similar to that of open ocean humic material. (c) The dis-tribution of chlorophyll with depth does not fol-low the distribution of particulate organic material due to photo-acclimation resulting in a subsurface pigment maximum located about 50 m below the POM maximum...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, human diphyllobothriosis has {{staged a}} {{comeback}} in Swiss, French and Italian sub-alpine regions. The main putative infective {{source of the}} causative agent (the tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum) in these areas is perch (Perca fluviatilis). Therefore, the occurrence of D. latum in this fish species was investigated between 2005 and 2008 in the <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>lakes</b> Maggiore, Lugano and Geneva. Prevalence in fish of Lake Maggiore was 14 % (n = 880). In Lake Geneva, 5. 1 % fillets (n = 532) were infected, whereas perch from Lake Lugano were free from the parasite. These results are discussed in relation to previous studies. Data on fish size and weight indicate that infection of perch by D. latum is independent of age and sex. Abiotic factors considered critical for D. latum life cycle (water temperature and oxygen concentration) characterize the three basins and were related to their infestation frequencies. The presence of this parasite was most likely favoured by warmer, well oxygenated waters. Previous studies indicate that the lake’s trophic state (i. e. content of total phosphorus) influenced {{the availability of the}} first intermediate hosts (copepods) of some pseudophyllideans. In our study, no correlation was observed between the amount of phosphorus and the number of copepods in populations of zooplankton. Nevertheless, the trophic states of the three lakes seemed to affect the degree of infection in fish. In conclusion, at least in <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>lakes,</b> abiotic factors such as water temperature, oxygenation and trophic state seem to have an influence on maintaining or preventing perch infection with D. latum...|$|R

The pollen data suggest that Picea schrenkiana F. and M. was the dominant tree in this region {{from the beginning of}} the record. The pollen record of pronounced die-backs of the forests, along with lithostratigraphical evidence, points to possible climatic cooling (and/or drying) around 3, 800 cal year B. P., and between 3, 350 and 2, 520 cal year B. P., with a culmination at 2, 800 - 2, 600 cal B. P., although stable climatic conditions are reported for this region for the past 3, 000 - 4, 000 years in previous studies. From 2, 500 to 190 cal year B. P. high pollen values of P. schrenkiana suggest rather closed and dense forests under the environmental conditions of that time. A marked decline in spruce forests occurred with the onset of modern human activities in the region from 190 cal year B. P. These results show that the present forests are anthropogenically reduced and represent only about half of their potential natural extent. As P. schrenkiana is a species endemic to the western Tien Shan, it is most likely that its refugium was confined to this region. However, our palaeoecological record is too recent to address this hypothesis thoroughly...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a single lake on {{downstream}} water chemistry may be compounded {{by the presence of}} additional lakes within the watershed, augmenting or negating the effects of the first lake. Multiple, linked lakes are a common feature of many watersheds and these resemble reactors in series often studied in engineering. The effects of multiple lakes in series on nutrient transport are largely unexplored. We populated and calibrated a simple lake model to investigate the role of a <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>lake</b> (Bull Trout Lake (BTL), Rocky Mountains, USA) on the transport of the macronutrients during the summer of 2008. Further, we developed a sequential model in which four identical lakes (copies of the BTL model) were connected in series. All lakes in the sequence retarded the flux of nutrients, thus slowing their transport downstream. The first lake in the sequence dramatically altered stream water chemistry and served as a sink for C and P and a source of N, while additional lakes downstream became sources of C, N and P. Although additional downstream lakes resulted in important changes to water chemistry and nutrient transport, the nature of the changes were similar from Lakes 2 to 4 and the magnitude of the changes diminished with distance downstream. Our lake model served as an effective tool for assessing the nutrient budget of the lake and the hypothetical effect of multiple lakes in sequence in a landscape limnology framework...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} first {{preliminary}} {{results of the}} DYRESM-CAEDYM model application to a mid size <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>lake</b> (Lake Pusiano North Italy). The in-lake modelling {{is a part of}} a more general project called Pusiano Integrated Lake/Catchment project (PILE) whose final goal is to understand the hydrological and trophic relationship between lake and catchment, supporting the restoration plan of the lake through field data analysis and numerical models. DYRESM is a 1 D- 3 D hydrodynamics model for predicting the vertical profile of temperature, salinity and density. CAEDYM is multi-component ecological model, used here as a phytoplankton-zooplankton processes based model, which includes algorithms to simulate the nutrient cycles within the water column as well as the air-water gas exchanges and the water-sediments fluxes. The first results of the hydrodynamics simulations underline the capability of the model to accurately simulate the surface temperature seasonal trend and the thermal gradient whereas, during summer stratification, the model underestimates the bottom temperature of around 2 °C. The ecological model describes the epilimnetic reactive phosphorus (PO 4) depletion (due to the phytoplankton uptake) and the increase in PO 4 concentrations in the deepest layers of the lake (due to the mineralization processes and the sediments release). In terms of phytoplankton dynamics the model accounts for the Planktothrix rubescens dominance during the whole season, whereas it seems to underestimate the peak in primary production related to both the simulated algal groups (P. rubescens {{and the rest of the}} other species aggregated in a single class). The future aims of the project are to complete the model parameterization and to connect the in-lake and the catchment modelling in order to gain an integrated view of the lake-catchment ecosystem as well as to develop a three dimensional model of the lake...|$|E
40|$|Like many <b>lakes</b> worldwide, French <b>sub-Alpine</b> <b>lakes</b> (lakes Annecy, Bourget and Geneva) have {{suffered}} from eutrophication in the mid- 20 th century. Although restoration measures have been undertaken and resulted in significant reductions in nutrient inputs and concentrations over the last 30 years in all three lakes, the limnological monitoring does not extend back far enough to establish the reference conditions, {{as defined by the}} European Water Framework Directive. The over-arching aim of this work was to reconstruct, using a palaeolimnological approach, the pre-eutrophication levels and subsequent temporal changes in the lakes trophic status over the last century. The objectives were three-fold: i) to test whether fossil diatoms archived in deep sediment cores adequately reflect past changes in the planktonic diatom communities for these deep <b>sub-Alpine</b> <b>lakes</b> based on data from lake Geneva; ii) to investigate changes in the diatom communities over the last 150 years in the three lakes; and iii) to infer the past total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of the lakes from a diatom based transfer function. Annual palaeolimnological and limnological diatom countings for lake Geneva were strongly correlated over the last 30 years. Most notable differences essentially resulted from both taphonomic and depositional biases, as evidenced by the underestimation of thin skeleton species such as Asterionella formosa and Diatoma tenuis in the palaeolimnological dataset and the presence of many benthic taxa. The fossil diatom records revealed shifts in the communities in the three lakes over time, most of which were changes typically associated with nutrient enrichment. Indeed, in all three lakes, the proportion of Cyclotella spp. was very high before the 1950 s, but these species were then replaced by more eutrophic taxa, such as Stephanodiscus spp, by the mid- 20 th century. From the 1980 s, some but not all diatom species typical of re-oligotrophicated conditions (i. e. Cyclotella sp.) re-appeared in all three lakes. Yet, not all changes that occurred in the diatom communities since then may be attributed to decreasing TP. Total phosphorus concentrations inferred from weighted averaging with classical deshrinking in lake Annecy and lake Geneva and weighted averaging with inverse deshrinking in lake Bourget were very close to the monitored values. Comparisons of diatom-inferred TP concentrations to other palaeo-proxies for trophic status revealed though that the transfer functions were rather insensitive to changes occurring below 10 mu g L- 1, which limits the study ability to set accurate TP reference conditions below this threshold. However, current diatom community compositions arestill rather different from the pre-eutrophication ones, suggesting that reference conditions are still not achieved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWater {{temperature}} and the alternation of stratification and mixing count amongst key drivers of lake ecology. Reliable long time-series of water temperature are rare. Here, we investigated how a numerical model can fill {{the gaps in}} heterogeneous time-series and {{make it possible to}} identify a significant trend in the lake thermal regime. We computed the mean water {{temperature and}} the Schmidt stability, an indicator of the stratification strength, in a deep and well-stratified lake (Lake Bourget, France), between 1976 and 2008. We first used temperature measurements and then a one-dimensional vertical model, which we describe here. The model performs as well as the best existing models. During the 1976 - 2008 periods, whereas no statistically significant trend came out of the measurements, we found in the simulation results an increase of 0. 12 °C per decade in the water temperature and of 5. 9 days per decade in the stratification duration. This shows that the temperature history of a lake can be reconstructed and a reliable long-term trend computed when weather data and a calibrated temperature model are available. Our results also suggest that different local climatic influences cause a slower warming in this lake of the south-western Alps than in other <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>lakes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Short {{sediment}} cores {{from two}} small interconnected <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>lakes</b> (Vorder-er and Hinterer Schwendisee) in northeastern Switzerland contain a continuous record of environmental changes, which {{occurred during the}} last 600 years. Several light-colored layers within predominantly organic carbon-rich sedi-ments display elevated density values and a high amount of detrital material. This composition points towards an allochthonous origin, which we interpret as material brought into the lake by unusually strong rainfall events. Based on this interpretation, four event horizons were identified in the sedimentary record. These horizons were dated combining a 137 Cs and 210 Pb-based chronol-ogy with meteorological and historical data. They occurred mostly within the 19 th and {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century, whereas only one event occurred prior to 1800. The well-documented strong rainfall event that occurred on June 14, 1910 is observed in the sedimentary record as the thickest detrital horizon. These short-lived climatic events archived in the sediments of both lakes are superimposed on a longer-term environmental trend characterized by fluctuat-ing conditions in organic productivity. The formation and preservation of au-thigenic minerals, such as siderite and vivianite, are most likely related to in-tervals of different primary productivity in the water column.

60|$|What {{is going}} on in Maggiore {{is going on}} equally in all the other <b>sub-Alpine</b> <b>lakes</b> of the Po valley. They are being {{gradually}} filled in, every one of them, by the aggressive mud sheet. The upper end of Lugano, for example, has already been cut off, as the Lago del Piano, from the main body; and the piano itself, from which the little isolated tarn takes its name, is the alluvial mud fiat of a lateral torrent--the mud flat, in fact, which the railway from Porlezza traverses for twenty minutes before it begins its steep and picturesque climb by successive zigzags over the mountains to Menaggio. Similarly the influx of the Adda at the upper end of Como has cut off the Lago di Mezzola from the main lake, and has formed the alluvial level that stretches so drearily all around Colico. Slowly the mud fiend encroaches everywhere on the lakes; and if you look for him when you go, there you can see him actually at work every spring under your very eyes, piling up fresh banks and deltas with alarming industry, and preparing (in a few hundred thousand years) to ruin the tourist trade of Cadenabbia and Bellagio.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{temperature}} {{of land and}} water bodies is an ecologically important parameter and can be measured using remote sensing using data acquired in the thermal infrared region. The most commonly used method for deriving water temperature (for both inland and ocean water bodies) is the split window technique. It considers the spectral bands at 10. 2 – 11. 5 µm (tb 1) and 11. 5 – 12. 5 µm (tb 2). The increasing number of sensors which provide these spectral bands at moderate spatial resolution (~ 1 km) at a temporal coverage of 1 - 3 days globally, attracts many researchers to rely on these data sets in alternative to often scarce field data. The open data policy adopted by different space agencies helped to maximize the usage of remotely sensing data in climate and ecological research. In this study, we compare the usability and sensitivity of three most commonly used sensors – MODIS, AVHRR and AATSR on-board polar orbiting instruments in deriving Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) of big <b>sub-Alpine</b> <b>lakes</b> of Northern Italy. The processing of the thermal bands (tb 1 and tb 2) differs across these three sensors due to different carrier instruments, multiple level- 1 B data source formats adopted by the respective agencies, differences in radiometric calibration coefficients, errors originating from instrument decaying, accuracy in geolocation sampling, acquisition times and the various external factors like cloud coverage and the atmospheric profiles {{at the time of}} acquisition. This demands different sensor based approaches in processing these datasets. We developed sensor specific workflows using open source geo-spatial tools to read and calibrate level- 1 B data, apply geo-correction and used Planck's function to derive Brightness Temperature (BT) from the radiances. LSWT was then derived using the Lake/sensor specific coefficients provided by Hulley et. al (2011) using the split window algorithm. For this study, we are using day images (11 a. m. – 14 p. m.) from these sensors for five overlapping years (2003 – 2008). Specifically, we used MODIS data on-board the Terra satellite and AATSR sensor on-board ENVISAT. For AVHRR, we used data from NOAA 16 / 18 instruments which have afternoon overpasses. We compared the derived LSWT from these sensors against the field data available for these lakes. We found that MODIS and AVHRR offer higher accuracy in derived lake temperature with observed RMSE between 1. 0 to 1. 5 K with less variability in case of zenith angles less than 45 º. While AATSR derived temperatures are comparable, they show an average RMSE up to 2 K. The increased RMSE with AATSR may occur due to the slightly off acquisition time compared to that of respective field data. Another factors could be undetected sub-pixel size clouds and further outliers due to mixed pixels along shorelines. We continue to develop further techniques to successfully remove outliers from the satellite observations {{in order to reduce the}} RMSE to an acceptable range below 1 K. This study is significant in developing unified long term temporal datasets of LSWT by combining multiple sensor data, and analyzing long term trends in warming of <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>lakes</b> due to climate change...|$|R

40|$|Macroinvertebrates {{are one of}} the key {{components}} of lake ecosystems and are required to be monitored alongside other biological groups to define ecological status according to European Union legislation. Macroinvertebrate communities are highly variable and complex and respond to a diverse series of environmental conditions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relative importance of environmental variables in explaining macroinvertebrate abundance. A total of 45 <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>lakes</b> were sampled for macroinvertebrates in the shallow sublittoral. Environmental variables were grouped into four types: (1) aquatic physical and chemical parameters, (2) littoral and riparian habitat, (3) lake morphometric parameters and (4) sediment chemical characteristics. Nonparametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) was used to model the abundance of individual macroinvertebrate taxa. Significant models were produced for nine out of the 24 taxa examined. Sediment characteristics were the group most frequently included in models and also the factors to which taxa abundance was the most sensitive. Aquatic physical and chemical variables were the next group most frequently included in models although chlorophyll a was not included in any of the models and total phosphorus in only one. This indicates that many taxa may not show a direct easily interpretable response to eutrophication pressure. Lake morphometric factors were included in several of the models although the sensitivity of macroinvertebrate abundance tended to be lower than for sediment and aquatic physical and chemical factors. Habitat factors were only included in three models although riparian vegetation was found to have a significant influence on the abundance of Ephemera danica indicating that ecotone integrity is likely to play a role in its ecology. Overall, the models tended to be specific for species with limited commonality across taxa. Models produced by NPMR indicate that the response of macroinvertebrates to environmental variables can be successfully described but further research is required focussing in more detail on the response of key taxa to relevant environmental parameters and anthropogenic pressures...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge-based water {{management}} requires {{a thorough understanding}} of previous lake conditions. Paleolimnological methods utilizes lake sediments as an important tool to obtain this knowledge. To gain a realistic view of previous conditions in lakes, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) require lake sediments to be retrieved from a lake unaffected by anthropogenic activity or classified as a reference lake. This thesis is based on the analysis of two sediment core records collected from Øvre Heimdalsvatn in September 2016, located in Øystre Slidre, Oppland County. The lake is classified as a reference <b>lake</b> for other <b>sub-alpine</b> <b>lakes</b> in Norway, and has served as an important research site in several fields, related to e. g. lake ecosystems during the last 50 years. The two sediment cores have been analyzed for nineteen different chemical constituents (Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, K, P, S, Na, Mn, Cu, V, Zn, Cr, Pb, As, Cs, Cd, Hg, Ni, Pb, As, Cs, Cd, Hg), and sixteen pigments included degradation products. Simultaneously, analyses of dry weight, total carbon, and total nitrogen have been carried out. By using these parameters, the thesis aims to examine late Holocene environmental history in Øvre Heimdalsvatn, and look at the major trends in distribution of inorganic constituents and pigments during the last ca 2000 years. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to emphasize variation and correlation among the parameters. The results from PCA indicated a positive correlation between the trace metals (Zn, Hg, Cd, As, Pb) and S. Since 950 CE until present, there is a generally increasing trend, with a decline in Pb, Cd and Zn in recent times. These trace metals are not considered a natural part of the bedrock composition in the area, and are assumed to be a result of long-range transport of atmospheric pollution. The remaining constituents show a more constant pattern throughout the sediment core, with minor variations. Based on the geomorphology in the area these constituents {{are a part of the}} bedrock composition, and the occurrence is most probably a result of natural background levels. The PCA indicated a positive correlation between chlorophyll a and -b (included degradation products) as they orient in the same direction. This was to be expected. Some pigments were excluded from the thesis, as they were not found or had very low concentrations. The remaining pigments indicated an overall similar trend, but occurred at different concentration levels. A change in pigment assemblage indicate a change in phytoplankton community in the lake. The major trends in pigment variations coincide well with the estimated temperature reconstruction in Northern Europe during the last millennium. The algae assemblage in a lake is largely influenced by changes in climatic conditions, which is well reflected in the pigment analyses...|$|R

Negative psychological effects and psychiatric complications due to termination of pregnancy seem to be rare. The objective {{of this study was to}} review the impact of induced abortion on sexuality and couple relationships. A systematic search of the literature was performed. Studies had to report a quantitative or qualitative evaluation of sexuality after pregnancy termination. Four studies were included. In the one prospective study using a control group, no difference in sexual functioning between groups after 1 year was reported. In the remaining observational studies, sexual dysfunction was reported in up to 30 % of women after termination. Women undergoing abortion had significantly more conflicts in their partnerships. This was similar in all studies. Separation occurred in about one-quarter of all couples. Some studies report sexual dysfunction after termination of pregnancy. In about half of the couples separated after termination, abortion seemed not to have led to the separation. Psychological factors, together with relationship problems, might have played a role in failed contraception. The impact of induced abortion on sexuality needs to be studied in greater detail with rigorous methodology to draw firm conclusions.

Wedekind, C. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2015 Aquatic Sciences 773481 - 497 <![CDATA[Fish eggs are associated with microbes, whose roles range from mutualism to parasitism. Recent laboratory experiments have shown that the taxonomic composition of associated microbial communities on the egg influences embryonic development. Host genetics also plays an important role in determining the consequences for embryonic growth and survival in this interaction. Moreover, it has been found that the importance of host genetics increases during embryogenesis. These findings suggest that during embryogenesis, the host increasingly influences the composition of its associated microbial community. However, little is known about the composition of microbial communities associated with naturally spawned eggs in the wild. We sampled fertilized whitefish eggs (Coregonus spp.) of different developmental stages from six <b>sub-Alpine</b> <b>lakes</b> and used a universal primer pair and 454 pyrosequencing in order to describe the taxonomic composition of egg-associated bacterial communities. We found bacterial communities on early embryos to be very diverse and to resemble the bacterial composition of the surrounding water environment. The bacterial communities on late embryos were significantly less diverse than on early embryos and displayed a clear shift in taxonomic composition that corresponded poorly with the bacterial composition of the surrounding water environment. The main bacterial components on whitefish eggs in this study were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, while the five most common families were Leuconostocaceae, Streptococcaceae, Comamonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae and Moraxellaceae. Their putative relationships with the host are discussed.

Energy requirements of platypuses foraging, resting and walking were measured in a swim tank and on a conventional treadmill using flow-through respirometry. Foraging behaviour and activity pattern of platypuses in the wild were investigated at a <b>sub-alpine</b> Tasmanian <b>lake</b> where individuals were equipped with combined data-logger-transmitter packages measuring foraging activity or dive depth and ambient temperature. Energy requirements while foraging in the laboratory were found to depend on water temperature, body mass and dive duration and averaged 8. 48 W kg- 1. Mean rate for subsurface swimming was 6. 71 W kg- 1. Minimum cost of transport for subsurface swimming platypuses was 1. 85 J N- 1 m- 1 at a speed of 0. 4 m s- 1. The metabolic rate of platypuses resting on the water surface was 3. 91 W kg- 1 while minimal RMR on land was 2. 08 W kg- 1. The metabolic rate for walking was 8. 80 and 10. 56 W kg- 1 at speeds of 0. 2 and 0. 3 m s- 1, respectively. Minimal cost of transport for walking was predicted to be 2. 13 J N- 1 m- 1 at a speed of 1. 7 m s- 1.
