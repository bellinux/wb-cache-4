50|$|A {{seaplane}} is a powered {{fixed-wing aircraft}} {{capable of taking}} off and landing (alighting) on water. Seaplanes that can also take off and land on airfields are in a subclass called amphibious aircraft. <b>Seaplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> are usually divided into two categories based on their technological characteristics: floatplanes and flying boats; the latter are generally far larger and can carry far more. These aircraft were sometimes called hydroplanes, but currently this term applies instead to motor-powered watercraft that use the technique of hydrodynamic lift to skim the surface of water when running at speed.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} stages of the {{creation}} of seaplanes and amphibious aircraft are flight certification tests, including tests to determine their landing and sailing characteristics on the water. In accordance with aviation regulations (part 21) certification work is carried out according to the methods of determination of compliance (MOC), which are the main organizational and methodological document for testing. The paper discusses the main provisions of the standard methods for the determination of the runway and sea keeping characteristics of <b>seaplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> on water areas with full-scale tests...|$|E

50|$|Gallery was {{an early}} naval aviator. He flew <b>seaplanes,</b> torpedo bombers <b>and</b> <b>amphibians.</b> In the late 1930s, he won at the National Air Races in a race-tuned Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo plane. In 1941, while the U.S. was still neutral, he was {{assigned}} as the Naval Attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Great Britain. While in Britain, he earned his flight pay by ferrying Supermarine Spitfires from the factory to Royal Air Force aerodromes. He liked to claim {{that he was the}} only U.S. Navy aviator who flew Spitfires during the Battle of Britain, but they were unarmed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shape of}} the Short Empire, a British flying boat of the 1930s was a harbinger of the shape of 20th century {{aircraft}} yet to come. Today, however, true flying boats have largely been replaced by <b>seaplanes</b> with floats <b>and</b> <b>amphibian</b> aircraft with wheels. The Beriev Be-200 twin-jet amphibious aircraft {{has been one of}} the closest [...] "living" [...] descendants of the earlier flying boats, along with the larger amphibious planes used for fighting forest fires. There are also several experimental/kit amphibians such as the Volmer Sportsman, Quikkit Glass Goose, Airmax Sea Max, Aeroprakt A-24, and Seawind 300C.|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} known cases of {{operation}} of <b>seaplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> in the snow-covered surfaces. On {{the basis of}} the existing data on the resistance and acceleration acting on the hull of planing snowplane analysis of possible acting {{on the bottom of the}} amphibious aircraft weighing 37 tons moving in the snow-covered surface was carried out. Estimates have shown the possibility of the takeoff of such plane while moving in the snow-covered surface. Vertical acceleration and landing hit will not exceed the maximum permissible value if the thickness of the snow cover is not less than 1 meter...|$|E

Recommendations for {{preventing}} transmission of Salmonella from reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> to humans • Pet store owners, health-care practitioners, and veterinarians should provide information to owners and potential purchasers of reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> {{about the risk}} for acquiring salmonellosis from their pets. • Persons should always wash their hands {{with soap and water}} after handling reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> or their cages. • Persons at increased risk for infection with serious complications from salmonellosis (e. g., children aged < 5 years and immunocompromised persons) should avoid contact with reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians.</b> • Reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> should be kept out of households with children aged < 5 years or immunocompromised persons. Families expecting a new child should give away their pet reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> away before the infant arrives. • Reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> should not be kept in child-care centers. • Reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> {{should not be allowed to}} roam freely throughout the house. • Reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> should be kept out of kitchens and other food-preparation areas to prevent contamination. Kitchen sinks should not be used to bathe pets or to wash their dishes, cages, or aquariums. If bathtubs are used for these purposes, they should be thoroughly cleaned afterward...|$|R
5000|$|... "Herp" [...] is a vernacular {{term for}} non-avian {{reptiles}} <b>and</b> <b>amphibians.</b> It {{is derived from}} the old term [...] "herpetile", with roots back to Linnaeus's classification of animals, in which he grouped reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians</b> together in the same class. There are over 6700 species of <b>amphibians</b> <b>and</b> over 9000 species of reptiles. In spite of its modern taxonomic irrelevance, the term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of non-avian reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians,</b> <b>and</b> herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of reptiles <b>and</b> <b>amphibians.</b>|$|R
