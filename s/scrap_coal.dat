40|$|Atmospheric {{fluidized-bed}} combustion (AFBC) is {{the prevalent}} technology in boiler design for new power plants. Using plant-level cost {{data from a}} sample of commercial AFBC powerplants, we {{examine the effects of}} fuel type (<b>scrap</b> <b>coal</b> or standard-grade coal), plant size, and plant completion date on fuel costs, operating costs, capital costs, and levelized total costs per unit of electrical output. We find important relationships between the type of fuel used and unit-output fuel costs (AFBC plants burning scrap are cheaper in fuel per unit of output, despite the lower heat content of scrap) and between operating costs and plant size (larger AFBC plants are cheaper to run). While we find that the advantage in unit fuel costs is not reflected in levelized total costs (which are affected only by plant size), this result may be caused by our procedure for calculating levelized total costs from component costs. ...|$|E

Instead of <b>scrapping</b> old pulverised <b>coal</b> fired units, NTPC should replace coal with torrefied crops waste/biomass as fuel in these units (nearly 11,000 MW) to make them profitable and productive assets without contributing to pollution.|$|R

With the resumption of the Napoleonic Wars, Nicol lived in constant fear of being impressed, and thus left Edinburgh for rural Scotland. Eventually he grew {{too old to be}} at risk of impressment, and so travelled to London in search of his naval pension, which he was unable to obtain. He returned to Scotland, where he was so poor that he had to pick <b>scraps</b> of <b>coal</b> from the street in order to keep himself warm.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1989, the archaeologists of the Old Mobile Project {{excavated}} a house site located near {{the western edge of}} the site. The house, believed to have been occupied by French Canadians, was a long narrow building consisting of a parlor flanked by two bedrooms with a fenced garden or animal pen at one end. The only remaining features of the house were the footing trenches used for wall sills, clay floors, and brick rubble remaining from a fireplace.During the 1990 field survey, the location of a blacksmith shop was identified by the discovery of large quantities of iron <b>scrap,</b> slag, <b>coal,</b> and charcoal.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} R&D {{activities in}} the field of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy for industrial applications and shows novel LIBS systems running in routine operation for inline process control tasks. Starting with a comparison of the typical characteristics of LIBS with XRF and spark-discharge optical emission spectrometry, the principal structure of LIBS machines embedded for inline process monitoring will be presented. A systematic requirement analysis for LIBS systems following Ishikawa's scheme was worked out. Stability issues are studied for laser sources and Paschen-Runge spectrometers as key components for industrial LIBS systems. Examples of industrial applications range from handheld LIBS systems using a fiber laser source, via a set of LIBS machines for inline process control tasks, such as <b>scrap</b> analysis, <b>coal</b> analysis, liquid slag analysis and finally monitoring of drill dust...|$|R
50|$|These wagons have a {{level floor}} and solid sides {{with at least}} one door on each side. They are mainly used for {{transporting}} bulk goods, <b>coal,</b> <b>scrap,</b> steel, wood and paper. The majority of wagons have folding sides and end walls, otherwise they are given the letters l (fixed sides) or o (fixed end walls). Wagons may have one or two folding end walls. Steel rings enable ropes, nets or covers to be attached to secure the load.|$|R

50|$|By the mid-1950s, Woodham Brothers was trading {{mainly as}} a scrap metal merchants, {{producing}} high quality scrap metal {{for the newly}} nationalised steel industry. Dai Woodham, {{as a result of}} the British Rail decision, negotiated a contract in 1957 to scrap metal mainly from the Western Region, covering like other scrap merchants the easily handled railway line and rolling stock; the more complex steam locomotives were to be handled solely by the railway works. As none of the many South Wales-based scrap merchants knew how long the work from <b>scrapping</b> the short-wheelbase <b>coal</b> wagons from the former South Wales coalfield would last, they all chose to scrap these first.|$|R
40|$|The aims of this {{research}} was to study the effect of Coal Tar as softener for reclaim rubber production from waste of rubber of tyre rethreading as input materials was <b>scrap</b> rubber. <b>Coal</b> Tar as softener was used with variation; 2, 5; 5; 7, 5; 10; 12, 5 and 15 % respectively from total scrap rubber. Reclaimed rubber was made at temperature 1200 C for 1 hour in autoclave and than it was subsequently ground with two rolls mills. The characteristics of the reclaimed rubber was tested for the vulcanization and physical properties. The results showed that Coal Tar could be utilized as softener for reclaimed rubber.

40|$|The Port of Ferrol {{is in the}} {{autonomous}} region of Galicia, in the north-west of the Iberian peninsula, in the ria of the same name. The port has traditionally specialised in bulk goods, mainly <b>coal,</b> <b>scrap</b> and petroleum products. An increase in traffic in the 1990 s, combined with the diversification policy in the port authority activities, and the advisability {{to have a new}} container terminal, led the Port Authority to consider a major expansion project in the outer part of the ria. This paper provides an account of the works that were involved in this project (carried on from 2001 to 2005), known as the `Port of Ferrol enlargement works (outer harbour) ¿ 1 st stage¿ and describes all the main construction processes (quarry, construction of breakwater, wharf, dredging processes, etc.) including the technological advances introduced at these work...|$|R
50|$|Traffic on the Mississippi system {{climbed from}} 211 million short tons {{to more than}} 330 million between 1963 and 1974. The growth in river {{shipping}} did not abate in the final quarter of the century. Traffic along the Upper Mississippi rose from 54 million tons in 1970 to 112 million tons in 2000. The change from riveted to welded barges, the creation of integrated barges, and the innovation of double-skinned barges have led to improved economy, speed, and safety. Shipping on Mississippi barges became substantially less expensive than railroad transport, but {{at a cost to}} taxpayers. Barge traffic is the most heavily subsidized form of transport in the United States. A report in 1999 revealed that fuel taxes cover only 10 percent of the annual $674 million that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spends building and operating the locks and dams of the Mississippi River. Barges figured there were a lot more corn and soybeans in Iowa than there was scrap iron! Until then, some had limited themselves to pushing <b>scrap</b> downstream and <b>coal</b> upriver, but those commodities were dwarfed by the potential downstream grain business. Overcoming the challenges of expansion, more players jumped into the booming barge industry.|$|R
