50|$|To {{discover}} {{the extent and}} <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> artery ectasia {{there are a variety}} of diagnostic tools used. The most common method for discovering the disease is through angiography. Angiography is the procedure where a contrast dye is entered into the vessels and an x-ray is taken, which will allow the vessels to be seen on the x-ray. Using angiography clinicians are able to display the size, location and number of vessels affected by the disease. Is can also be analyzed through other methods such as intravascular ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Using these diagnostic methods, it has been discovered that the disease normally occurs most often in the right coronary artery, followed by the left anterior descending artery, and finally the left anterior circumflex artery. Using these methods Coronary artery ectasia can be divided into four different types: Type 1¬→diffuse ectasia in 2-3 different vessels, Type 2¬→ diffuse disease in 1 vessel and local disease in another, Type 3¬→ diffuse disease in one vessel and Type 4¬→ localized or segmental ectasia.|$|E

40|$|Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a {{commonly}} used index {{to assess the}} functional <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> a <b>coronary</b> artery stenosis. It is conventionally calculated as {{the ratio of the}} pressure distal (P-d) and proximal (P-a) to the stenosis (FFR=P-d/P-a) - We hypothesize that the presence of a zero flow pressure (P-zf), requires a modification of this equation. Using a dynamic hydraulic bench model <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> circulation, which allows one to incorporate an adjustable Pzf, we studied the relation between pressure-derived FFR=P-d/P-a, flow-derived true FFRQ = Q(S) /Q(N) (= ratio of flow through a stenosed vessel to flow through a normal vessel), and the corrected pressure-derived FFRC = (P-d-P-zf) /(P-a-P-zf) under physiological aortic pressures (70 mmHg, 90 mmHg, and 110 mmHg). Imposed P-zf values varied between 0 mmHg and 30 mmHg. FFRC was in good agreement with FFRQ, whereas FFR consistently overestimated FFRQ. This overestimation increased when P-zf increased, or when P-a decreased, and could be as high as 56 % (P-zf = 30 mmHg and P-a = 70 mmHg).

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify clinical and echocardiographic parameters independently associated with the angiographically-determined <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> atherosclerosis in long-term kidney transplant patients. Fifty-two kidney transplant recipients who underwent elective coronary angiography were reviewed retrospectively. Angiographic severity was evaluated using the modified Gensini index (MGI). The mean age at coronary angiography was 52. 5 ± 7. 9 yr with a mean prior transplant duration of 118. 1 ± 58. 8 months. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated a positive correlation of MGI with transplant duration before coronary angiography and chronic allograft nephropathy, whereas an inverse correlation was demonstrated with ejection fraction and statin use. On subsequent multivariate linear regression analysis, transplant duration before coronary angiography, statin use, and ejection fraction were independently associated with the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> atherosclerosis in long-term kidney transplant patients.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe used {{myocardial}} fractional flow reserve (FFRmyo) and coronary flow reserve (CFR) {{to estimate}} cut-off values for {{assessment of the}} functional <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> stenosis and myocardial ischemia, and we tested the usefulness of coronary blood hemodynamic measurements before and after plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) and {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery (CABG). BackgroundFractional flow reserve and CFR are useful for assessing the functional <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> artery stenosis, coronary microvascular dysfunction, and myocardial ischemia during cardiac catheterization in adults. However, there have been no reports on the use of these measurements in children with Kawasaki disease (KD). MethodsThe study group included 128 patients with 314 coronary branches. The subjects were classified into three groups: normal coronary group, with 206 branches; abnormal coronary artery without ischemia group, with 58 branches; and ischemia group, with 50 branches. ResultsIn each branch, CFR and FFRmyowere significantly lower in the ischemia group than in the other groups. Cut-off values for assessing the functional <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> stenosis and CFR were approximately equal to those obtained for adults (CFR: < 2. 0; FFRmyo: < 0. 75). We obtained very high sensitivity and specificity for estimating myocardial ischemia using CFR and FFRmyo(CFR: 94. 0 % and 98. 5 %, respectively; FFRmyo: 95. 7 % and 99. 1 %, respectively).
