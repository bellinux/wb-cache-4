25|$|Central Anatolia {{receives}} little annual rainfall. For instance, the semi-arid {{center of}} the plateau receives an average yearly precipitation of only 300 millimeters. However, actual rainfall {{from year to year}} is irregular and occasionally may be less than 200 millimeters, leading to severe reductions in crop yields for both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture. In years of low rainfall, <b>stock</b> <b>losses</b> also can be high. Overgrazing has contributed to soil erosion on the plateau. During the summers, frequent dust storms blow a fine yellow powder across the plateau. Locusts occasionally ravage the eastern area in April and May. In general, the plateau experiences extreme heat, with almost no rainfall in summer and cold weather with heavy snow in winter.|$|E
25|$|Clearing {{is carried}} out by the grazing {{industry}} in an attempt to increase {{the quality and quantity of}} feed available for stock and to improve the management of livestock. The removal of trees from savanna land removes the competition for water from the grasses present, and can lead to a two to fourfold increase in pasture production, as well as improving the quality of the feed available. Since stock carrying capacity is strongly correlated with herbage yield, there can be major financial benefits from the removal of trees, such as assisting with grazing management: regions of dense tree and shrub cover harbors predators, leading to increased <b>stock</b> <b>losses,</b> for example, while woody plant cover hinders mustering in both sheep and cattle areas.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{ornamental}} fish trade {{is a growing}} trade sector that {{has a number of}} stakeholders that form the supply chain. <b>Stock</b> <b>loss</b> has been highlighted as a concern in relation to the sustainable growth of the industry and welfare concerns. To investigate the issues surrounding <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> and its extent within the {{ornamental fish}} trade, a mixed method approach was used. Specifically, the factors that affect <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> were identified and the relation to care taken by retail staff (n= 40) and consumers (n= 110) were investigated. Direct occurrence of <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> was also assessed – that was collated from 13 stores for the marine sample and 19 stores for the tropical sample – and <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> within the tropical freshwater fish sample (n= 32, 204) was 5...|$|R

25|$|Cattle plagues recurred {{throughout}} history, often accompanying {{wars and}} military campaigns. They hit Europe especially {{hard in the}} 18th century, with three long panzootics which, although varying in intensity and duration from region to region, {{took place in the}} periods of 1709–1720, 1742–1760, and 1768–1786. There was a major outbreak covering the whole of Britain in 1865/66. Later in history, an outbreak in the 1890s killed 80 to 90% of all cattle in southern Africa, {{as well as in the}} Horn of Africa. Sir Arnold Theiler was instrumental in developing a vaccine that curbed the epizootic. More recently, a rinderpest outbreak raged across much of Africa in 1982–1984, costing at least an estimated US$500 million in <b>stock</b> <b>losses.</b> The loss of animals caused famine which depopulated subsaharan Africa, allowing thornbush to colonise. This formed ideal habitat for tsetse fly, which carries sleeping sickness. Much of the land remains depopulated, under the control of the tsetse fly.|$|E

40|$|Retention of well-fixed {{bone cement}} {{at the time}} of {{revision}} THA is appealing, as its removal can be difficult and risks bone <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> or fracture. The technique of cement in cement revision however is not in widespread use. Femoral cement in cement revisions has been performed at our institution since 1989. Existing stems were removed to aid exposure for acetabular revision, alter version or leg length, or for component incompatibility. Minimum follow up of 5 years was available for 136 cases (in 134 patients) with a mean of 8 years (maximum 15). 35 cases underwent further revision surgery (26 acetabular loosening, 4 sepsis, 3 instability, 1 femoral fracture and 1 stem fracture). No femoral stem has been re-revised for aseptic loosening. These results support the technique of femoral cement in cement revision. Advantages include speed, less blood or bone <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> and less risk of femoral perforation or fracture. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{consistent}} definition of natural disaster damage costs, i. e., equivalently, of natural disaster prevention benefits {{in accordance with}} general definition of benefits, Willingness to Pay, more concretely, Equivalent Variation, of any policy such as tax reforms, transportations, environments, infrastructures, etc. In order to formulate the damage cost it needs to model the economic behavior at and after the disaster periods given the disaster physical damages are measured by the equivalent labor loss and the equivalent capital <b>stock</b> <b>loss.</b> The model is composed of two stages. The first is the static general equilibrium given the labor loss and the equivalent capital <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> measured above, for which this study will adopt the static computable general equilibrium (SCGE). The second is the dynamic macroeconomics which models the recovery process given the initial labor and capital stock for cases with and without disaster, for which this study will adopt the dynamic computable general equilibrium (DCGE). The damage cost or benefit of the disaster {{is defined as the}} present value of the time stream of Equivalent Valuation for the time stream of utility change due to the initial condition change. Then it will be shown that the conventional damage calculation by the reconstruction and/or replacement cost is assumes that the second stage immediately takes place at the disaster time, therefore, the first stage does not happens. Also sometimes the economic impacts on GDP of disaster capital <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> are calculated but nothing is referred to the damage cost of disaster. This is because there is not yet clear definition of damage cost and lack of recognition of it is a work of only the first stage. Finally it will be discussed how to transform the disaster physical damages to the equivalent labor and capital <b>stock</b> <b>loss.</b> The physical damages are either private capital loss or labor loss or output loss or social overhead capital loss, each of which enters to CGE as private capital loss, labor force loss, efficiency parameter reduction due to both output loss and social overhead capital loss. Then assuming constant returns to scale the efficiency parameter change due to both output loss and social overhead capital loss can be transformed to the loss of labor and capital stock.

40|$|Acetabular bone <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> compromises {{the outcome}} in primary and {{revision}} total hip arthroplasty. In 1979, a biologic method was introduced with tightly impacted cancellous allografts in combination with a cemented polyethylene cup for acetabular reconstruction. With this technique, {{it is possible to}} replace the loss of bone and to repair normal hip mechanics and hip function with a standard implant. Based on the authors' 20 years experience, a review of the long-term data is presented in primary total hip arthroplasty with preexisting acetabular bone <b>stock</b> <b>loss,</b> primary total hip arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis, patients who had bone impaction when younger than 50 years, and in acetabular revisions. The survival rate with revision of the cup for aseptic loosening as the end point was 94 % at 10 to 17 years, 90 % at 10 to 18 years, 91 % at 10 to 17 years, and 92 % at 10 to 15 years. From biopsy specimens from humans and histologic data in animal experiments the incorporation of these impacted bone chips was proven. The acetabular bone impaction technique using large morselized bone chips (range, 0. 7 - 1 cm) and a cemented cup is a reliable technique with favorable long-term outcome...|$|R

40|$|To {{simulate}} femoral intramedullary bone <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> in revision surgery {{of failed}} total hip arthroplasties, a method was developed using impacted trabecular bone grafts. In 14 goats a cemented {{total hip arthroplasty}} was performed, fixating the stem within a circumferential construction of bone allografts. After 6 or 12 weeks, 4 goats were used for mechanical tests and 3 for histology. The stability of the stems was determined in a loading experiment with roentgen-stereophotogrammetric analysis; loads of up to 1. 44 times body weight were used. One aseptic loosening was seen with gross movements. In the other cases the most important movements were axial rotations (max. 0. 24 degrees under 800 N) and axial translations (max. 0. 16 mm under 800 N). After unloading some elastic recovery occurred. There were no differences between the 6 and 12 -week groups. Histologically, revascularization and remodeling of the grafts were evident. Bone apposition and bone resorption of the grafts resulted {{in a mixture of}} graft and new bone. There was more new bone formation in the 12 -week group, but the process was not yet completed.
