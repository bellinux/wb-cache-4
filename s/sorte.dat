In this novel Duteurtre relates some personal experiences from his activities {{as a journalist}} and music critic.

50|$|Drawing the <b>Sortes</b> Sanctorum (Lots of the saints) or <b>Sortes</b> Sacrae (Holy Lots) was {{a type of}} divination or cleromancy {{practiced in}} early Christianity, derived and adapted from the ancient Roman <b>sortes,</b> {{as seen in the}} Greek <b>Sortes</b> Homericae and Roman <b>Sortes</b> Virgilianae.|$|R
50|$|In ancient Rome, {{the method}} of <b>sortes</b> {{involved}} opening a book and choosing some verse at first sight. This method was particularly called the <b>sortes</b> Praenestinae; and afterwards, according to the poet who was used, <b>sortes</b> Homerica, <b>sortes</b> Virgilianae, etc.|$|R
50|$|Among Christians, the Bible is most {{commonly}} used (in the <b>Sortes</b> Sanctorum), and in Islamic cultures the Qur'an. In the Middle Ages the use of Virgil's Aeneid was common in Europe and known as the <b>sortes</b> Virgilianae. In the classical world the <b>sortes</b> Virgilianae and <b>sortes</b> Homericae (using the Iliad and Odyssey) were used.|$|R
25|$|In 1983, a {{group of}} squatters moved in and took control of an empty house in Ryesgade 58. The squatters, many of them very experienced, moved in slowly and in small groups to avoid detection. The plan succeeded, and {{after a couple of}} months, they had {{established}} a well-organized squat. It was designed so that every floor was an independent collective charged with maintaining its part of the house. They improved the living conditions in the house, and Ryesgade 58 soon became the unofficial headquarters of the squatters movement. It was the center for political activities and was usually the place where foreign squatters lived when visiting Copenhagen. Soon after the squatting of Ryesgade 58, other new squats were established around Copenhagen. These squats included Kapaw in Østerbro, Baldersgade 20 ("Baldurs Street 20"), Bauhaus, and the infamous <b>Sorte</b> Hest ("Black Horse").|$|E
500|$|The first {{third of}} the novel {{provides}} a lengthy exploration of the characters' histories. Balzac makes this clear after 150 pages: [...] "Ici se termine, en quelque <b>sorte,</b> l'introduction de cette histoire." [...] ("Here ends what is, in a way, the introduction to this story.") At {{the start of the}} novel, Adeline Hulot– wife of the successful Baron Hector Hulot– is being pressured into an affair by a wealthy perfumer named Célestin Crevel. His desire stems in part from an earlier contest in which the adulterous Baron Hulot had won the hand of the singer Josépha Mirah, also favored by Crevel. The Hulots' daughter, Hortense, has begun searching for a husband; their son Victorin is married to Crevel's daughter Celestine. Mme. Hulot resists Crevel's advances, and he turns his attention elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|In Agrippina the da capo aria is {{the musical}} form used to {{illustrate}} {{character in the}} context of the opera. The first four arias of the work exemplify this: Nero's [...] "Con raggio", in a minor key and with a descending figure on the key phrase [...] "il trono ascenderò" [...] ("I will ascend the throne") characterises him as weak and irresolute. Pallas's first aria [...] "La mia <b>sorte</b> fortunata", with its [...] "wide-leaping melodic phrasing" [...] introduces him as a bold, heroic figure, contrasting with his rival Narcissus whose introspective nature is displayed in his delicate aria [...] "Volo pronto" [...] which immediately follows. Agrippina's introductory aria [...] "L'alma mia" [...] has a mock-military form which reflects her outward power, while subtle musical phrasing establishes her real emotional state. Poppaea's arias are uniformly light and rhythmic, while Claudius's short love song [...] "Vieni O cara" [...] gives a glimpse of his inner feelings, and is considered one of the gems of the score.|$|E
5000|$|Bibliomancy {{compares with}} rhapsodomancy (from rhapsode [...] "poem, song, ode") [...] "divination by reading a random passage from a poem". A {{historical}} precedent was the ancient Roman practice of <b>sortes</b> ("sortilege, divination by drawing lots") which specialized into <b>sortes</b> Homericae, <b>sortes</b> Virgilianae, and <b>sortes</b> Sanctorum, using {{the texts of}} Homer, Virgil, and the Bible.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Sortes</b> Homericae (Latin for [...] "Homeric lots") was the {{practice}} of drawing a random sentence or line from the works of Homer (usually the Iliad) {{to answer a question}} or predict the future. Socrates is recorded as doing so in prison to determine the day of his execution, and {{the practice}} even occurred in the Renaissance era. In the Roman world it co-existed with the various forms of the <b>sortes,</b> such as the <b>Sortes</b> Virgilianae and their Christian successor the <b>Sortes</b> Sanctorum.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Sortes</b> Vergilianae (Virgilian Lots) {{is a form}} of divination by bibliomancy {{in which}} advice or {{predictions}} of the future are sought by interpreting passages from the works of the Roman poet Virgil. The use of Virgil for divination may date as early as the second century AD, and is part of a wider tradition that associated the poet with magic. The system seems to have been modeled on the ancient Roman <b>sortes</b> as seen in the <b>Sortes</b> Homericae, and later the <b>Sortes</b> Sanctorum.|$|R
500|$|Later {{accounts}} {{repeat the}} explanation {{that the ship}} heeled over while going about and that the ship was brought down because of the open gunports. A biography of Peter Carew, brother of George Carew, written by John Hooker sometime after 1575, gives the same reason for the sinking, but adds that insubordination among the crew was to blame. The biography claims that George Carew noted that the Mary Rose showed signs of instability as soon as her sails were raised. George's uncle Gawen Carew had passed by with his own ship the Matthew Gonson during the battle to inquire about the situation of his nephew's ship. In reply he was told [...] "that he had a <b>sorte</b> of knaves whom he could not rule". Contrary to all other accounts, Martin du Bellay, a French cavalry officer who {{was present at the}} battle, stated that the Mary Rose had been sunk by French guns.|$|E

In July 1915, the volunteers were intended for a sector of the front around Ala and the Gardesana. On 24 October 1915, Boccioni participated in the battle of Dosso Casina. On 1 December 1915 the battalion was dissolved as part of a general reorganization; the volunteers were laid off temporarily, then each was called up along with the class. In May 1916 Boccioni was drafted into the Italian Army, and was assigned to an artillery regiment at <b>Sorte</b> of Chievo, near Verona. On 16 August 1916, he was thrown from his horse during a cavalry training exercise and was trampled. He died the following day, age thirty-three.|$|E

2500|$|In the Baroque and Classical eras quintuple meter is, if anything, {{even less}} {{frequently}} encountered {{than in the}} Renaissance.

Charles Burney found this whole scene admirable, as a portrait of Orlando's madness, but observed that [...] "Handel has endeavoured to describe the hero's perturbation of intellect by fragments of symphony in , a division of time {{which can only be}} borne in such a situation". Burney's German contemporary, Johann Kirnberger, also felt that [...] "No one can repeat groups of five and even less of seven equal pulses in succession without wearisome strain".
