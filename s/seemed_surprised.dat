25|$|The strike lasted 172 days, at {{the time}} making it ({{at the time}}) the longest in UAW history and the longest strike in International Harvester history. International Harvester made key errors—including using inexperienced negotiators, going public with {{bargaining}} demands, and attacking key union issues such as seniority {{and the lack of}} mandatory overtime without giving itself room to negotiate—which greatly prolonged the strike. The seeming arrogance of top company officials is {{considered by many to be}} a serious strategic error. Company officials <b>seemed</b> <b>surprised</b> that the union could hold out for any length of time, and McCardell appeared to assume that the international union staff (not rank and file members) were pushing for a strike.|$|E
25|$|Following the win, it {{was soon}} {{announced}} that Darchinyan would take part in Showtime's four man bantamweight tournament, along with Joseph Agbeko, Abner Mares and IBF bantamweight champion Yonnhy Pérez. Vic lost in the semi-finals against México's Mares via controversial split decision. Darchinyan dominated Mares in {{first half of the}} fight. Mares was knocked down once in the second round and was docked a point in the fourth round for low blows. Mares had been throwing dirty punches the entire fight, however, and continued to do so, being warned 16 more times after the point deduction. The referee continued to {{turn a blind eye to}} Mares' low blows and, as a result, Mares started winning rounds. Darchinyan was knocked down once in the seventh round out of pain from low blows. When the win was announced for Mares, the audience <b>seemed</b> <b>surprised,</b> as many felt Darchinyan had won this fight.|$|E
500|$|... "Too Dizzy" [...] was {{the first}} song Bowie and new {{collaborator}} Erdal Kizilcay wrote together for the album, and was written in homage to the 50s. Bowie said [...] "a real Fifties subject matter was either love or jealousy, so I thought I’d stick with jealousy because it’s a lot more interesting". Bowie at the time called the song a [...] "throwaway" [...] and <b>seemed</b> <b>surprised</b> that he included it on the album. The song has been deleted from subsequent reissues of Never Let Me Down. Despite Bowie's dislike for the song, EMI briefly considered it for release as a fourth single from the album, and in fact it did appear as a promo release in the US.|$|E

500|$|Shakur {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism {{as a child}} and attended the all-girls Cathedral High School, for six months before transferring to public high school, which she attended until she dropped out. Shakur is no longer Catholic. She later earned a General Educational Development (GED) with her aunt's help. Often there were few, or no other black students in her high school class. Shakur later wrote teachers <b>seemed</b> <b>surprised</b> when she answered a question in class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged, and what she was taught a sugar-coated version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States. In her autobiography she later wrote: “I didn’t know what a fool they had made out of me until I grew up and started to read real history”.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after taking}} power, Napoleon told the celebrated chemist, Jean-Antoine Chaptal, {{who was then}} the Minister of the Interior: [...] "I want to do {{something}} great and useful for Paris." [...] Chaptal replied immediately, [...] "Give it water". Napoleon <b>seemed</b> <b>surprised,</b> but the same evening ordered the first studies of a possible aqueduct from the Ourcq River to the basin of La Valette in Paris. The canal was begun in 1802, and completed in 1808. Beginning in 1812, the water was distributed free to Parisians from the city fountains. In May 1806 Napoleon issued a decree that water should run from the fountains both day and night. He also built new fountains around the city, both small and large, the most dramatic of which were Egytpian Fountain on rue de Sèvres and the Fontaine du Palmier, both still in existence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first test}} flight {{coincided with a}} visit by United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to China, and was {{initially}} interpreted by the Pentagon as a possible signal to the visiting U.S. delegation. Speaking to reporters in Beijing, secretary Gates said [...] "I asked President Hu about it directly, {{and he said that}} the test had {{absolutely nothing to do with}} my visit and there had been a pre-planned test." [...] Hu <b>seemed</b> <b>surprised</b> by Gates' inquiry, prompting speculations that the test might have been a signal sent unilaterally by the Chinese military. [...] Abraham M. Denmark of the Center for New American Security in Washington, along with Michael Swaine, an expert on the PLA and United States–China military relations, explained that senior officials are not involved in day-to-day management of aircraft development and were unaware of the test.|$|E

2500|$|The French {{themselves}} <b>seemed</b> <b>surprised</b> at {{the success}} of the operation, which was well beyond what they had anticipated. Villeroi wrote: [...] "The disorder that we have caused in this city is incredible, the people menace us with many threats of reprisal, I don't doubt they have the will to do so, but I don't see how they have the means." [...] The French master of artillery wrote [...] "I have been on many tours of duty, but I have never before seen so large a fire or so much desolation as there seems to be in that city." [...] The young Duke of Berwick, a future Marshal of France who was present, disapproved, writing {{at the end of his}} life [...] "A more appalling spectacle has never been seen, and nothing else comes as close to the sack of Troy." ...|$|E
