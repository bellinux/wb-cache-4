5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> not even light can escape.|$|E

Advocating campaign finance reform, Jones garnered 184,703 votes in the primary, enough to best a field including Scotty Baesler (149,352 votes), Dr. Floyd Poore (132,060 votes), and Gatewood Galbraith (25,834).|$|E

They were in bundles on the deck, the shipping container and filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor was <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> the Coast Guardsman who found them had to breathe through his mouth since it burned his nose. Since no corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were contraband.|$|E

The tornado at the school was <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has developed}} into an essential tool in modern astrophysics.

Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E

Minority groups in Cambodia also use loris-based medicine for treating broken bones, asthma, and sexually transmitted diseases. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris etal.

5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium is <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes {{may contribute to the}} relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E

5|$|When mass is {{concentrated}} into a sufficiently compact region of space, general relativity predicts {{the formation of}} a black hole– a region of space with a gravitational effect <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> not even light can escape. Certain types of black holes are thought to be the final state in the evolution of massive stars. On the other hand, supermassive black holes with the mass of millions or billions of Suns are assumed to reside in the cores of most galaxies, and they {{play a key role in}} current models of how galaxies have formed over the past billions of years.|$|E

5|$|Anisotropy {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and is <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also {{an effect on the}} final shape.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Cisneros Carrillo {{was born}} on August 25, 1932, son of Edgardo Cisneros Díaz Isabel Carrillo Iñiguez in the Lagunero town of Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. While in school Cisneros met and befriended José Eusebio Vázquez Bernal, a {{friendship}} that was close that they considered each other's brothers. The friendship between the two was <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> Cisneros' parents considered Vázquez {{as one of their}} own children. After leaving school they both went their separate ways, not seeing each other for two years, before they both ended up training at the same boxing gym where Cisnero met with some success as a Golden Gloves boxer. Cisnero was also an avid cyclist, having participated in the first ever Vuelta Coahula bicycle race. Late in life he credited training as a boxer and cyclist for his stamina in the ring.|$|E
5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E

5|$|Josce {{was married}} to Sybil, the widow of Pain fitzJohn, who died in 1137. Sybil had held Ludlow Castle against Stephen in 1139, but {{surrendered}} after a siege. Ludlow was an important strategic stronghold {{for control of the}} Welsh Borders, and Stephen decided to marry Pain's widow to someone he felt was trustworthy. Upon his marriage Josce also acquired control of the castle, built in the late 11th century. Josce probably also received many of the de Lacy family's holdings in southern Shropshire, but he rebelled against Stephen and fortified Ludlow against the king. Josce's position was <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> when Stephen granted much of the surrounding lands to Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, Ludlow was specifically exempted. Stephen told Robert that he would have a royal grant of the castle if he could secure Josce's submission as a vassal.|$|E
5|$|Many seabirds show {{remarkable}} site fidelity, {{returning to}} the same burrow, nest or site for many years, and they will defend that site from rivals with great vigour. This increases breeding success, provides a place for returning mates to reunite, and reduces the costs of prospecting for a new site. Young adults breeding {{for the first time}} usually return to their natal colony, and often nest close to where they hatched. This tendency, known as philopatry, is <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> a study of Laysan albatrosses found that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22m; another study, this time on Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica, found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony bred in the burrow they were raised in, and two actually bred with their own mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{probable}} {{properties of}} further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium {{have not been}} explored yet as of 2015; in fact, it is suspected {{that they may not}} be able to exist. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become <b>so</b> <b>strong</b> <b>that</b> extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers. Interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium stems from the fact that both elements are located close to the expected locations of islands of stabilities, centered at elements 122 (306Ubb) and 164 (482Uhq).|$|E
