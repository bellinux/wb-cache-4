5|$|Going {{into his}} sophomore campaign, Arcidiacono focused on {{improving}} his footwork and shooting mechanics. Arcidiacono hit a 3-pointer with 10.1 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> a November 29 matchup against Kansas despite {{not making a}} shot until that point. The Wildcats held on to upset the second-ranked Jayhawks 63-59. Arcidiacono had his first double-double with 20 points and 11 assists in a 94–85 overtime win over Marquette on January 25, 2014. He recorded a season-high 21 points in the February 18 game against Providence. With 3.1 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> double overtime, Arcidiacono completed a three-point play to help the Wildcats to a 82–79 victory.|$|E
5|$|Arizona {{came into}} the fourth quarter {{trailing}} Nevada by 17 points. Arizona was able to cut the lead to 45-35 on a 63-yard touchdown pass from Scott to Austin Hill soon after the 4th quarter began. Nevada then took a 48-35 lead on a 25-yard field goal from Hardison, for a 13-point lead with only 1:44 left in regulation time. Arizona, with no timeouts and needing two scores to win the game, was able to cut the lead down to 48-42 with only 42 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> regulation on a short touchdown pass from Scott to Hill. After Marquis Flowers successfully recovered the onside kick, Arizona quickly scored with another short Scott touchdown pass, this time to Tyler Slavin, to take tie the game at 48 with only 19 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> regulation. Prior to the extra point attempt, Nevada coach Chris Ault called his final timeout to try to ice kicker John Bonano. The tactic was unsuccessful, as Bonano made the extra point to give Arizona a one-point lead. The final 19 seconds of the game were {{the only time that}} Arizona led. Arizona held on to the lead after Arizona's Flowers intercepted a Fajardo pass with a few seconds remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|At Clemson, quarterback Bernie Faloney {{returned}} the opening kick off 88 {{yards for a}} touchdown. In the second quarter, Clemson quarterback Don King was sacked by several Maryland defenders and suffered a game-ending knee injury. With 45 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the half, Dick Nolan scored on a 90-yard punt return. In the second half, Faloney connected with Nolan for a 65-yard touchdown pass. Clemson finished the game with two pass completions and suffered its first shutout at home in 11 years, 20–0.|$|E
5|$|During the February 21, 2000 {{game between}} the Canucks and the Boston Bruins, Brashear was {{involved}} in a fight with Marty McSorley. Brashear handily won the fight and {{on his way to the}} penalty box taunted the Bruins bench. Later in the game, Brashear collided with Bruins goaltender Byron Dafoe, who had to be taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury. For the rest of the game, McSorley attempted to fight Brashear, who refused. With 4.6 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the game, McSorley struck Brashear with a two-handed slash to the temple with his stick; Brashear collapsed, and his helmet fell off upon impact. He suffered a seizure on the ice and the slash resulted in a grade three concussion. Goaltender Garth Snow then tried to fight McSorley, but a pile-up occurred, and Snow couldn't get at McSorley, who was ejected with 2.8 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the game. McSorley later received an indefinite suspension from the NHL and was charged with assault with a weapon as a result of his actions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Notre Dame scored first on a 15-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Ron Powlus to Bobby Brown, culminating a 12-play, 78-yard drive. In the second quarter, the Wolverines tied {{the game on}} a 4-yard touchdown run by Clarence Williams to complete an 11-play, 68-yard drive. Notre Dame regained the lead late {{in the second quarter}} on a 98-yard drive ending in a two-yard run by Tony Driver with 18 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the half.|$|E

5|$|On November 17, Yang Shu-chun of Chinese Taipei, was {{abruptly}} disqualified with 12 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> {{the first}} round of the taekwondo competition, while leading her opponent 9–0. She was accused of having installed illegal sensors on the heel of her socks. The event quickly turned into an international incident, with officials, politicians and public opinion from Chinese Taipei, China and South Korea trading accusations of manipulation and fraud.|$|E
5|$|Statistically, the Bears offense struggled. Cutler {{completed}} 27 of 47 {{passes for}} 317 yards, two touchdowns, three interceptions and a 65.6 passer rating. Cutler's three interceptions and fumble tied his turnover amount {{in the first}} three games. The offense also had trouble on third down; despite being ranked ninth in third down efficiency, the Bears failed to convert until there were 47 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the game to end the game converting just 1 of 13 third downs.|$|E
5|$|The Colts put {{together}} one last drive {{with less than}} two minutes left. The standout player was receiver Raymond Berry, who caught three passes for 62 yards, the last one for 22 yards to the New York 13-yard line. With seven <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> regulation, Steve Myhra kicked a 20-yard field goal to tie the score 17–17, sending a game to overtime {{for the first time in}} NFL history.|$|E

5|$|The NHL became first {{involved}} in international {{play in the}} mid-1970s, starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union. With the eight-game series tied at three wins apiece and a tie, Paul Henderson scooped up a rebound and put it past Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak with 34 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the eighth and final game to score the series-winning goal.|$|E
5|$|With {{just over}} two minutes left the Giants punted {{the ball to the}} Colts, pinning them on their own 14yard line. The Colts put {{together}} one last, desperate drive. The star of this drive was receiver Raymond Berry, who caught three passes for 62yards, the last one for 22yards to the Giant 13–yard line. With seven <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> regulation, Steve Myhra kicked a 20–yard field goal to tie the score 17–17, sending the game to overtime {{for the first time in}} NFL history.|$|E
5|$|As a sophomore, Burke made 5 of 6 {{free throws}} in {{overtime}} {{to help his}} team defeat Dublin Scioto High School by a 54–53 margin in a 2009 OHSAA Division I regional final. In the state championship game, he made one of two free throws to give Northland a 58–56 lead with 27.6 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> what became a 60–58 win over Princeton High School. He also made the pass {{to set up the}} final game-winning points, although they were scored from the foul line by Sullinger. During the championship season, Burke averaged 10.7 points and 9.1 assists, and made only 1.7 turnovers per game.|$|E

50|$|Cubit won a {{basketball}} game in 1968 after making two free throws with one <b>second</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the game 62-61. He was named all-Delco honorable mention in 1969 and 1970. He was named first team All-Delco his senior year. Cubit finished his career with 1,114 points.|$|R
5|$|During {{his senior}} year, Marian {{was the number}} 1 seed in the Thornton {{sectional}} of the IHSA Class 4A tournament. On March 11, Ulis had 40 points to lead Marian past Bloom High School 6645. In the game, which was a rematch from the prior year, {{he made his first}} six shots, all three-pointers. On March 18, Marian lost its supersectional rematch against Edwardsville in overtime, again falling one game short of reaching the final four in Peoria, Illinois and finishing with a 283 record. In the game, Ulis, who had 23 points and 4 assists, tied the score with 21 seconds in regulation and with 50 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> overtime. In the April 18 Jordan Brand Classic, Ulis posted 9 points and 9 assists.|$|E
5|$|The referee {{added two}} minutes of injury time {{at the end of}} extra time, during which time Manchester United won another free kick, but Scholes' shot was {{straight}} at the Arsenal defensive wall. Then, with just <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> regulation time, Ronaldo made a break towards the Arsenal half, only to be cynically body-checked by Reyes. Referee Styles made no hesitation and showed Reyes a second yellow card, making the Spaniard the second player to be sent off in an FA Cup Final, after Manchester United's Kevin Moran in 1985. The full-time whistle went immediately after Reyes' dismissal, and the match finished at 0–0, making it the first FA Cup Final to result in a penalty shootout.|$|E
5|$|After Navy forced North Texas {{to begin}} the second quarter with a punt, Midshipmen running back Eric Kettani fumbled {{the ball on the}} second play of the next drive and the Mean Green recovered. The next eight {{possessions}} – four from each team – resulted in touchdowns. Four of the drives took less than a minute of game time to reach the end zone, and a fifth took barely over a minute. In the final two minutes of the half the Midshipmen forced the Mean Green to punt after three plays, and Navy quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada threw a 47-yard pass to running back Reggie Campbell. The Midshipmen ran for another touchdown on the next play. North Texas got the ball back with seven <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the half, but chose not to attempt to score again. At {{the end of the first}} half, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen 49–45.|$|E

5|$|Despite Toronto's {{improved}} defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely {{missed in}} the first-round {{series against the}} second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to Ben Wallace's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals. Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit. With 10.7 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play, instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds. Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the absence}} of Bertuzzi for the {{remainder}} of the season, Näslund led the Canucks to the Northwest Division title they had lost the previous season. Bertuzzi was replaced on the top line by Matt Cooke. The Canucks' division title placed them third in the Western Conference standings, matching them against the sixth-placed Calgary Flames in the opening round of the 2004 playoffs. In the seventh and deciding game of the series between the two teams, the Canucks faced a one-goal deficit in the final minute of regulation time. With the Canucks having pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker, Näslund stickhandled the length of the ice past two defenders, before shooting the puck on goal. Calgary goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff saved the shot before Cooke scored on the rebound with six <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the game. Despite the effort, Calgary subsequently eliminated Vancouver a minute-and-a-half into the subsequent overtime period on a powerplay goal. Näslund finished the playoffs with nine points in seven games.|$|E
5|$|Hershey lost 2–1 in {{overtime}} against Binghamton on October 21. The game {{would have gone}} to a shootout, but under the first usage of the AHL's new video replay system at Giant Center, a Senators goal that had been overturned with 6.5 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> overtime was restored. The Bears were held to a single goal in a second straight game in a 3–1 loss to Connecticut Whale on October 26, but the next day saw their first home win and first shutout victory of the season. They defeated the Albany Devils 3–0 and Holtby, who had been sidelined since the previous week by an upper body injury, made 35 saves. Forward T.J. Syner was recalled from the ECHL's Reading Royals and made his Hershey debut in that game. The Bears finished the month with a 3–2 victory against the Penguins on October 28, marking their first winning streak of the season. Orlov would miss the next four games due to an upper body injury, not returning until November 11.|$|E
