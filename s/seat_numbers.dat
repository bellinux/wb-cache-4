The three full buffet cars were still utilised. The two TranzAlpine cars had their Addington <b>seat</b> <b>numbers</b> reduced from 52 to 50. The seats were reupholstered and modified before being reinstalled, and were re-arranged into bays of four, alcove-style, around tables. These two cars, still retaining their small windows, were permanently allocated to the Southerner when the TranzAlpine was made an all-panorama train.|$|E

500|$|The 767s were {{launched}} as [...] "First Business Class" [...] to charter travelers, but the business model was not successful. The new consumer groups entering the market had low willingness to pay, {{and the demand}} for premium charter services was low. The company was faced with not being able to charter out the plane because of the low <b>seat</b> <b>numbers,</b> but could not put in the extra seats because of the aircraft also being used on the scheduled market. Using so large aircraft on the short-haul flights in Southern Norway gave little economy-of-scale, and the airline seldom needed the increased capacity. Braathens SAFE also had problems, because from order to delivery, the exchange rates had increased from 5 to 9 NOK per USD, almost doubling the price in NOK. In 1986, the two 767s where sold. Two years later, Altas Resor was sold, and the following year Saga. Braathens SAFE closed its bases in Gothenburg and Stockholm, but remained a charter operator with 737s from Norway.|$|E
