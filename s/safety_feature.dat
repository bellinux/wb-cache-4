5|$|Powered winches {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy loads. One winch was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
40|$|General {{practice}} {{computer systems}} {{already have a}} number of important <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b> However, there are problems in that general practitioners (GPs) have come to rely on hazard alerts when they are not foolproof. Furthermore, GPs {{do not know how to}} make best use of <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> on their systems. There are a number of solutions that could help to improve the <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> of general practice computer systems and also help to improve the abilities of healthcare professionals to use these <b>safety</b> <b>features...</b>|$|R
50|$|The W87 design {{includes}} all modern <b>safety</b> <b>features,</b> including insensitive high explosives LX-17 and PBX-9502 (primary component TATB), a fire-resistant pit, and advanced arming and fuzing <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the lack}} of trained {{personnel}} available in remote areas, SMRs have to be inherently safe. Many larger plants have active <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> that require [...] "intelligent input", or human controls. Many of these SMRs are being made using passive or inherent <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b> Passive <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> are engineered, but do not require outside input to work. A pressure release valve may have a spring that can be pushed back when the pressure gets too high. Inherent <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> require no engineered moving parts to work. They only depend on physical laws.|$|R
5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E
25|$|The New Haven {{main line}} and New Canaan branch use Automatic Train Control, or ATC, in {{conjunction}} with Cab Signals, a <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> used in routing trains, keeping safe distances, and moderating train speeds.|$|E
25|$|The new Chrysler-built A833 four-speed manual {{transmission}} was offered {{together with a}} Hurst shifter. Another new option was the Sure-Grip limited slip differential, which was touted as a bad-weather <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> and also offered traction benefits in performance driving.|$|E
50|$|Mini monster {{trucks are}} not {{carbureted}} {{and the design}} includes a full roll cage and <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b> As most mini monster trucks are custom built, not {{all have the same}} <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b> When based on a go-kart or ATV chassis, <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> vary. Professional mini monster trucks are built with comparable <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> to those of standard monster trucks. In youth racing competitions, trucks are built with limiters, and will not go faster than 25 mph. Other standard safety requirements are fire suits, safety helmets, a radio-operated remote ignition interrupt system, and driver-to-crew radio systems that keep the drivers in contact with adults at all times.|$|R
50|$|A {{full set}} of airbags, steel {{reinforced}} cabin, and head restraints were <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> {{designed to protect the}} interior while VDC, ABS, electronic brakeforce distribution and brake assist were mechanical <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b> VDC incorporates a form of traction control.|$|R
50|$|Although {{they lack}} such {{advanced}} <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> as air bags, antilock braking systems, and other electronic controls, most US-market cars built 1966 and later have basic <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> such as padded dashboards, seat belts, dual-circuit braking systems, and safety glass.|$|R
25|$|This is {{considered}} an important <b>safety</b> <b>feature,</b> as the surface team can monitor the diver's breathing sounds, which can give early warning of problems developing, and confirms that the diver is alive. In a four wire system the diver to surface channel can be on all the time.|$|E
25|$|For example, the Rambler Classic was {{equipped}} with a standard tandem master cylinder in 1962 that provided stopping ability {{even if there was}} a failure in the brake system. Only Cadillac also included this <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> six years before U.S. safety regulations required it on all cars.|$|E
25|$|In April 1895 {{a railway}} {{telephone}} line was installed between Wallerawang and Mudgee with Rylstone {{as an intermediate}} telephone point. The telephone was an important <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> on this railway due to the steep cliffs and tunnels that occur {{on both sides of}} Rylstone allowing quick and clear communication of problems.|$|E
50|$|The {{globally}} certified <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> of {{this vehicle}} include crash protecting crumple zones, child lock, collapsible steering and side intrusion beams. Also, the tubeless tires, voice assist system and remote locking / unlocking {{of the vehicle}} are the additional <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b>|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} year where all the races were run on {{circuits}} with <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> on them, and considerable progress had been made since 1968, the last year where all races were run on circuits with no <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} active and passive <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> of cars. In {{the first part}} describes the history of these <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b> The second part deals with the biomechanics related to vehicle safety. The third part describes the various active and passive <b>safety</b> <b>features,</b> {{with an emphasis on}} restraint systems. In the fourth part briefly introduces the methodology of evaluation of the safety car. And at the end indicates the expected future development of security features...|$|R
25|$|The 1991 {{model year}} had little {{news for the}} Premier except for a new {{anti-lock}} braking system (ABS) that was also available on the Canadian-built Dodge Monaco twin. The new <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> came standard on the ES Limited and was optional on other models. The Limited model received a new front grille and rear tail lamp assemblies.|$|E
25|$|Thus, DA {{means that}} a cocking action {{separate}} from the trigger pull is unnecessary; every trigger pull {{will result in a}} complete cycle. This allows uncocked carry, while also allowing draw-and-fire using only the trigger. A longer and harder trigger stroke is the trade-off. However, this drawback can also be viewed as a <b>safety</b> <b>feature,</b> as the gun is safer against accidental discharges from being dropped.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} {{arrangement with}} wired diver communications {{is to have}} the diver's side normally on, so that the surface team can hear anything from the diver at all times except when the surface is sending a message. This is considered an important <b>safety</b> <b>feature,</b> as the surface team can monitor the diver's breathing sounds, which can give early warning of problems developing, and confirms that the diver is alive.|$|E
50|$|Chainsaws {{incorporate}} numerous <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> {{common to}} many engine-driven power tools. Manufacturers have invented numerous design <b>features</b> to improve <b>safety.</b> Some <b>features</b> have become de facto standards, {{and others are}} legal requirements in particular jurisdictions. Best practice dictates that an operator should inspect the saw before starting work and only operate the saw if all the <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> are properly functional.|$|R
5000|$|Antique {{automobiles}} and early to middle era classic cars {{do not have}} the <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> that are standard on modern cars. The most rudimentary of <b>safety</b> <b>features,</b> front wheel brakes and hydraulic brakes, began appearing on cars in the 1920s and 1930s respectively.|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>features</b> {{included}} 3-point {{seat belts}} {{for the front}} two passengers and lap belts for rear passengers. Standard on all Voyagers were legally mandated side-impact reinforcements for all seating front and rear outboard positions. <b>Safety</b> <b>features</b> such as airbags or ABS were not available.|$|R
25|$|The Veyron's brakes use cross drilled, {{radially}} vented {{carbon fibre}} reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, {{which have a}} much greater resistance to brake fade when compared with conventional cast iron discs. The lightweight aluminium alloy monobloc brake calipers are made by AP Racing; the fronts have eight titanium pistons and the rear calipers have six pistons. Bugatti claims maximum deceleration of 1.3g on road tyres. As an added <b>safety</b> <b>feature,</b> {{in the event of}} brake failure, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) has also been installed on the handbrake.|$|E
25|$|A blank-firing adapter or blank-firing {{attachment}} (BFA), {{sometimes called}} a blank adapter or blank attachment, is a device {{used in conjunction}} with blank ammunition. Blank firing adapters are required for allowing blanks to cycle most automatic firearms. It can also be a <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> designed so if a live round is mistakenly fired, most of the energy is spent smashing through the BFA reducing both the range and damage inflicted. A BFA may also divert the hot gases from a blank discharge out to the sides, reducing the risk of injury to the target of an aimed shot.|$|E
25|$|Demand {{breathing}} systems {{reduce the}} amount of gas required to adequately ventilate the diver, as it needs only to be supplied when the diver inhales, but the slightly increased work of breathing caused by this system is a disadvantage at extreme levels of exertion, where free-flow systems may be better. The demand system is also quieter than free-flow, particularly during the non-inhalation phase of breathing. This can make voice communication more effective. The breathing of the diver is also audible to the surface team over the communications system, and this helps to monitor the condition of the diver and is a valuable <b>safety</b> <b>feature.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{electrical}} {{codes in}} the US and Canada began to require additional <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> {{in the basic}} NEMA 5-15R and 5-20R configurations to address specific electric shock hazard concerns. The <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> listed below are not mutually exclusive; for example, tamper-resistant GFCI receptacles are available.|$|R
50|$|Additional <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> are a {{significant}} commercial advantage to chainsaw producers. Companies continue to develop new features over time. Most chainsaw <b>safety</b> <b>features</b> {{are focused on the}} kickback problem, and seek to either avoid it (chain and bar design), or {{to reduce the risk of}} injury should it occur (chain brakes).|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} modernised in 2006 with {{additional}} <b>safety</b> <b>features.</b>|$|R
25|$|In CANDU {{the fuel}} bundles are instead {{contained}} in much smaller metal tubes about 10cm diameter. The tubes are then {{contained in a}} larger vessel containing additional heavy water acting purely as a moderator. This vessel, known as a calandria, is not pressurized and remains at much lower temperatures, making {{it much easier to}} fabricate. In order to prevent the heat from the pressure tubes leaking into the surrounding moderator, each fuel tube is enclosed in a second tube. Carbon dioxide gas in the gap between the two tubes acts as an insulator. The moderator tank also acts as a large heat sink that provides an additional <b>safety</b> <b>feature.</b>|$|E
25|$|These form an {{organizing}} principle and unifying theme for Asimov's robotic-based fiction, appearing in his Robot series, the stories linked to it, and his Lucky Starr series of young-adult fiction. The Laws {{are incorporated into}} {{almost all of the}} positronic robots appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a <b>safety</b> <b>feature.</b> Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often parodic, appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.|$|E
25|$|The SkyTrain {{network is}} fully mobility-needs accessible, {{including}} vehicles and stations. Mark I train cars have one designated wheelchair position, Mark II, Mark III and Hyundai Rotem cars have two, and all stations have elevators. TransLink upgraded all Expo Line platform station edges to match {{those on the}} Millennium Line shortly after it was completed. The new, wider edges are brighter and are tiled to provide a safer environment for the visually impaired. The Canada Line also uses this <b>safety</b> <b>feature</b> in its stations. Since {{the opening of the}} Millennium Line, aside from platform tile upgrading, many Expo line stations have also been refitted with new signage and ticket vending machines. Beside minor English-language (electric) signage, the majority of the system is inaccessible to d/Deaf individuals due to audio-based announcements and notices.|$|E
