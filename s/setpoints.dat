To reach Net Zero in the Academic Building the project utilizes an air-tight envelope, expanded indoor temperature <b>setpoints</b> in specified areas to more closely model real-world conditions, a solar thermal system, and geothermal water source heat pumps.

25|$|Two basic {{requirements}} are regulation (disturbance rejection – {{staying at a}} given <b>setpoint)</b> and command tracking (implementing <b>setpoint</b> changes) – these refer to how well the controlled variable tracks the desired value. Specific criteria for command tracking include rise time and settling time. Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the process variable beyond the <b>setpoint</b> if, for example, this would be unsafe. Other processes must minimize the energy expended in reaching a new <b>setpoint.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the costs of {{grid-connected}} PV/H 2 systems sized to meet a <b>setpoint</b> power using ORIENTE® software. The aim is to determine optimal component sizes to minimize cost of injection-to-grid. We study the case of guaranteed PV production where the PV array is coupled to a hydrogen chain to inject a constant <b>setpoint</b> power into the grid from 8 am to 5 pm (local time) all year long without failure (100 % satisfaction level). We studied 4 <b>setpoint</b> powers: 100, 200, 300 and 400 kW. The results show that regardless of <b>setpoint</b> power, the optimum system design fits the ratios: installed PV power-to-setpoint power = 2. 4 - 2. 5; nominal electrolyzer power-to- <b>setpoint</b> power = 0. 72 - 0. 75; nominal fuel cell power-to-setpoint power = 1.

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) viral <b>setpoint</b> during the disease-free interval has been strongly associated with future risk of disease progression. An awareness of the correlation between viral <b>setpoint</b> and HIV- 1 genetic evolution over time {{is important in the}} understanding of viral dynamics and infection. We examined genetic diversity in HIV- 1 CRF 02 _A/G-IbNG-infected seroincident women in Dakar, Senegal; determined whether a viral <b>setpoint</b> kinetic pattern existed for CRF 02 _A/G-IbNG during the disease-free interval; and correlated viral load level and diversity. Samples were drawn during the disease-free interval from consenting CRF 02 _A/G-IbNG-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naïve female commercial sex workers in Dakar, Senegal. Based on sequential plasma RNA values, low and high viral <b>setpoint</b> groups were established. Intrapatient diversity and divergence over time was determined from earlier and later time point DNA samples from each person. Most individuals followed the viral <b>setpoint</b> paradigm. For each 1 |−|log 10 copy/ml of plasma increase in viral load, intrapatient diversity increased by 1. 4 % (P = 0. 028). A greater diversification rate was observed in the high viral <b>setpoint</b> group than in the low viral <b>setpoint</b> group (P = 0. 01). Greater nucleotide (P = 0. 015) and amino acid (P = 0. 048) divergences and a greater nucleotide divergence rate (P = 0. 03) were found in the high viral <b>setpoint</b> group. There was no difference between the groups in the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site. The greater intrapatient diversity, divergence, and diversification rates observed in the high viral <b>setpoint</b> group supports the notion that diversity is driven by cycles of viral replication resulting in accumulated mutations.
