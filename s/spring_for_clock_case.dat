50|$|The use of gilt-bronze to make {{luxury goods}} {{could be argued}} to have reached its peak at the {{beginning}} of the 19th century in France. This medium was not new, as it had enjoyed international reputation in Europe since the reign of Louis XIV that continued during the entire ancien régime. One reason for this success is the technical qualities inherent in bronze. Cheaper than gold and silver, it is a common material easy both to mold and ennoble by gilding with mercury.

40|$|Sleeping {{scheduling}} is {{a common}} energy-conservation solution for sensor networks. For application whereby coordination of sleeping among sensors is not possible or inconvenient, random sleeping is the only option. In this article, we study the asynchronous random sleeping(ARS) scheme whereby sensors (i) {{do not need to}} synchronize with each other, and (ii) do not need to coordinate their sleeping schedules. The stationary coverage probability and the expected coverage periods for ARS are derived. For surveillance application, we derive in addition the detection probability and detection delay distribution. The correctness of our results is validated through extensive simulations. We compare ARS with other synchronous and asynchronous sleeping scheduling algorithms and show that ARS offers better performance in terms of detection delay in the lower duty-cycle regime.

40|$|The {{ability to}} measure {{location}} using {{time of flight}} in IEEE 802. 11 networks is impeded by the standard clock resolution, imprecise synchronization of the 802. 11 protocol, and the inaccuracy of available clocks. To achieve real-time location with accuracy goals of a few meters, we derive new consensus synchronization techniques <b>for</b> free-running <b>clocks.</b> Using consensus synchronization, we improve existing time of arrival (TOA) techniques and introduce new time difference of arrival (TDOA) techniques. With this common basis, we show how TOA is theoretically superior to TDOA.

We demonstrate applications using off-the-shelf 802. 11 hardware that can determine location to within 3 m using simple, existing optimization methods. The synchronization techniques extend existing ones providing distributed synchronization <b>for</b> free-running <b>clocks</b> to <b>cases</b> where send times cannot be controlled and adjusted precisely, as in 802. 11 networks.

40|$|The {{trend of}} modern turbomachines towards lighter and slimmer blades exposed to higher {{loadings}} has made forced response problems {{emerge as a}} major concern in the design process of these machines. Forced response accounts for unsteady forces on the blade due to non-uniformities in the flow field. The clocking method, which consists in this case in changing the relative circumferential position between two consecutive stator blade rows, represents a possibility to reduce the excitation level of the blade’s natural modes. The goal {{of this investigation was}} to analyze the influence of the clocking method on a transonic compressor in order to find an optimum regarding aerodynamic forcing. The investigation was carried out in three parts. The first consisted in a computational fluid dynamics analysis which aimed at calculating the unsteady forces acting on the blades. The second consisted in a finite element analysis with the purpose of obtaining the mode shapes of the dangerous natural modes of the blades. In third part, the two analyses were coupled in order to evaluate the excitation level of the blades <b>for</b> seven equally-spaced <b>clocking</b> <b>cases</b> that covered a complete circumferential pitch. The results revealed that changing the circumferential position of the inlet guide vane with respect to the first stator blade row can reduce the excitation level of the rotor blade row in between by more than 50 percent and of the stator blade row by about 30 percent. Variations of the force distribution affecting sensible zones of the blade were detected, which explains the changes <b>for</b> the different <b>clocking</b> positions. An optimal clocking position was proposed regarding minimum excitation levels of the critical modes. Keywords: turbomachine, forced response, unsteady forces, clockin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Maximum {{likelihood}} (ML) {{is increasingly}} {{used as an}} optimality criterion for selecting evolutionary trees (Felsenstein, 1981, J. Mol. Evol. 17 : 368 – 376.), but finding the global optimum is a hard computational task. Because no general analytic solution is known, numeric techniques such as hill climbing or expectation maximization (EM) are used {{in order to find}} optimal parameters for a given tree. So far, analytic solutions were derived only for the simplest model—three-taxa, two-state characters, under a molecular clock. Quoting Ziheng Yang (2000, Proc. R. Soc. B 267 : 109 – 119), who initiated the analytic approach, “this seems to be the simplest case, but has many of the conceptual and statistical complexities involved in phylo-genetic estimation. ” In this work, we give general analytic solutions for a family of trees with four-taxa, two-state characters, under a molecular clock. The change from three to four taxa incurs a major increase in the complexity of the underlying algebraic system, and requires novel techniques and approaches. We start by presenting the general maximum likelihood problem on phylogenetic trees as a constrained optimization problem, and the resulting system of polynomial equations. In full generality, it is infeasible to solve this system, therefore specialized tools <b>for</b> the molecular <b>clock</b> <b>case</b> are developed. Four-taxa rooted trees have two topologies—the fork (two subtrees with two leaves each) and the comb (one subtree with three leaves, the other with a single leaf). We combine the ultrametric properties of molecular clock fork trees with the Hadamard conjugation (Hendy and Penny, 1993, J. Classif. 10 : 5 – 24) to derive a number of topology dependent identities. Employing these identities, we substantially simplify the system of polynomial equations for the fork. We finally emplo...|$|R
