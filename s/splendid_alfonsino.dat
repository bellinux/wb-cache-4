5000|$|Beryx splendens, the <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino,</b> a {{fish species}} found {{around the world}} at depths of between 25 and 1,300 m ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino</b> is the {{far more}} studied species of Beryx, but the alfonsino's biology {{is very similar to}} that of its congener. Alfonsinos are benthopelagic and {{aggregate}} over deep-ocean seamounts, typically near deep-sea corals. At night, they migrate vertically into shallower waters. Their primary food sources are crustaceans, cephalopods, and small fish, with the last being the most abundant prey in its diet. In this it is quite dissimilar from the <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino,</b> which appears to have a slower digestion and wider dietary breadth.|$|E
50|$|Alfonsinos are {{economically}} important fish, {{targeted by}} commercial fisheries, including seamount fisheries, that employ deep-water trawling and longline fishing methods to catch them. It is of import to fisheries in Spain and Mauritania {{in the eastern}} Atlantic, the southeastern United States in the western Atlantic, and Japan, La Reunion Island, and the Canary Islands in the Indo-Pacific. It is also captured as bycatch of fisheries targeting the <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino,</b> though capture data likely does not distinguish between the two. This has led to concerns that stocks may be more depleted than previously thought. Of all Beryx species, the <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino</b> is the most commonly caught, but B. decadactylus makes up 95% of all Beryx catches off the southeastern United States.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>splendid</b> <b>{{alfonsino}}</b> (Beryx splendens) is an alfonsino of {{the genus}} Beryx, found around the world at depths between 25 and 1300 m, usually between 400 and 600 m. Although its most common size is 40 cm, it can reach lengths of up to 70 cm. It is known as kinmedai (金目鯛) in sushi and Japanese cuisine.|$|E
5000|$|Like most seamounts, they attract fish. Over 175 {{species have}} been found there, {{including}} <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino,</b> black cardinal fish, black scabbardfish, and wreckfish. Trawl fishing during the 1970s and 1980s resulted in approximately 20,000 tons of fish being harvested. [...] As a result, the seamounts were closed to demersal fishing (collecting fish {{near the bottom of}} the ocean, as opposed to pelagic fishing, collecting fish near the surface) beginning 1 January 1997. The original ban was supposed to be lifted 31 December 2010, but was extended until 31 December 2020. Almost a decade into the ban, a 2005 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution survey found that two of the peaks, Kükenthal and Yakutat, had been stripped bare of both corals and bottom-dwelling animals. However the survey, which covered both the Corner Rise and New England Seamounts, found 270 species of invertebrates and crustaceans, including 70 species unique to the Corner Rise Seamounts.|$|E
50|$|The Beryciformes are a poorly-understood {{order of}} {{carnivorous}} ray-finned fishes consisting of 7 families, 30 genera, and 161 species. They feed on small fish and invertebrates. Beyond this, {{little is known}} about the biology of most member species because of their nocturnal habits and deepwater habitats. All beryciform species are marine and most live in tropical to temperate, deepwater environments. Most live on the continental shelf and continental slope, with some species being found as deep as 2000 m. Some species move closer to the surface at night, while others live entirely in shallow water and are nocturnal, hiding in rock crevices and caves during the day. Several species are mesopelagic and bathypelagic. Beryciformes' bodies are deep and mildly compressed, typically with large eyes that help them see in darker waters. Colors range from red to yellow and brown to black, and sizes range from 8 - 61 cm. Member genera include the alfonsinos, squirrelfishes, flashlight fishes, fangtooth fishes, spinyfins, pineconefishes, redfishes, roughies, and slimeheads. A number of member species are caught commercially, including the alfonsino, the <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino,</b> and the orange roughy, the latter being much more economically important. Some species have bioluminescent bacteria contained in pockets of skin or in light organs near the eyes, including the anomalopids and monocentrids.|$|E
50|$|Spawning {{occurs in}} the summer months, June through September, though males can {{reproduce}} year-round. Alfonsinos are batch spawners, that is they release eggs multiple times over an extended spawning season rather in a short period. Eggs and larvae are epipelagic, staying near the ocean's surface. Eggs hatch after around 27 hours and larvae are initially 1.5 - 3.0 mm SL in size, identifiable by pigment near the brain. Flexion, when the larva bends upwards prior to development of the caudal fin, occurs at 3.7 - 6.0 mm SL. Fin rays and scales are fully formed by 15 mm SL. They are distinguished by elongated pelvic rays and anterior dorsal spines as well as pigment near the gas bladder, though they {{are very similar to}} the larvae of the <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino.</b> Juveniles live deeper, but are still pelagic for a few months, eventually moving to their demersal habitat where they will live as adults. After 4 years, they reach sexual maturity, at which point they will be about 30 cm in size, with females being slightly larger on average than males. Individuals grow slowly, as is common among members of Berycidae. Although their maximum age is unknown, individuals have been caught at 69 years old. Their actual maximum age is unknown, however, with estimates ranging as high as 85 years.|$|E
40|$|The Japanese {{trawlers}} commenced {{exploratory fishing}} {{operations in the}} Southern Emperor and Northern Hawaiian Ridge (SE-NHR) in 1969, and the trawl fishery have been developed after then. In this area, 2 to 13 trawlers have been conducting fishing activities every year, targeting mainly North Pacific armorhead (Pseudopentaceros wheeleri) and <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino</b> (Beryx splendens). The fisheries are the {{important component of the}} ecosystem in the fishing ground, and understanding the impacts of the fisheries is important for the sustainable use of the aquatic resources. To estimate the management benchmarks, first attempt has been made to apply surplus production model to the <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino</b> stock in SE-NHR (Nishimura & Yatsu, 2006). This paper describe the results from two different surplus-production model program runs with using unadjusted/adjusted CPUE, and with using catch statistics from Japan, Korea, an...|$|E

40|$|Commercial aggregations of {{alfonsino}} (Beryx splendens) on the Corner Rising and in {{the area}} of North Azores were discovered {{for the first time on}} board the USSR exploratory vessels the mid- 70 s of last century. The NAFO SC recommended that precautionary regulations of the mid-water trawl fishery on <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino</b> be put in place. In 2014 NAFO Fisheries Commission request for scientific advice on provide a stock assessment for alfonsino. Taking in account the alfonsino spatial distribution associated with seamounts, their life history and their aggregation behavior and due to the limited availability of data it could be advised a scalar approaches to advice the future catch levels by using simple scalar multipliers applied to current or historical catch patterns. Based on this approach a maximum catch limit of 200 tonnes (the mean of the last 6 years) on 16 - 18 days or around 120 fishing hours could be advised by year in Kükenthal seamount and recommend that the exploitation of new seamounts should not be allowed to prevent the exploitation of populations that have not yet been fished...|$|E
40|$|Research Paper and PowerPoint PresentationThis paper aims {{to analyse}} and {{elucidate}} key {{conditions for the}} sustainability of community-based fisheries management (CBFM) on unrestricted fisheries in Japan. It re-examines more than 50 years’ worth of empirical evidence regarding the outcomes of the socio-economic rationality of the self-imposed management of common property, with particular reference to <b>splendid</b> <b>alfonsino</b> (Beryx splendens) fishing grounds off Katsuura, Chiba Prefecture, and the Small-Type Coastal Fishing Vessel Fishery Cooperative (STCC) there. It shows that the exclusive use of fishing grounds and other factors, including communal solidarity and a social milieu advocating fishermen’s protection of fishing grounds observed roughly 20 years ago, have for more than 50 years continuously existed as conditions necessary to establishing sustainable CBFM in unrestricted alfonsino fisheries using waters off Katsuura. At present, however, it should be recognised that the resource management of alfonsino as a migratory species would be required with different types of fishery operations in fishing grounds other than STCC’s operation near Katsuura. To resolve this issue, a co-management system involving a resource management plan and fisheries risk management plan under the fraternal insurance of the fishery was recently introduced {{in collaboration with the}} Japanese government, Chiba’s prefectural government, and the STCC. As a type of adaptive fisheries management system in Japan, this co-management system would {{play an important role in}} securing key sustainable conditions for CBFM in unrestricted, self-managing fisheries in alfonsino fishing grounds off Katsuura, Japan...|$|E
