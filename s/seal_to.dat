5|$|In 1819, {{the state}} seal {{was part of}} a state crisis. Lieutenant Governor Christopher Harrison became acting-governor when Governor Jonathan Jennings was away {{conducting}} negotiations with northern Indiana's native tribes. When Jennings returned, Harrison refused to step down as governor, claiming that Jennings' actions had invalidated his governorship. Harrison seized the state seal and set up his own governor's office. After several weeks of debate in the state legislature, Harrison was forced to return the <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> Jennings and vacate the office of the governor.|$|E

He and his father were driven from Le Mans, Henry's birthplace, in 1189. Geoffrey did not attend the subsequent conference at which Henry submitted to Philip immediately before Henry's death, unwilling to witness his father's humiliation, but he did help nurse him during his final days. Henry made a bedside wish that Geoffrey be made either Archbishop of York or Bishop of Winchester, and Geoffrey used his father's <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> make appointments to York after Henry's death. Geoffrey then escorted Henry's body to Fontevrault Abbey for burial. He {{was the only one of}} Henry II's sons present at his death.|$|E

In 1998, the LDS Church created a new policy that a woman may also be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> more than one man. A woman, however, may not be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> more than one man while she is alive. She may only be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> {{subsequent}} partners after both she and her husband(s) have died. Thus, if a widow who was <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> her first husband remarries, she may be <b>sealed</b> by proxy <b>to</b> all of her subsequent husband(s), but only after both she and the subsequent husbands have died.

5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} bite to the hindquarters (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.|$|E

However, a woman whose sealed husband has died is still bound by the original sealing and must request a cancellation of <b>sealing</b> <b>to</b> be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> another man (see next paragraph for exception to this after she dies).

5|$|The process upon being branded is {{a painful}} {{experience}} for the person as the body would either accept the seal or reject it. Once one's body accepts the seal, they can assume its First Level where the seal spreads from its point of application across the user's body, increasing their chakra supply and their physical abilities in the process. When the seal is deactivated, the user is left exhausted, having expended all their energy during its use. The Second Level of the Cursed Seal is achieved by allowing the <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> engulf the users entire body, ultimately causing the person to transform into a personalized parody of Sage Mode with various strengths and weakness. The means to achieve the Second Level is by being given a drug and entering a state of lifelessness.|$|E

Jeremy, knowing that the First Paladin of Rome would kill him and Alysa on sight, sets off to defeat the demon before the army of Rome arrives. When Jeremy and Alysa confront the demon, it explains that it was summoned because the humans have become too numerous, and with increased numbers they have gone from fearing vampires to hunting them. Jeremy and Alysa kill the demon and Bartholomew recovers the Blood Seal. As he does this, the First Paladin of Rome arrives and demands the seal for himself.

In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War. In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa'eq Ali Rimawi was elected. In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities to append its municipal <b>seal</b> <b>to</b> the Memorandum from the masses and the institutions of the West Bank to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a display of unity with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993, full control over security and civilian affairs in the town.|$|E

Coulter and Draper were the third duo to be eliminated from the competition on 4 March. Later that year, she returned to Australian Idol as a host and reporter alongside James Mathison and Andrew Günsberg. Coulter co-hosted the show for two seasons, and received a nomination at the 2009 Logie Awards for Most Popular New Female Talent. Coulter became a mentor for the first season of The Voice Australia in 2012, and paired up with coach <b>Seal</b> <b>to</b> prepare the contestants in his team for the show's battle rounds.

25|$|In the LDS Church today, {{both men}} and women may enter a {{celestial}} marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> more than one woman. If his wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the celestial kingdom as a family with all to whom he was sealed. In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women <b>to</b> be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> more than one man. A woman, however, may not be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> more than one man at a time while she is alive. She may only be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> subsequent partners after she has died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to the person in the afterlife.

If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.|$|R
5000|$|A {{man who is}} <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> a woman {{but later}} {{divorced}} must apply for a [...] "sealing clearance" [...] from the First Presidency in order <b>to</b> be <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> another woman.

This approval voids the original sealing {{as far as the}} woman is concerned. Divorced women who have not applied for a sealing cancellation are considered <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> the original husband. However, it is generally believed that even in the afterlife the marriage relationship is voluntary, so no person could be forced into an eternal relationship through temple sealing that they do not wish to be in. Divorced women may also be granted a cancellation of sealing, even though they do not intend to marry someone else. In this case, they are no longer regarded as being <b>sealed</b> <b>to</b> anyone and are presumed to have the same eternal status as unwed women.|$|R
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good <b>seal,</b> <b>to</b> shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
