50|$|In economics, {{the average}} {{propensity}} to save (APS), {{also known as the}} <b>savings</b> <b>ratio,</b> is the proportion of income which is saved, usually expressed for household savings as a fraction of total household disposable income. The ratio differs considerably over time and between countries. The <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> for an entire economy can be affected by (for example) the proportion of older people (as they have less motivation and capability to save), and the rate of inflation (as expectations of rising prices can encourage people to spend now rather than later).|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{personal}} <b>saving</b> <b>ratio</b> in the US {{economy in the}} last two decades. We examine whether the mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) mechanism – the cash out from refinancing home mortgage conditions – is useful for explaining the <b>saving</b> <b>ratio’s</b> declining pattern. Empirically, we find that MEW depends on house price inflation and mortgage rates. We construct a VEC model among the two variables explaining MEW, the <b>saving</b> <b>ratio</b> and the stock price. We obtain a significant cointegrating relationship. We then estimate a structural form imposing restrictions, suggested by theoretical or empirical literature, on the long-run impact matrix. We find a negative response of the <b>saving</b> <b>ratio</b> to positive shocks in asset prices, whereas there is an opposite effect {{in the case of a}} positive shock in mortgage rates, according to the theoretical expectations. ...|$|R

The reason for this exercise is twofold. Firstly, it is generally accepted that individual households regard consumer durables as assets even though they are not treated as such in the System of National Accounts 1993. Secondly, the issue is related to the definition of household <b>saving</b> <b>ratios.</b> For instance, the U. S. Federal Reserve Board publishes three household saving measures. The main difference between these <b>saving</b> <b>ratios</b> is that one is derived by treating expenditure on consumer durables as investments while the other two are compiled by consid-ering them to be household final consumption expenditure.

Most of these funds have moved from defined benefit (final salary) to contribution-based benefits. Thousands of private funds have been wound up. The government has appointed an enquiry to look at ways of ensuring that a major increase in poverty in the coming decades can be avoided. Suggestions have included compulsory pensions and increasing the retirement age to 70.|$|E

He publicised it as a budget for savings and announced the Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> that had been apparent during the previous financial year. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a [...] "hard [...] ", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and Douglas Hurd, Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.|$|E
50|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{gave birth}} to {{what would become the}} first formal consumption function. However Kuznets shook the economic world by finding that Keynes' predictions, while seemingly accurate in short-run cross-sections, broke down under more rigorous examination. In his 1942 tome Uses of National Income in Peace and War, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Kuznets became the first economist to show that the Absolute Income Hypothesis gives inaccurate predictions in the long run (by using time-series data). Keynes had predicted that as aggregate income increases, so will marginal savings. Kuznets used new data to show that, over a longer span of time (1870's - 1940's) the <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> remained constant, despite large changes in income. This paved the way for Milton Friedman's Permanent Income Hypothesis, and several more modern alternatives such as the Life cycle hypothesis and the Relative Income Hypothesis.|$|E

Three theories unambiguously predict a higher private <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> during recessions: a Ricardian offset effect, the presence of credit constraints, and precautionary savings. We find evidence only for the latter theory.

40|$|In a {{simplified}} model GDP growth {{depends on the}} demand effect of private investment growth and on {{the growth of the}} private <b>savings</b> <b>ratio.</b> In a generalized model private investment (IP) has to be supplemented by the trade balance (E) and the budget deficit (D), their sum being termed NPCE (Non-Private-Consumption-Expenditures). Hence GDP growth depends, in the generalized case, on the demand effect of NPCE growth and on changes in the private <b>savings</b> <b>ratio.</b> In the present paper the term NPCE (given the import and tax coefficients) is treated as independent of GDP, hence exogenous in the model. In contrast, the private <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> does depend on GDP, especially on the distribution of disposable GDP between undistributed profits of firms and private households, as well as the latter's propensity to save. Using this model the relation between growth and private savings in the USA and in Japan between 1960 and 2000 is investigated in the paper. The results of the analysis of the period 1996 - 2000 are of special interest. In the USA a sharp decline of the private <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> helped to achieve a high rate of GDP growth at a stagnating NPCE term. In Japan an increase in the private <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> provoked an almost stagnating GDP although the NPCE term increased rather substantially. These results prove that spendthrift in the USA (especially of the private households) {{turned out to be a}} collective blessing while thrift in Japan has become a collective fault. The causes of the different developments of the private <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> in the USA and Japan require further research. We have found that in the USA the private <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> depends not only on income of but also on wealth, defined as equity shares at market value, owned by private households. growth, savings, private investment, trade balance, budget deficit, propensity to save of private households, USA, Japan...|$|E

The use of a <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> helper constraint was not required. It is shown that the introduction of a <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> constraint leads to a 12 % underestimation of maximum atmospheric temperature rise. In addition, evidence of a <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> within economic data was unable to be confirmed using the equivalent proxy of an investment ratio and model selection techniques for mixed Gaussian probabilistic graphical models. However, evidence of a dilute intertemporal relationship between investment and an increase in production was detected. The results of this research support the use of Runge-Kutta sampling differential transcendental solvers with Chebyshev function outputs for continuous solutions in integrated assessment models without the requirement for helper constraints. 1.

40|$|Co{{generation}} {{is defined}} as generation of two forms of energy viz, heat and work using single primary fuel. Cogeneration or {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) is important in improving energy efficiency of the overall plant and in reducing environmental pollution. A methodology, based on pinch analysis, is proposed in this paper to integrate gas turbine and regenerator with a process plant to minimize fuel consumption. Thermodynamic analysis of gas turbine integrated CHP plant is presented on gas turbine pressure ratio versus power to heat ratio diagram. On this novel diagram, limits of integration are identified and various regions of integration are represented. Additionally, contour plots of energy utilization factors and fuel energy <b>saving</b> <b>ratios</b> are represented on this diagram for optimal integration of gas turbine with a process plant. It {{is interesting to note that}} though the contour plots of energy utilization factors and fuel energy <b>saving</b> <b>ratios</b> differ significantly, loci of the maximal energy utilization factor and the maximal fuel energy <b>saving</b> <b>ratio</b> are identical. Optimum sizing of gas turbine integrated cogeneration plant for grassroots design and retrofitting are performed based on these diagrams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Trezzini (2015) {{presents}} a methodological approach {{for the study}} of the <b>saving</b> <b>ratio</b> that does not rely on normal capacity utilization positions. To explain the <b>saving</b> <b>ratio</b> he focuses instead on the fluctuations of consumption and investment. Precisely that focus requires I would argue a different kind of approach. Once the traditional theory of saving is discarded, the ‘indeterminacy’ of the <b>saving</b> <b>ratio</b> opens the way to an analysis of the evolution of consumption, and of how that evolution affects aggregate demand. The generation and evolution of autonomous demand are matters of obvious relevance to the classical-Keynesian approach to the analysis of growth. In this comment I take Duesenberry’s criticism of demand theory as the first step for focusing on the evolving standard of consumption and autonomous (‘innovative’) investment, therefore addressing directly the investment-consumption relationship. It seems to me that in a framework centered on the pace of accumulation this is a more fruitful line of investigation. There are of course a number of complicated questions involved and they are far from being satisfactorily analyzed. They are part of the necessary task of articulating a theory of consumption consistent with demand-led growth and forward-looking investment decisions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to empirically test whether house price increases are an important factor in a household’s savings decisions and whether housing tenure choice and savings behavior are inter-correlated in Taiwan. Heckman's two-stage procedure for correcting sample selection bias is used in the estimation of savings function for homeowners and renters. Household survey data from 1985, 1989 and 1993 are used to compare households ' saving behavior at different times. The empirical results show that in some cases the coefficients of the two different definitions of house price increases have opposite signs. These differences {{may be the result of}} different behavior motives. House price increases with respect to the price of the house itself seem to cause concern among households about future housing prices; hence, increase their <b>savings</b> <b>ratio.</b> House price increases with respect to income, however, seem to cause a wealth effect and then decreased <b>savings</b> <b>ratio.</b> Considering the complexity of households ' reaction, the overall effect of house price changes on the aggregate <b>savings</b> <b>ratio</b> becomes impossible to determine...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} Statistical-Mechanics {{inspired}} framework for modeling economic systems. Each agent composing {{the economic system}} {{is characterized by a}} few variables of distinct nature (e. g. <b>saving</b> <b>ratio,</b> expectations, etc.). The agents interact locally by their individual variables: for example, people working in the same office may influence their peers' expectations (optimism/pessimism are contagious), while people living in the same neighborhood may influence their peers' saving patterns (stinginess/largeness are contagious). Thus, for each type of variable there exists a different underlying social network, which we refer to as a ``layer''. Each layer connects the same set of agents by a different set of links defining a different topology. In different layers, the nature of the variables and their dynamics may be different (Ising, Heisenberg, matrix models, etc). The different variables belonging to the same agent interact (the level of optimism of an agent may influence its saving level), thus coupling the various layers. We present a simple instance of such a network, where a one-dimensional Ising chain (representing the interaction between the optimist-pessimist expectations) is coupled through a random site-to-site mapping to a one-dimensional generalized Blume-Capel chain (representing the dynamics of the agents' <b>saving</b> <b>ratios).</b> In the absence of coupling between the layers, the one-dimensional systems describing respectively the expectations and the <b>saving</b> <b>ratios</b> do not feature any ordered phase (herding).
