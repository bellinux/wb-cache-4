Substitution possibilities between differently qualified employees are investigated at the establishment level. The derived substitutional relationships within the blue-collar workers were {{very similar to those}} within the white collar workers. <b>Skilled</b> <b>employees</b> and, to a lesser extent, highly <b>skilled</b> <b>employees</b> are substitutes for the unskilled.

The frequently cited results that the own-wage demand elasticity decreases with skill, can be confirmed between skilled and highly <b>skilled</b> <b>employees,</b> but not between <b>skilled</b> and unskilled <b>employees.</b> The elasticities of substitution between blue collar and white collar workers are relatively low; unskilled, skilled and highly skilled blue collar workers are found to be complements to the analogue group of white-collar workers.

The result of having a bottleneck are stalls in production, supply overstock, pressure from customers and low employee morale. There are both short and long-term bottlenecks.

The results confirm the hypothesis that skilled labor is a scarce commodity in Bolivia, while unskilled labor is abundantly available. This implies that <b>skilled</b> <b>employees</b> shop around for alternative employment opportunities and quit their jobs when a better opportunity arises. The quit rate among <b>skilled</b> <b>employees</b> in the private sector is much higher than the quit rate among <b>skilled</b> <b>employees</b> in the public sector. The reverse is true for the lay-off rate, and together this suggests that the private sector has difficulties maintaining its skilled labor.

The article is the product of research which describes the nature of the psychological contract and analyses the extent to which the Limpopo Provincial Treasury (LPT) is able to retain financial practitioners (scarce <b>skilled</b> <b>employees)</b> by focusing upon issues such as career development, motivation and attachment. The LPT faces serious staff turnover rates in scarce <b>skilled</b> <b>employees,</b> specifically pertaining to young internal auditors, which has resulted in unmet targets over the past 10 years. In this research, a questionnaire survey was used to collect data.

The target population included internal auditors, risk management practitioners, internal control practitioners, financial management practitioners, information technology specialists, revenue management practitioners, accountants and economists.

The results revealed that the employee morale, the lack of promotion opportunities and inadequate resource allocations were the main causes for retention failure.

Clearly, this reduces overlap {{between the two groups}} and renders group membership a stronger predictor of skills.

Skill transparency is highest in the top right graph where the skills gap is large and members of the same group tend to be very similar in terms of the actual skills that they have. In this hypothetical situation, an employer could be almost certain that he/she would hire a more <b>skilled</b> <b>employee</b> by choosing an applicant from the higher-educated rather than the lower-educated group.

Using a sparse simulation model, we have replicated much of the behavior seen in the industrial world in which machine tool companies operate. This model has allowed us to test and confirm many of our hypotheses. Two results stand out. Even though machine tool builders can do little to reduce their production volatility through choice of forecast rule, a longer view of the future leads companies to retain more of their skilled workforce.

40|$|This study investigates {{turnover}} intentions {{across three}} different skill levels of New Zealand employees: low-skilled (Study 1), semi-skilled (Study 2), and skilled (Study 3) using both {{quantitative and qualitative}} methods. Specifically, this study first compares job autonomy, supervisor support, and work-life balance towards job satisfaction and turnover intentions and then ultimately, tests a two mediator model in which firstly, work-life balance and then job satisfaction act as the mediators towards turnover intentions. These mediator effects were confirmed by Monte Carlo analysis. Overall, there is strong support across the studies that work-life balance predicts job satisfaction, which in turn predicts turnover intentions. Towards the antecedents, there is uniformity between low-skilled and <b>skilled</b> <b>employee</b> samples, with supervisor support predicting work-life balance and job autonomy predicting both work-life balance and job satisfaction. Finally, this study uses qualitative interviews (Study 4) to add depth to the quantitative results and explore any additional emerging themes, while also providing a personal narrative to the turnover literature, which is often missing. The interviews generally reinforced the quantitative findings although additional themes were found, and two mini-cases were explored regarding actual turnover.

Member checking and methodological triangulation increased the trustworthiness of interpretations. Five themes emerged from the data analysis: work environment, effective communication, education and training, promotion opportunities, and policies and procedures.

40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a qualitative study that sought to gain insight into the process of college enrollment among African American females from low-income communities. A comparative case study approach was used to examine the life histories and social relationships of five African American young women who enrolled in college and two who did not. The findings indicate that their ability to enroll in college appeared to be connected to a pattern of perceptions regarding self, their family inter-active patterns, and their connectedness to others. Social factors such as poverty, inadequate educational institutions, and multiple systems of oppression that are traditionally viewed as risk factors were viewed by the youngwomen of this study as being inconsequential in regards to their abil-ity to enroll in college. Although the gains of African American women are encouraging, African American women still make up a disproportionate number of the poor and continue to be overrepresented at the low-wage end of the employment structure (Morris, 1993). In this technological age, a college education becomes increasingly significant in terms of upwardmobility for low-incomeAfricanAmericanwomen. Yet, in 1993, African American women made up only 6. 5 % of the total fall enrollment in undergraduate programs in this country, com-pared to 41. 8 % of White women (Digest of Education Statistics, 1995).
