5|$|Currently, {{solid-phase}} oligonucleotide synthesis {{is carried}} out automatically using computer-controlled instruments (oligonucleotide synthesizers) and is technically implemented in column, multi-well plate, and array formats. The column format is best suited for research and large scale applications where a high-throughput is not required. Multi-well plate format is designed specifically for high-throughput synthesis on <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> to satisfy the growing demand of industry and academia for synthetic oligonucleotides. A number of oligonucleotide synthesizers for <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> synthesis and medium to large scale synthesis are available commercially.|$|E
5|$|DAB radio {{stations}} in the United Kingdom are broadcast {{on a number of}} frequency blocks on VHF Band III. The original plan devised in Wiesbaden for the framework of DAB in Europe was to allocate frequency blocks 11B to 12D for UK DAB broadcasting. However, as part of its Review of Radio, Ofcom has expanded the frequency allocations for DAB and has advertised local and a national ensemble licence on blocks outside the original Wiesbaden plan on 10B to 10D and 11A. Block 5A has also been reserved for the launch of local ensembles. In 2015, additional blocks were opened up for <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> DAB trials for an initial period of nine months. Ofcom reitreated the use of a number of frequency blocks between 7D and 9C for any future roll-out of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> DAB multiplexes in its final report regarding the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> DAB multiplexes published in September 2016.|$|E

5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very <b>small</b> <b>scale.</b> Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution.

5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The solid support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the solid support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on <b>small</b> <b>scale.</b> At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
