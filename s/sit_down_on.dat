5|$|In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison {{utilized}} keyboard clusters {{in several}} {{works such as}} his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At least {{as far back as}} 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant Jésus (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstück X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his Klavierstück XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the keyboard. George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.|$|E

Neal then opens up to Emma about his past, and about home, telling her {{it is a place}} that you cannot shake, and that you just miss.|$|E
25|$|Útgarða-Loki {{says that}} no {{visitors}} {{are allowed to}} stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing {{in the rear of}} the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. Útgarða-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of Logi to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, Þjálfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.|$|E

500|$|Cotto lost to Saul [...] "Canelo" [...] Álvarez on November 21, 2015 via {{unanimous}} decision. The {{fight was}} close throughout as both boxers were cautious in their attacks, neither fighter was seriously hurt. As Cotto attacked with a jab the whole fight, and didn't <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his punches, instead deciding to employ movement. Álvarez responded with power punches, landing {{especially to the}} body. Both fighters showed iron chins, with Cotto repeatedly coming back after hard shots to the head. The scorecards {{at the end of}} the night were highly controversial as they did not show the competitiveness of the fight, with many boxing pundits having Álvarez winning by a round or two, others called it a draw. The official judges scorecards read 119-109, 118-110 and 117-111 in favor Álvarez. ESPN.com had the fight much closer, but still scored it in favour of Álvarez at 115-113.|$|E
500|$|An infamous {{incident}} occurred in Australia's second innings. As Australia were 247 runs {{behind on the}} first innings and forced to follow on, they played for a draw and Brown and Fingleton batted slowly in the second innings. Sections of the crowd heckled his slow batting by using a slow hand clap. Bradman then sent Mervyn Waite out to deliver orders to the openers that they should back away from their positions and hold up proceedings until the barracking stopped. Fingleton {{said that he was}} not perturbed by the crowd but obeyed; umpire Frank Chester and England captain Wally Hammond had no issues with this. At one point, Fingleton theatrically decided to take off his gloves, put down his bat and <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the pitch and refusing to resume before the gallery quietened, but this only caused a huge uproar. Wisden later criticised him, saying that he lost [...] "all true sense of the situation...an extraordinary action {{on the part of a}} cricket in a Test match." [...] They regarded the gesture as disrespectful as a majority of the spectators had not heckled him.|$|E
