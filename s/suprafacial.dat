If the migrating group remains on the same face of the π system, the shift is known as <b>suprafacial,</b> while if the migrating group transfers to the opposite face is called an antarafacial shift, which are impossible for transformations that occur within small- or medium-sized rings.|$|E
25|$|The Claisen {{rearrangement}} is an exothermic, concerted (bond cleavage and recombination) pericyclic reaction. Woodward–Hoffmann rules show a <b>suprafacial,</b> stereospecific reaction pathway. The kinetics are of {{the first}} order and the whole transformation proceeds through a highly ordered cyclic transition state and is intramolecular.

500|$|Thermal alkyl [...] shifts, {{similar to}} [...] hydride shifts, must proceed antarafacially. Here the {{geometry}} of the transition state is prohibitive, but an alkyl group, {{due to the nature}} of its orbitals, can invert its geometry, form a new bond with the back lobe of its sp3 orbital, and therefore proceed via a <b>suprafacial</b> shift. These reactions are still not common in open chain systems because of the highly ordered nature of the transition state, which is more readily achieved in cyclic molecules.|$|E

50|$|The {{reaction}} can {{be modeled}} using a closed, boat-like transition state, with all bonds {{being in the}} process of forming or breaking at some given point, and therefore must obey the Woodward-Hoffman general selection rules. This means that for a three component, six electron system, all components must interact in a <b>suprafacial</b> manner (or one <b>suprafacial</b> and two antarfacial). With all components being <b>suprafacial,</b> the allowed transition state is boat-like; a chair-like transition state would result in three two-electron antarafacial components. The chair-like case is thermally disallowed by the Woodward-Hoffman rules.|$|E
50|$|Using {{correlation}} diagrams one can derive selection {{rules for}} the following generalized classes of pericyclic reactions. Each of these particular classes is further generalized in the generalized Woodward-Hoffmann rules. The more inclusive bond topology descriptors antarafacial and <b>suprafacial</b> subsume the terms conrotatory and disrotatory, respectively. Antarafacial refers to bond making or breaking through the opposite face of a π system, p orbital, or σ bond, while <b>suprafacial</b> refers to the process occurring through the same face. A <b>suprafacial</b> transformation at a chiral center preserves stereochemistry, whereas an antarafacial transformation reverses stereochemistry.|$|E

Thus a disrotatory mechanism is symmetry-allowed.|$|E
50|$|An {{example is}} the 1,3-hydride shift, in which the {{interacting}} frontier orbitals are the allyl free radical and the hydrogen 1s orbitals. The <b>suprafacial</b> shift is symmetry-forbidden because orbitals with opposite algebraic signs overlap. The symmetry allowed antarafacial shift would require a strained transition state and is also unlikely. In contrast a symmetry allowed and <b>suprafacial</b> 1,5-hydride shift is a common event.|$|E
50|$|Many sigmatropic {{reactions}} and cycloadditions {{can be either}} <b>suprafacial</b> or antarafacial, and this determines the stereochemistry.|$|E
50|$|A 4n {{electron}} electrocyclic {{ring opening}} reaction {{can be considered}} to have 2 components - the π-system and the breaking σ-bond. With respect to the π-system, the reaction is <b>suprafacial.</b> However, with a conrotatory mechanism, {{as shown in the}} figure above, the reaction is antarafacial with respect to the σ-bond. Conversely with a disrotatory mechanism it is <b>suprafacial</b> with respect to the breaking σ-bond.|$|E
50|$|A sigmatropic {{rearrangement}} is {{a reaction}} {{in which a}} sigma bond moves across a conjugated pi system with a concomitant shift in the pi bonds. The shift in the sigma bond may be antarafacial or <b>suprafacial.</b> In {{the example of a}} 1,5 shift in pentadiene, if there is a <b>suprafacial</b> shift, there is 6 e− moving suprafacially and none moving antarafacially, implying this reaction is allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. For an antarafacial shift, the reaction is not allowed.|$|E

50|$|The {{first thing}} to note {{is that in the}} Generalized Woodward-Hoffmann rules, {{everything}} is characterized in terms of antarafacial and <b>suprafacial</b> bond topologies. A conrotatory reaction mechanism corresponds to an antarafacial bond topology as illustrated in the adjacent diagram. The p-orbital lobes that make contact in the forming σ-bond are from opposite sides of the π-system. Conversely, a disrotatory mechanism corresponds to a <b>suprafacial</b> bond topology as the forming σ-bond is between p-orbital lobes {{on the same side of}} the π-system.|$|E
50|$|The Ireland-Claisen {{rearrangement}} {{is a type}} of Claisen rearrangement. The {{mechanism is}} therefore a concerted 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangement which according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules show a concerted, <b>suprafacial,</b> pericyclic reaction pathway.|$|E

50|$|There are 4 {{possible}} {{mechanisms for}} the 2+2 cycloaddition: π2s+π2s, π2a+π2s, π2s+π2a, π2a+π2a. However, in reality, the only reaction that, in general, can proceed due to geometric constraints is <b>suprafacial</b> {{with respect to}} both components.|$|E
50|$|If {{the total}} number of {{electrons}} is 4n+2, then one is in the bottom row of the table. The reaction is thermally allowed if it is <b>suprafacial</b> with respect to both components or antarafacial with respect to both components. That is to say the number of antarafacial components is even (it is 0 or 2). Similarly if {{the total number}} of electrons is 4n, then one is in the top row of the table. This is thermally allowed if it is <b>suprafacial</b> with respect to one component and antarafacial with respect to the other. Thus {{the total number of}} antarafacial components is always odd as it is always 1.|$|E

50|$|Antarafacial and <b>suprafacial</b> are two topological {{concepts}} in organic chemistry describing {{the relationship between}} two simultaneous chemical bond making and/or bond breaking processes in or around a reaction center.

5000|$|A 1,j-sigmatropic {{rearrangement}} {{is also a}} two component pericyclic reaction: {{one component}} is the π-system, the other component is the migrating group. The simplest case is a 1,j-hydride shift across a π-system where j is odd. In this case, as the hydrogen has only a spherically symmetric s orbital, the reaction must be <b>suprafacial</b> {{with respect to the}} hydrogen. The total number of electrons involved is (j+1) as there are (j-1)/2 π-bond plus the σ bond involved in the reaction. If j = 4n − 1 then it must be antarafacial, and if j=4n+1, then it must be <b>suprafacial.</b> [...] This agrees with experiment that 1,3-hydride shifts are generally not observed as the symmetry-allowed antarafacial process is not feasible, but 1,5-hydride shifts are quite facile.|$|E

5000|$|The Woodward-Hoffmann rules {{can also}} explain bimolecular cycloaddition {{reactions}} through correlation diagrams.

50|$|Conjugated {{azomethine}} ylides {{are capable}} of 1,5- and 1,7-electrocyclizations. An example of a 1,7-electrocyclization of a diphenylethenyl-substituted azomethine ylide is shown below.

5000|$|To {{explain why}} the {{reaction}} happens suprafacially, first notice that the terminal orbitals {{are in the same}} phase.

50|$|The {{discussion}} {{on whether the}} vinylcyclopropane rearrangement proceeds via a fully concerted or a two-step, non-concerted mechanism was given further careful consideration when Woodward and Hoffmann used the vinylcyclopropane rearrangement to exemplify 1,3-sigmatropic concerted alkyl shifts in 1969. They hypothesized that if a concerted mechanism was operative the consequences of orbital-symmetry controlled factors would only allow the formation of certain products. According to their analysis of a vinylcyclopropane substituted with three R groups the antarafacial 1,3-shift of bond 1,2 to C-5, with retention at C-2, leading to the ar cyclopentene and the <b>suprafacial</b> 1,3-shift of bond 1,2 to C-5, with inversion at C-2, leading to cyclopentene si are symmetry allowed whereas the <b>suprafacial</b> 1,3-shift of bond 1,2 to C-5, with retention at C-2, leading to cyclopentene sr and the antarafacial 1,3-shift of bond 1,2 to C-5, with inversion at C-2, leading to the ai cyclopentene are symmetry-forbidden.
