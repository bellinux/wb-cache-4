Moreover, if the quotient three-manifold is an integral homology sphere, then we may assume that L is orbitally separated. This paper studies the behavior of the coefficients of the Conway polynomial of such a link. Namely, we prove that if L is a strongly p-periodic orbitally <b>separated</b> <b>link</b> and p is an odd prime, then the coefficient a 2 i(L) is congruent to zero modulo p for all i such that 2 i < p − 1.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a brief {{description}} of Hyper-G - the first second generation hypermedia system - is given. The first section identifies some problems with first generation hypermedia systems. The following sections are an outline of the new concepts that are implemented in Hyper-G. These new concepts such as a world-wide distributed network database, a <b>separated</b> <b>link</b> database and bidirectional links allow highly sophisticated navigation, hyperlinks in all native document types such as hypertext, images, PostScript documents and even in movies, sound and 3 D scenes. Hyper-G also implements very powerful search mechanisms such as boolean search on titles, keywords, even fulltext with user defined scope from one collection on one server to all servers worldwide. And last but not least Hyper-G is fully compatible to first generation systems like Gopher and WWW. 1 Introduction Currently, the most popular Internet information systems use distributed menus and searching (Gopher, see [Alberti et [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Link {{dimensioning}} and routing {{problems in}} resilient network design are considered. Reliable network operation is ensured {{by means of}} flow restoration which is performed on preselected protection (backup) paths that can absorb traffic overflows from failed primary paths. Backup and primary flows use <b>separated</b> <b>link</b> capacities, and can be split among many paths. In the paper, two restoration models are considered. The first model assumes that once the backup path is assigned it must be used in every state in which the protected primary path fails while the second model allows different protection paths {{to be used in}} different network failure states. The problems are formulated as multiple commodity linear programming (LP) models using the link-path (L-P) notation and solved by the column generation technique. Consequent pricing models and algorithms are introduced. Computational efficiency of the presented approaches is analyzed.

With the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) {{and the concept}} of adequate yearly progress, measuring growth across years is becoming more important. In vertical scaling where two tests have different difficulty levels and are given to different grade level students and there may be construct shift between grades, the IRT assumption of unidimensionality would appear implausible. There are a few studies comparing separate Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) linking methods, however, none of them have compared concurrent calibration and <b>separate</b> MIRT <b>linking.</b> The purpose of this simulation research is to compare the performance of concurrent calibration and four <b>separate</b> <b>linking</b> methods. Based on the results from the studies of Unidimensional IRT (UIRT) concurrent and separate estimation methods, it was predicted that, in MIRT linking, concurrent linking would perform better than <b>separate</b> <b>linking</b> methods when groups are equivalent. As in the unidimensional IRT situation, separate estimation was expected to perform better than concurrent calibration with the nonequivalent groups design. Independent variables were; sample size, test length, group equivalence, correlation between the two ability dimensions, and five estimation methods of MIRT linking (concurrent calibration, the test characteristic function (TCF), the item characteristic function (ICF), the direct method, and Min's methods). RMSE and bias were applied as the indices of linking quality. The {{results of this study suggest}} that concurrent calibration generally performs better than <b>separate</b> <b>linking</b> methods even when groups were non-equivalent with 0. 5 standard deviation difference between group means and the correlation among ability dimensions was high. Concurrent calibration benefited more from a larger sample size than did <b>separate</b> <b>linking</b> methods with respect to all item parameters, especially with a shorter test form. Among <b>separate</b> <b>linking</b> methods, the ICF method tended to perform better than other <b>separate</b> <b>linking</b> methods when groups were non-equivalent, while Min's method did not perform as well as other methods. With equivalent groups, all <b>separate</b> <b>linking</b> methods performed similarly. A discussion of the limitations of the study and possibilities for future research is included...|$|R

40|$|For {{some time}} now, {{designers}} of hypermedia systems have recognised {{the need to}} move away from closed systems to open environments which <b>separate</b> the <b>link</b> structure from the data in the system, and enable <b>separate</b> <b>link</b> and data processing. The main motivations behind this development are the need to reduce authoring effort in large-scale hypermedia applications and to make them more easily modifiable, customisable and extensible. Microcosm is one such open hypermedia system which has been developed at the University of Southampton. At the heart of Microcosm is the Link Service, which allows links maintained by the system to be applied to information native to third-party applications in the host environment.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} how linking {{mechanisms}} {{contribute to the}} expressiveness of hypertext systems. For this purpose, we formalise hypertext systems as abstract machines. As the primary benefit of hypertext systems {{is to be able}} to read documents non-linearly, their expressiveness is defined in terms of the ability to follow links. Then, we classify hypertext systems according to the power of the underlying automaton. The model allow us to compare embedded vs <b>separate</b> <b>links</b> and simple vs generic links. Then, we investigate history mechanisms, adaptive hypertexts, and functional links. Our conclusion is that simple links, whether embbeded or <b>separate,</b> generic <b>links,</b> and some adaptive links all give hypertext systems the power of finite state automata. The history mechanism confers them the power of pushdown automata, whereas the gener al functional links give them Turing completeness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} the {{capacity}} of the diamond channel. We focus on the special case where the channel between the source node and the two relay nodes are two <b>separate</b> <b>links</b> of finite capacity and the link from the two relay nodes to the destination node is a Gaussian multiple access channel. We call this model the Gaussian multiple access diamond channel. We first propose an upper bound on the capacity. This upper bound is a single-letterization of the n-letter upper bound proposed by Traskov and Kramer, which is tighter than the cut-set bound. Next, we provide a lower bound based on sending correlated codes through the multiple access channel. Since the upper and lower bounds take on similar forms, it is expected that they coincide for certain channel parameters. To show this, we further focus on the symmetric case where the <b>separate</b> <b>links</b> to the relays are of the same capacity and the power constraints of the two relays are the same. For the symmetric case, we give necessary and sufficient conditions that the upper and lower bounds meet. Thus, for a Gaussian multiple access diamond channel that satisfies these conditions, we have found its capacity. I...|$|R

40|$|Should one {{calculate}} user {{benefits from}} changes in door-to-door journeys or from {{changes in the}} use of <b>separate</b> <b>links</b> of the network? Quite often, the second approach is deemed wrong, as consumers are supposed to demand journeys, not parts of journeys. However, we show that for a quite general economic model and under fairly general assumptions regarding the network, both approaches are equivalent. The cost-benefit analysis practitioner can exploit this result. The links approach reveals on what part of the networks user benefits and/or losses are generated. This additional piece of information might help to optimize the project design. ...|$|R
40|$|Should one {{calculate}} user {{benefits from}} changes in door-to-door journeys or from {{changes in the}} use of <b>separate</b> <b>links</b> of the network? The second approach is often discarded for its perceived inability to deal with new links and the OD-matrix approach is favoured. Differences arise when the set of used routes changes. A consumer model containing a general static transportation network with explicit non-negativity constraints serves as a basis for welfare measures expressed in shadow prices. The approximation error when applying the link approach need not be too severe. A rehabilitation of the link approach may be in order. ...|$|R
