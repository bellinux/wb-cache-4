5|$|The party's ski boots, {{specially}} designed by Amundsen, were {{the product of}} two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of <b>sealskin</b> from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after {{the style of the}} Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{remarkable}} fact that, {{in spite of the}} many voyages from Sydney Cove, Hobart Town, and Port Dalrymple to procure <b>sealskins</b> and sea-elephant oil, the only sources of information as to the incidents of these expeditions have been short reports in colonial newspapers and in official communications from Sydney to the Home Government. An old log bound in kangaroo skin and kept in the well-known hand-writing' of Captain James Kelly,describes the proceedings of two voyages; first, that of the 'Brothers,' which is described hereafter, and secondly that of the 'Mary and Sally' to Macquarie Island to take sea-elephant oil and <b>sealskins...</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{had been}} {{supplied}} {{with a long}} lance {{and a couple of}} spears, to which latter were attached, by thongs of walrus hide, two inflated <b>sealskins</b> to act as buoys. These Leo had been previously instructed how to use.|$|R
25|$|Wrist-length mittens {{used to be}} {{commonly}} made of seal or caribou {{skin with}} the fur and the rough edge of the seam on the outside. <b>Sealskin</b> mittens were frequently made from leftover pieces of skin after boots were cut from them. The back and palm were separate pieces and the thumb one piece; gloves were unknown. Women wore fur mittens reaching nearly to the elbow with wolverine trim along the upper edge. Mittens of silver salmon skins which reached to the elbow were worn by men when hunting in a kayak in spring. The fish were cut down the back and the belly skins used for mittens. These sometimes were lined with grass or had grass mittens, woven all in one piece, inside; often they had a border of bleached <b>sealskin.</b> The combination of fish skin mittens with grass padding was less bulky for paddling than fur mittens. According to Curtis (1930, p.11), mittens of dehaired <b>sealskin</b> that reached barely to the wrist were also worn by men in the spring.|$|E
25|$|Glove (aasgaaq, aisgaaq , aigsaaq, aigyaaq, aiggsak , aggsak , aaggsak, aaggsaq, yuaralek in Yup'ik, agyaaq, aiygaaq in Cup'ik, asgar in Cup'ig) {{were usually}} {{made out of}} caribou or <b>sealskin,</b> {{sometimes}} made out of fish skin (especially Pacific salmon) or dried grass. Decorated ceremonial fancy glove is aiggaqtaaq or aaggaqtaaq.|$|E
25|$|Coarse {{seashore}} {{grass or}} coarse grass, dune grass, beach grass Leymus mollis subsp. mollis (taperrnaq sg taperrnak dual taperrnat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, taperrnar in Cup'ig) Yup’ik {{people use the}} leaves extensively to make mittens, socks, mats, and baskets. In former times, men wore grass socks and folded grass insoles inside their water boots; in cold weather <b>sealskin</b> socks were worn. Coarse grass, gathered in October, was used for insoles.|$|E

50|$|The name ‘Robbery Beach’ {{was used}} by James Weddell in 1820-23. It arose from the English robbery of <b>sealskins</b> {{collected}} by the American brig Charity (Capt. Charles H. Barnard) of New York in January 1821. There was fierce competition between British and American sealers in the area during the early 1820s.|$|R
25|$|Mitten (aliiman, aliuman, aritvak, kauman in Yup'ik, aritvag in Cup'ig). Child's mitten of {{any sort}} is aritvacuar or aritvacuarar (in Cup'ig). Long {{waterproof}} dehaired <b>sealskin</b> or fish-skin (salmon-skin) mitten is (arilluk sg arilluuk dual arilluut pl, arin in Yup'ik, arillugar in Cup'ig). Fish skin mittens with grass liners used for kayak travel during spring in bad weather. Man's short skin mitten used when going on a kayak trip is arikarer (in Cup'ig).|$|E
25|$|Children's {{clothing}} (mikelnguut aturait) {{was made}} of soft skin of younger animals. Reindeer fawn and dog puppy skin parkas, with the fur inside, were made for babies (irniaq) and small children (mikelnguq). Puppies one and two months old were killed for the purpose. Fawn and puppy skins were turned inside out, scraped, hung out to dry, and then put away. When needed the skins were taken from storage, rubbed between the hands with a rotary motion, and chewed as necessary to soften and loosen tissue that had not previously been removed. For a <b>sealskin</b> parka, one skin was required for a three-year-old, two for a five- or six-year-old, and three for a child of 10 or 12 years. A small child's <b>sealskin</b> parka was often decorated with tassels of the same material stitched to the upper center of the back. A baby's boots were always made with the fur inside but otherwise were similar in construction to adult boots. In former times, babies wore long boots and no pants. When a child was toilet trained, pants separate from boots were put on a boy, while girls were given trouser-boots like those worn by women.|$|E
25|$|Cotton is the {{material}} of the banknotes in the United States. Leather banknotes (or coins) were issued {{in a number of}} sieges, as well as in other times of emergency. During the Russian administration of Alaska, banknotes were printed on <b>sealskin.</b> A number of 19th century issues are known in Germanic and Baltic states, including the places of Dorpat, Pernau, Reval, Werro and Woiseck. In addition to the Bielefeld issues, other German leather Notgeld from 1923 is known from Borna, Osterwieck, Paderborn and Pößneck.|$|E
50|$|Cape Sheffield is a cape {{forming the}} {{northwest}} extremity of Rugged Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. It {{was named for}} Captain James P. Sheffield, Master of the brig Hersilia of Stonington, Connecticut, in 1819-20 and 1820-21, the first American sealer known to have visited the South Shetland Islands. In 1819-20 he took 8,868 <b>sealskins</b> from headquarters at Rugged Island.|$|R

60|$|Even {{the waiting}} at the {{junction}} had its charms, for it was enlivened by a supplementary breakfast on rolls and milk! and at a few minutes past eleven the train was drawing up at Rockstone, and Aunt Jane, <b>sealskins</b> and all, was beckoning from the platform, hurrying after the carriage as it swept past, and holding {{out a hand to}} jump the party from the door.|$|R
25|$|Although a furbearer, the wildcat's skin is {{of little}} {{commercial}} value, due to the unattractive colour of its natural state, and the difficulties present in dyeing it. In the former Soviet Union, the fur of a forest wildcat usually fetched 50 kopecks, while that of a steppe wildcat fetched 60 kopecks. Wildcat skin is almost solely used for making cheap scarfs, muffs, and women's coats. It is sometimes converted into imitation <b>sealskin.</b> As a rule, wildcat fur is difficult to dye in dark brown or black, and {{has a tendency to}} turn green when the dye is not well settled into the hair. When dye is overly applied, wildcat fur is highly susceptible to singeing.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} clothing system {{developed and}} used by the Eskimo peoples {{is the most effective}} cold weather clothing developed to date. Yup'ik women made clothes and footwear from animal skins (especially hide and fur of marine and land mammals for fur clothing, sometimes birds, also fish), sewn together using needles made from animal bones, walrus ivory, and bird bones such as front part of a crane's foot and threads made from other animal products, such as sinew. The multi-functional ulu (semilunar woman's knife) is used to process and cut skins for clothing and footwear. Women made most clothing of caribou (wild caribou Rangifer tarandus granti and domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus tarandus) and <b>sealskin.</b> Yup’ik clothing tended to fit relatively loosely.|$|E
25|$|In Norway in 2004, only Rieber {{worked with}} <b>sealskin</b> and seal oil. In 2001, the biggest {{producer}} of raw seal oil was Canada (two {{percent of the}} raw oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores). Rieber had the majority of all distribution of raw seal oil in the world market, {{but there was no}} demand for seal oil. From 1995 to 2005, Rieber annually received between 2 and 3 million Norwegian krone in subsidy. A 2003–2004 parliamentary report says CG Rieber Skinn is the only company in the world that delivers skin from bluebacks. Most of the skins processed by Rieber have been imported from abroad, mainly from Canada. Only a small portion is from the Norwegian hunt. Of the processed skin, five percent is sold in Norway; the rest is exported to the Russian and Asian markets.|$|E
60|$|It was {{astonishing}} {{the work}} required, under such circumstances, to supply one's simple needs {{of food and}} shelter. Indeed, I was rarely idle, that first year. The hut, itself a mere lair of rocks, nevertheless took six weeks of my time. The tardy curing and the endless scraping of the <b>sealskins,</b> {{so as to make}} them soft and pliable for garments, occupied my spare moments for months and months.|$|R
5000|$|Dyer showed great {{business}} acumen, and {{was considered}} a very rich and respected man in the Overberg. Alexander Johnstone Jardine (1790-1845), the Cape Town librarian, interviewed Dyer during 1824 and wrote: [...] "Samson Dyer is a most extraordinary man of uncommon industry, honesty and sobriety." [...] The previously unnamed island has since been known as Dyer Island or Dyers Island, and in the 1830s was noted for its <b>sealskins,</b> seal oil, penguin eggs and guano.|$|R

After her father's murder, Kenojuak moved with her widowed mother Silaqqi {{and the rest of the}} family to the home of Silaqqi's mother, Koweesa, who taught her traditional crafts, including the repair of <b>sealskins</b> for trade with the Hudson's Bay Company and how to make waterproof clothes sewn with caribou sinew.|$|R
25|$|The {{traditional}} clothing system {{developed and}} used by the Eskimo peoples {{is the most effective}} cold weather clothing developed to date. Yup’ik clothing tended to fit relatively loosely. Skin sewing is artistic arena in which Yup'ik women and a few younger men excel.

Before the arrival of the Russian fur traders (promyshlennikis), caribou and beaver skins were used for traditional clothing but subsequently, the Eskimos were persuaded to sell most furs and substitute manufactured materials. Everyday functional items like skin mittens, mukluks, and jackets are commonly made today, but the elegant fancy parkas (atkupiaq) of traditional times are now rare. Today, many Yup'ik have adopted western-style clothing.|$|E

The center often hosts {{traveling}} theatre troupes, as well as concerts, from classical to folk music. The Sisimiut Culture Day on 21 November is also celebrated at Taseralik. Greenlandic handicrafts, created in a workshop located in an old warehouse on the old harbor, are sold in the Greenland Travel Incoming's Arts n' Craft, and in several small shops along the main street. Greenland stones and <b>sealskin</b> products are created in the Natseq and Panigiit workshops.|$|E
500|$|Potter {{probably}} modelled the American {{black bear}} on a specimen in the London Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park. She {{wrote in her}} manuscript in reference to her drawing of the bear: [...] "Intended to represent the American black bear, it has a smooth coat, like a <b>sealskin</b> coat." [...] Kutzer suggests the bear in Potter's two illustrations of the animal would theoretically be recognized by American children, but the depiction of the bear is almost as stiff and unnatural as Potter's depictions of humans in her other books. The bear lacks any of the species' [...] "clumsy gracefulness", she argues, which Potter could only have realized after seeing bears in the wild [...] an opportunity that simply did not exist for her in England. The inclusion of an American black bear-looking creature in the tale and its depiction in the illustrations only emphasize Potter's awkward struggle with subject matter she had not directly observed in nature or of which she had little knowledge.|$|E
50|$|Santa Anna reached Sydney from Norfolk Island on 6 June, {{and left}} for the Bounty Islands on 15 October 1808. There she picked up 8000 <b>sealskins</b> and the 11 {{survivors}} of the shore party that she had left.

5000|$|In 1840, a {{government}} commission investigating the Greenland trade {{issued a report}} proposing that the KGH be operated on a non-profit basis, reïnvesting any surplus towards benefiting the native Greenlanders; this was accepted, although the company reserved the right to interest on the government's investment into Greenland. The prices paid for native goods [...] principally <b>sealskins</b> and whale blubber [...] were raised and expenditures on education (two teacher training colleges and scholarships for study in Denmark) and health care (an additional doctor) increased.|$|R
2500|$|Trouser-boots (allirtet pl [...] in Yup'ik) is {{pants with}} {{attached}} socks made of fur. Women wore trouser-boots, each one {{made from a}} single small harbor seal skin with the seam running {{down the front of}} the leg. Each boot, longer on the outer (hip) side, was tied to the belt. Very short trousers made from a single small <b>sealskin</b> were also worn. A man's <b>sealskin</b> pants required two skins, and was not hemmed at the bottom. At the top the skin was turned under and stitched. Braided sinew was run through the hem to serve as a belt. Narrow strips of <b>sealskin</b> were sewn on a man's pants at the waist in front and in the seam of a woman's trouser-boots as fringe or tassel decoration.|$|E

In the past, Yup'ik people relied on seals primarily for their meat, oil, and skin. The hide and sinew were commonly used as clothing, rope, nets, and for sewing. <b>Sealskin</b> could be used to make strands for rope and were used to make maklak skin boots. Intestines (guts) were used to make waterproof parkas. And even the fur of an unborn pup was used as a favorite trimming for clothing.|$|E
60|$|Toolooha's cooking-lamp {{was made}} of soapstone, formed like a clam-shell, and about eight inches in diameter; the fuel was seal-oil, and the wick was of moss.
