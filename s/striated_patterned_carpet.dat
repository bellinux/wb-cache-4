40|$|We {{present a}} model for the {{spontaneous}} formation of a <b>striated</b> <b>pattern</b> in polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough it is {{well known}} that insulin {{controls}} the synthesis of glycogen from non-carbohydrates by down-regulating expression of several glyconeogenic enzymes, a mechanism of short-term inhibition of glyconeogenesis remains unknown. In recent years, we have shown that in skeletal muscle, fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a part of the hypothetical glyconeogenic complex located on sarcomeric Z-line. Here, we show that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 causes disruption of the FBPase–Z-line interactions and reduction of muscle glycogen content in vivo. The normal, <b>striated</b> <b>pattern</b> of muscle FBPase localization is also disturbed by insulin treatment but preserved when insulin is applied together with Akt inhibitor. We suggest that destabilization of FBPase–Z-line interaction is a universal cellular mechanism of glyconeogenesis down-regulation, allowing for preferential utilization of glucose for insulin-stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{characterizing the}} {{three-dimensional}} organization of liquid crystals composed of collagen, {{in order to}} determine the physico-chemical conditions leading to highly organized structures found in biological tissues such as cornea. To that end, we use second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy, since aligned collagen structures have been shown to exhibit intrinsic SHG signals. We combine polarization-resolved SHG experiments (P-SHG) with the theoretical derivation of the SHG signal of collagen molecules tilted with respect to the focal plane. Our P-SHG images exhibit <b>striated</b> <b>patterns</b> with variable contrast, as expected from our analytical and numerical calculations for plywood-like nematic structures similar to the ones found in the cornea. This study demonstrates the benefits of P-SHG microscopy for in situ characterization of highly organized biopolymers at micrometer scale, and the unique sensitivity of this nonlinear optical technique to the orientation of collagen molecules...|$|R
40|$|Actin {{filament}} {{assembly in}} nonmuscle cells is {{regulated by the}} actin polymerization machinery, including the Arp 2 / 3 complex and formins. However, {{little is known about}} the regulation of actin assembly in muscle cells, where straight actin filaments are organized into the contractile unit sarcomere. Here, we show that Fhod 3, a myocardial formin that localizes to thin actin filaments in a <b>striated</b> <b>pattern,</b> regulates sarcomere organization in cardiomyocytes. RNA interference-mediated depletion of Fhod 3 results in a marked reduction in filamentous actin and disruption of the sarcomeric structure. These defects are rescued by expression of wild-type Fhod 3 but not by that of mutant proteins carrying amino acid substitution for conserved residues for actin assembly. These findings suggest that actin dynamics regulated by Fhod 3 are critical for sarcomere organization in striated muscle cells...|$|R
50|$|Myotilin is a {{structural}} protein that, along with titin and alpha-actinin give structural integrity to sarcomeres at Z-discs in striated muscle. Myotilin induces {{the formation of}} actin bundles in vitro and in non-muscle cells. A ternary complex myotilin/actin/alpha-actinin {{can be observed in}} vitro and actin bundles formed under these conditions appear more tightly packed than those induced by alpha-actinin alone. It was demonstrated that myotilin stabilizes F-actin by slowing down the disassembly rate. Ectopic overexpression of truncated myotilin causes the disruption of nascent myofibrils and the co-accumulation of myotilin and titin in amorphous cytoplasmic precipitates. In mature sarcomeres, wild-type myotilin colocalizes with alpha-actinin and Z-disc titin, showing the <b>striated</b> <b>pattern</b> typical of sarcomeric proteins. Targeted disruption of the myotilin gene in mice does not cause significant alterations in muscle function. On the other hand, transgenic mice with mutated myotilin develop muscle dystrophy.|$|R
5000|$|PMEL is a 100 kDa type I transmembrane {{glycoprotein}} that {{is expressed}} primarily in pigment {{cells of the}} skin and eye. The transmembrane form of PMEL is modified in the secretory pathway by elaboration of N-linked oligosaccharides and addition and modification of O-linked oligosaccharides. It is then targeted to precursors of the pigment organelle, the melanosome, where it is proteolytically processed to several small fragments. Some of these fragments form non-pathological amyloid that assemble into sheets and form the <b>striated</b> <b>pattern</b> that underlies melanosomal ultrastructure. PMEL cleavage is mediated by several proteases including a proprotein convertase of the furin family, a [...] "sheddase" [...] that might include members of the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family, and additional proteases in melanosomes or their precursors. After the amyloidogenic region is cleaved, the small remaining integral membrane fragment is digested by γ-secretase.|$|R
