60|$|I had <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> note. He stopped sidling. His {{clutching}} hand {{fell to his}} side.|$|R
60|$|I had <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> note. There was a hush of pleased {{anticipation}} {{among the}} audience.|$|R
60|$|He had <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> {{note with}} his easy humor; but Harding saw that Mowbray was not pleased.|$|R
60|$|He <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> note, for Osborn was not {{clever and}} perhaps his strongest {{characteristic}} was his exaggerated family pride.|$|R
60|$|Agatha {{said she}} was not {{excessively}} tired. She liked his matter-of-fact manner and thought he had <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> note.|$|R
60|$|He had <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> note again. Anything of {{the nature}} of a {{confession}} or appeal for sympathy seldom failed to stir her.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy had <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> note. His father's eyes {{began to}} gleam with excitement. The {{scent of the}} footlights seemed to dilate his nostrils.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's primitive; our {{thoughts}} run in another groove. But I daresay there's something archaic about Quebec French and you perhaps know the latter. Have I <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> note?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{find you}} have <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place," [...] he said. [...] "Now I {{wonder if you}} could fix a pin or {{something}} in this button shank. It's coming off, you see." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold's heart warmed suddenly. Without {{knowing it}} {{the father had}} again <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> note to win his son. [...] "That's right," [...] the boy said, [...] "don't let 'em tramp on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellent! {{you have}} hit it exactly," [...] said Grace; [...] "exactly <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportion</b> of seeds. I was hurrying," [...] she added, [...] "to get these flowers in water, because {{a letter from}} John is waiting to be read." ...|$|R
5000|$|Binder: Water-soluble binders such as [...] "makko" [...] {{have to be}} used in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportion</b> {{to ensure}} that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry but also that the binder does not take up too much of the mixture.|$|R
60|$|He had <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> note, for <b>the</b> British Columbian is a {{somewhat}} chivalrous person, {{and there was}} silence, through which the jingle of a piano in the saloon broke irritatingly, until Lee stood up.|$|R
6000|$|The skeptics of the {{neighborhood}} were quite generally sympathetic. [...] "You've <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> trail now, parson," [...] said Chapman, as they walked homeward together. [...] "The days of the old-time denominationalism are about played out." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{were soon}} at the table, and having by a lucky chance (or {{was it the}} girl's natural tact?) <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> vein, <b>the</b> {{conversation}} became quite animated, and soon all were on very good terms.|$|R
50|$|Néstor Ortigoza {{scored the}} only {{goal of the}} game, a penalty after a shot from Martín Cauteruccio <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> hand of Ramón Coronel. Ortigoza hit <b>the</b> ball <b>right</b> footed to <b>the</b> left of the goalkeeper who dived the other way.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Zenith was perfected around 1906-1908 by Francois Baverey of Lyon, France. The {{carburettor}} had two jets, one for rich mixture, one for lean. The mixture was then combined in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions</b> for <b>the</b> engine's speed and load.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> road this time," [...] exulted Wetherell. [...] "Here is {{the wall}} of black rocks." [...] There was no snow, but he argued that, the season having been {{extraordinarily}} warm and wet, this landmark had temporarily disappeared.|$|R
3000|$|... [...]. This {{solves the}} problem when {{a pair of}} authors {{does not have any}} {{co-author}} in common. Then, we sum one at the denominator to give <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportion</b> to <b>the</b> equation. Also, for unweighted social networks, tieness value {{is the same as the}} modified neighborhood overlap.|$|R
25|$|Fires {{start when}} a {{inflammable}} or a combustible material, {{in combination with}} a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, {{and is able to}} sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions.</b> For example, an inflammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions.</b> Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{discussion}} of analogies and metaphors, Johnson compares the components of good punch to those of good conversation. He equates spirits with wit, lemon juice with raillery, sugar with adulation and water with [...] "easy prattle". The ingredients must be blended in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions</b> to create a pleasing final product.|$|R
5000|$|All other dals {{including}} {{pigeon pea}} {{do not have}} individual amino acids within protein in ideal proportion (unlike eggs and meats). However, if the proteins in dals are combined with other seeds, nuts, rice or wheat (for example, chapatis), it provides amino acids in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions,</b> making it a complete protein.|$|R
60|$|We {{were not}} at Leuk {{in time to see}} her at her {{heaviest}} weight. She had suffered from corpulence and had come there to get rid of her extra flesh in the baths. Five weeks of soaking--five uninterrupted hours of it every day--had accomplished her purpose and reduced her to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's {{silence in}} the tiny cottage parlor now, whilst he--gauging the full value of his words, knowing by {{instinct}} that he had <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> cord in that vibrating girlish heart, watched the subtle change in her face from defiance and wrath to submission and appeal.|$|R
50|$|He was {{eldest of}} the three brothers; others are B. Nagi Reddy and B. N. Konda Reddy. He was popularly known as B. N. Reddy. He is the {{director}} who balances artistic values and business needs in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportion.</b> Many of his earlier films like Vande Mataram, Devatha had Chittor V. Nagaiah as lead.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would need}} to be a heavy one," [...] {{answered}} Adrian, [...] "if it was worse than that of which I know." [...] But there was hesitation in his voice, for Ramiro, the skilful player upon human hearts, had <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> string, and Adrian's superstitious nature answered to the note.|$|R
50|$|As the {{quotations}} {{that follow}} show, Follett was generally compared favourably with Fowler, doing for Americans, as it were, what Fowler {{had done for}} the writer of British English. He was considered by expert reviewers to have <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> balance of prescriptivity and to have trodden <b>the</b> <b>right</b> line between outdated, schoolmarmish rules and laissez-faire liberality in matters of grammar and usage.|$|R
50|$|Not all {{commentators}} {{agree that}} <b>the</b> Rudd government <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> balance between simplification and appropriate protection. Baird and Williamson, for example, {{argue that the}} new minimum standards are detrimental to certain groups, particularly women, because the new awards fail to adequately cover women working in social services, call centres and the health sector.|$|R
50|$|Johnny Town-Mouse was {{the last}} of Potter's books in her early style. The rural scenes {{inspired}} Potter's best designs, and <b>the</b> author <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> tone for children while incorporating subtler touches for adults. The book is a satire on human society, and a warning about the dangers and extravagances of life in the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank Heaven," [...] Leslie said, [...] "we have <b>struck</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place. There {{seem to be}} ten {{or twelve}} of them, of whom two, no doubt, are the prisoners. We shall have no {{difficulty}} in overcoming them by a sudden surprise. Capture or kill every man if possible, or we shall have hot work in getting back to Edinburgh." ...|$|R
50|$|Function {{and design}} must meet at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions</b> in children's {{clothing}} {{for it to}} be popular and accepted. Fabric choices, openings and fastenings, fit and ease, trimmings used are all major considerations when designing children's wear. Some other factors a designer designing for children's clothing should focus on are the changing shape of the growing kid and different proportions of the different parts of the body.|$|R
40|$|The basic {{components}} that largely determine {{the structure of}} a liquid laundry detergent are water, salts and a mixture of surfactants. When these are mixed in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions,</b> <b>the</b> surfactant in a lamellar fashion. This lamellar phase is a packing of amphiphiles in a bilayer, with the tails in the inner core of the bilayer and the headgroups pointing towards the water. Zie: Summary. ...|$|R
40|$|The method now {{described}} for preparation of dispersed lactating goat mammary-gland cells gives a high yield of morphologically and functionally normal mammary cells. The cells synthesize specific goat milk fatty acids in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions,</b> and {{they respond to}} hormones by increased protein synthesis. The cells can be frozen and thawed without losing the above properties, which makes them an excellent tool for metabolic and hormonal studies...|$|R
50|$|The use of hops in beer {{was written}} of {{as early as}} 822 by a Carolingian Abbot. Flavouring beer with hops was known {{at least since the}} 9th century, but was only {{gradually}} adopted because of difficulties in establishing <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions</b> of ingredients. Before that, gruit, a mix of various herbs had been used, but did not have the same conserving properties as hops.|$|R
5000|$|The ancient Greeks viewed {{perfection}} as a requisite {{for beauty}} and high art. The Pythagoreans held that perfection {{was to be}} found in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>proportions</b> and in a harmonious arrangement of parts. The idea that beauty and art were characterized by perfection, was subsequently embraced by Plato, who believed that art ought to be [...] "apt, suitable, without deviations" [...] — in short, [...] "perfect." ...|$|R
