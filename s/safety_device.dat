5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E

30|$|The 2009 Tax Authorities Report {{indicates}} that the phenomenon of leasing companies’ purchasing cars with minimal <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> has existed for several years. However, {{as a result of}} the recent change in tax incentives intended to encourage purchasing cars equipped with more <b>safety</b> <b>devices,</b> there are indications that the gap in the level of installed <b>safety</b> <b>devices</b> between company cars and privately owned cars is closing. This is prominent in the number of airbags. The difference in the number of airbags between company cars and privately owned cars was reduced in 2008.|$|R

25|$|The skybridge also {{acts as a}} <b>safety</b> <b>device,</b> so that in {{the event}} of a fire or other {{emergency}} in one tower, tenants can evacuate by crossing the skybridge to the other tower. The total evacuation triggered by a bomb hoax on 12 September 2001 (the day after the September 11 attacks destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City) showed that the bridge would not be useful if both towers need to be emptied simultaneously, as the capacity of the staircases was insufficient for such an event. Plans thus call for the lifts to be used if both towers need to be evacuated, and a successful drill following the revised plan was conducted in 2005.|$|E
25|$|A sea kayak's primary <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> is its paddler. Although some kayakers {{consider}} a well-practised self-righting move {{such as an}} Eskimo roll to be essential in order to safe open-water kayaking, it is the technique of bracing that every well-trained, experienced kayaker practises {{in order to maintain}} an upright position in their kayak. Practice in bracing is often neglected by inexperienced kayakers once they have learned the Eskimo roll. However, the reality is that having to roll really means having to recover from a failed brace. Being in the capsized position in some environments due to missing a brace can put the paddler in danger of colliding with obstacles under the water. Staying upright in surf zones, rocky surf zones (informally known as rock gardens), and rivers is most important and is only accomplished through well-practised and successful bracing.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Volvo {{installed}} a head-protecting airbag, {{which was made}} standard in all new models {{as well as some}} existing models. The IC head-protecting airbag was not available on the 1997 C70 since the initial design deployed the airbag from the roof, and the C70, being a convertible, could not accommodate such an airbag. A later version of the C70 featured a head-protecting airbag deploying upwards from the door, avoiding this problem. It has been stated by many testing authorities that side head protecting curtain airbags can reduce the risk of death in a side impact by up to 40% and brain injury by up to 55%, as well as protect occupants during a rollover. In 1998, Volvo introduced its Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS), a <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> to prevent injury to front seat users during collisions.|$|E

500|$|The {{first modern}} three-point seat belt, the CIR-Griswold {{restraint}} used in most consumer vehicles today, was patented in 1955 (US patent 2,710,649) by the Americans Roger W. Griswold and Hugh DeHaven. It was developed into its modern form by Swedish inventor Nils Bohlin (US patent 3,043,625) for Volvo, who introduced the three-point <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> in 1959 as standard equipment. [...] He demonstrated its effectiveness {{in a study}} of 28,000 accidents in Sweden; unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed range, whereas none of the belted occupants were fatally injured at accident speeds below , and no belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact. [...] American manufacturers followed their lead, and most automobiles had three-point front seat belts as standard equipment by 1964 and standard rear seat belts by 1968.|$|E
500|$|In 1960, Ford {{unveiled}} the new Falcon in Australia, only months after its introduction in the United States. To Holden's advantage, the Falcon was not durable, {{particularly in the}} front suspension, making it ill-suited for Australian conditions. In response to the Falcon, Holden introduced the facelifted EK series in 1961; the new model featured two-tone paintwork and optional Hydramatic automatic transmission. A restyled EJ series came in 1962, debuting the new luxury oriented Premier model. The EH update came a year later bringing the new Red motor, providing better performance than the previous Grey motor. The HD series of 1965 saw {{the introduction of the}} Powerglide automatic transmission. At the same time, an [...] "X2" [...] performance option with a more powerful version of the [...] six-cylinder engine was made available. In 1966, the HR was introduced, including changes in the form of new front and rear styling and higher-capacity engines. More significantly, the HR fitted standard front seat belts; Holden thus became the first Australian automaker to provide the <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> as standard equipment across all models. This coincided with the completion of the production plant in Acacia Ridge, Queensland. By 1963, Holden was exporting cars to Africa, the Middle East, South-East Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean.|$|E
500|$|The rammerman's {{position}} was of special concern, as ramming {{was considered the}} most dangerous part of loading the gun. The ram was used to first thrust the projectile and then the powder bags into the gun's breech. The ram speed used for the projectile was much faster ( [...] per second) than that used for the lighter powder bags ( [...] per second), {{but there was no}} <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> on the ram piston to prevent the rammerman from accidentally pushing the powder bags at the faster speed. Overramming the powder bags into the gun could subject the highly flammable powder to excessive friction and compression, with a resulting increased danger of premature combustion. Also, if the bags were pushed too far into the gun, a gap between the last bag and the primer might prevent the powder from igniting when the gun was fired, causing a misfire. None of Iowas rammermen had any training or experience in ramming nonstandard five-bag loads into the guns. Complicating the task, as the rammerman was shoving the powder bags, he was also supposed to simultaneously operate a lever to shut the powder hoist door and lower the powder hoist car. Iowa crewmen later stated that Turret Two's center gun rammer would sometimes [...] "take off" [...] uncontrollably on its own at high speed. Furthermore, Backherms had never operated the ram before during a live fire shoot.|$|E

500|$|A {{fusible plug}} {{operates}} as a safety valve when dangerous temperatures, rather than dangerous pressures, are reached in a closed vessel. In steam engines [...] the fusible plug is screwed into the crown sheet (the top plate) of the firebox, typically extending about an inch (25mm) into the water space above. Its purpose is {{to act as a}} last-resort <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> in the event of the water level falling dangerously low: when the top of the plug is out of the water it overheats, the low-melting-point core melts away and the resulting noisy release of steam into the firebox serves to warn the operators of the danger before the top of the firebox itself runs completely dry, which could result in catastrophic failure of the boiler. The temperature of the flue gases in a steam engine firebox can reach 1000°F (550°C), at which temperature copper, from which historically most fireboxes were made, softens to a state which can no longer sustain the boiler pressure and a severe explosion will result if water is not put into the boiler quickly and the fire removed or extinguished. The hole through the plug is too small to have any great effect in reducing the steam pressure and the small amount of water, if any, that passes through it is not expected to have any great impact in quenching the fire.|$|E
2500|$|In {{electronics}} and electrical engineering, a fuse is an electrical <b>safety</b> <b>device</b> that operates to provide overcurrent protection of an electrical circuit. [...] Its essential component is a metal wire or strip that melts when too much current flows through it, thereby interrupting the current. It is a sacrificial device; once a fuse has operated {{it is an}} open circuit, {{and it must be}} replaced or rewired, depending on type.|$|E
