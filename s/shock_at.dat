5|$|Through late September, Caltech seismometers {{recorded}} 188 aftershocks {{higher than}} magnitude 4.0. Six {{of those on}} the day of the mainshock were M5 and above, but some of these (like the 12:05 M6.3 shock) were only felt, and didn't cause any damage. The July 21 M5.1 <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> 15:13 GMT and the July 23 <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> 00:38 both damaged buildings in Arvin, and the latter event also caused slight damage in Fresno and near Bakersfield. Three additional shocks on July 23 were particularly destructive. Walls and other portions of buildings that had been previously damaged took a second hit from the 07:53 M5.2 event, and a house that saw only minor damage during the mainshock was nearly destroyed by it. Gas and water lines were also severed, and transformers were loosened or dislodged. The 13:17 M5.8 shock compounded problems at Tehachapi and Arvin with damage to previously-affected buildings that was described as serious, but the 18:13 shock on July 23 only had a slight affect at Arvin.|$|E

5|$|After {{withdrawing}} from the Commonwealth Games squad, Kydd took a four-month hiatus from the sport in order to recover from injury and regain motivation. She married fiancée Garth in April 2006, and though widely known by her maiden name, decided to take on her husband's surname. Kydd began the process of re-signing with the Kestrels for the 2006 season, and returned to training with the club with March 2006, but stunned the team when she defected to more successful rival Melbourne Phoenix only {{three weeks before the}} start of the season. The defection caused notable antagonism between the traditional rivals with Kydd's former coach, Jane Searle and several teammates expressing <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> the suddenness of the switch.|$|E

40|$|Size {{matters in}} banking. In this paper, we explore whether <b>shocks</b> {{originating}} <b>at</b> large banks affect {{the probability of}} distress of smaller banks and thus {{the stability of the}} banking system. Our analysis proceeds in two steps. In a first step, we follow Gabaix (2008 a) and construct a measure of idiosyncratic <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> large banks, the so-called Banking Granular Residual. This measure documents the importance of size effects for the German banking system. In a second step, we incorporate this measure of idiosyncratic <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> large banks into an integrated stress-testing model for the German banking system following De Graeve et al. (2007). We find that positive <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> large banks reduce the probability of distress of small banks.

Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots. To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> what she had witnessed.|$|E
5|$|Al-Adil aroused open hostility {{from the}} Hanbali lobby in Damascus for largely {{ignoring}} the Crusaders, having launched only one campaign against them. Al-Adil {{believed that the}} Crusader army could not be defeated in a direct fight. Prolonged campaigns also involved the difficulties of maintaining a coherent Muslim coalition. The trend under al-Adil was the steady growth of the empire, mainly through the expansion of Ayyubid authority in al-Jazira and Armenia. The Abbasids eventually recognized al-Adil's role as sultan in 1207. A Crusader military campaign was launched on 3 November 1217, beginning with an offensive towards Transjordan. Al-Mu'azzam urged al-Adil to launch a counter-attack, but he rejected his son's proposal. In 1218, the fortress of Damietta in the Nile Delta was besieged by the Crusaders. After two failed attempts, the fortress eventually capitulated on 25 August. Six days later al-Adil died of apparent <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> Damietta's loss.|$|E
5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them.

5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that treatment strategy plays a critical role in ensuring maximum stone fragmentation during shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). We aimed to develop an optimal treatment strategy in SWL to produce maximum stone fragmentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four treatment strategies were evaluated using an in-vitro experimental setup that mimics stone fragmentation in the renal pelvis. Spherical stone phantoms were exposed to 2100 shocks using the Siemens Modularis (electromagnetic) lithotripter. The treatment strategies included increasing output voltage with 100 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 12. 3 kV, 400 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 14. 8 kV, and 1600 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 15. 8 kV, and decreasing output voltage with 1600 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 15. 8 kV, 400 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 14. 8 kV, and 100 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 12. 3 kV. Both increasing and decreasing voltages models were run at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1 and 2 Hz. Fragmentation efficiency was determined using a sequential sieving method to isolate fragments less than 2 mm. A fiberoptic probe hydrophone was used to characterize the pressure waveforms at different output voltage and frequency settings. In addition, a high-speed camera was used to assess cavitation activity in the lithotripter field that was produced by different treatment strategies. RESULTS: The increasing output voltage strategy at 1 Hz PRF produced the best stone fragmentation efficiency. This result was significantly better than the decreasing voltage strategy at 1 Hz PFR (85. 8 % vs 80. 8 %, P= 0. 017) and over the same strategy at 2 Hz PRF (85. 8 % vs 79. 59 %, P= 0. 0078). CONCLUSIONS: A pretreatment dose of 100 low-voltage output shockwaves (SWs) at 60 SWs/min before increasing to a higher voltage output produces the best overall stone fragmentation in vitro. These findings could lead to increased fragmentation efficiency in vivo and higher success rates clinically...|$|R
