40|$|Image {{compression}} {{is one of}} {{the prominent}} signal processing areas for multimedia applications. Compressed images when transmitted are affected by noise and thus reconstruction of images at the receiver becomes complex. Very recently Artificial Neural Networks are being used for image compression and decompression. One of the building blocks in ANN is the multiplying DAC. In this paper, we present the design and analysis of sub circuits for multiplying DAC using 180 nm CMOS technology. The DA, current reference and opamp are design, modelled and analysed for its performances using Cadence Virtuoso and HSPICE. The optimum geometries for sub circuits are computed and <b>schematic</b> <b>captured</b> is carried out. The results obtained show that the designed sub circuits are suitable for multiplying DAC implementation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} issue of {{behavioral}} organization in robot systems in the context of many independent tasks. We argue that principles of embodiment—an understanding of how to employ sensorimotor resources and kinematic structure— provide a substrate for rich and complex interactions with the world and objects in it. We propose a framework for behavioral organization into <b>schematic</b> units that <b>capture</b> critical control knowledge and a methodology for acquiring this knowledge in an incremental way. In this paper, we introduce the three main components of this framework: 1) how to organize behavior, 2) how to represent knowledge in a robot, and 3) how to learn new skills incrementally. I...|$|R
40|$|Although visual {{information}} affects auditory perception {{in a variety}} of tasks, audition is generally believed to be relatively immune from visual influence when judging tone duration. However, Schutz and Lipscomb (2007) report a musical illusion in which physical gestures influence the perceived duration of notes per formed on the marimba. In order to better understand which aspects of these gestures are responsible for the illusion, we created a "schematic marimbist ” consisting of either a four-point skeleton or a single mov ing dot. This <b>schematic</b> abstraction <b>captured</b> the essential properties of the gestures, replicating the effect under both conditions. Therefore, this illusion requires seeing only a sudden change in gesture direction — independent of the depiction of a struck object. As this finding means that it can be replicated with a mini mum of {{visual information}}, it will be useful in facilitating future research aimed at uncovering the reason for this break with the widely accepted theory of ‘optimal integration’.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{designed}} to synthesize two theories of consumer information search process and to extend recent research by the authors on information search strategies used by employed women {{for the purchase of}} employment apparel. The main objective is to offer an integrated explanation for the processes which produce dfferent search patterns used by employed women for the purchase of employment apparel. While speculative, it provides one possible <b>schematic</b> that <b>captures</b> the interaction of consumers, product, and situational characteristics and information search patterns by utilizing systematic/heuristic theory and active/passive search theory within an integrative explanatory framework. This information contributes to theory development about search strategies among consumers. This paper {{is designed to}} synthesize two theories of consumer search process with recent research by Shim and Drake (1988) on information search strategies used by employed women for the purchase of employment apparel. The two theories synthesized in this paper are systematic/ heuristic information processing advanced by Chaiken (1980) and active/passive search posited by Walters (1978). Consumer information search is an important stage in the consumer decision making model. Researchers of consumer behavior have found that consumers employ information search strategies which can be distinguished by the number of external search activities and the amount of decision tim...|$|R

40|$|Cave art {{constitutes}} one of {{the areas}} of study of prehistory more attractive, perhaps because of the secrecy that still conveys. After a century of research on post-Paleolithic cave painting in Spain, and when the scientific production exceeds two thousand records, is addressed from bibliometric parameters, the analysis of this production over the period 1907 - 2010. Based on an own database in Microsoft Access, prepared for over twenty years and that the March 31, 2011 counted on 2186 bibliographic records, bibliometric techniques are used to determine the temporal distribution, the language used, the styles of cave art, the document types, the themes addressed in the works and the publication place. Document production is below 21, 02 publications/year until 1970, although in the 104 years of research analyzed, highlights the years 1999 (with 4, 5 %) and 2006 (with 5, 1 %) for the large number of publications. Regarding the language of the documents are distributed as follows, Spanish (88, 1 %), Catalan (4, 6 %), French (3, 9 %), English (2 %), German (1 %) and other languages (Italian, Portuguese or Galician) with 0, 32 %. 35, 4 % of production is dedicated to Levantine art, while <b>schematic</b> painting <b>captures</b> 34, 8 %. Regarding the document type, the scientific article stands out with 55, 2 %, followed by conference papers (19, 2 %), book chapters (11, 3 %), case studies (9, 8 %), notes (2, 3 %), doctoral thesis (1 %) and undergraduate dissertations (0, 7 %). The predominant topics are sites (34, 5 %), chronology (8, 8 %), iconography (7, 7 %), or scientific divulgation (5, 1 %). 90, 6 % of scientific production has been published in Spain, highlighting Zaragoza (13, 4 %), Madrid (13, 3 %), Valencia (9, 2 %) and Murcia (9 %). We consider that the total production is low because hardly exceeds 21 papers / year, although in the last fifty years growth rates were reached above 5 %. Because Spanish is {{one of the}} most spoken languages in the world, greater internationalization of research of the Spanish post-Palaeolithic cave painting would be necessary, overcoming marked localism in which has been involved, as opposed to current view that cave art is a universal phenomenon present in all five continents and diverse cultural and chronological settings. Also, greater internationalization of Spanish industry magazines and a greater interest in the prehistoric art in general. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hamiltonian {{dynamical}} systems possessing equilibria of saddle × center ×· · ·× center stability type display reaction-type dynamics for energies {{close to}} the energy of such equilibria; entrance and exit from certain regions of the phase space is only possible via narrow bottlenecks created by {{the influence of the}} equilibrium points. In this paper we provide a thorough pedagogical description of the phase space structures that are responsible for controlling transport in these problems. Of central importance is the existence of a Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifold (NHIM), whose stable and unstable manifolds have sufficient dimensionality to act as separatrices, partitioning energy surfaces into regions of qualitatively distinct behavior. This NHIM forms the natural (dynamical) equator of a (spherical) dividing surface which locally divides an energy surface into two components (“reactants” and “products”), one {{on either side of the}} bottleneck. This dividing surface has all the desired properties sought for in transition state theory where reaction rates are computed from the flux through a dividing surface. In fact, the dividing surface that we construct is crossed exactly once by reactive trajectories, and not crossed by nonreactive trajectories, and related to these properties, minimizes the flux upon variation of the dividing surface. We discuss three presentations of the energy surface and the phase space structures contained in it for 2 -degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in the three-dimensional space R 3, and two <b>schematic</b> models which <b>capture</b> many of the essential features of the dynamics for n-DoF systems. In addition, we elucidate the structure of the NHIM. ...|$|R
40|$|The pace of {{progress}} {{in the design of}} integrated circuits continues to amaze observers inside and outside of the industry. Three decades ago, a 50 transistor chip was a technological wonder. Fifteen year later, a 5000 transistor device would 'wow' the crowds. Today, 50, 000 transistor chips will earn a 'not too bad' assessment, but it takes 500, 000 to really leave an impression. In 1975 a typical ASIC device had 1000 transistors, took one year to first samples (and two years to production) and sold for about 5 cents per transistor. Today's 50, 000 transistor gate array takes about 4 months from spec to silicon, works the first time, and sells for about 0. 02 cents per transistor. Fifteen years ago, the single most laborious and error prone step in IC design was the physical layout. Today, most IC's never see the hand of a layout designer: and automatic place and route tool converts the engineer's computer <b>captured</b> <b>schematic</b> to a complete physical design using a gate array or a library of standard cells also created by software rather than by designers. CAD has also been a generous benefactor to the digital design process. The architect of today's digital systems creates the design using an RTL or other high level simulator. Then the designer pushes a button to invoke the logic synthesizer-optimizer tool. A fault analyzer checks the result for testability and suggests where scan based cells will improve test coverage. One obstinate holdout amidst this parade {{of progress}} is the automation of analog design and its reduction to semi-custom techniques.

40|$|For {{the past}} 40 years, {{the number of}} {{transistors}} per chip has been increasing at an exponential rate confirming Moore’s Law regarding the growth of chip complexity. Increases in transistor count have led to enhancements in functionality and made possible products with features that were unimaginable ten years ago. Consequently, the resulting increase in digitization in all electronics, across {{a wide range of}} applications, requires the Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) with a higher resolution and lower power consumption. The evolution of the integrated circuit technologies and scaling methodologies partially helps in providing faster circuits and allowing complex functionalities in a given silicon area. ^ The objective of the present work is to better understand the design of ADCs in the context of low voltage operation as a function of temperature, speed and power consumption. However, one requirement in designing faster circuits with transistor of smaller geometries is reducing the supply voltages. Additionally, {{the increase in the number}} of battery-operated applications has focused in reducing the supply voltage in current designs to improve energy efficiency. Few low voltage methodologies have been studied and implemented for analog circuits in general and more specifically for ADCs. In the present work, an ADC was designed which implemented the Successive Approximation (SAR) method – based on a binary search. The functionality of ADC was tested in simulation by applying a DC voltage and a ramp signal as the input and analyzing the resulting output digital codes. The power consumption at different temperatures and supply voltages was recorded and analyzed. The results indicate that the effect of temperature on power consumption is significant. ^ The SAR ADC was designed for TSMC 0. 25 μm CMOS technology. The design of the ADC at the <b>schematic</b> level was <b>captured</b> in Virtuoso Cadence. Cadence offers an integrated Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solution, which encompasses the entire design flow from behavioral modeling to post-layout simulation. The Spectre simulator from Cadence was used to analyze the behavior of the ADC at different voltages and temperatures through simulation. Finally, a built-in Cadence calculator was used to calculate the power consumption and Spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) at different voltages and temperatures to compare the design to previously reported ADCs. ^ The ADC was simulated at 27 °C with the sinusoidal signal as the input. The input sinusoidal signal has 0. 5 V P-P running at frequency of 500 Hz. The SFDR and the power consumption for the ADC at these conditions were calculated to be 40. 56 dB and 2. 5640 μW respectively – a 63 % decrease in power consumption in the proposed design relative to the leading ADC reported in literature with 60 times decrease in speed. ...|$|R
