In the case of Saturn, magnetic flux tubes loaded with cold, waterrich plasma interchange with flux tubes filled with hot plasma arriving from the outer magnetosphere.

The cold plasma is eventually removed from the magnetosphere by plasmoids formed when the magnetic field reconnects in the magnetotail.

50|$|Substorms {{can cause}} {{magnetic}} field disturbances in the auroral zones up to a magnitude of 1000 nT, roughly 2% {{of the total}} magnetic field strength in that region. The disturbance is much greater in space, as some geosynchronous satellites have registered the magnetic field dropping to half of its normal strength during a <b>substorm.</b> The most visible indication of a <b>substorm</b> {{is an increase in}} the intensity and size of polar auroras.

30|$|When {{considering}} isolated <b>substorms,</b> {{solar wind}} energy dissipated in the auroral ionosphere has {{the contribution of}} <b>substorms</b> only, whereas the solar wind energy dissipated in the auroral ionosphere has contribution of both storms and <b>substorms</b> during <b>substorms</b> associated with a geomagnetic storm. The total dissipation, in this case, can be found out by considering the geomagnetic storms and the associated <b>substorms</b> as distinct phenomena. It is found recently that Joule heating generated during geomagnetic storms is more concentrated in cusp region of the auroral ionosphere, whereas that during <b>substorms</b> is more focused in the auroral oval region of the auroral ionosphere (Palmroth et al. 2004 a). Also, it had been confirmed over a few decades that magnetospheric <b>substorms</b> frequently occur in the midnight sector of the auroral oval region since energetic electron flux bursts out directly from mid-tail lobes.|$|R

30|$|Mechanisms of the <b>substorms</b> {{triggering}} {{is still}} being discussed. The commonly accepted idea is that <b>substorms</b> are triggered by geoeffective changes in the solar wind parameters. The alternative concept suggests that <b>substorms</b> can be triggered by internal process (Hsu and McPherron 2003; Liu et al. 2011; McPherron et al. 1986). Indeed, occurrence of moderate and even intense <b>substorms</b> under conditions of relatively steady interplanetary (northward) magnetic field was noted in many studies (e.g., (Kullen and Karlsson 2004; Lee et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2002)). Special attention to intense <b>substorms</b> developed under conditions of persistently northward IMF was given by Lee et al. (2010) {{with the use of}} the UV auroral images on board the IMAGE spacecraft and other complementary observations such as magnetic dipolarizations and energetic particle injections on geosynchronous orbit (the GOES and LANL spacecraft measurements). The conclusion was made that occurrence of such <b>substorms</b> implies a large amount of energy remained in the tail even under northward IMF impact on the magnetosphere.|$|R

30|$|The basic {{observations}} for magnetic {{storms and}} <b>substorms</b> at Earth and for flares at the Sun are reviewed for background. We present a common scenario of double magnetic reconnection for both <b>substorms</b> and flares {{based on previous}} interplanetary observations and substorm-triggering results. Central to the scenario {{is that the first}} magnetic reconnection phase is the source of energy loading for possible <b>substorms</b> and flares. The energy placed in the magnetotail or magnetosphere/at the sun lasts for only a short duration of time however. The energy gets dissipates away rapidly (in some less dramatic form). This scenario predicts that if the initial reconnection process is sufficiently intense and rapid, concomitant <b>substorms</b> and flares occur soon thereafter. If the energy input is less rapid, there may be lengthy delays for the onset of <b>substorms</b> and flares. If external influences (shocks, etc.) occur during the latter energy buildup, the “trigger” will cause a sudden release of this energy. The model also explains reconnection without subsequent <b>substorms</b> and flares. The model addresses the question why strong triggering events are sometimes ineffective.|$|R

50|$|Substorms are {{distinct}} from geomagnetic storms {{in that the}} latter take place {{over a period of}} several days, are observable from anywhere on Earth, inject a large number of ions into the outer radiation belt, and occur once or twice a month during the maximum of the solar cycle and a few times a year during solar minimum. Substorms, on the other hand, take place over a period of a few hours, are observable primarily at the polar regions, do not inject many particles into the radiation belt, and are relatively frequent — often occurring only a few hours apart from each other. Substorms can be more intense and occur more frequently during a geomagnetic storm when one <b>substorm</b> may start before the previous one has completed. The source of the magnetic disturbances observed at the Earth's surface during geomagnetic storms is the ring current, whereas the sources of magnetic disturbances observed on the ground during substorms are electric currents in the ionosphere at high latitudes.|$|E
50|$|Although {{spacecraft}} have travelled {{many times}} in the inner and outer orbit of Earth since the 1960s, the spacecraft ATS 5 was the first major plasma experiment performed that could reliably determine the existence of radial injections driven by interchange motions. The analysis revealed the frequent injection of a hot plasma cloud is injected inward during a <b>substorm</b> in the outer layers of the magnetosphere et al. 1971. The injections occur predominantly in the night-time hemisphere, being associated with the depolarization of the neutral sheet configuration in the tail regions of the magnetosphere. This paper then implies that Earth’s magnetotail region is a major mechanism in which the magnetosphere stores and releases energy through the interchange mechanism.The interchange instability also has been found to have a limiting factor on the night side plasmapause thickness et al. 1990. In this paper, the plasmapause is found to be near the geosynchronous orbit in which the centrifugal and gravitational potential cancel exactly. This sharp change in plasma pressure associated with the plasma pause enables this instability. A mathematical treatment comparing the growth rate of the instability with the thickness of the plasmapause boundary revealed that the interchange instability limits the thickness of the boundary.|$|E
5000|$|Colorful auroras {{are due to}} a {{phenomenon}} called magnetic substorms. A <b>substorm</b> is a major reconfiguration of the Earth's magnetic field on the nightside. During substorms, oppositely directed magnetic ﬁeld lines reconnect in the distant magnetotail. The relaxation of the magnetic tension of the stretched ﬁeld lines converts the stored magnetic energy into plasma kinetic energy and heat. The plasma is accelerated earthward in short duration bursty bulk ﬂows (BBFs).The BBFs are the most prominent means to carry mass and energy from the tail toward the near-Earth region. BBFs are often accompanied by magnetic ﬁeld dipolarization, at their front, as detected by the multi-spacecraft Cluster mission Nakamura et al., 2002. Observationally, they are seen by satellites as {{a sharp increase in}} the vertical-to-the-current sheet component (Bz), usually preceded by a transient decrease in Bz. These asymmetric bipolar variations in the z component of the magnetic ﬁeld are referred to as dipolarization fronts (DFs). DFs velocities can be estimated by multi-spacecraft observations. Such velocities have been estimated since 2002 by the first multi-spacecraft magnetospheric mission, the ESA Cluster mission, at around 19 Earth radii or RE (around 115,000 km from Earth), i.e. in the outer magnetotail region. But how these velocities evolve as BBF propagate towards Earth?In a recent study published by Schmid et al. (2016), these multi-spacecraft DFs observations have been compared with other multi-spacecraft DFs observations. These DFs velocities have been estimated in 2015 by the NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) mission below 12 RE distance from Earth, i.e. in the inner magnetotail region, and by Cluster at distances around 20 RE measured in 2003.As expected most of the BBFs observed are Earthward propagated, but about 25% of DFs are tailward propagating. Thanks to the DFs measurements at two locations in the tail, Schmid et al. interpret that these tailward propagating events are the result of DFs rebound (bouncing) near Earth where the magnetic field is almost like a dipole. Another interesting feature found is that the larger DF velocities correspond to higher values of Bz directly ahead of the DFs. This behavior is observed by both Cluster and MMS despite their very different locations. Schmid et al. (2016) interpret the higher Bz to a local snow plow like phenomenon resulting from a higher DF velocity and thus a higher magnetic flux pileup ahead of the DF. Coordinated BBF measurements by Cluster and MMS, this time simultaneously, are planned in August 2016.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} aspects of the global magnetospheric response to solar wind changes is the relationship between storms and <b>substorms.</b> Here we present new results on the relationship between these two different classes of magnetospheric phenomena by approaching the problem on the side of information theory. Using the Auroral Electrojet AL and SYM‐H indices as representative proxies of magnetic <b>substorms</b> and storms, we investigate the transfer of information by means of transfer entropy analysis (Schreiber, 2000). The obtained results seem, on average, to indicate the presence of a net transfer of information from AL to SYM‐H on time scales shorter than 10 h. On the basis of this result, geomagnetic <b>substorms</b> may act as a driver for the occurrence of geomagnetic storms. However, carrying out a more careful analysis which takes into account the global geomagnetic daily activity, we suggest that the direction of information flow between <b>substorms</b> and storms depends on the global activity level. Indeed, {{if it is true that}} a sequence of magnetospheric <b>substorms</b> may drive a moderate storm, it is also true that very large storms may dominate and drive the occurrence of magnetospheric <b>substorms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Previous {{statistical}} observations {{have shown}} that the recovery time scales of <b>substorms</b> occurring in the winter and near equinox (when the nighttime auroral zone was in darkness) are roughly twice as long as the recovery time scales for <b>substorms</b> occurring in the summer (when the nighttime auroral region was sunlit). This suggests that auroral <b>substorms</b> in the northern and southern hemispheres develop asymmetrically during solstice conditions with <b>substorms</b> lasting longer in the winter (dark) hemisphere than in the summer (sunlit) hemisphere. Additionally, this implies that more energy is deposited by electron precipitation in the winter hemisphere than in the summer one during <b>substorms.</b> This result, coupled with previous observations that {{have shown that}} auroral activity is more common when the ionosphere is in darkness and is suppressed when the ionosphere is in daylight, strongly suggests that the ionospheric conductivity plays an important role governing how magnetospheric energy is transferred to the ionosphere during <b>substorms.</b> Therefore, the ionosphere itself may dictate how much energy it will accept from the magnetosphere during <b>substorms</b> rather than this being an externally imposed quantity. Here, we extend our earlier work by statistically analyzing the recovery time scales for a large number of <b>substorms</b> observed in the conjugate hemispheres simultaneously by two orbiting global auroral imagers: Polar UVI and IMAGE FUV. Our current results are consistent with previous observations. The recovery time scales are observed to be longer in the winter (dark) hemisphere while the auroral activity has a shorter duration in the summer (sunlit) hemisphere. This leads to an asymmetric energy input from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere with more energy being deposited in the winter hemisphere than in the summer hemisphere...|$|R
