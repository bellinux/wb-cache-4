5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Yamaha <b>SG</b> <b>Series</b> (1966 to 1971 - first era) ...|$|E
50|$|In 1967, Yamaha {{have changed}} the series # from S to <b>SG</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Service Grade Commander (SGC): {{shared the}} unique design {{features}} of the full-size <b>SG</b> <b>series,</b> with a shorter overall length of 6.5 in, barrel length of 4 in, and lighter weight of 27 oz.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SG</b> 540 <b>series</b> come {{equipped}} {{with either a}} fixed buttstock or a side-folding metal skeleton stock. Another standard feature is a folding bipod which is stowed under the handguard when not in use. The fixed stock, pistol grip and handguard are all made of high-strength polymers to reduce overall weight. In order to minimize costs, metal stamping was employed in the production process.|$|R
2500|$|The SG 553 is an {{improved}} {{version of the}} SG 552 and was released in 2008. Even though it mostly resembles the SG 552, the SG 553 has one key advantage, the recoil spring is now wrapped around the piston rod like in the SG 550/551 models, which address several reliability issues encountered in the SG 552 and also allows the usage of the standard SG 550/551 charging handle. The <b>SG</b> 553 <b>series</b> rifles have a [...] long sight radius. A long barrel version of the SG 553 known as the SG 553 LB incorporates a [...] barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. Further factory options for the <b>SG</b> 553 rifle <b>series</b> are an integrated receiver Picatinny rail and an adjustable butt stock. The SG 553 R is a variant chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge fed from AK family box magazines.|$|R
25|$|The SG 550/551/552/553 {{are also}} {{available}} in semi-automatic only configurations, intended for the civilian shooting market. Among these variants are the SG 550/551/552 SP, PE 90 and SIG Sport rifles. The <b>SG</b> 550 <b>series</b> is available with either 178mm or 254mm (1:7 and 1:10 in) twist rate barrels. Rifles designated SG 55x-1 have a 254mm (1:10 in) twist rate, while models marked SG 55x-2 have a 178mm (1:7 in) twist rate. The ordnance GP 90 ammunition is optimized for use with the original Swiss 254mm (1:10 in) rifling twist rate.|$|R
50|$|Since Dewa Budjana {{started his}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} musician, he has mainly used a Parker Fly Delux as his main guitar, occasionally using Klein and Gibson guitars <b>SG</b> <b>series</b> instead. Budjana also owns a double neck Klein guitar which was used on his latest album, Home, and pictured on the CD cover. For his rig, Dewa Budjana mainly uses Mesa Boogie rectifier and Carvin Legacy amplifier that {{are connected to the}} Line 6 Ax2 212.|$|E
5000|$|The RG guitars with fixed bridges were {{introduced}} to the market following the demand of various artists for an RG guitar without a tremolo. The RG [...] "fixed" [...] series are basically regular RG guitars but with fixed bridges (i.e. excluding the tremolo). This series offers thru-body stringing for improved sound and sustain. The fixed bridge does make it harder to perform string bends, but in return gives more tuning stability, as well as an altogether warmer and rounder sound than the RG Tremolo series. The bodies are made of mahogany as in Gibson's Les Paul and <b>SG</b> <b>series,</b> or basswood.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Vox refined the Virage {{design with}} the Virage II series of guitars. This series {{repeated}} the double and single cutaway {{bodies of the}} earlier Virage series, but also included the Series 77 (with double horns emulating the Gibson <b>SG</b> <b>series),</b> the Series 55 (with resemblance to the Gibson Les Paul single cutaway), and the Series 33 (with lower cost fabrication than the 77 and 55 series). The Virage II series features a CoAxe pickups which resemble the earlier Three-90 features, but claimed to be lower noise. The one-piece cast MaxConnect bridge of this series is aluminium and provides both a saddle and anchor for the guitar strings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SG</b> 540 <b>series</b> {{has entered}} service with {{the armed forces}} of several {{countries}} in Africa, Asia and South America as well as numerous law enforcement and security services. In 1988, the nationally-owned Portuguese defense manufacturer INDEP purchased rights to license build the SG 543 carbine for its own forces. Currently both the SG 540 and SG 542 are only manufactured in Chile, under license by FAMAE for the Chilean Armed Forces. Based on the SG 540, FAMAE developed a 9×19mm Parabellum submachine gun version of the weapon known as the SAF.|$|R

5000|$|Development of {{the rifle}} started in 1963 as a joint project between SIG and Beretta. The latter had already cooperated with SIG on the {{production}} of the SG 510-4 rifle for Chile. Initial prototypes of the 5.56 mm rifle used the delayed-blowback operating system of the SIG SG 510. However, this operating system proved to be problematic with the relatively [...] "weak" [...] 5.56×45mm NATO intermediate cartridge, and the designers were forced to use a gas-operated, roller-locked system. In 1968, Beretta ceased development with SIG, and went to work on their own 5.56 mm rifle design resulting in the outwardly similar AR70. Due to a lack of sales, SIG abandoned the SG 530 in the 1970s in favor of developing the <b>SG</b> 540 <b>series.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Features: - {{the round}} Yamaha logo on the {{headstock}} {{is not a}} decal, it's a die cast metal piece with chrome tuning forks (the Yamaha logo) raised above a black background. You can turn it with your fingers on my guitar but it doesn't come off - you can also see in the picture that the Yamaha brand name appears on the neck plate. This is also chrome and black but is a stamping not a casting. And this isn't actually a neck plate because it doesn't hold the neck on. If you remove the four screws this plate comes off, you will then see the actual neck plate which has four larger screws holding the neck on. The neck plate has a rectangular [...] "window" [...] in it {{to allow you to}} access the truss rod through a hole through the body {{into the back of the}} neck (that's right, the truss is accessed through the back of the neck). - All three pickups are identical. They have adjustable pole piece screws. The black and silver areas that you see are actually the tops of the pickup bobbins themselves. The black and silver areas are covered by a domed clear plastic piece. I took the guitar apart a few years ago to give it a good cleaning. I found that the pickups are not held in place with springs at the height adjustment screws like normal pickups, but instead had a large foam rubber block under the body of each pickup. The fretboard is quite thin. Thin enough that the side dots are actually located on the split line between the fretboard material and the wood of the neck. The guitar's serial number is stamped directly into the fretboard between two of the lower frets. - Yamaha was obviously proud of this guitar, and put their name and logo all over it. Besides the Yamaha name on the tuning machines, it has the Yamaha decal and die cast logo on the headstock, the name and logo on the neck plate and the name and logo are molded into the bridge pickup ring between the two bridge pickups. - The SG2 and SG3 were Yamaha's first electric guitar models, and finish details (as described above) are amazing for a 1965 Japanese guitar. If I lay it down next to my Strat, the Strat looks like a bargain basement model by comparison. Later 1960s models in Yamaha's <b>SG</b> <b>series</b> have far cruder appointments. - As was already noted, the bridge has roller saddles and each saddle is height adjustable. The bridge also has the normal coarse height adjustment screws on each end. There are two sheet metal springs on the ends of the bridge pinching the saddles together so they don't move side-to-side. - The guitar shown here has either a metal or black plastic nut, mine is white plastic. There is, of course, a zero fret. - The string tree is also a good quality chrome plated die casting, not a metal stamping like many guitars of the period. - The main knobs are chrome-plated metal with plastic skirts. As for the roller controls, the mysterious 3rd thumbwheel nearest to the bridge pickup is a balance control for the two bridge pickups. This functions whether the slide switch is in the up or down position. - The remaining two thumbwheels are just like their Fender counterparts; they're a volume control and a tone control that override the main volume and tone controls when the slide switch is in the up position. [...] Supposedly most of them were sold in Japan, and only a few were exported to the US.|$|E
40|$|The basic {{energy balance}} model {{is applied to}} analyze the hohlraum {{energetics}} data from the Shenguang (<b>SG)</b> <b>series</b> laser facilities and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) experiments published {{in the past few}} years. The analysis shows that the overall hohlraum energetics data are in agreement with the energy balance model within 20 % deviation. The 20 % deviation might be caused by the diversity in hohlraum parameters, such as material, laser pulse, gas filling density, etc. In addition, the NIF's ignition target designs and our ignition target designs given by simulations are also in accordance with the energy balance model. This work confirms the value of the energy balance model for ignition target design and experimental data assessment, and demonstrates that the NIF energy is enough to achieve ignition if a 1 D spherical radiation drive could be created, meanwhile both the laser plasma instabilities and hydrodynamic instabilities could be suppressed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies show}} that {{terrestrial}} and space based observations of gravity agree overEurope. In this paper, we compare time series of terrestrial gravity (including thecontribution due to surface displacement) as measured by superconducting gravimeters(SGs), space based observations from GRACE, and predicted changes in gravity derived fromtwo global hydrological models at 10 SG stations in Central Europe. Despite the fact that allobservations and models observe a maximum in the same season due to water storagechanges, there is little agreement the <b>SG</b> time <b>series</b> {{even when they are}} separated bydistances smaller than the spatial resolution of GRACE. We also demonstrate that GRACE andthe SG observations and the water storage models do not display significant correlation atseasonal periods nor at inter-annual periods. These findings are consistent with the fact thatthe SGs are sensitive primarily to mass changes in the few hundred meters surrounding thestation. Even if the hydrological models were perfect, we show that we could not correct theSGs for these local effects that would allow comparisons with GRACE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:The Hilbert-Huang {{transform}} (HHT) is used {{to analyze}} the time series from nine superconducting gravimeter (SG) stations and 22 broadband seismometers to investigate the anomalous signals prior to the great 2010 Maule earthquake. The results show that seven <b>SG</b> time <b>series</b> and 20 broadband seismometer time series have anomalous signals lasting about one to three days before the earthquake occurrence. The anomalous signals appear around the frequency bands 0. 07 Hz and 0. 15 Hz in SG records while around the frequency band 0. 13 Hz − 0. 2 Hz in seismic records, and the reason why they appear in different bands might be attributed to the intrinsic nature and different sensitivities of different kinds of instruments. Because more than 87 % records have the anomalous signals prior to the earthquake, and no typhoon event is found in our chosen time window, we may conclude that the anomalous signals might be precursory signals of the great 2010 Maule event. However, we do not rule out other possible excitation sources...|$|R
25|$|The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO {{assault rifle}} firing from a closed bolt. It has a gas-actuated piston-driven {{long-stroke}} operating system {{derived from the}} SIG <b>SG</b> 540 <b>series</b> of rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's moving parts. Once inside the gas cylinder, propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel machined in the piston head and are directed forward towards the gas valve. The pressure build-up {{in front of the}} piston head pushes the piston and bolt carrier rearward. As the piston is driven back, the gas port and the L-shaped channel move out of alignment, cutting off the supply of gas to the cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the gas cylinder. This system ensures that only the precise volume of gas required to overcome the mass and resistance of the rifle's moving assembly is admitted from the barrel. The manually adjustable gas valve has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting for use in the presence of heavy fouling or icing.|$|R

The corresponding quality factor Q s are also determined for those modes, of which the Q s of the five singlets of 1 S 2 and the five singlets (m = 0, m =± 2, and m =± 3) of 0 S 4 are estimated for the first time using the SG observations. The singlet m = 0 of 3 S 1 is clearly observed from the power spectra of the <b>SG</b> time <b>series</b> without using other special spectral analysis methods or special time series from pole station records. In addition, the splitting width ratio R of 3 S 1 is 0. 99, and consequently we conclude that 3 S 1 is normally split.

40|$|To {{validate}} the novel concept of laminating a metal reinforcement to a glass beam using a SentryGlas (<b>SG)</b> interlayer, a <b>series</b> of bending tests has been performed at 23, - 20 and 60 °C on 1. 5 m SG-laminated metal-reinforced glass beams. The beams {{consisted of three}} glass layers with a stainless steel box section laminated in between the glass at the lower edge. The test results showed high redundancy of the beam specimens at all tested temperature levels. However, the specific response of the beam specimens varied at different temperature levels. At 23 °C the beam specimens showed the highest residual strength, whereas the residual strength was reduced at both - 20 and 60 °C. This difference in response {{was caused by a}} difference in glass cracking behaviour and the occurrence of plastic hinges in the beams. These plastic hinges limited the residual strength of the beam and probably originated from a more brittle response of the SG at - 20 °C and a lower metal-to-glass bond strength of the SG at 60 °C. Since the SG-laminated metal-reinforced glass beams showed promising results, future research at TU Delft will further explore the possibilities of this concept...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} of transient system {{behavior of a}} nuclear power plant is the goal of systems code calculations, and the evaluation of a code’s calculation accuracy is accomplished by assessment and validation against appropriate system data. These system data may be developed either from a running system prototype or from a scaled model test facility, and characterize the thermal hydraulic phenomena during both steady state and transient conditions. The identification and characterization of the relevant thermal hydraulic phenomena, and the assessment and validation of thermal hydraulic systems codes, has been the objective of multiple international research programs. The validation and assessment of the best estimate thermal hydraulic system code TRACE against the Multi-Application Small Light-Water Reactor (MASLWR) Natural Circulation (NC), helical coil Steam Generator (SG), Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) design is a novel effort, and is the topic of the present paper. Specifically, the current work relates to the assessment and validation process of TRACE code against the NC database developed in the OSUMASLWR test facility. This facility was constructed at Oregon State University under a U. S. Department of Energy grant in order to examine the NC phenomena of importance to the MASLWR reactor design, which includes an integrated helical coil <b>SG.</b> Test <b>series</b> have been conducted at this facility in order to assess the behavior of the MASLWR concept in both normal and transient operation and to assess the passive safety systems under transient conditions. In particular the test OSU-MASLWR- 002 investigated the primary system flow rates and secondary side steam superheat, used to control the facility, for a variety of core power levels and Feed Water (FW) flow rates. This paper illustrates a preliminary analysis, performed by TRACE code, aiming at the evaluation of the code capability in predicting NC phenomena and heat exchange from primary to secondary side by helical SG in superheated condition and to evaluate the fidelity of various methods to model the OSU-MASLWR SG in TRACE. The analyses of the calculated data show that the phenomena of interest of the OSU-MASLWR- 002 test are predicted by the code and {{that one of the reasons}} of the instability of the superheat condition of the fluid at the outlet of the SG is the equivalent SG model used to simulate the different group of helical coils.

40|$|We analyse {{data from}} seven superconducting {{gravimeter}} (SG) stations in Europe from 2002 to 2007 from the Global Geodynamics Project (GGP) and compare seasonal variations {{with data from}} GRACE and several global hydrological models—GLDAS, WGHM and ERA-Interim. Our technique is empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition of the fields that allows for the inherent incompatibility of length scales between ground and satellite observations. GGP stations below the ground surface pose a problem because part of the attraction from soil moisture comes from above the gravimeter, and this {{gives rise to a}} complex (mixed) gravity response. The first principle component (PC) of the EOF decomposition is the main indicator for comparing the fields, although for some of the series it accounts for only about 50 per cent of the variance reduction. PCs for GRACE solutions RL 04 from CSR and GFZ are filtered with a cosine taper (degrees 20 – 40) and a Gaussian window (350 km). Significant differences are evident between GRACE solutions from different groups and filters, though they all agree reasonably well with the global hydrological models for the predominantly seasonal signal. We estimate the first PC at 10 -d sampling to be accurate to 1 μGal for GGP data, 1. 5 μGal for GRACE data and 1 μGal between the three global hydrological models. Within these limits the CNES/GRGS solution and ground GGP data agree at the 79 per cent level, and better when the GGP solution is restricted to the three above-ground stations. The major limitation on the GGP side comes from the water mass distribution surrounding the underground instruments that leads to a complex gravity effect. To solve this we propose a method for correcting the <b>SG</b> residual gravity <b>series</b> for the effects of soil moisture above the station...|$|R
40|$|A {{clinically}} benign {{member of}} the dsRNA virus family Reoviridae, Mammalian Orthoreovirus (MRV) serves as a model system to determine the nuances of replication within the family. MRV is composed of ten dsRNA gene segments that are contained in a double capsid structure and encode 12 - 13 viral proteins. It has previously been shown that at early times in MRV infection, granules form throughout the cytoplasm of the host cells that have been termed stress granules (SGs). MRV induces the formation of these SGs by activation of the kinase Protein Kinase R (PKR) which subsequently phosphorylates the initiation factor eIF 2 α to trigger the accumulation of the various factors found within SGs. SGs consist of cellular proteins, ribosomal subunits, silenced mRNAs, and initiation factors and their presence effectively results in the shutoff of translation of both the host and viral proteins. It has been previously shown that at early times in infection, viral cores associate with SGs and that translation is shutoff. However, at late times in infection SGs are no longer present in the cell and translation of viral, but not host, protein occurs. In order to determine how MRV is able to disrupt SGs, we mapped the association of a viral protein, µNS, to <b>SGs</b> using a <b>series</b> of deletion and substitution mutants. Using these mutants, we mapped the necessary amino acids in µNS to amino acids 78 and 79. We then used an amino acid 78 - 79 substitution mutant to determine whether these amino acids were important for interaction with other MRV proteins and if a virus containing these mutations was replication competent. To determine how MRV proteins are able to be preferentially translated at late times in infection, we created plasmids that contained different combinations of viral or non-viral sequence, UTR lengths, and mRNA modifications (cap, poly A tail). Using these plasmids and a non-radioactive protein labeling system, we viewed the ability of samples transfected with our plasmids to escape translational shutoff {{in the presence of}} either the oxidative stressor sodium arsenite or viral infection...|$|R
