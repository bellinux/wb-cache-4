50|$|<b>Snap</b> <b>action</b> {{thermostats}} are {{the most}} common control used in heavy duty commercial griddles with medium-to-heavy production demands. These controls are called “snap action” because the control mechanism will turn the burner valve or electrical element fully on or completely off, with no modulation or intermediate heat source operation - effectively ‘snapping’ the heat source on or off. While not as responsive as solid state controls, <b>snap</b> <b>action</b> controls can maintain a griddle surface temperature within +/- 15°F (8°C) of set point if the thermostat bulb is embedded assuming a 1-inch (25mm) thick steel plate. This operating temperature range may be pushed to +/- 20 to 25°F (10°C to 13°C) if the probe is bottom mounted due to the additional thermal hysteresis introduced by the plate material.|$|R

50|$|Open knife {{switches}} were {{supplanted by}} safety switches with current carrying contacts inside a metal enclosure {{which can only}} be opened by switching off the power. In modern applications, automatic switches (such as contactors or relays), and manual switches such as circuit breakers are used. These devices use a <b>snap</b> <b>action</b> mechanism which opens the switch contacts rapidly, and feature an arc chute where the arc caused by opening the switch is quenched. These devices also prevent injury due to accidental contact, as all of the current carrying metal parts of the switch are hidden within or surrounded by insulating guards.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{construction}} of many small switches, the spring that stores the mechanical energy necessary for the <b>snap</b> <b>action</b> of the switch mechanism is made of a beryllium copper alloy that is hardened to form a spring {{as part of the}} fabrication of the contact. The same part often also forms the body of the contact itself, and is thus the current path. Abusing the switch mechanism to hold the contacts in a transition state, or severely overloading the switch, will heat and thus anneal the spring, reducing or eliminating the [...] "snap action" [...] of the switch, leading to slower transitions, more energy dissipated in the switch, and progressive failure.|$|R

50|$|<b>Snap</b> <b>action</b> {{control systems}} are often run with electricity, where a {{stand-alone}} thermostat {{acting as a}} switch is activated by the capillary bulb fluid. The thermostat switches an electrical signal on-or-off to an associated solenoid valve, controlling gas flow to the burner. This construction allows integration of other control mechanisms into the system, such as pilot flame failure, but {{requires the use of}} components known to be sensitive to high temperatures and water damage. Solenoids and associated wiring are known to degrade over time, even if operating within their design parameters, due to the cumulative effects of thermal cycling and ambient grease and oil coating their surfaces - environmental aspects known to attack the integrity of plastics.|$|R
50|$|A manual {{door closer}} stores the energy {{used in the}} opening of the door in a {{compression}} or torsion spring and releases it to close the door. Some closers allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most door closers use hydraulic (oil-filled) dampers, although spring mechanisms may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for, for example, external doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, something which could otherwise cause damage to the doorset and/or objects and/or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the sweep speed and the latch speed of the door and some closers are optioned with a delayed <b>action</b> <b>valve.</b> The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last third to 10 degrees as it closes and is often set fast so that the door can properly latch closed. The sweep speed is the speed which the door travels at along the first two thirds of its travel and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, one may opt for a delayed action closer. The delayed <b>action</b> <b>valve</b> slows the sweep speed dramatically for roughly {{the first half of the}} sweep range. Door closers which provide this two or three-stage action and close doors at a determined rate are called 'controlled' door closers.|$|R
50|$|Solid-state {{controls}} {{are used in}} gas and electric applications at the high range of the performance and cost spectrum. Composed of two parts, the sensor probe and the control box, solid state thermostats are the most precise control available for griddle operation. The probe consists of two thermocouple wires mounted in a protective capillary tube body that is mounted (typically threaded) into the griddle plate material at a location {{near the center of}} the heating element being controlled. When a temperature variation is detected the probe sends an electrical signal to the control box, which consists of an electrical circuit board that then activates or deactivates the burner system. This control system can respond almost instantly to temperature changes on the griddle surface, which provides a far superior temperature control response to the fluid filled capillary bulb found in Modulating and <b>Snap</b> <b>Action</b> thermostats. Temperature consistency to set point of +/- 5F is typical.|$|R
40|$|The valve, {{especially}} as an overload safety valve for a mechanical press, has a mechanical {{lock on the}} valve piston (1) in the pressure medium flow path between an entry (7) and outlet (9) opening.

40|$|Abstract — The Vehicle {{tracking}} {{system is a}} total security protection and fleet management solution. By using the latest GSM & GPS technology to protect and monitor our car, truck and any other moveable object virtually anywhere and then locate it within a few meters. This Paper presents an automatic vehicle accident detection system using GPS and GSM modems {{with the help of}} piezoelectric sensors and <b>snap</b> <b>action</b> switches which can detect the accident when ever any vehicle or object collides with the vehicle. The system can be mounted with the control system of the car and aware the owner about the location of accident on his mobile phone using GPS and GSM. The system gives the location of the vehicle upon sending a message in case it has been theft. This system also provides an accident prevention using sensors which upon detection of any obstacle can reduce the speed of the vehicle and prevent the accident. The proposed design demonstrates the feasibility of real time tracking of vehicles and enhanced customizability, global accessibility and economical in contrast with existing designs...|$|R

50|$|The {{origins of}} the hammerless shotgun are European but {{otherwise}} obscure. The earliest breechloading shotguns originated in France and Belgium in the early 19th century (see also {{the history of the}} Pinfire) and a number of them such as those by Robert and Chateauvillard from the 1830s and 1840s did not use hammers. In fact during these decades a wide variety of ingenious weapons, including rifles, adopted what is now often known as a 'needle-fire' method of igniting the charge, where a firing pin or a longer sharper needle provided the necessary impact. The most widely used British hammerless needle-fire shotgun was the unusual hinged-chamber fixed-barrel breech-loader by Joseph Needham, produced from the 1850s. By the 1860s hammerless guns were increasingly used in Europe both in war and sport although hammer guns were still very much in the majority. The first significant encroachment on hammer guns was a hammerless patent which could be used with a conventional side-lock. This was British gunmaker T Murcott's 1871 action nicknamed the 'mousetrap' on account of its loud <b>snap</b> <b>action.</b> However, the most successful hammerless innovation of the 1870s was Anson and Deeley's boxlock patent of 1875. This simple but ingenious design only used four moving parts allowing the production of cheaper and reliable shotguns.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} to examine {{overhand}} throwing motions of adult women. Eleven physical fitness test items and measurement of throwing distance (using softball) were administerd to 96 adult female students. The multiple regression equation to estimate throwing distance was calculated by the stepwise method. The differences between estimated distance and measured distance were calculated. Ten subjects with higher residual were selected as Excellent group, and ten with lower residual were selected as Poor group. Overhand throwing motions of selected subjects were filmed simultaneously from side and overhead view by two cameras. Dynamic variables such as displacement, time, velocity, angle and angular velocity were obtained from film analysis. Excellent group showed longer throwing distance (p< 0. 01), while {{there was no significant difference}} in fitness test items between two groups. Excellent group showed higher initial velocity of ball at release (p< 0. 01). Judging from these results, it seems that longer throwing distance was caused by higher initial velocity of ball, and higher initial velocity of ball was produced by rational throwing motions. Characteristics of rational overhand throwing motions of adult women which were verified in this study were as follows: 1) greater backward rotation of shoulder of throwing-hand side in the horizontal plane during preparatory phase (step motion), 2) greater back-swing of throwing-hand during preparatory phase, 3) faster forward rotation of shoulder of throwing-hand side in the horizontal plane during throwing phase (from front foot contact to ball release), 4) skillful whip-like action, 5) well-timed wrist (<b>snap)</b> <b>action.</b> The results of this study suggest that five these points should be emphasized in motor learning of throwing for adult women...|$|R
