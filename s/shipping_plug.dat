5000|$|Ammunition for the Type 3 mortar {{is issued}} disassembled, {{but with all}} {{components}} packed in the same box. To prepare a round for firing, the <b>shipping</b> <b>plug</b> is pulled from the booster cavity, and the fuze locked in place by screwing in the set screw located in {{the nose of the}} projectile. An ignition cartridge then is pushed firmly into place in the base, and the desired number of small powder bags called [...] "increments" [...] are placed between the fins. The fuze is covered with metal foil and has a projecting wire loop which operates as a tear-wire to aid in removing the foil.|$|E
25|$|Those to whom {{goods were}} {{delivered}} were often equally dissatisfied. Instructions were sometimes in Spanish or Chinese, {{making it difficult}} to use the product. Some products were <b>shipped</b> with <b>plugs</b> and internal wiring meant for the U.S. market, making them unusable in Britain (in a few cases, the company did provide a power converter, the FTC conceded). Even products usable in Britain turned out not to have been manufactured for sale there, or in the European Union (EU) generally, meaning they were not covered by manufacturers' warranties.|$|R
5000|$|Hahn {{issued an}} {{executive}} order to require that 17% of all of Los Angeles' energy come from [...] "natural" [...] sources by 2017. He began to convert the city's fleet of vehicles to hybrids and prevented the city from investing in a coal plant in Utah. At the Port of Los Angeles, he created the alternative maritime power program to enable large cruise and cargo <b>ships</b> to <b>plug</b> into clean power while docked at the port, and pledged to make Los Angeles a landfill free city by 2006.|$|R
500|$|Finally, on 13 December, U-43 fired two torpedoes at the unescorted 10,350 ton British {{merchant}} ship Orari about [...] southwest of Ireland. One torpedo hit {{the ship in}} the stern. However, U-43 had no torpedoes left, and the sea was too rough for her to use her deck gun. The crew of the <b>ship</b> managed to <b>plug</b> the hole with tarpaulins, and the ship made it under her own power to the Clyde.|$|R
25|$|The Army Corps of Engineers built a {{cofferdam}} around Maine {{and pumped}} water out from inside it. By 30 June 1911, Maines main deck was exposed. The ship forward of frame 41 was entirely destroyed; a twisted mass of steel {{out of line}} {{with the rest of the}} hull, all that was left of the bow, bore no resemblance to a ship. The rest of the wreck was badly corroded. Army engineers dismantled the damaged superstructure and decks, which were then dumped at sea. About halfway between bow and stern, they built a concrete and wooden bulkhead to seal the after-section, then cut away what was left of the forward portion. Holes were cut in the bottom of the after-section, through which jets of water were pumped, to break the mud seal holding the <b>ship,</b> then <b>plugged,</b> with flood cocks, which would later be used for sinking the ship.|$|R
5000|$|The {{formation}} itself {{resembled a}} [...] "U" [...] shape (thus the crane), with the heaviest battleships {{in the center}} and lighter ships on the wings. There was a turtle ship {{at the end of each}} side, anchoring the flanks. Reserves were placed behind the central <b>ships</b> and would <b>plug</b> gaps as the formation expanded. Ships at the front of the formation would face broadsides to maximize the number of cannons that would be aimed at the enemy. Furthermore, the [...] "U" [...] shape itself would allow for interlocking fields of fire so that many Japanese ships would be enfiladed and hit from several angles. In this sense the Crane Wing formation shared similarities with the late-19th- and early-20th-century battleship tactic of 'Crossing the T'.|$|R
50|$|For several years, Maine {{was left}} where she sank in Havana Harbor, {{although}} it was evident {{she would have to}} be removed sometime. Maine took up valuable space and the buildup of silt around her hull threatened to create a shoal. In addition, various patriotic groups wanted mementos of the ship. On 9 May 1910, Congress authorized funds for the removal of Maine, the proper interment in Arlington National Cemetery of the estimated 70 bodies still inside, and the removal and transport of the main mast to Arlington. Congress did not demand a new investigation into the sinking at that time.The Army Corps of Engineers built a cofferdam around Maine and pumped water out from inside it.
