40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> {{describing}} {{the effectiveness of}} alternative strategies to the detection and management of early occlusal caries and suspected occlusal dentinal caries. Methods Nine detection and intervention decision points were identified as being central to the management of early occlusal caries and suspected occlusal dentinal caries, or suspicious areas. For each decision point, the evidence for effectiveness was assessed, using existing systematic reviews when available, and nonsystematic review methods when necessary. Results For the 2 detection decisions (early occlusal caries and suspicious areas) the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> was weak. Accuracy in detecting early occlusal caries was extremely variable within and across detection methods. Approximately 50 % of suspicious areas identified had dentinal caries. The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> for effectiveness <b>of</b> nonsurgical approaches {{for the management of}} early occlusal caries was weak for all 3 management strategies examined (doing nothing, sealants, remineralization). This evidence suggested that sealants were highly effective, with remineralization reflecting moderate effectiveness. For the management of suspicious areas, the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> was still weaker and reflected the same relative effectiveness. For the surgical management strategy for suspicious areas, operative treatment, the evidence was strong and reflected high effectiveness for preventive resin restorations, but no evidence was available for minimally invasive techniques. Conclusion Identification methods for early occlusal caries are not accurate. The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> for effectiveness <b>of</b> nonsurgical management strategies for early occlusal caries is at best, weak. The available evidence suggests that sealing both enamel caries and suspected occlusal dentinal caries is the most effective management approach if subsequent maintenance of the sealed surfaces can be assured...|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, {{investigators}} from Vanderbilt University under {{contract with the}} Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality performed {{a comprehensive review of}} the scientific literature on ABA-based and other therapies for autism spectrum disorders; the ABA-based therapies included the UCLA/Lovaas method and the Early Start Denver Model (the latter developed by Sally Rogers and Geraldine Dawson).

However, they also concluded that [...] "the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> ... is low", [...] "many children continue to display prominent areas of impairment", [...] "subgroups may account for a majority of the change", there is [...] "little evidence of practical effectiveness or feasibility beyond research studies", and the published studies [...] "used small samples, different treatment approaches and duration, and different outcome measurements".|$|E
2500|$|There is {{widespread}} agreement that p-values are often misused and misinterpreted. One practice {{that has been}} particularly criticized is accepting the alternative hypothesis for any p-value nominally less than [...]05 without other supporting evidence. Although p-values are helpful in assessing how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model, contextual factors must also be considered, such as [...] "the design of a study, {{the quality of the}} measurements, the external evidence for the phenomenon under study, and the validity of assumptions that underlie the data analysis". Another concern is that the p-value is often misunderstood as being the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Some statisticians have proposed replacing p-values with alternative measures of evidence, such as confidence intervals, likelihood ratios, or Bayes factors, but there is heated debate on the feasibility of these alternatives. Others have suggested to remove fixed significance thresholds and to interpret p-values as continuous indices of the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> against the null hypothesis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{growth of}} the {{scientific}} literature in the last 20 years has been unprecedented. For example, the library of medicine now includes {{more than two million}} Neuroscience articles. Anthony Landreth and Alcino Silva have developed a strategy to derive [...] (simplified abstraction) of published articles in Neuroscience that they think could be used to integrate and summarize with more clarity and objectivity what we know, what we are uncertain about and what we do not know in neuroscience. They propose that these maps of research findings would also be invaluable during experiment planning: Understanding more objectively the implications of the millions of neuroscience papers already published would allow neuroscientists to more clearly define what to do next. Landreth and Silva propose that quantitative maps of research findings will be to experiment planning in neuroscience what statistics is to experiment analyses: a tool that will help neuroscientists judge the likelihood that a series of planned experiments will contribute to the research record. As a first step towards the generation of these maps, Landreth and Silva developed a way to classify the many millions of experiments in neuroscience into a small number of categories that are critical for the generation of these maps. To generate these maps, Landreth and Silva also developed a set of algorithms that formalize strategies neuroscientists use to determine the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> in their fields. [...] These algorithms are used [...] to represent the experiments in networks of causally connected phenomena (i.e., research maps). Pranay Doshi and colleagues in the Silva Lab developed a completely free app (www.ResearchMaps.org) that helps researchers generate these maps. Data from individual research articles is entered into a relational database, and the app can generate maps not only for experimental findings in single research articles, but also for combinations of findings associated with different articles. The user can query the app and tailor-make specific maps that can then be used for experiment planning.|$|E

40|$|Forensic {{scientists}} {{have come under}} increasing pressure to quantify the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> their <b>evidence,</b> {{but it is not}} clear which of several possible formats for presenting quantitative conclusions will be easiest for lay people, such as jurors, to understand. This experiment examined the way that people recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (n = 541) responded to 2 types of forensic evidence—a DNA comparison and a shoeprint comparison—when an expert explained the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> this <b>evidence</b> 3 different ways: using random match probabilities (RMPs), likelihood ratios (LRs), or verbal equivalents of likelihood ratios (VEs). We found that verdicts were sensitive to the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> DNA <b>evidence</b> regardless <b>of</b> how the expert explained it, but verdicts were sensitive to the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> shoeprint <b>evidence</b> only when the expert used RMPs. The weight given to DNA evidence was consistent with the predictions of a Bayesian network model that incorporated the perceived risk of a false match from 3 causes (coincidence, a laboratory error, and a frame-up), but shoeprint evidence was undervalued relative to the same Bayesian model. Fallacious interpretations of the expert’s testimony (consistent with the source probability error and the defense attorney’s fallacy) were common and were associated with the weight given to the evidence and verdicts. The findings indicate that perceptions <b>of</b> forensic science <b>evidence</b> are shaped by prior beliefs and expectations as well as expert testimony and consequently that the best way to characterize and explain forensic evidence may vary across forensic disciplines.

It was quite clear to him that Mr. Seely, his own lawyer, did in truth believe {{that there had been}} some form of marriage between him and Euphemia Smith. The attorney had never said so much,--had never accused him. It would probably have been opposed to all the proprieties in such a matter that any direct accusation should have been made against him by his own attorney. But he could understand from the man's manner that his mind was not free from a strong suspicion. Mr. Seely was eager enough as to the defence; but seemed to be eager as against opposing evidence rather than on the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> on his own side. He was not apparently desirous of making all the world know that such a marriage certainly never took place; but that, whether such a marriage had taken place or not, the jury ought not to trust the witnesses. He relied, not on the strength of his own client, but on the weakness of his client's adversaries. It might probably be capable of proof that Crinkett and Adamson and the woman had conspired together to get money from John Caldigate; and if so, then their evidence as to the marriage would be much weakened. And he showed himself not averse to any tricks of trade which might tend to get a verdict. Could it be proved that John Crinkett had been dishonest in his mining operations? Had Euphemia Smith allowed her name to be connected with that of any other man in Australia? What had been her antecedents? Was it not on the cards that Allan, the minister, had never undergone any ceremony of ordination? And, if not, might it not be shown that a marriage service performed by him would be no marriage service at all? Could not the jury be made to think,--or {{at least some of the}} jury,--that out there, in that rough lawless wilderness, marriage ceremonies were very little understood? These were the wiles to which he seemed disposed to trust; whereas Caldigate was anxious that he should instruct some eloquent indignant advocate to declare boldly that no English gentleman could have been guilty of conduct so base, so dastardly, and so cruel! 'You see, Mr. Caldigate,' the lawyer said on one occasion, 'to make the best of it, our own hands are not quite clean. You did promise the other lady marriage.' ...|$|E
