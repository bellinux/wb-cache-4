5|$|The {{level of}} wing sweep, {{the angle of}} the wings in {{relation}} to the fuselage, can be altered in flight at the pilot's control. The variable wing can adopt any sweep angle between 25 degrees and 67 degrees, with a corresponding speed range for each angle; some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing-sweep system to reduce pilot workload. When the wings are <b>swept</b> <b>back,</b> the exposed wing area is lowered and drag is significantly decreased, which is conducive to performing high-speed low-level flight. The weapons pylons pivot with {{the angle of the}} variable-sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> 40°, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured a graceful, 50° swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.|$|E
25|$|The Gull was {{assembled}} at the Kirkham {{facility in}} Garden City, New York and Mitchel Field. It used conventional landing gear, a mid-wing arrangement, corrugated aluminum skins, and a radial engine. The cockpit featured a large streamlined greenhouse bubble with two seats. The large tailwheel was steerable and fully faired. The tail used small vertical stabilizers, with large elevators {{that could be}} <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> in flight. The aircraft profile was not unusual for the era {{with the exception of}} the highly tapered and <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> wings with a large dihedral and large tapered tail surfaces.|$|E

25|$|Designed to meet Air Ministry {{specification}} E.38/46 the P.1052 {{was similar}} to the Hawker P.1040 (Hawker Sea Hawk) in most aspects, with the main difference being the wings were <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> at an angle of 35°. The tailplane was cropped to a shorter span. The first prototype (VX272) first flew on 19 November 1948, and the second prototype (VX279) on 13 April 1949.|$|E
25|$|Once Democrats regained {{power in}} Mississippi, Democrats {{in other states}} adopted the Mississippi Plan to control the {{election}} of 1876, using informal armed militias to assassinate political leaders, hunt down community members, intimidate and turn away voters, and effectively suppress African American suffrage and civil rights. In state after state, Democrats <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> to power. From 1868 to 1876, there were 50–100 lynchings annually.|$|E

25|$|The XP-47B was of {{all-metal}} construction (except for the fabric-covered {{tail control}} surfaces) with elliptical wings, {{with a straight}} leading edge that was slightly <b>swept</b> <b>back.</b> The air-conditioned cockpit was roomy and the pilot's seat was comfortable—"like a lounge chair", as one pilot later put it. The canopy doors hinged upward. Main and auxiliary self-sealing fuel tanks were placed under the cockpit, giving a total fuel capacity of 305U.S. gal (1,155L).|$|E
25|$|The {{front wing}} was {{moderately}} tapered {{with a straight}} leading edge, while the rear wing was in three parts: an unswept centre section, clearing the propeller and supporting the main undercarriage legs, and outer sections from about ¼ span <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> at approximately 30°, supporting large end-plate fins at the tips. The box-like fuselage connected all the components and carried the engine, fuel and cockpit {{as well as the}} nose undercarriage.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{complies with}} the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight category rules. It features an unusual diamond-shaped biplane, strut-braced closed wing layout, a two-seats-in-tandem enclosed or open cockpit, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration. The upper wing is <b>swept</b> <b>back,</b> while the lower wing is straight, but mounted further aft. The two wings are joined by swept tip rudders. The elevons are mounted to the lower wing only.|$|E

25|$|It was a {{parasol wing}} {{monoplane}} of fabric-covered all-metal construction. Its slightly <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> wing {{was attached to}} the fuselage by bracing struts, and its two floats were braced to both the wing and fuselage. It was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engine driving a three-bladed propeller, and could carry a single torpedo or bombs under the fuselage. Defensive armament was one fixed forward-firing machine gun, also two in the rear cockpit and one in a ventral tunnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} two prototypes flew on 22 December 1979, but testing showed that the Epsilon had poor {{handling}} and it was redesigned with a new <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> fin supplemented by a ventral strake and a larger tailplane, while the wing was fitted with elliptical tips increasing the wingspan from 7.40m (24ft 3in) to 7.59m (24ft 11in). The first prototype flew again with these changes on 31 October 1980, and it was soon found that the handling problems had been fixed.|$|E
25|$|New {{sheet metal}} {{highlighted}} by new <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> grilles/headlights, new taillights and revised coupe rooflines {{were among the}} changes to the 1980 Buick LeSabre aside from the complete disappearance of Buick's traditional portholes (the C-body Electra would retain them until 1984). The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models look a little bigger than their 1977–79 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{details the}} {{numerical}} investigation of flow patterns {{in a conventional}} radial turbine compared with a <b>back</b> <b>swept</b> design for same application. The blade geometry of a designed turbine from a 25 kW micro gas turbine {{was used as a}} baseline. A <b>back</b> <b>swept</b> blade was subsequently designed for the rotor, which departed from the conventional radial inlet blade angle to incorporate up to 25 ° inlet blade angle. A comparative numerical analysis between the two geometries is presented. While operating at lower than optimum velocity ratios (U/C), the 25 ° <b>back</b> <b>swept</b> blade offers significant increases in efficiency. In turbocharger since the turbine typically experiences lower than optimum velocity ratios, this improvement in the efficiency at off-design condition could significantly improve turbocharger performance. The numerical predictions show off-design performance gains of the order of 4. 61 % can be achieved, while maintaining design point efficiency...|$|R

25|$|The Congress under Gandhi <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> {{to power}} in January 1980. Elections soon after to State {{assemblies}} across the country also brought back Congress ministries in the state with Indira's son Sanjay Gandhi choosing loyalists to lead the states. Unfortunately, Indira experienced an immense personal loss when Sanjay Gandhi died an air crash while performing an aerobatic manoeuvre on 23 June 1980 in New Delhi. Gandhi by this stage only trusted her family members and therefore decided to bring in her reluctant pilot son, Rajiv, into politics.|$|E
25|$|Like the Tupolev Tu-134, the Tu-154 has a wing <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> at 35° at the quarter-chord line. The British Hawker Siddeley Trident has {{the same}} {{sweepback}} angle, while the Boeing 727 has a slightly smaller sweepback angle of 32°. The wing also has anhedral (downward sweep) which is a distinguishing feature of Russian low-wing airliners designed during this era. Most Western low-wing airliners such as the contemporary Boeing 727 have dihedral (upward sweep). The anhedral means that Russian airliners have poor lateral stability compared to their Western counterparts, but also have weaker Dutch roll tendencies.|$|E
25|$|The Little Toot is {{a single}} seat, open cockpit, biplane with {{conventional}} landing gear. Its design accommodates an optional cockpit canopy. The fuselage is welded steel tubing aluminum covering. The original tail section is a metal monocoque truss section from a Luscome 8A. The wings use spruce spars with wooden ribs and are fabric covered. The upper wing is <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> eight degrees. The lower wing has 2.5 degrees of dihedral with nearly full-length ailerons. The landing gear and wheel pants were sourced from a Cessna 140 tail-dragger. The production cost of the original Little Toot aircraft was 2000 in 1958.|$|E

25|$|Designed by {{the company}} as its Model 74, the plane was an {{incremental}} improvement over the F2B. The Navy-designated prototype XF3B-1 still had the tapered wings of the F2B for instance, but was built as a single-float seaplane using the FB-5 undercarriage. However, the growing use of aircraft carriers took away most {{of the need for}} floating fighters, and by the time other test results had been taken into account, the production F3B-1 (Model 77) had a larger upper wing that was slightly <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> and a redesigned tail with surfaces made from corrugated aluminum. It also eliminated the spreader bar arrangement of the undercarriage and revised the vertical tail shape.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the event, it is hard to {{determine}} if limnic eruptions have happened elsewhere. A third lake, Lake Kivu, exists on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, and contains massive amounts of dissolved CO2. Sample sediments from the lake were taken by professor Robert Hecky from the University of Michigan, which showed that an event caused living creatures in the lake to go extinct approximately every thousand years, and caused nearby vegetation to be <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> into the lake. Limnic eruptions can be measured on a scale using the concentration of CO2 in the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|However, {{his term}} {{was marked by}} {{economic}} depression that had grown out of the Panic of 1873, which Mackenzie's government was unable to alleviate. In 1874, Mackenzie negotiated a new {{free trade agreement with}} the United States, eliminating the high protective tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. However, this action did not bolster the economy, and construction of the CPR slowed drastically due to lack of funding. In 1876 the Conservative opposition announced a National Policy of protective tariffs, which resonated with voters. When an election was held at the conclusion of Mackenzie's five-year term, the Conservatives were <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> into office in a landslide victory.|$|E
