40|$|The unmanageable {{agricultural}} waste comprises {{of structural}} polymers, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin can {{be led to}} pollutions, thus {{it can be used}} as a mushroom substrate. Lignocellulosic materials are most favorable feedstock as renewable and natural resource. Forestry and agricultural practices generated a large amount of ligncelluosic waste and promoted to serious problematic environmental pollution. It can be easily broken down by lignocellulotic enzymes. In this study, an attempt was made to evaluate the effect of various substrates on cultivation of Pleurotus sajor-caju. The substrates used in this study were tissue paper, rice husk ash and rubber sawdust. All of the substrates were added with rice bran and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Then, the mixtures were transferred into plastic sized 8 cm × 4. 5 cm and were pasteurized in the steamer for 1 hour at 60 °C - 100 °C. After that they were cooled overnight at 25 °C - 30 °C. The spawn were inoculated into the bag and incubated in incubation room. The media bags were incubated until mycelium fully colonized and watering was done twice a day. The parameters studies were included <b>spawn</b> <b>running,</b> number of fruit body, total of stipe length, weight of fruit body and biological efficiency. Results showed that the fastest <b>spawn</b> <b>running</b> and highest number of fruits body, total of stipe length, weight of fruit body and biological efficiency are found using tissue paper substrates. In contrast the rubber sawdust showed the lowest values of <b>spawn</b> <b>running,</b> total of stipe length, weight of fruit body and biological efficiency. It can be concluded that the tissue paper is one of promising substrate which can be used in growing of Pleurotus sajor-caju due to lower cost and easy to purchase as compared to other substrates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMushrooms are a {{rich source}} of protein and {{vitamins}} as human food. In view of the growing importance of mushroom in Pakistan, a research study was initiated with the objective to examine the suitability of Oyster mushroom cultivation and to compare the growth and yield of Oyster mushroom in two different areas (Peshawar and Swat, North-West region of Pakistan) with different ecological conditions. <b>Spawn</b> <b>running</b> time, number of crops, stalk height, stalk diameter, cap size, fresh weight, number of production days, and the interval in days between the time of bag opening and the time of starting fruiting bodies formation were among the important parameters investigated in the current study. Stalk height, stalk diameter, cap size and fresh weight of mushrooms were found higher in Peshawar region as compared to those growing in Swat region. On the other side, the <b>spawn</b> <b>running</b> time, formation of fruiting bodies and the number of productions were higher in Swat region as compared to the mushroom under study in Peshawar region.

The training intensity was 80 ％ VCP at the 18 ％ oxygen concentration and 100 ％ VCP at the 16 ％ oxygen concentration. The heart rate on the maximum effort test was reduced after the hypoxic training compared with the level before the training. The SpO₂ on the maximum effort test remained higher until about 10 minutes after the beginning of exercise and decreased more slowly after the hypoxic training than before the training. The workload and VO₂max significantly increased after the training compared with the values before the training (p< 0. 05). These results suggest that hypoxic training is effective for improving the systemic endurance capacity...|$|R

40|$|Storage {{conditions}} of the spawn of edible fungi are of major importance to facilitate the production of mushrooms. Here, standard storage conditions at 10 degrees C or 15 degrees C were used and the potential of colonization of standard European compost by the tropical species Agaricus subrufescens was assessed during the <b>spawn</b> <b>running</b> phase. Two lignocellulolytic activities, laccase and CMC-cellulase, were enhanced after storage compared to control as well as substrate transformation, as described by the aromaticity ratio and a humification ratio calculated from NMR data. This result indicates that mycelium growth probably occurred during storage at 10 or 15 degrees C, leading to a larger amount of biomass in the inoculum. Moreover, the microbial functional diversity of the substrate was favored, showing that the electivity of the substrate was maintained. Thus, these findings indicate that recommendations for the mushroom producers can be established for A. subrufescens cultivation under European standard conditions...|$|R
