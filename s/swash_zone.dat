However, four deaths of an indirect nature were attributed to the hurricane; two of them were related to heart attacks. Numerous people sustained injuries, largely from broken glass or cleanup efforts. Overall property damage from the storm in Florida amounted to $150 million. In the storm's aftermath, a study of the hurricane's effect on aquatic animals living in the <b>swash</b> <b>zone</b> (the immediate area where land and the ocean meet) of Panama City Beach was conducted. The study concluded that compared to 11 consecutive months of data prior to the storm, the <b>swash</b> <b>zone</b> experienced a brief influx of animal species normally found offshore. However, the number decreased to near normal shortly thereafter. Also along the shore, the hurricane dismantled or severely impaired several piers, including the total destruction of a [...] extension of the Okaloosa Island Pier built just three years earlier and part of its original span. A fishing pier at St. Andrews State Park also suffered vast damage, along with another wooden pier at Mexico Beach and the M.B.

50|$|It is {{said that}} conduct of {{morphology}} research and field measurements in the <b>swash</b> <b>zone</b> is challenging since it is a shallow and aerated environment with rapid and unsteady swash flows. Despite the accessibility to the <b>swash</b> <b>zone</b> and the capability to take measurements with high resolution {{compared to the other}} parts of the nearshore zone, irregularity of the data has been an impediment for analysis as well as critical comparisons between theory and observation. Various and unique methods have been used for field measurements in the <b>swash</b> <b>zone.</b> For wave run-up measurements, for example, Guza and Thornton (1981, 1982) used an 80m long dual-resistance wire stretched across the beach profile and held about 3 cm above the sand by non-conducting supports. Holman and Sallenger (1985) conducted run-up investigation by taking videos of the swash to digitise the positions of the waterline over time. Many of the studies involved engineering structures, including seawalls, jetties and breakwaters, to establish design criteria that protect the structures from overtopping by extreme run-ups. Since the 1990s, swash hydrodynamics have been more actively investigated by coastal researchers, such as Hughes M.G., Masselink J. and Puleo J.A., contributing to the better understanding of the morphodynamics in the <b>swash</b> <b>zone</b> including turbulence, flow velocities, interaction with the beach groundwater table, and sediment transport. However, the gaps in understanding still remain in swash research including turbulence, sheet flow, bedload sediment transport and hydrodynamics on ultra-dissipative beaches.|$|E

The results show low medium-term variability, not seasonally distributed, and without a direct connection to changes on average wind intensity. The three morphologies are not interdependent and do not show a clear relation on sediment exchanges between them.

50|$|Understanding the {{sediment}} transport {{system in the}} <b>swash</b> <b>zone</b> is also vital for beach nourishment projects. Swash {{plays a significant role}} in transportation and distribution of the sand that is added to the beach. There have been failures in the past due to inadequate understanding. Understanding and prediction of {{the sediment}} movements, both in the swash and surf zone, is vital for the nourishment project to succeed.|$|E
50|$|The cross-shore {{sediment}} exchange, {{between the}} subaerial and sub-aqueous zones of the beach, is primarily {{provided by the}} swash motion. The transport rates in the <b>swash</b> <b>zone</b> are much higher compared to the surf zone and suspended sediment concentrations can exceed 100 kg/m3 close to the bed. The onshore and offshore sediment transport by swash thus {{plays a significant role}} in accretion and erosion of the beach.|$|E
50|$|The beachface is the planar, {{relatively}} steep {{section of}} the beach profile that is subject to swash processes (Figure 2). The beachface extends from the berm to the low tide level. The beachface is in dynamic equilibrium with swash action when the amount of sediment transport by uprush and backwash are equal. If the beachface is flatter than the equilibrium gradient, more sediment is transported by the uprush to result in net onshore sediment transport. If the beachface is steeper than the equilibrium gradient, the sediment transport {{is dominated by the}} backwash and this results in net offshore sediment transport. The equilibrium beachface gradient is governed by a complex interrelationship of factors such as the sediment size, permeability, and fall velocity in the <b>swash</b> <b>zone</b> as well as the wave height and the wave period. The beachface cannot be considered in isolation from the surf zone to understand the morphological changes and equilibriums as they are strongly affected by the surf zone and shoaling wave processes as well as the <b>swash</b> <b>zone</b> processes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Waves {{observed}} in the inner surf and <b>swash</b> <b>zones</b> of a fine grained, gently sloping beach are modeled accurately with the nonlinear shallow water equations. The model is initialized with observations from pressure and current sensors collocated about 50 m from the mean shoreline in about i m depth, and model predictions are compared to pressure fluctuations measured at five shoreward locations and to run-up. Run-up was measured with a vertical stack of five wires supported parallel to and above the beach face at elevations of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm. Each 60 -m-long run-up wire yields time series of the most shoreward location where the water depth exceeds the wire elevation. As noted previously, run-up measurements {{are sensitive to the}} wire elevation owing to thin run-up tongues not measured by the more elevated wires. As the wire elevation increases, the measured mean run-up location moves seaward, low-frequency (infragravity) energy decreases, and higher-frequency sea swell energy increases. These trends, as well as the variation of wave spectra and shapes (e. g., wave skewhess) across the inner surf zone, are well predicted by the numerical model. 1...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{observed}} difference in sediment transporting efficiency by the swash uprush, compared with the downrush, could be mainly due to greater bed shear stress for a given velocity in the more abruptly accelerated uprush. The bed shear stress generated by an arbitrary free stream velocity time series is modelled in terms of usual wave boundary layer models plus a phase lead (phi(tau) of the bed shear stress compared with the free stream velocity at the peak frequency. With this approach, the total transport amounts in uprush and downrush can be modelled satisfactorily with the same sediment transport formula, {{without the need for}} different uprush and downrush coefficients. While the adaptation of sediment transport formulae from steady flow can thus lead to the right total amounts of sediment moved by this method, the timing of the instantaneous sediment transport rates are probably not accurately modelled due to the highly unsteady nature of the swash and the presence of pre-suspended sediment in the uprush. Nevertheless, the proposed method is a useful intermediate step before we have a complete understanding of sediment transport under very rapid accelerations and of the relative contribution of pre-suspended sediment to the onshore sediment transport in <b>swash</b> <b>zones.</b> (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Tropical scleractinian corals are {{particularly}} vulnerable to global warming as elevated sea surface temperatures (SST) disrupt the delicate balance between the coral host and their algal endosymbionts, leading to symbiont expulsion, mass bleaching and mortality. While satellite sensing of SST has proven a good predictor of coral bleaching at the regional scale, there are large deviations in bleaching severity and mortality on the local scale, which are only poorly understood. Here, we show that internal waves {{play a major role}} in explaining local coral bleaching and mortality patterns in the Andaman Sea. In spite of a severe region-wide SST anomaly in May 2010, frequent upslope intrusions of cold sub-pycnocline waters due to breaking large amplitude internal waves (LAIW) alleviated heating and mitigated coral bleaching and mortality in shallow LAIW-exposed waters. In LAIW-sheltered waters, by contrast, bleaching susceptible species suffered severe bleaching and total mortality. These findings suggest that LAIW, which are ubiquitous in tropical stratified waters, benefit coral reefs during thermal stress and provide local refugia for bleaching susceptible corals. The <b>swash</b> <b>zones</b> of LAIW may thus be important, so far overlooked, conservation areas for the maintainance of coral diversity in a warming climate. The consideration of LAIW can significantly improve coral bleaching predictions and can provide a valuable tool for coral reef conservation and management...|$|R

50|$|Sediment {{removed from}} the cliffs, brought onshore from {{offshore}} and the sediment supplied by rivers that remains in the lower foreshore zone undergoes longshore transport. The main agents are swash and backwash, which act to move the material {{up and down the}} beach in a zigzag fashion. Almost all of the changes in beach morphology and sediment distribution observed are produced by swash and backwash (Kirk, 1967). The direction and rate of longshore sediment transport {{is a function of the}} angle of wave approach, wave strength and the time between successive waves (Hart et al., 2008). The end result of this is a net northward migration of coarse sediment, predominantly in the <b>swash</b> <b>zone</b> (Hart et al., 2008). This is because only swell/waves moving from south to north are generally strong enough to move large sediment (Kirk, 1967). Sediment {{removed from the}} backshore is predominantly moved offshore rather than along shore as only large southerly storm waves and their subsequent swash, which usually flow perpendicular to the beach are able to reach this area (Kirk, 1967). The direction of wave approach is often relatively perpendicular due to wave refraction. This means that longshore transport mainly occurs in the nearshore <b>swash</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
40|$|Shell {{orientation}} {{experiments in}} a flume, wave tank, field current, and wave enviromnents have yielded abasic difference between wave and current orientations. Rose diagrams of current orieuted shells show one strong maximum; over {{two thirds of}} an assemblage of elongate conical or plate-form shells point into or away from the current, depending on the geometry and mass distribution of the shell. In shoaling, nonswash waves, long axes of the same forms are aligned parallel to the wave crests or ripple marks. Because of currents associated with wave progression, the maxima tend to be skewed, so that a wave orientation pattern forms an obtuse arrow pointing {{in the direction of}} wave progression. In low angle <b>swash</b> <b>zones,</b> orientations show the two maxima of wave patterns, but the shells are aligned perpendicular to the ripple marks by oncoming and outgoing swash. Equant plate-form shells, rollers, and elongate plates and cones with protuberances may develop typical orientation patterns, but commonly show nondiagnostic orientations. Heavy shells fail to develop diagnostic orientations when they become on{rapped in relatively, soft sediment. Shells may become ntangled on pro-jections on gravel and shell hash, thus developing nondiagnostic orientations. Shells are commonly oriented in a stable position by currents, then buried by scour around the shell margins. Under weak waves, cones are buried in wave orientation by detritus on the bottom.

In this paper, we suggest a rational method to determine the frequency cut-off between the low frequency band and the sea-swell frequency band from the cross-shore evolution of the sea surface elevation energy density spectra. Sea-swell wave heights are depth limited, consistent with previous works whereas low frequency wave heights are independent of the local water depth. In models of surf zone hydrodynamics, wave energy dissipation is often parameterized in terms of γ, the ratio of the sea-swell significant wave height to the local mean water depth. The observed values of γ are well correlated with β/kh (where β is the beach slope, h the mean water depth and k the local wavenumber corresponding to the local centroidal frequency and depth) but the linear regression through the data differs significantly from previous work. Finally, the evolution of the energy distribution in both frequency band indicates the local (not only dependent on the depth) behaviour of two phenomena: the phenomenon of merging shocks {{and the distribution of}} low frequency band into two components – principally infragravity motions (0. 005 ≤ f < 0. 05 Hz) or first subharmonic motions (0. 05 ≤ f < 0. 09 Hz) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{migration}} of ridge and runnel systems on mícrotidal coasts {{is a rather}} simple process starting {{with the formation of}} a rídge at the uppcr shoreface after storms and its mígration landwards until it welds onto fue berm. This results in an ideal sequence of structures which ineludes (from bottom to top) : cross-laminated sands (runnel facies); cross-bedded sands with local discontinuity surfaces (ridge facies); and even-laminated sands (berm facies). Larger tidal tange and higher wave activity on mesotidal coasts induce a mote differentiated pattern. At early stages of accretion, the ridge is covered at high tide and éxposed at low tide. Swash accumulates a secondary bar of coarse sediment during low water that is removed snd incorporated in the slip face of the ridge by avalanching during rising tídes. At high tide, large amounts of finer sedíment are brought by waves and deposíted on top of the rídge and in the slip face, generating fining-upward sequences. Erosional low-angle discontinuity surfaces develop during falling tides. Within the runnel, longshore currents are strong enough to build up small megaripples with crests roughly normal to the shoreline and waves induce wave ripples with crests more or less parallel to the shoreline. At later stages of accretion, the ridge is submerged mainly during spring high tide. After the runnel has been filled up, a vertical growth of the new berm occurs associated with finíng-upward sequences due to decreasing energy and shoreward shíftíng of <b>swash</b> <b>zones,</b> during the transition from neap to spring tides.

50|$|Longshore drift affects {{numerous}} sediment sizes as {{it works}} in slightly different ways depending on the sediment (e.g. the difference in long shore drift of sediments from a sandy beach to that of sediments from a shingle beach). Sand is largely affected by the oscillatory force of breaking waves, the motion of sediment due {{to the impact of}} breaking waves and bed shear from long shore current. Because shingle beaches are much steeper than sandy ones, plunging breakers are more likely to form, causing the majority of long shore transport to occur in the <b>swash</b> <b>zone,</b> {{due to a lack of}} an extended surf zone.|$|E

40|$|New {{laboratory}} {{data are}} presented on {{the influence of}} free long waves, bound long waves and wave groups on sediment transport in the surf and <b>swash</b> <b>zones.</b> As a result of the very significant difficulties in isolating and identifying the morphodynamic influences of long waves and wave groups in field conditions, a laboratory study was designed specifically to enable measurements of sediment transport that resolve these influences. The evolution of model sand beaches, each with the same initial plane slope, was measured for a range of wave conditions, firstly using monochromatic short waves. Subsequently, the monochromatic conditions were perturbed with free long waves and then substituted with bichromatic wave groups with the same mean energy flux. The beach profile changes and net cross-shore transport rates were extracted and compared for the different wave conditions, with and without long waves and wave groups. The experiments include a range of wave conditions, e. g. high-energy, moderate-energy, low-energy waves, which induce both spilling and plunging breakers and different turbulent intensities, and the beaches evolve to form classical accretive, erosive, and intermediate beach states. The data clearly demonstrate that free long waves influence surf zone morphodynamics and promote increased onshore sediment transport during accretive conditions and decreased offshore transport under erosive conditions. In contrast, wave groups, which can generate both forced and free long waves, generally reduce onshore transport during accretive conditions and increase offshore transport under erosive conditions. The influence of the free long waves and wave groups is consistent with the concept of the relative fall velocity, H/w(s) T, as a dominant parameter controlling net beach erosion or accretion. Free long waves tend to reduce H/w(s) T, promoting accretion, while wave groups tend to increase the effective H/w(s) T, promoting erosion. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The core samples yielded 121 species representing eight phyla, among which the Polychaeta, Malacostraca and Bivalvia were the most speciose classes, contributing ∼ 38, 23 and 10 %, respectively, to the total number of individuals. The total number of species and mean density of macroinvertebrates at the most protected habitat type (1), i. e. 70 and 209. 2 individuals 0. 1 m- 2, respectively, were far greater than in any other habitat type.

Furthermore, the extents of the differences among the species compositions of the six habitat types statistically matched the extents of the differences among the values for the suite of enduring environmental characteristics that distinguished each of those habitat types. Overall, the species composition at habitat type 1 was the most distinct, containing five abundant species of polychaetes that were adapted to deposit-feeding in calm waters with high levels of organic material and which were rare in all other habitat types. In contrast, the fauna at the most exposed habitat type was characterized by four crustacean species and a species of bivalve and polychaete, whose mobility and tough external surface facilitated their survival and feeding in turbulent waters.

40|$|Beach {{nourishment}} {{is increasingly}} {{used to protect}} public beach amenity and coastal property from erosion and storm damage. Where beach nourishment uses fill sediments that differ in sedimentology from native beach sands, press disturbances to sandy beach invertebrates and their ecosystem services can occur. How long impacts persist is, however, unclear because monitoring after nourishment typically only extends for several months. Here, monitoring was extended for 3 - 4. years following each of two spatially separated, replicate nourishment projects using unnaturally coarse sediments. Following both fill events, the contribution to beach sediments of gravel-sized particles and shell fragments was enhanced, and although diminishing through time, remained elevated as compared to control sites {{at the end of}} 3 - 4. years of monitoring, including in the low intertidal and <b>swash</b> <b>zones,</b> where benthic macroinvertebrates concentrate. Consequently, two infaunal invertebrates, haustoriid amphipods and Donax spp., exhibited suppressed densities over the entire post-nourishment period of 3 - 4. years. Emerita talpoida, by contrast, exhibited lower densities on nourished than control beaches only in the early summer of the first and second years and polychaetes exhibited little response to nourishment. The overall impact to invertebrates of nourishment was matched by multi-year reductions in abundances of their predators. Ghost crab abundances were suppressed on nourished beaches with impacts disappearing only by the fourth summer. Counts of foraging shorebirds were depressed for 4. years after the first project and 2. years after the second project. Our results challenge the view that beach nourishment is environmentally benign by demonstrating that application of unnaturally coarse and shelly sediments can serve as a press disturbance to degrade the beach habitat and its trophic services to shorebirds for 2 - 4. years. Recognizing that recovery following nourishment can be slow, studies that monitor impacts for only several months are inadequate. 12 page(s...|$|R
