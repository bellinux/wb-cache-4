40|$|The thesis {{poses the}} {{question}} of how one can stabilize a state through external intervention without destabilizing sovereignty. The study critically examines the justifications for international and regional interventions in the cases of Liberia and Burundi through a social constructivist framework. The main objective of the thesis is to enhance the understanding of how sovereignty is interpreted during non-aggressive interventions, both from a theoretical perspective through analysis of official discourses and from a practical perspective through interviews with external and internal actors in the field. The thesis argues that it may be more fruitful for future studies to question the aim of these interventions, rather than ask how to improve them. The study finds that rather than reinforce the sovereignty, these interventions <b>neutralize</b> <b>states</b> subject to external intervention {{in the sense that they}} become dependent on external capacity to maintain their stability, thereby maintaining peace and order in the international arena. The conclusion is that these interventions remain both controversial and paradoxical and the stated aim of reinforcing the state's sovereignty is questionable at best.

The transport {{properties of}} pores in a blend membrane are examined. The pores were produced in this membrane by a track etching technique. For this purpose, a thin polymer mem-brane was penetrated {{by a single}} heavy ion of Ni 7 + of 100 MeV, followed by preferential chemical etching of the ion track. Ion permeation measurements show that pores in polymeric membrane are charged or neutralized, which depends upon the variation in concentration of the solvent. The V–I curve at concentration, N/ 10, shows that the pores are negatively charged, whereas at concentration, N/ 20, the linear nature of V–I curve indicates that the pores approach towards <b>neutralized</b> <b>state</b> and on further concentration, N/ 40, the pores become fully neutralized, consequently the rectifier behaviour of pores has been omitted.

40|$|Technical {{strategies}} like {{amino acid}} substitution and residue modification {{have been widely}} used to characterize the importance of key amino acids and the role that each residue plays in the structural and functional properties of protein molecules. However, there is no systematic approach {{to assess the impact of}} the substituted/modified amino acids on the conformational dynamics of proteins. In this investigation to clarify the effects of residue modifications on the structural dynamics of human prion protein (PrP), a comparative molecular dynamics simulation study on the native and the amino acid-substituted analog at position 208 of PrP has been performed. It is believed that Arginine to Histidine mutation at position 208 is responsible for the structural transition of the native form of human prion protein to the pathogenic isoform causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). So, three 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations on three model constructs have been performed. Simulation results indicated considerable differences of conformational fluctuations for Alanine substituted construct (PrPALA) and the analog form (PrPSB) comprising the <b>neutralized</b> <b>state</b> of the Arginine residue at position 208 of the human prion protein. According to our data, substitution of the Arginine residue by the uncharged state of this residue induces some reversible structural alterations in the intrinsically flexible loop area including residues 167 – 171 of PrP. Thus, deprotonation of Arg 208 is a weak perturbation to the structural fluctuations of the protein backbone and the resulting construct behaves almost identical as its native form. Otherwise, Alanine substitution at position 208 imposed an irreversible impact on the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein, which leads to conformational instabilities in the remote hot region comprising residues 190 – 195 of the C–terminal part of helix 2. Based on the results, it could be deduced that the observed conformational transitions upon Arg 208 to His point mutation, which is the main reason for CJD, may be mainly related to the structural instabilities due to the induced-conformational changes that caused alterations in local/spatial arrangements of the force distributions in the backbone of the human prion protein...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 {{chemisorption}} on SrTiO 3 (001) surfaces is studied using {{ab initio}} calculations {{in order to}} establish new chemical sensing mechanisms. We find that CO 2 adsorption opens the material band gap, however, while the adsorption on the TiO 2 -terminated surface <b>neutralizes</b> surface <b>states</b> at the valence band (VB) maximum, CO 2 on the SrO-terminated surfaces suppresses the conduction band (CB) minimum. For the TiO 2 -terminated surface, the effect is explained by the passivation of dangling bonds, whereas for the SrO-terminated surface, the suppression is caused by the surface relaxation. Modulation of the VB states implies a more direct change in charge distribution, and thus the induced change in band gap is more prominent at the TiO 2 termination. Further, we show that both CO 2 adsorption energy and surface band gap are strongly dependent on CO 2 coverage, suggesting that the observed effect can be utilized for sensing application {{in a wide range of}} CO 2 concentrations...|$|R

We investigate the neutralization of NV^- and calculate the ratio of NV^ 0 to total NV (NV^-+NV^ 0) caused by a hydrogen terminated diamond with a surface water layer. We find that NV^- neutralization exhibits two distinct regions: near the surface, where the NV^- is completely neutralized, and in the bulk, where the neutralization ratio is inversely proportional to depth following the electrostatic force law. In addition, small changes in concentration can lead to large differences in neutralization behavior. This phenomenon allows one to carefully control the concentration to decrease the NV^- neutralization. The presence of nitrogen dopant greatly reduces NV^- neutralization as the nitrogen ionizes in preference to NV^- neutralization at the same depth. The water layer pH also affects neutralization. If the pH is very low due to cleaning agent residue, then we see {{a change in the}} band bending and the reduction of the 2 -dimensional hole gas (DHG) region.

The murine macrophage cell line P 388 D 1 or porcine macrophage-monocytes isolated from peripheral blood were incubated with antibody-complexed virus.

Virus-specific structural and nonstructural proteins were synthesized in antibody-complexed virus-infected P 388 D 1 cells, while only nonstructural proteins were detected in porcine macrophage cultures. Negative-strand RNAs were detected in both cell types, indicating that RNA replication had taken place. Cultures of P 388 D 1 cells transfected with viral RNA produced very low levels of infectious virus, and infection with virus-antibody complexes, followed by a brief wash with pH 6. 0 buffer to remove residual input virus, allowed the detection of low levels of productive replication.

40|$|Baroclinic eddies are an {{important}} component of the General Circulation which regulate the extratropical climate by transporting heat and momentum. An idealization of this feedback is provided by baroclinic adjustment theories (Stone, 1978), which envision a linearly <b>neutralized</b> mean <b>state.</b> Based on the Charney-Stern condition, most baroclinic adjustment formulations propose basic states with homogenized potential vorticity. In this thesis we investigate the degree of potential vorticity homogenization in the extratropical troposphere. We show that homogenization is only observed across a shallow region around 700 mb, and propose an adjusted state with homogenized PV at the steering level alone. We demonstrate that this state can be neutral under certain conditions, and investigate its relevance for the equilibration of an idealized model. Because of the role of the PV flux as an eddy forcing of momentum, it is illuminating to describe the equilibration in terms of the redistribution of momentum. This affects both the PV gradient and the steering level of the waves, but the condition of homogenization at the steering level is very robust. In the 2 D problem, a local balance can be written between the dynamical and frictional forcing of momentum. However, in the 3 D problem there is an additional redistribution by a remotely forced meridional circulation. To circumvent this difficulty, we have developed a momentum-based formulation that exploits the interchangeability of momentum and temperature for quasi-balanced stratified rotating flow. By rewritting the thermodynamic equation as a momentum equation, we eliminate the forcing by the mean meridional circulation and formulate a local balance between the eddy PV flux and the non-conservative forcing of momentum. (cont.) This introduces a new variable, which we call potential momentum. The circulation can then be described in terms of the conversion between potential and physical momentum. A major simplification of this formulation is that temperature and momentum can be directly compared. For instance, the surface temperature gradient appears as a momentum source, which helps ellucidate the role of the momentum fluxes and the so-called "barotropic governor" (James, 1987) for the baroclinic equilibration. Our results suggest that mechanical friction might prevent thermal homogenization at the surface. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|A {{considerable}} {{improvement in}} the crystalline quality of thermo chemically grown ZnO NRs with the treatment of high intensity plasma can be explained using the existing literature. In general, ZnO NRs grown by thermo chemical method usually consist of different surface defect states due {{to the presence of}} water and hydroxyl ions, and non-reacted Zn and O ions as interstitial defect states [20],[21]. These defect states probably act as amorphous centers and as results, the as-grown structures exhibit slightly poor crystallinity. Upon plasma treatment, these surface defect states probably released due to the bombardment of energetic nitrogen ions, which also induce the re-crystallization of Zn and O ions. Further, the diffusion of Ni ions into the core-lattice of ZnO probably <b>neutralizes</b> the defect <b>states</b> present in the ZnO NRs. As result, the overall crystallinity of ZnO NRs enhanced with the increase of nitrogen plasma treatment. On the other hand, a possible reason for the formation of Zn 3 N 2 phase could be unintentional raise in temperature during plasma treatment since nitrogen ions can easily replace the oxygen atoms at temperatures higher than 110 °C. Therefore, these analyses clearly emphasized that the structure and phase purity of ZnO NRs remains as same as the untreated nanostructures upto the plasma exposure time of 15  min, and the crystalline quality of 15  min treated ZnO NRs improved nearly by three times than that of untreated ones.|$|R

Consequently, the prabation officer, counselor or social therapist, as reintegration experts with appropriate skills and techniques, are able to bring about a temporal and interpersonal change in an individual. A new image and lifestyle of the person undergoing therapy will be shaped through the strategy of destigmatisation and overcoming stress, i. e. getting out of an oppressive situation. This is a methodical, targeted and organized process, which has specific phases: successful institutional rehabilitation followed by rehabilitation in the open system. Its aim is to prepare an in dividual to change their former image and lifestyle through developing rel evant competencies, knowledge, selfassessment and motivation. Given the above, there should be developed individual rehabilitation programmes, Le. offers of change. The word “offer” im plies that one person proposes changes, and the other participates in the process by jointly determining aims and tasks which can result in the programme implementation. In order for an offer to bring about a real change in an individual’s behaviour, there must be provided proper means and tools necessary to accomplish direct and indirect services of a formative and therapist nature. This can be don e by means of original rehabilitation offers. What is necessary {{on the part of the}} community, however, is a network of institutionalized specialist services as a response to honesty, diligence and usefulness, i. e. axiological paradigm of social identity which is really put into operation...|$|R
30|$|Conceptually, {{existing}} studies {{emphasize the}} arbitrary {{role of the}} Chinese authoritarian state (Cai 2008). This work finds {{that the state has}} adopted mediation as a flexible channeling strategy that successfully the collective struggle of workers after controlling the factor of heavy-handed repression for maintaining social stability that dominated the committees of politics and law. Empirically, this conclusion does not agree that the government can effectively resolve workers’ collective struggles by enlarging the scope of mediation. For a long time, the repression to maintain stability that was led by committees of politics and law did not really play a role; therefore, in recent years, governments began to shift their methods of dealing with disputes from blocking to channeling. All levels of governments, from central to local, were keen to promote a variety of grand mediation mechanisms. However, many grassroots-level mediation organizations lacked sufficient professional legal ability to handle the increasingly complicated labor disputes, resulting in very rough and oversimplified grassroots-level mediation and leaving a large number of labor disputes mediated but not resolved. Moreover, this kind of mediation required excessive involvement of all levels of governmental departments in labor disputes. The arbitrary intervention by the <b>state</b> <b>neutralized</b> the equal and institutionalized mechanism of negotiation and consultation between employees and employers inside enterprises. Over time, the state was required to {{spend a great deal of}} administrative resources on absorbing a wider range of collective labor struggles. Moreover, the state’s stubborn preference of mediation over strict regulation (such as active labor inspections, arbitration awards, the administration of justice, and so on) will in the long run soften the binding power of labor laws and fuel unscrupulous violations by employers. Under the circumstances of irregular grassroots-level mediation, the absence of negotiation mechanisms between employers and employees, excessive political mobilization of administrative resources, and long-range suspension of coercive powers, the rights of workers were not truly protected. Mediation could only help obtain a temporary compromise, rather than play a fundamental role in channeling disputes, which in turn forced the state to mediate selectively according to the scale and intensity of collective disputes—focusing on large ones and ignoring small ones. As a result, although statistically the average scale of collective labor disputes decreased due to the resolution of large-scale collective disputes, in reality, the number of small-scale and individual disputes still remained high. The mass incidents caused by rights-defense activities also appeared to be endless. There have been some signs that Chinese workers have begun to seek solutions outside institutionalized relief channels and are turning to violent approaches. This article thus insists that, in the long run, only by enhancing the capacity to legally handle labor disputes, recognizing the collective rights of workers, and establishing a good mutual consultation mechanism between employers and employees can the state resolve labor disputes without mediation.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{the article}} {{is an attempt to}} evaluate basic legal solutions of the Act of January 28, 1987 on counteracting monopolistic practices (Dz. U. nr 3, sec. 18). This act, unprecedented in the Polish legislation, is part of the economic reform. Polish economy is characterized by a high degree of concentration of production and monopolization of the market. With the increase of legal and economic independence of socialized enterprises more widespread became the tendency to take advantage of priviledged market position and to apply different monopolistic practices infringing the social interest and the interests of other producers and consumers. Such negative phenomena are a serious threat for the present economic reform. Therefore they need to be <b>neutralized</b> by the <b>state</b> through its broad and complex antimonopoly policy. One of the elements of that policy is the Act of 1987. The Act does not fight monopolies understood as organizational structures. The existence of monopolies is neither forbidden by law nor it is subject to legal sanctions. The Act, however, fights the most deterimental external aspects of monopolies, i. e. specific practices and monopolistic agreements. It is the basic purpose of the Act. Another important aim of the Act is protecting competition. The Act encompasses wide subjective and objective range. It is concerned with virtually all economic activity conducted by all legal and natural persons irrespective of the form of property, size or the degree of monopolizing the market since in conditions of an unbalanced market any producer, big or small, may behave or behaves like a true monopolist. The author presents the catalogue of monopolistic practices and agreements forbidden by the Act (Art. 8, 9, 11, 13, 14). He formulates several reservations and doubts concerning the narrow range of forbidden practices and the liberal attitude of the legislator towards the perpetrators of such practices. In particular, he criticizes the solution according to which monopolistic practices and agreements forbidden by the Act are not absolutely invalid (ex lege) but are subject to invalidation by an antimonopoly organ. In the final part {{of the article}} the author discusses the tasks and competences of an antimonopoly organ with respect to counteracting monopolistic practices and shaping the antimonopoly policy (Art. 4, 5). The author critically evaluates the placement of an antimonopoly organ as an administrative organ in the structure of State. In the author's opinion, vesting in the Minister of Finance additional functions of an antimonopoly organ is not the best solution. Rather, a special Antimonopoly Office subordinated directly to the Sejm or the Council of State should have been created.

40|$|This Article {{attempts}} {{to identify and}} clarify what is genuinely new about the 2 ̆ 2 new paradigm 2 ̆ 2 of armed conflict after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Assuming that sound policy counsels treating {{certain aspects of the}} global struggle against modern transnational terrorist networks within the legal rubric of war, this Article stresses that the principal challenge such networks pose is that they require international humanitarian law, somewhat incongruously, to graft conventions-in both the formal and informal senses of that word-onto an unconventional form of organized violence. Furthermore, this process occurs in a context in which one diffuse 2 ̆ 2 party 2 ̆ 2 to the conflict both (1) repudiates a predicate axiom of international humanitarian law and (2) exhibits an organizational structure at odds with the one presupposed by the inherited conventions of war In particular, modem transnational terrorist networks, unlike most nonstate actors of concern to international humanitarian law in the past (including, for example, francs-tireurs, insurgents, and national liberation movements), characteristically repudiate the conventional, 2 ̆ 2 amoral 2 ̆ 2 conception of noncombatant immunity and the triad of core international humanitarian law principlesnecessity, proportionality,a nd distinction-thatf ollow from it. Furthermore, the diffuse, decentralized structure of modern transnational terrorist networks-in contradistinction to the hierarchical, linear structure of professional state armies and cognate private armies of past eras-makes them ill-suited for compliance with international humanitarian law. It also renders deterrence and negotiation-the principal historical mechanisms by which <b>states</b> <b>neutralized</b> threats from nonstate actors-frequently ineffective. Coupled with the increasing availability of catastrophic weapons on illicit markets, these features vastly complicate efforts to adapt the inherited war convention to contemporary circumstances-a periodic ritual that has followed major wars and crises since the advent of modern international humanitarian law in the nineteenth century. For these reasons, international humanitarian law must begin to work out the contours of a voluntarist war convention to govern what {{is likely to be a}} prolonged state of episodic armed conflict with this particular genre of twenty-first-century nonstate actor The conventional regimes governing internal and international armed conflicts should be augmented-but not, in my judgment, displaced- by conventions designed for what may be characterized as transnational armed conflict. Several factors, however, counsel Burkean caution and multilateral deliberation before introducing innovations: the continuing vitality of certain instrumentalist rationales for international humanitarian law, its synergy with international human rights law, and the manifest potential for abuse. I therefore conclude that, in the meantime, (1) any proposed modifications should be incremental, transparent, tentative, and subject to revision as the genuine scope of military necessity becomes clear; (2) the burden of persuasion should be on those who urge such modifications; and (3) insofar as existing law does not clearly govern, sound policy rationales generally continue to commend adherence to the inherited conventions of war...|$|R
40|$|From {{observations}} {{carried out}} with the viruses of Russian spring-summer encephalitis, louping ill, W. E. E., and the Japanese B, St. Louis, and West Nile types of encephalitis, the following facts and inferences have been derived. 1. Russian encephalitis and louping ill viruses showed a close relationship by complement fixation, neutralization, and intraperitoneal cross-resistance tests. Intracerebral cross-resistance tests, on the other hand, failed to reveal any connection between them. Neither Russian nor louping ill virus appeared {{to be related to}} the remaining viruses tested. 2. Japanese B, St. Louis, and West Nile types of encephalitis, as a group, showed a certain degree of group relationship, but it was not so close as that between the Russian and louping ill viruses. In complement fixation tests, besides homologous reactions, Japanese serum brought about reactions with both St. Louis and West Nile antigens; St. Louis serum reacted with Japanese antigen, and West Nile serum with Japanese antigen. In neutralization tests with mouse sera, no relationship was found amongst these three viruses, while in similar tests with either hamster or guinea pig serum,—which gave higher homologous titers,—it was found that Japanese serum protected against West Nile and St. Louis viruses, St. Louis serum protected against West Nile virus, and West Nile serum against Japanese virus. In intracerebral and intraperitoneal cross-resistance tests, no relationship was found to exist between these three viruses. Moreover, the Japanese B, St. Louis, and West Nile viruses appeared to be unrelated to any one of the three other viruses tested. 3. W. E. E. virus stood apart in all tests as unrelated to any of the other viruses studied. 4. The homologous titers of complement-fixing antibodies in mouse sera showed a gradual decline with the passing of time after vaccination, and this loss of homologous titer was paralleled by a similar drop in the titer of the heterologous reactions. In the case of the Japanese B, St. Louis, and West Nile viruses, with which at the start the amount of crossing was not high, a point was reached beyond which heterologous reactions could no longer be detected. 5. A comparison of the specific levels of complement-fixing and neutralizing antibodies for the viruses in mouse hyperimmune sera showed their rate of persistence to differ. Complement-fixing antibodies which had highest titers on the 10 th day, diminished gradually until, when tested on the 50 th day, all titers had reached levels from one-fourth to one-eighth of their values on the 10 th day. On the other hand, the levels of neutralizing antibodies for the same samples of serum were, on the 50 th day, as high as or higher than those found on either the 25 th or 10 th days, save in the case of the Japanese B virus. 6. The state of immunity of animals following vaccination with the viruses discussed was found to be different at a given time, depending on the method employed to determine it. Thus, mice vaccinated with St. Louis virus had positive complement-fixing antibodies on the 10 th day and no <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies. The <b>state</b> of immunity changed in the course of time. For this reason it is felt that in order to detect whether two viruses are related or not, multiple observations are necessary, over a considerable time and employing all available methods of immune comparison...|$|R
