There are two main types of evidence in coinage: coins minted in or for Cyprus, and all coins circulating within the province during Roman times (Parks). After 30 B.C. the nature of coinage became more [...] "Romanized"; coin type and manufacture did not remain <b>static</b> <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> and styles and imagery of coins changed frequently. Provincial coins were minted at Pafos and Salamis, as well as [...] "regal" [...] coins specific to each reigning Emperor in his time (Amandry). The Koinon was responsible for the coinage, as well as the emperor cult and organization of festivals. For a detailed compilation of each type of coin for each Emperor during this period, see Amandry (reference).|$|E

But during the following decade, the size of America's Asian middle class grew rapidly, leading to a sharp rise in applications and admissions, with Asians exceeding 10 percent of undergraduates by the late 1980s and crossing the 20 percent threshold by 1993. However, from that year forward, the Asian numbers went into reverse, generally stagnating or declining during the two decades which followed, with the official 2011 figure being 17.2 percent.Even more surprising has been the sheer constancy of these percentages, with almost every year from 1995-2011 showing an Asian enrollment within a single point of the 16.5 percent average, despite huge fluctuations {{in the number of}} applications and the inevitable uncertainty surrounding which students will accept admission. By contrast, prior to 1993 Asian enrollment had often changed quite substantially from year to year. It {{is interesting to note that}} this exactly replicates the historical pattern observed by Karabel, in which Jewish enrollment rose very rapidly, leading to imposition of an informal quota system, after which the number of Jews fell substantially, and thereafter remained roughly constant for decades. On the face of it, ethnic enrollment levels which widely diverge from academic performance data or application rates and which remain remarkably <b>static</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> provide obvious circumstantial evidence for at least a de facto ethnic quota system.|$|E

A limitation of the simulation model is that processing durations for transportation and production are assumed static. As a consequence, the RLT is independent of uncertainties. Furthermore, the standard deviation of demand is assumed <b>static</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> and as a consequence, the determined safety stock levels are slightly imprecise (see [81] for a related empirical analysis).

If a product {{improves}} upon one ethically relevant dimension, agents may care less about other independent ethical facets of the product. Opting for a product that fulfills one ethical aspect may thus suffice for keeping a high moral self-image in agents, and render it easier to ignore other ethically relevant aspects they would otherwise care about.

In this paper, we examine this overlooked theoretical and empirical puzzle by looking at how reelection-seeking actors adapt their legislative behavior according to the electoral cycle.

Methods: Literature review and critical analysis and synthesis. Results: Traumatic memories are diagnostic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the dual representation theory posits separate memory systems subserving vivid re-experiencing (non-hippocampally dependent) versus declarative autobiographical memories of trauma (hippocampally dependent). But the psychopathological signs of trauma are not <b>static</b> <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> nor is the expression of traumatic memories.
