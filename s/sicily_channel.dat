50|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} petroleum plays in mainland Italy and the northern Ionian Sea, the potential for hydrocarbon accumulation {{in most of the}} Tyrrhenian basin is very poor. This is primarily due to the basin's high geothermal gradient which pushes the oil window to very shallow depths where structural and stratigraphic traps are uncommon. There is, however, active hydrocarbon exploration on the south edge of the basin near the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel.</b> Here, the small Narciso and Nilde fields produce sulphur-rich, light to medium-grade crude oil (API gravity ranging between 21 and 39). The primary reservoirs in these fields are Miocene karstic limestones that are sealed by Pliocene clays. The source of the hydrocarbons is unknown but is inferred to be Mesozoic limestone. Traps are structural in nature and are primarily thrust faults related to the Tunisian Atlas thrust belt.|$|E

The results illustrates that calculated surface temperature and salinity follow the reanalysed data well and with biases of − 0. 4 °C and − 0. 004, respectively.

40|$|The {{island of}} Pantelleria {{is an active}} volcano located in the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> (Southern Italy), {{in the middle of}} a {{continental}} rift system. Since the 1980 s the island was periodically surveyed by using geodetic techniques (EDM, levelling, GPS and high precise gravimetry) to monitor the regional and local volcanic dynamics. Gravity data, collected between 1990 and 1998, show short and long wavelength changes due to the combined effect of shallow and deep sources. They reflect, to some degree, the structural setting of the island as delineated by the Bouguer anomaly field, which indicates that the island is broken up into two main basement blocks. The latter are bordered by two lineaments, probably regional faults related to the global geodynamics of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> Rift Zone. Moreover, the inverse correlation between the gravity and altimetric variations suggests that: i) Pantelleria is kinematically divided in two blocks; ii) the observed behaviour is strongly influenced by the geodynamics of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel.</b> A new interpretation of the fully reprocessed data sets is presented, focusing on the spatial–temporal features of the horizontal ground deformation and gravity changes compared to the Bouguer anomaly and altimetric data. This leads to conclude that volcanism on the island has been probably strongly influenced by the global geodynamics of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> and future eruptions are most likely to occur at the structural boundary separating the two blocks...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> surface {{circulation}} is {{investigated by}} analyzing the outputs of a high-resolution ocean model MED 12 forced during 46 years by the ARPERA atmospheric fields. Applying a neural network classifier, we show that the surface circulation in the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> can be decomposed into 8 modes characterizing the major patterns of that circulation, particularly the Algerian Current separation {{at the entrance to}} the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> the features of the Atlantic Tunisian Current and of the Atlantic Ionian Stream. These modes reflect the variability of the circulation in space and time at seasonal and inter-annual scales. Some modes preferably occur in winter whilst others are characteristic of summer. The mode sequence presents an inter-annual variability in good agreement with observations. The topography of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> sill plays a major role in steering the circulation. In particular the summer upwelling along the southern coast of Sicily, which is present in several modes, could be explained by a large-scale density forcing. A combination of barotropic/baroclinic double Kelvin waves generated on both sides of the sill provides a mechanism for explaining the complexity of the surface circulation advecting the surface waters from the Western Mediterranean toward the Eastern Mediterranean, the most salient features of which are the Atlantic Tunisian Current, the Atlantic Ionian Stream and the Tyrrhenian Sicilian Current which is a new feature highlighted by the present study...|$|E
40|$|Field {{geological}} {{data of the}} Pantelleria Island, a large Late Quaternary volcano {{located in}} the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> rift zone, integrated with offshore geophysical information, are used to derive the structural setting of the Island and the surrounding region, and to analyse the relationships between tectonics and magmatism. Field work shows that the principal faults exposed on the Island fall into two systems trending NNE–SSW and NW–SE. Mapped faults from offshore multichannel seismic profiles show similar trends, {{and some of them}} represent the offshore extension of the Pantelleria Island structures. The NW–SE faults bound the Pantelleria Graben, one of the three main depressions formed since the Late Miocene–Early Pliocene within the African continental platform, which compose the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> rift zone. A 3 -D Moho depth geometry, derived from inversion of Bouguer gravity data, shows a significant uplift of the discontinuity up to 16 – 17 km beneath the westernmost part of the Pantelleria Graben and beneath the Pantelleria Island; it lows rapidly to 24 – 25 km away from the graben northeastward and south-westward. The Moho uplift could explain the presence of a shallow magma chamber {{in the southern part of}} the Island, where processes of magmatic differentiation are documented. Geological and geophysical data suggest that the northwestern part of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> is presently dominated by a roughly E–W directed extensional regime. Crustal cracking feeding the Quaternary volcanism could be also related to this extensional field that would be further responsible for the development of the N–S trending volcanic belt that extends in the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> from Lampedusa Island to the Graham Bank. This mode of deformation is confirmed also by geodetic data. This implies that in the northwestern part of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> the E–W extension replaced the NE–SW crustal stretching that originated the NW-trending tectonic depressions constituting the rift zone. © 2008 Elsevier B.

Assemblages are dominated by placoliths, mostly Emiliania huxleyi, while, at least in the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> sediments, Florisphaera profunda was {{an important part of the}} coccolithophore community. The paleoenvironmental reconstruction, based on ecological preference of species and groups, suggests that the Tyrrhenian core C 90 - 1 M maintained higher productivity levels over recent centuries, with respect to the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> sites, possibly because of more pronounced winter phytoplankton blooms, in agreement with modern primary productivity variations over the last ten years. The lowermost part of the record of one of the cores from the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> Station 407, which extends down to 1650 AD, is characterized by drastic changes in productivity. Specifically, below 1850 AD, the decrease in abundance of F. profunda and the increase of placoliths, suggest increased productivity. The chronology of this change is related to the main phase of the Little Ice Age, which might have impacted the hydrography of the southern coast of Sicily and promoted vertical mixing in the water column. The comparison with climatic forcings points out the importance of stronger and prolonged northerlies, together with decreased solar irradiance. The identification of the LIA in the northern <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> cover the Bond cycle BO that was missing in a previous study of Holocene climatic anomalies in the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel.</b> Finally, we suggest that major abundance changes in reworked nannofossil specimens, recorded in the Tyrrhenian core C 90 - 1 M, might be linked to variations in terrigenous supply from land. Paradoxically, higher amounts of reworking correspond to dry periods. We argue that soil and rock vulnerability is enhanced during times of prolonged drought and vegetation cover loss...|$|E
40|$|The Istituto Nazionale di Geofsica e Vulcanologia – Osservatorio Etneo INGV-OE) {{manages a}} {{permanent}} local seismic network in Eastern Sicily, {{with the aim}} of monitoring the main tectonic areas (Iblei, Peloritani) and active Sicilian volcanoes (Etna, Vulcano, Stromboli). This network enables locating low magnitude earthquakes and detecting low energy signals that are typical of active volcanic areas (e. g. volcanic tremor, explosion quakes, LP events). Apart from Mt. Etna and the Aeolian islands, another area characterized by active volcanism is the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> with the volcanic edifices of Pantelleria and Linosa islands. The emergence (and subsequent disappearance after about two months) in 1831 of the Ferdinandea island, as well as the Foerstner island in 1891 (about 4 km north of Pantelleria), is the most reliable and recent evidence of volcanism in the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> which is undersea for the most part (Fig. 1). Since {{there are only a few}} onshore areas in the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> it is therefore diffcult to instrumentally detect its seismicity with traditional onshore networks, with the exception of locating the foci of high-energy earthquakes, which often have poor azimuthal constraints. Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) are not widely used owing to the high costs of the instruments and their running. Consequently, seismological knowledge of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> and Pantelleria Island in particular, is still lacking in detail.

Although this region lies on the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> Rift Zone, a seismically active domain of Central Mediterranean, the knowledge about seismotectonic and seismic hazard is not satisfactory. At present, seismic hazard assessment (SHA) for Italy (MPS Working Group, 2004), Tunisia (Ksentini and Romdhane, 2014) and more generally for whole European areas (Giardini et al., 2013) do exist, whereas no specific SHA for the <b>Sicily</b> <b>channel</b> archipelagos are available.

For this reason, in the present study, a theoretical seismic history was derived (Fig. 2) for Lampedusa and Malta, using the European–Mediterranean Earthquake Catalogue (EMEC) (Grünthal and Wahlström, 2012) and the attenuation relationship for macroseismic intensity data by Pasolini et al.

They reveal a regionally coherent current patterns from track to track with a marked inter-annual variability that is unequally shared between the Atlantic Tunisian Current and Atlantic Ionian Stream inflows in the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> and the Bifurcation Tyrrhenian Current outflow northeast of Sicily. Secondly, an empirical altimetry-based transport-like technique is proposed to quantify volume budgets inside the closed boxes formed by the crossing of the altimetry tracks and coastlines over the study area. A set of hydrographic measurements is used to validate the method. The inferred altimetry transports give a well-balanced mean eastward Atlantic Waters baroclinic flow of 0. 4 Sv {{and standard deviations of}} 0. 2 Sv on a yearly basis throughout the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> and toward the Ionian Sea, which is fairly coherent with those found in the literature. Furthermore, the analysis allows to quantify the intrusions of Atlantic Waters over the Tunisian Shelf (0. 12 +/- 0. 1 Sv) and highlights two main modes of variability of the main surface waters path over the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> through the Bifurcation Atlantic Tunisian Current and Atlantic Ionian Stream systems.

40|$|The {{calcareous}} nannofossil assemblages of Ocean Drilling Program Hole 963 D {{from the}} central Mediterranean Sea have been investigated to document oceanographic changes in surface waters. The studied site is located in an area sensitive to large-scale atmospheric and climatic systems and to high- and low-latitude climate connection. It {{is characterized by a}} high sedimentation rate (the achieved mean sampling resolution is < 70 years) that allowed the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> environmental changes to be examined in great detail over the last 12 ka BP. We focused on the species Florisphaera profunda that lives in the lower photic zone. Its distribution pattern shows repeated abundance fluctuations of about 10 - 15 %. Such variations could be related to different primary production levels, given that the study of the distribution of this species on the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> seafloor demonstrates the significant correlation to productivity changes as provided by satellite imagery. Productivity variations were quantitatively estimated and were interpreted {{on the basis of the}} relocation of the nutricline within the photic zone, led by the dynamics of the summer thermocline. Productivity changes were compared with oceanographic, atmospheric, and cosmogenic nuclide proxies. The good match with Holocene master records, as with ice-rafted detritus in the subpolar North Atlantic, and the near- 1500 -year periodicity suggest that the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> environment responded to worldwide climate anomalies.

40|$|The {{seismicity}} of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> {{bordered by}} the Sicilian, Tunisian, and Libyan coastlines, is mainly controlled by active faults of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> rift zone (SCRZ). This region {{is characterized by}} a moderate level of earthquake activity with magnitudes generally below 5. 0. However, most seismicity, especially south of the Maltese islands, has, to date, either gone unreported or been poorly located owing to difficulties in instrumental coverage. Since many earthquakes are recorded only on a single station on Malta (broadband station WDD), it was deemed necessary to develop a routine procedure for detecting and locating earthquakes using three-component polarization analysis. Such a system, nicknamed LESSLA (Local Earthquake Single-Station Location Analyser) has been successfully implemented since 2005. It uses an automated method of recognizing local/regional events based on a weighting scheme applied to triggers in different sampling streams.

Petrological evidence suggests that the ascent of magmas to the surface was relatively rapid, probably through channels superimposed over the major tectonic discontinuities of the Rift. Major and trace element data indicate an ocean island basalt affinity for Graham and Nameless bank alkaline lavas and a depleted tholeiitic signature for one Pantelleria seamount, which had a shallower mantle source. Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions suggest a heterogeneous mantle source involving both focus zone (FOZO) and high- mu(HIMU) components. Lead isotopic compositions are slightly less radiogenic in the tholeiitic basalt and more radiogenic (closer to HIMU) in the alkaline lavas. We hypothesize that a decompressional melting mechanism affected the mantle beneath the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> at different levels. Our data fit in a regional scenario characterized by the presence of HIMU or FOZO components in alkaline and calc-alkaline volcanics all around Sicily.

40|$|In the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> {{volcanic}} activity has been concentrated {{mainly on the}} Pantelleria and Linosa islands, while minor submarine volcanism {{took place in the}} Adventure, Graham and Nameless banks. The {{volcanic activity}} spanned mostly during Plio-Pleistocene, however, historical submarine eruptions occurred in 1831 on the Graham Bank and in 1891 offshore Pantelleria Island. On the Graham Bank, 25 miles SW of Sciacca, the 1831 eruption formed the short-lived Ferdinandea Island that represents the only Italian volcano active in historical times currently almost completely unknown and not yet monitored. Moreover, most of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> seismicity is concentrated along a broad NS belt extending from the Graham Bank to Lampedusa Island. In 2012, the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) carried out a multidisciplinary oceanographic cruise, named “Ferdinandea 2012 ”, the preliminary results of which represent the aim of this paper. The cruise goal was the mapping of the morpho-structural features of some submarine volcanic centres located in the northwestern side of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> and the temporary recording of their seismic and degassing activity. During the cruise, three OBS/Hs (ocean bottom seismometer with hydrophone) were deployed near the Graham, Nerita and Terribile submarine banks. During the following 9 months they have recorded several seismo-acoustic signals produced by both tectonic and volcanic sources. A high-resolution bathymetric survey was achieved on the Graham Bank and on the surrounding submarine volcanic centres. A widespread and voluminous gas bubbles emission was observed by both multibeam sonar echoes and a ROV (remotely operated vehicle) along the NW side of the Graham Bank, where gas and seafloor samples were also collected...|$|E
40|$|The Mediterranean Sea {{acts as a}} {{miniature}} ocean {{with the development of}} its own conveyor belt. It constitutes an ideal location to study and forecast how the marine environment responds to rapid climatic change. Here we present a palaeoenvironmental study carried out on the sediments of ODP Site 963, recovered in the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> the sill which divides the western from the eastern Mediterranean basin. We focused on the transition between the penultimate glacial (MIS 6) and the last interglacial (MIS 5), between approximately 130 and 115 kyr BP. A novel approach is proposed, taking into account centennial-scale geochemical data on major elements, selected trace elements, and yttrium and REE (YREE). This approach was demonstrated to be suitable to recognize both environmental conditions existing during deposition of the studied sequences and to establish whether diagenetic modifications of the original geochemical signature occurred. Our results highlight the delivery of Fe-rich material to the basin, probably from the arid continental environment of southern Sicily. This phenomenon seems to be interrupted in coincidence with the development of Eemian forests at about 126 - 127 kyr BP in southern Europe. The deposition of weathered products suggests increate humidity in Sicily between 127 and 124 kyr BP. Less oxidizing/more productive conditions characterized the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> sea floor between 124 and 119 kyr BP, while sapropel S 5 was depositing in the eastern Mediterranean. They are evidenced by the enrichment of heavy REE, the decrease in positive Ce anomaly, and a slight increase in excess barium. This implies that oceanographic processes which led to bottom anoxia in the eastern Mediterranean might have had an impact even on the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> environment...|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} of 67 calcareous nannofossil assemblages from surface sediments recovered {{in a wide}} area across the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> {{has been carried out}} in order to improve the interpretation of palaeontological data based on this planktonic group in a key area for Mediterranean palaeoceanographic studies. The investigation focused on three case studies that demonstrate the high potentiality of such a combined approach, taking into account the recent distribution of taxa or groups of taxa on the sea floor and the palaeontological record. The distribution of reworked specimens over the northern <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> sea floor validates the role of southern Sicily as a source region for reworked nannofossils and the role of rivers as their carrier. Eustatic sea-level fluctuations can be considered to be the main factor that influenced the abundance variations in sedimentary sequences of this area. The distribution of Florisphaera profunda can be explained in terms of topography (positive correlation) and mesoscale oceanographic circulation. In particular, its significant anti-correlation to the amount of chlorophyll-A deduced by satellite imagery validates the use of this species as a proxy for palaeoproductivity reconstructions. Finally, high abundance values of G. oceanica are confined to thewesternmost part of the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> coinciding with a water mass salinity minimum. In particular, abundances of up to about 10 % were observed in the westernmost part of the African Margin, suggesting the importance of the Atlantic Tunisian Current, whose activity is more pronounced in winter. The comparison of data of this species between 135 and 110 kyr BP, inside and outside the Channel, led us to deduce that the physical transport in almost unmodified waters of Atlantic origin might be the most important factor for its significant occurrence...|$|E
40|$|The Little Ice Age (LIA) is {{the last}} episode {{of a series of}} Holocene climatic anomalies. There is still little {{knowledge}} on the response of the marine environment to the pronounced cooling of the LIA and to the transition towards the 20 th century global warming. Here we present decadal-scale coccolithophore data from four short cores recovered from the central Mediterranean Sea (northern <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel</b> and Tyrrhenian Sea), which on the basis of 210 Pb activity span the last 200 – 350 years. The lowermost part of the record of one of the cores from the <b>Sicily</b> <b>Channel,</b> Station 407, which extends down to 1650 AD, is characterized by drastic changes in productivity. Specifically, below 1850 AD, the decrease in abundance of F. profunda and the increase of placoliths, suggest increased productivity. The chronology of this change is related to the main phase of the Little Ice Age, which might have impacted the hydrography of the southern coast of Sicily and promoted vertical mixing in the water column. The comparison with climatic forcings points out the importance of stronger and prolonged northerly winds, together with decreased solar irradiance...|$|E
