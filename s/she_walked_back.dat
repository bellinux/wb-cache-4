60|$|<b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> {{toward the}} house, {{and he went}} on. Half an hour later he met Millicent, who stopped to greet him.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Dale, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> {{to her own}} house, {{acknowledged}} to herself that her brother-in-law's manner was different to her from anything that she had hitherto known of him.|$|E
60|$|Tess {{went as far}} as the corner. She {{had done}} all she could do; but {{determined}} not to escape present trepidation at the expense of future distress, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> again quite past the house, looking up at all the windows.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have such}} a number of apartments. My servant will show them to you." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> with great state to her chair by the window, and resumes her station and work there.|$|R
50|$|F.B.I. agent Donna Kiel {{confirms}} {{the identity of}} the victim of the serial killer, making a snide remark about one less actor in Hollywood. The victim was killed by wounds caused by claws. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> to her office and it shows numerous pictures of Daken on her wall, indicating that Daken is considered a prime suspect for the serial killings.|$|R
60|$|She was careful. The {{door closed}} behind {{her and she was}} alone in the little green close. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>back</b> through the farmyard; she was pensive.|$|R
60|$|The child {{eyed him}} for a moment, {{conscious}} of something which she had never noticed in him before, and puzzled by the discovery. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back,</b> cowed and silent, to the door. He followed her and spoke to Mrs. Presty.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so {{you choose}} {{the time when you}} are with me to think! Thank you, John! You had better think, at present," [...] and, rising from the seat she had just taken, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the house again, {{regardless}} of John's explanations and shouts.|$|E
60|$|Benita sat by {{the lake}} till the {{twilight}} fell, and the wild geese began to flight over her. Then <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the house thinking no more of Heer Meyer, thinking only that she was weary of this place {{in which there was}} nothing to occupy her mind and distract it from its ever present sorrow.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> {{into the}} city, bloodied and disorientated. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> into the Jefferson Parish Police Department, {{immediately}} having guns drawn on her. Upon {{discovery of the}} twenty to thirty bodies at Honey Island Swamp, she is placed as the prime suspect in the murders by Sheriff Fowler (Zach Galligan), even after telling him numerous times about {{the events of the}} last two films. The Sheriff heads out to the swamp with the paramedics and fire department, leaving Deputy Winslow (Robert Diago DoQui) in charge of the station until he gets back.|$|R
50|$|Her {{right arm}} {{can be seen}} going up to her head, and then she turns to {{re-enter}} the cab, putting {{both hands on the}} side of the door. She then goes to the control panel, presses many more buttons, some more than once, and then returns to the wall she had come into the elevator from, putting both hands over her ears again briefly as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> to the section of wall she had been standing against before. The door remains open.|$|R
5000|$|While Hanna, Emily, and Alison enter Sara's {{hotel room}} closet in [...] "We've All Got Baggage", Alex, clothed as a maid, walks into another room. As the Liars escape, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> {{into the room}} after having heard them making noise, and removes her disguise. Still wearing the maid gloves during the episode's {{concluding}} sequence, Alex reads a manual to a universal remote control. Next to them, is a slice of white wedding cake meaning they likely attended Byron and Ella's wedding.|$|R
60|$|He tore {{himself from}} {{her as he}} spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his {{resolution}} might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah.|$|E
60|$|A {{new light}} shone into the room. She {{seemed to be}} {{breathing}} a different atmosphere--the atmosphere of hope. She listened no longer with horror for a creaking upon the stairs. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> and forth until she was exhausted.... Curiously enough, when the end came she was asleep, crouched upon the bed and dreaming wildly. She sprang up to find Inspector French, with a policeman behind him, standing upon the threshold.|$|E
60|$|The {{second cousin}} of Carol's sister's husband lived in Winnetka, and once invited {{her out to}} Sunday dinner. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> through Wilmette and Evanston, {{discovered}} new forms of suburban architecture, and remembered her desire to recreate villages. She decided that she would give up library work and, by a miracle whose nature was not very clearly revealed to her, turn a prairie town into Georgian houses and Japanese bungalows.|$|E
50|$|Three bandit scouts are spotted. Two are killed, {{while another}} reveals the {{location}} of their camp. Against {{the wishes of the}} samurai, the villagers kill the prisoner. The samurai burn down the bandits' camp in a pre-emptive strike. Rikichi, a troubled villager who helps the samurai, breaks down when he sees his wife, who had apparently been kidnapped and made a concubine in a previous raid. On seeing Rikichi, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> into her burning hut. Heihachi is killed trying to save Rikichi, whose grief is compounded.|$|R
50|$|Karas {{calls on}} Farfella who hides Bislane from Avalon while also getting a fake {{passport}} for Ilona. However the mega-corporation's security are also {{closing in on}} the Parisian sewer where Ilona is being held captive. After a short battle, Karas is mortally wounded rescuing Ilona. However she refuses to take the fake passport to start a new life. Instead she tells Karas she wants immortality by giving her discovery to Avalon. Reluctantly Karas shoots her in the <b>back</b> as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> towards Avalon security. CEO Dellenbach watches all this happen through a live feed from one of his men's helmet camera.|$|R
50|$|Toni skips {{practice}} {{and goes to}} stand in the empty pool. As <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> towards the gym, she begins to float in the air. The team watches in shock as she enters the room, floating and flailing her arms with her eyes closed. The film then cuts to shots of Toni and the dance team in uniform performing on the stairs, in the gym, the boxing ring, and in the empty pool. It then cuts back to Toni still flailing in the air, before she falls to the ground. She opens her eyes and smiles.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> {{along the}} shining avenue to her hotel with {{drooping}} head. She knew {{the worst of}} Humiston now. She burned with helpless wrath as she dwelt upon his assumptions of superiority. She hated the whole glittering, unresting, lavish city at the moment, and her soul longed for {{the silence of the}} peaks to the west. She turned to her husband as one who seeks a tower of refuge in time of war.|$|E
6000|$|Again <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> {{with him}} to Dillsborough, passing as they always did across the little bridge. He seemed to be very silent as he went, more so than usual,--and as was her wont with him she only spoke {{to him when he}} {{addressed}} her. It was only when he got out on the road that he told her what was on his mind. [...] "Mary," [...] he said, [...] "how will it be with me if that poor fellow dies?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{sight of}} a face, the slam of a door, are both rather {{destructive}} of exaltation in the abstract; and, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to Chelsea, Katharine had her doubts whether anything would come of her resolves. If you cannot make sure of people, however, you can hold fairly fast to figures, and {{in some way or}} other her thought about such problems as she was wont to consider worked in happily with her mood as to her friends' lives. She reached home rather late for tea.|$|E
5000|$|Having no {{where else}} to go, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> inside and meets Thelma [...] "Sister" [...] Husband (Stockard Channing), {{a woman who}} runs the Welcome Wagon in town and gives her a buckeye tree. Novalee also meets a {{photographer}} named Moses Whitecotton (Keith David) who advises her to give her baby a strong name. Later that evening, Novalee feeling sick, runs into the bathroom again to vomit. When she {{comes out of the}} bathroom, she discovers the store has closed. She soon figures out how to live undetected in the Walmart, spending the days walking around the town and sneaking back into the store to stay the night.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know, Florence,' said <b>she,</b> as they <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to {{the house}} together, 'I did you great injustice? I never {{expected}} you to know or care about poor people.' ...|$|R
50|$|On Sunday, March 7, 1965, Sheyann was the {{youngest}} person to attempt to march to Montgomery. As they left Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> near the <b>back</b> with her teacher.|$|R
60|$|Her {{companion}} got up, {{drew her}} round again and kissed her. 'I {{think you would}} fidget me,' she remarked as she released her. Then, {{as if this were}} too cheerless a leave-taking, she added in a gayer tone, as Laura had her hand on the door: 'Mind what I tell you, my dear; let her go!' It was to this that the girl's lesson in philosophy reduced itself, she reflected, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to Mellows in the rain, which had now come on, through the darkening park.|$|E
60|$|The countess, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> {{with her}} {{daughter}} towards the house, had to bethink herself {{for a minute or}} two as to how she should act, and what she would say. She knew, she felt that she knew, what had occurred. If her daughter's manner had not told her, the downcast eyes, the repressed sobs, the mingled look of shame and fear;--if she had not read the truth from these, she would have learned it from the tone of Fitzgerald's voice, and the look of triumph which sat upon his countenance.|$|E
60|$|The next day, Sunday, {{was one of}} {{the most}} marked in Lily's life. It was the first time she saw Mr. Devereux after his illness, and though Claude had told her he was going to church, it gave her a sudden thrill of joy to see him there once more, and perhaps she never felt more thankful than when his name was read before the Thanksgiving. After the service there was an {{exchange}} of greetings, but Lily spoke no word, she felt too happy and too awe-struck to say anything, and <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the New Court in silence.|$|E
60|$|Honoria never spoke. <b>She</b> rose, <b>walked</b> quietly <b>back</b> {{along the}} beam, passed Argemone and Lancelot without seeing them, and firmly but hurriedly {{led the way}} round the pool-side.|$|R
50|$|In 1907, seven-year-old Oshin is {{sent off}} {{by her father}} {{to work as a}} {{babysitter}} to support her family. Her boss was a timber trader, and despite the physical and verbal abuse from the chief servant at his household, Oshin insisted on enduring it for the sake of her family. A sympathetic local teacher persuades the trader to allow Oshin to attend elementary school and bring the baby along. However, Oshin's classmates bully her and threaten to harm the baby. Oshin reluctantly stops going to school. However, when she is unjustly accused by the family of stealing money, she runs away, and for days suffers through blizzards as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> home to be with her mother, nearly freezing to death.|$|R
50|$|As Jackson stood there, the {{neighbor}} recalled that {{his face was}} “empty of any emotion or feeling or spark of life.” <b>She</b> watched him <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> into his house, come back outside wearing different clothes, and driving away.|$|R
60|$|So {{they walked}} off, and he, at any rate, on that {{occasion}} was a happy lover. For a few minutes,--perhaps for an hour,--he did allow himself {{to believe that he}} was destined to enjoy that rapture of requited affection, in longing for which his very soul had become sick. As <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> with him to the vicarage her hand rested heavily on his arm, and when she asked him some question about his land, she was able so to modulate her voice as to make him believe that she was learning to regard his interests as her own. He stopped her at the gate leading into the vicarage garden, and once more made to her an assurance of his regard.|$|E
60|$|Ten {{days had}} passed, and Mark and Annaple were {{thinking}} {{that they ought to}} return to ordinary life, and leave the bereaved ones to endeavour to construct their life afresh under the dreadful wearing uncertainty of their darling's fate. Still they were detained by urgent entreaties from father and daughter, who both dreaded their departure as additional desolation, and as closing the door of hope. And certainly, even this rest was good for Annaple; and her baby, for whom nurse had discovered a better system, had really not cried more for a whole day than 'befitted a rational child,' said the mother, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to Springfield with her husband in the summer night, after dinner, on the day that Broadbent's negotiations had failed.|$|E
60|$|Poor Mrs. Edmonstone, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> {{from her}} mushroom-field, she little guessed that words had been spoken {{which would give}} the {{colouring}} to her daughter's whole life--she little guessed that her much-loved and esteemed nephew had betrayed her confidence! As she and the girls came up, Philip advanced to meet them, that Laura might have {{a few moments to}} recover, while with an effort he kept himself from appearing absent in the conversation that ensued. It was brief, for having answered some questions with regard to the doings on the important day, he said, that since he had met them he would not come on to Hollywell, and bade them farewell, giving Laura a pressure of the hand which renewed the glow on her face.|$|E
500|$|Previously, Julian {{had been}} allowed to visit his father twice a year by himself, but Lennon complained that during his time with Pang his ex-wife also wanted to be present, saying: [...] "She [...] thought <b>she</b> could <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> in 'cos I wasn't with Yoko!" [...] After his {{reconciliation}} with Ono, he complained again that his son was not being allowed to visit him.|$|R
50|$|In a final flashback, Alice {{stands over}} Barney, {{who is now}} barely conscious. Alice {{believes}} {{he is about to}} die. Seeking comfort, she heads to the church to find a mysterious man in the confessional booth. She enters, and speaks with him, learning that the man used to be a meteorologist working from within the church bunker, and living at the abandoned house where Alice and Barney have been staying. The man is deeply religious, but does not mind Alice's atheism, and respects her convictions. The man advises Alice to go to her husband's grave and speak to him for answers, which Alice does. Speaking to his grave, Alice tells Mark that recently she has been considering suicide. When she receives no response, Alice becomes angry and frustrated. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> to the house and, out of desperation, shoots Barney to end his suffering.|$|R
50|$|Jesse {{attempts}} to leave Pine Valley, but is assaulted and mugged {{by a couple}} {{pretending to be a}} battered wife and her abusive husband. He is rushed back to Pine Valley Hospital, keeping him in town a bit longer. On Valentine's Day, he {{attempts to}} leave town by train. Circumstance leads Angie to the Pine Valley train station as well, at approximately the same time. As she waits for her train, she sees Jesse sitting on another train as it is leaving the station. She chases the departing train, screaming Jesse's name, and collapses onto the tracks in tears when the train continues on and disappears from sight. Dejected, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> to the station. However, the train unexpectedly returns, and Angie is stunned to see Jesse step onto the platform, alive and well. Embracing each other, the couple is reunited {{for the first time in}} 20 years.|$|R
