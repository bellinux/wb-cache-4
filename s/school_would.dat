5|$|A {{direct grant}} grammar <b>school</b> <b>would</b> provide 25% of its places {{free of charge}} to {{children}} who had spent at least 2 years in maintained primary schools, and would reserve at least a further 25% of places {{to be paid for}} by the LEA if required.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{attendance}} {{records for}} the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the <b>school</b> <b>would</b> have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Schwester Selma {{founded the}} Shaare Zedek Nursing School. The idea was {{initially}} opposed by Dr. Wallach, who {{worried that the}} <b>school</b> <b>would</b> emphasize theory over practical nursing, but Schwester Selma's curriculum proved him wrong. Examinations following the three-year course of study were administered by doctors from the British government hospital in Jerusalem. Schwester Selma taught all the practical nursing classes in the school's early years. After her death, the school instituted a Schwester Selma Award, which is bestowed on each year's outstanding graduate.|$|E
5|$|The <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> be {{inspected}} by Her Majesty's Inspectors of <b>Schools,</b> <b>would</b> have {{one third of}} their governing bodies appointed by the LEA, and would require {{the approval of the}} Secretary of State to raise fees or carry out building work.|$|R
5000|$|Nolan was a {{supporter}} of a heavier schedule than most schools at the time, choosing to play twelve games in the 1941 regular season when most <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> only play eight.

On July 22, 2006, the institute merged with OSU's School of Public Policy and Management to become the John Glenn School of Public Affairs; Glenn held an adjunct professorship at the school. In February 2015, {{it was announced that}} the <b>school</b> <b>would</b> become the John Glenn College of Public Affairs in April.|$|E
5|$|The 1879 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1879 college football season. The team {{was the first}} intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy. The team had no coach, as it was entirely student-operated; however, it was captained by squad member Bill Maxwell. The team played just a single game, which was a scoreless tie with the Baltimore Athletic Club. The team was entirely student operated, and was {{not supported by the}} Naval Academy's faculty. The <b>school</b> <b>would</b> not have another football squad until 1882.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, a {{constant}} question {{hanging over the}} Virginia Tech Hokies football team was whether or not star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school. The National Football League requires that players be {{at least three years}} out of high school before they are eligible for the NFL Draft. Vick, who had not played during his freshman year at the <b>school,</b> <b>would</b> be three years out of high school in the spring following the Gator Bowl.|$|E

50|$|The plans {{ultimately}} changed; in December 2008, the McCracken County Public Schools received state {{approval of}} a plan calling for a single county high <b>school</b> that <b>would</b> consolidate grades 10 though 12. Under this plan, the three current {{high schools in the}} county district (Lone Oak, Reidland, and Heath) would each house grades 7 through 9. The current middle <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> house grades 4 through 6. Then, the current elementary <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> house pre-school through 3.

She wrote that despite the intended demographic, older children in elementary and middle <b>school</b> <b>would</b> find the writing humorous, while girls would find the pet characters entertaining the most. The Dove Foundation member Donna Rolfe gave the same set a full five stars.|$|E
5|$|A strict {{conflict}} of interest policy was enacted, and researchers were {{forced to choose between}} the two entities; the initial investors had all kept their faculty jobs, and most returned to them. After the fledgling company's first contract resulted in a $4,000 loss, Robinson bought out {{all but one of the}} original investors and paid them each back their original $100. Robinson left EES and became president and CEO of the new company, which was renamed Scientific Atlanta. Boyd stayed on as a member of the board of directors; Robinson's friend Larry Clayton, previously involved in Robinson's radio business and now having graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in physics, became the head of the new company's research and development. Years later, the <b>school</b> <b>would</b> promote Scientific Atlanta's origins at Georgia Tech, and Scientific Atlanta has been a longtime financial contributor to Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Death Proof and Planet Terror were {{released}} separately on DVD in the United States. The trailers were omitted from Death Proof, {{with the exception}} of Machete which was from Planet Terror. Death Proof was released on September 18, 2007, with Planet Terror following on October 16, 2007. Both were two-disc special editions featuring extended versions of the films. Robert Rodriguez stated in his 10-Minute Film School that a box set of the two films would be available soon, and that his 10-Minute Cook <b>School</b> <b>would</b> appear on it. This release would also reportedly include Hobo with a Shotgun. A six-DVD edition of the film was released on March 21, 2008 in Japan, featuring the films in both their individual extended versions and in the abridged double feature presentation along with previously-unreleased special features.|$|E

5000|$|CASA <b>would</b> require <b>schools</b> to {{establish}} {{memoranda of understanding}} with local law enforcement regarding protocols for handling cases of sexual violence. <b>Schools</b> <b>would</b> forward reports of sexual violence to the police only when the alleged victims wished {{for them to do}} so. The bill <b>would</b> allow <b>schools</b> to institute systems for anonymous reporting of sexual assault. <b>Schools</b> <b>would</b> be required to publish information on their websites about community resources for assault victims. Students reporting sexual assault would be given amnesty for other misconduct, such as underage drinking, that may become known {{as a result of the}} report. <b>Schools</b> <b>would</b> be required {{to establish}} uniform disciplinary procedures for sexual violence with no special treatment for particular classes of students, such as athletes or students majoring in particular fields.|$|R

5|$|Enrollment levels {{held steady}} into the Great Depression; but in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} convert the school into a mental health institution. Students, faculty and administrators organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal. The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the <b>school</b> <b>would</b> be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14â€“5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and {{changed its name to}} Bowling Green State University.|$|E
5|$|From 1865 until 1918, Briarcliff Manor served {{students}} up to {{the ninth}} grade. Before 1918, Briarcliff students who wanted to proceed to high <b>school</b> <b>would</b> attend the nearby Ossining High School. After 1918, Briarcliff introduced an advanced curriculum for high school students. In 1923, four students were {{the first in a}} Briarcliff school to receive high school diplomas. In 1928, with the entrance of additional high school students, an extension was added to the Spanish Renaissance-style Grade School for use as Briarcliff High School. The building was located adjacent to the Walter W. Law Memorial Park. The enlarged school accepted students from Croton, Hawthorne, North White Plains, Valhalla, and as far as Granite Springs.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} went into production, the {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, rather than in Portland, came after debate on how to match the locations that were introduced in the first film. One member involved in the decision process pointed out that Vancouver had been scouted as a potential setting for Twilight, {{and it was only}} because the U.S. dollar had, at that time, dropped below the Canadian dollar that Oregon drew Twilight principal photography to Portland and its surrounding areas. Vancouver was chosen because it allowed a higher production value, while the surrounding areas contained beautiful forests and gray weather. With this decision, however, came the issue of reconstructing key sets that were used in the first film. For the exterior of Forks High School, crew members were able to find a parking lot, but the school's steps needed to be filmed with a greenscreen backing to match those that were originally presented in Twilight. David Thompson Secondary <b>School</b> <b>would</b> then be able to serve as the interior for the high school scenes.|$|E
50|$|It {{was finally}} {{announced}} in the Isle of Wight County Press on 23 May 2008 which <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> be closed.|$|R
50|$|This {{measure would}} allow a created state {{commission}} or approved local school boards to authorize qualifying nonreligious, nonprofit organizations to operate public charter schools, limited to forty schools over five years. Public charter <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> receive standard per-student public school funding and be open to all students without tuition. Public charter <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> be subject to teacher certification requirements, government oversight, and performance reporting requirements, but exempt from certain state laws and school district policies.|$|R

5|$|Overall, the Dartmouth {{football}} program went 23â€“23â€“2 in Wurtenburg's {{five years of}} coaching. The 1898 season was the final Triangular Football League championship the <b>school</b> <b>would</b> win; the conference would become defunct in 1901, two years later. Following Wurtenburg's departure, Frederick E. Jennings, a player under Wurtenburg, would take over the program, leading it to a 2â€“4â€“2 record in one year of coaching. Another former player, Walter McCornack would coach the program starting in 1901, and led the team to a 15-win record in two years. Wurtenburg's tenure as coach has occasionally been remarked {{as the beginning of}} Dartmouth's acceptance as a major team.|$|E
5|$|The 1885 season brought Navy's overall winâ€“loss {{record to}} an even 3â€“3â€“1. It also brought the Academy's record against Johns Hopkins to 2â€“2 tie. The season {{marked the first time}} a team for the Naval Academy would play a multiple-game season. In 1886, their {{schedule}} was expanded from three games to five, and continued to grow through subsequent years. It was the worst single-season record for the Academy until 1888, when they went 1â€“4. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14â€“12â€“2. The <b>school</b> <b>would</b> outscore their opponents 292â€“231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54â€“19â€“3.|$|E
5|$|The Midshipmen's {{loss was}} the first in school history, and ended the team's shutout streak at two seasons. The Naval Academy would not get another shutout until the 1886 season, when they {{defeated}} Johns Hopkins 6â€“0. The 1883 season continued a seven-season, eight-game long rivalry with Johns Hopkins, which Navy would win, five games to four. The 1883 game {{was the first}} win for Johns Hopkins, which had officially started playing football in 1881. 1883 is considered to be the first season played by the Naval Academy, according to the school athletic department. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14â€“12â€“2. The <b>school</b> <b>would</b> outscore their opponents 292â€“231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54â€“19â€“3.|$|E

50|$|The Safe Campus Act {{would require}} a formal hearing before {{students}} could be disciplined for sexual violence. <b>Schools</b> <b>would</b> be required to provide all parties {{with at least two}} weeks notice before the hearing. Both the accused and the alleged victim would have the right to an attorney at their own expense, the right to access all evidence, and the right to cross-examination, although such cross-examination would be prohibited from including any questions on the sexual history of the alleged victim. <b>Schools</b> <b>would</b> be required to ensure that those adjudicating allegations do not have conflicts of interest. Students who are found responsible for sexual violence would have the right to judicial review of that decision. <b>Schools</b> <b>would</b> be required to publish their procedures for adjudicating allegations of sexual violence in their student handbooks.|$|R
5|$|The coroner of Park County, Sharon Morris, {{confirmed}} that the body of Morrison (which had four bullet wounds, three non-fatal from police and one fatal shot from his own gun) {{was still in the}} second-floor classroom as of 6:00 p.m. An autopsy report later revealed that Morrison suffered two gunshot wounds to the head (including the fatal one fired from his gun), two additional in the right shoulder, and a graze wound to his right hand, while Emily Keyes died of a single gunshot wound to the right side of her head. District officials stated that both the high school and Fitzsimmons Middle <b>School</b> <b>would</b> be closed for September 28 and September 29; a counseling center set up at a local church would open at 7:00 a.m. for students.|$|E
5|$|By August, the {{prospect}} of Alabama fielding a football team for the 1943 season was in doubt. On August 17, coach Thomas spoke to a civic group in Birmingham and stated {{he did not think}} the <b>school</b> <b>would</b> field a team in 1943 due to the unwillingness of the Army to change their policy that prohibited their cadets from participating in intercollegiate athletics. On August 23, 1943, the University Physical Education and Athletics Committee officially canceled the 1943 season. The decision was made at that time because only two Alabama players were available to compete on the squad. As the season was canceled, coach Thomas spent his time leading war bond drives and serving as president of the Tuscaloosa Exchange Club during the time the season was originally scheduled. The cancellation marked only the third time since 1892 that Alabama did not field a football team. The only other seasons the Crimson Tide did not field teams were in 1898 due to University policy that prohibited athletic teams from traveling off campus to compete and again in 1918 due to the effects of World War I.|$|E
5|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} 1950s, the John Herron Art Institute placed an {{emphasis}} on professionalism and growth in collections. Wilbur Peat, director of the museum from 1929 until 1965, acquired significant portions of the collection. Peat also made connections with benefactors such as Dr. George H. A. Clowes, Booth Tarkington, and Eli Lilly. Caroline Marmon Fesler, president of the Art Association of Indianapolis, gave a number of artworks in the 1940s, including 20th-century modern artworks and Post-Impressionist works by CÃ©zanne, Van Gogh, and Seurat. After years of debate surrounding expansion and relocation of the museum and school, the great grandchildren of Eli Lilly, J.K. Lilly III and Ruth Lilly, donated the family estate, Oldfields, to the Art Association of Indianapolis in 1966. One year later {{it was decided that}} the <b>school</b> <b>would</b> become a part of Indiana University's Indianapolis campus in an effort to assist with accreditation. That same year it was confirmed that the museum would relocate to Oldfields, with the new Krannert Pavilion opening to the public in October 1970. In 1969, prior to moving to the new site, the Art Association of Indianapolis officially changed its name to the Indianapolis Museum of Art.|$|E
50|$|The {{release of}} the {{calendar}} resulted in several parties opting to hold their nominations on 17 January 2013. The IEBC proposed public school shut down on 17 January 2013, as the <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> be the venue for {{a significant number of}} nomination activities across the country. The Government confirmed that public <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> not open on 17 January 2013. The government later announced that Public primary <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> for the second day (18 January 2013) remain closed to allow party primaries to continue. On 19 January the IEBC indicated that political aspirants who lost during respective party primaries are not allowed to defect and seek tickets on other parties after Midnight on 18 January 2013.
