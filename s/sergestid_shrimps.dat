25|$|The spinner dolphin feeds {{mainly on}} small mesopelagic fish, squids, and <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimps,</b> and will dive 200–300 m {{to feed on}} them. Spinner {{dolphins}} of Hawaii are nocturnal feeders and forage in deep scattering layers, which contain many species. The dwarf spinner dolphin may feed mostly on benthic fish in reefs and shallow water. Off Oahu, Hawaii, spinner dolphins forage at night and cooperatively herd their prey into highly dense patches. They swim around the prey {{in a circle and}} a pair may swim through the circle to make a catch. Spinner dolphins are in turn preyed on by sharks. Other possible predators include the killer whale, the false killer whale, the pygmy killer whale and the short-finned pilot whale. They are susceptible to parasites, both external ones like barnacles and remoras, and internal ones, like nematodes, trematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans.|$|E
5000|$|Vinciguerria lucetia is an epipelagic and mesopelagic species. It is oviparous, {{the eggs}} and larvae {{drifting}} {{as part of the}} plankton. The photophores appear during the course of metamorphosis from larval to juvenile fish; these may be involved in camouflage, species or sexual identification or prey attraction. This fish feed on copepods, krill and <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimps,</b> crustaceans which also tend to make diel vertical migrations.|$|E

A variable complex of organisms, including euphausiids, a <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and mesopelagic fishes, was often common in 12 - and 38. 5 -kHz scattering layers. The depth range of many species was broad, and sometimes the largest catches were made at depths above or below scattering layers.

40|$|The <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Acetes indicus H. Milne Edwards, {{contributes}} to a substantial percentage of the crustacean landings along the Maharashtra coast. Although much information on its distribution and fishery is available through the works of Kemp (1917) and Kuiyu (1966), the larval development of the species has not been worked out so far. The present paper describes the different larval stages of the species from egg through post larva. It is observed that the larva passes through 3 naupliar, 3 protozoeal, 1 mysis and 5 postlarval stages {{in the course of}} its development. A comparison of the diagnostic features of the different larval stages with the corresponding stages of other allied species has been given...|$|R
40|$|Food {{habits and}} daily feeding {{activity}} of fish populations are important ecological variables for understanding {{their role in}} the ecosystem. Diel changes in feeding activity and dietary composition of juvenile whitemouth croaker Micropogonias furnieri, shortfin corvina Isopisthus parvipinnis, shorthead drum Larimus breviceps and of juvenile and adult banded croaker Paralonchurus brasiliensis were investigated from samples taken over a 24 hours period from 4 to 5 September 1987 on the continental shelf off South-eastern Brazil. Whitemouth croaker and banded croaker had a benthic diet based on polychaetes and some caridean shrimps and showed no diel feeding pattern. Shortfin corvina and shorthead drum fed on crustaceans and teleostean fish, the former species primarily on pelagic <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimps</b> and benthic caridean shrimps, and the latter mainly on pelagic <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimps,</b> mysidacean and benthic caridean shrimps. Shortfin corvina is primarily a diurnal feeder, but preyed on some items only at night. Shorthead drum is a night feeder, with minimum stomach fullness values between dawn and daytime, and maximum values between dusk and night time...|$|E
40|$|Although 92 % of {{the total}} volume of the world’s oceans occurs below a depth of 200 m, our {{understanding}} of deep-sea food webs lags far behind that of continental shelves. In particular, {{little is known about}} the exchange of biomass at the interface of continental margins and deep-sea ecosystems. Recent studies suggest that the transport of organic matter from continental shelves may influence deep-sea ecosystems more than previously thought. Here, we present results of a pelagic nekton survey along the southern slope of Georges Bank, NW Atlantic, a transition area between coastal and deep-sea environments. Specimens were collected as part of the Census of Marine Life program Gulf of Maine Area project. Macrocrustacea (primarily <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimps</b> and large euphausiids) dominated the total nekton (all taxa) numbers and biomass. Of the 85 deep-pelagic fish species collected during this cruise, the slender snipe eel Nemichthys scolopaceus (Anguilliformes: Nemichthyidae) ranked first in biomass and second in abundance. Microscopic analysis of N. scolopaceus gut contents revealed a predominance of large euphausiid and decapod prey. Other abundant potential prey, such as zooplankton, fish, and cephalopods, were absent from the diet, suggesting discriminatory feeding. Considering the relative biomass dominance of <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimps,</b> large euphausiids, and pelagic eels in this system, the ecological interaction described here likely represents a major trophic pathway in this and similar ‘oceanic rim’ ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a stomach}} content {{analysis}} of frilled shark Chlamydoselaclrus anguineus is presented based on 139 specimens caught incidentally by <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimp</b> midwater trawlins or bottom gill-net fishing conducted in Suruga Bay from 1984 to 1988. The food items of this shark were mostly decapodao cephalopods and fishes, which were found at the frequencies of 60. 5 % and 10. 5 %. respectively among the stomachs containing food. Food items found in the stomach, except for two cases of common squid Todarades paciftcus were digested {{to such an extent}} that it was not possible to identify the original shape. Thcrefore, species identification of decapodan cephalopods was performed by their beaks. These includcd bathypelagic species as weil as epipelagic species.

40|$|Biochemical {{composition}} and the elemental chemical constituents of the planktonic <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Lucifer hanseni Nobili were estimated during October 1991 - May 1992 from a selected station off p̂in {{island in the}} Cochin estuary. Protein formed the m^or fraction of the organic constituents. Seasonal variation was observed in the protein content. Protein and lipid fractions were inversely proportional. Neither lipid nor carbohydrate appeared to be significant energy sources. Lipid was the most variable component. An inverse relation was evident between the moisture content of the shrimp and its lipid level. Carbohydrate content of the organism was found complementary to its lipid content. Decrease in carbohydrate content was recorded during periods of low salinity. Values of chitin and ash were less variable. There was marked seasonal variation in the moisture content. Calorific content of L. hanseni estimated as 4. 527 k cal/g ash free weight was found comparable with that of other cadidate species selected as live feed.

40|$|Present {{research}} {{records for}} the first time, the occurrence of the <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimp</b> Acetes intermedius in Peninsular Malaysia. A taxonomic account of this shrimp is provided. Notes on its habitat and population characteristics were examined based on 995 specimens collected from the Klebang Besar, coastal waters of Malacca, Peninsular Malaysia during February 2005 to January 2006. Size-frequency distribution revealed that the mean size of females consistently exceeded that of males throughout the year (TL range: 15 - 27. 50 and 13. 50 - 33 mm for males and females, respectively). The overall yearly and the monthly sex ratio {{were in favor of}} females. Asymptotic length (L 4) and growth co-efficient (K) was estimated as 34. 65 mm and 1. 50 yearG 1. The exponent b (2. 979) of the length-weight relationship for males was found near to the isometric value (b = 3. 0) and positive allometric growth was observed in females and combined sexes (b = 3. 227 for females and b = 3. 249 combined sexes). The asymptotic weight was calculated as 211. 21 mg. The overall average growth rate of A. intermedius showed 2. 10 (` 0. 88) mm/month in the coastal waters of Malacca...|$|R
40|$|Genomic DNA of <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Acetes japonicus was {{successfully}} extracted {{by using the}} Promega Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit. Population genetic characterization of A. japonicus along the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia (state of Perak, Malacca and Kedah) was examined using the Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker. Twenty oligonucleotides from operon A kit were used to screen the populations, of which 6 were able to be amplified (OPA 03, OPA 04, OPA 07, OPA 09, OPA 10, OPA 16). The percentages of polymorphic bands of the three populations investigated varied from 57. 77 to 87. 77 %. Genetic distances between populations and cluster analysis from UPGMA grouped the populations into two major clusters. The Perak and Malacca populations were in one cluster, while the Kedah population was clustered by itself, indicating a different population. The genetic distance was highest as 0. 0999 for the Kedah and the Malacca populations while lowest value was 0. 0413 for the Perak and the Malacca populations, which probably have a closed ancestral relationship. The {{results of this study}} suggested that RAPD analysis, if carried out carefully and accurately would give a good indication of the separation between individuals of different populations and is suitable for identification of closely related genotypes...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal dietary patterns, dietary {{attributes}} and trophic guild structure of 12 resident fishes inhabiting the Mae Klong mangrove estuary, inner Gulf of Thailand were examined. Relative diet composition {{was described by}} the points method. Measurements were made also of gut fullness, vacuity index and diet breadth. Interspecific variations in diet were described by Bray Curtis coefficients and grouped, based on similarity coefficients, into eight feeding guilds. Of these, most diets were dominated by <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> zooplankton, phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, shrimp, polychaete, fish and insect. Zooplankton {{was the most common}} dietary item by all fishes examined (25. 2 %). Food intake was low for most fish with fullness values of 0. 58 to 2. 07. Vacuity index ranged from 4. 70 to 58. 23 among species, with indices for most species> 20. Overall diet breadth was relatively low among species and ranged from 0. 13 for Aspericorvina jubata to 0. 46 for Dendrophysa russelli. There was a clearly significant difference in the percentage composition of food items among seasons (P= 0. 001). The results from this study can serve as a reference for feeding ecology of fish in the Mae Klong estuary and in sustainable use and management of fisheries resources in the area...|$|R
40|$|Whale sharks, Rhincodon typus, {{are often}} {{perceived}} as solitary behemoths that live and feed {{in the open}} ocean. To the contrary, evidence is accumulating that they are gregarious and form seasonal aggregations in some coastal waters. One such aggregation occurs annually north of Cabo Catoche, off Isla Holbox on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. Here we report a second, much denser aggregation of whale sharks (dubbed "the Afuera") that occurs east of {{the tip of the}} Yucatán Peninsula in the Caribbean Sea. The 2009 Afuera event comprised the largest aggregation of whale sharks ever reported, with up to 420 whale sharks observed in a single aerial survey, all gathered in an elliptical patch of ocean approximately 18 km(2). Plankton studies indicated that the sharks were feeding on dense homogenous patches of fish eggs, which DNA barcoding analysis identified as belonging to little tunny, Euthynnus alletteratus. This contrasts with the annual Cabo Catoche aggregation nearby, where prey consists mostly of copepods and <b>sergestid</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Increased sightings at the Afuera coincide with decreased sightings at Cabo Catoche, and both groups have the same sex ratio, implying that the same animals are likely involved in both aggregations; tagging data support this idea. With two whale shark aggregation areas, high coastal productivity and a previously-unknown scombrid spawning ground, the northeastern Yucatán marine region is a critical habitat that deserves more concerted conservation efforts...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sergestid</b> <b>shrimp</b> Acetes intermedius was {{recorded}} {{for the first}} time from the Bintulu coastal waters in Sarawak. The morphological characters of the species were examined. Population structure, length-weight and length-length relationship of A. intermedius was estimated based on specimens collected from the site during February-March 2006. A total of 857 specimens (473 males and 384 females) of A. intermedius were measured for the study of size frequency structure. The mean length of the male and female was 25. 6 ± 2. 52 mm and 27. 02 ± 3. 24 mm, respectively. The sex ratio was found to be 1 : 0. 81 (males: females). Total length of female was on an average 1. 41 mm longer than the male (P < 0. 01). The equations calculated for length-weight relationship were W = 0. 0025 TL 3. 1484 (r 2 = 0. 80) for male, W = 0. 0033 L 3. 044 (r 2 = 0. 77) for female. The value of b for males (b = 3. 148) and females (b = 3. 044) were closest to 3 which was not significantly higher than isometric value (3) indicating that the growth in males and females were isometric.

40|$|Using {{data from}} {{electroretinogram}} recordings, we designed a submersible light meter with a {{spectral luminous efficiency}} {{comparable to that of}} a vertically migrating shrimp. Using this light meter on the “Johnson Sea Link” submersible, we were able to ascend with the isolumes (preferred light levels) associated with the <b>sergestid</b> and euphausiid <b>shrimp</b> layers. The speed of the submersible 2 ̆ 7 s movement was recorded and correlated with simultaneous measurements of surface irradiance. In situ measurements of the downwelling spectral distribution were also made with a fiber optic spectrometer. The average measured speed of the sergestid isolume was 8. 8 [*]cm[*]s− 1, while that of the shallower euphausiid isolume was 6. 7 [*]cm[*]s− 1. These values are different from those calculated using average diffuse attenuation coefficients and surface light measurements. This difference was due to the broadening of the spectral distribution of downwelling light above 120 [*]m and to the variability of the diffuse attenuation coefficients with depth. These results clearly demonstrate that when investigating the relationship between light and vertical migration patterns, it is important that: (1) the light measurements be made in situ and (2) such measurements take into account the spectral sensitivity of the eyes of the migrators...|$|R
