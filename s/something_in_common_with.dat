25|$|The {{essence of}} deep-rooted spirit lore is that {{supposed}} spirits {{of one kind or}} another – spirits of the dead, phantasms of the living, wraiths, or nature entities like fairies move through the physical landscape along special routes. In their ideal, pristine form, at least, such routes are conceived of as being straight, having <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> ley lines. By the same token, convoluted or non-linear features hinder spirit movement i.e. labyrinths and mazes.|$|E
25|$|By April 1954, {{the track}} {{had grown to}} 2.23 miles in length and {{within a year of}} the opening meeting had grown again, to 2.761 miles. On Easter 1975, another circuit layout, {{measuring}} 1.654 miles, came into use. Oulton Park is unique amongst the new post-World War II circuits in that it is a true road circuit whilst its contemporaries were, with one exception, converted airfields (the exception being the short-lived Blandford). It has <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> Mallory Park in that it can trace its history back a very long way (possibly as far as Roman times) and is mentioned in the Doomsday Book as ‘Aleton’.|$|E

25|$|Habitus is {{somewhat}} reminiscent of preexisting sociological {{concepts such as}} socialization, but habitus also differs from the more classic concepts in several important ways. Firstly, a central aspect of the habitus is its embodiment: Habitus does not only, or even primarily, function {{at the level of}} explicit, discursive consciousness. The internal structures become embodied and work in a deeper, practical and often pre-reflexive way. An illustrative example might be the 'muscle memory' cultivated in many areas of physical education. Consider the way we catch a ball - the complex geometric trajectories are not calculated; it is not an intellectual process. Although it is a skill that requires learning, it is more a physical than a mental process and has to be performed physically to be learned. In this sense, the concept has <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> Anthony Giddens' concept of practical consciousness.|$|E
500|$|The book {{provides}} {{what has}} been called an idiosyncratic and a combative take on the history of English cooking. The book is unusual as a history in not citing its sources, serving more as an oral social history from Hartley's own experiences as she travelled England as a journalist for the Daily Sketch, interviewing [...] "the last generation to have had countryside lives sharing <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the Tudors." [...] The book strikes some readers as principally a history, but it consists mainly of recipes. Some of these such as stargazey pie are old-fashioned, but all are practical recipes that can be cooked.|$|E
500|$|Peel's {{view was}} contested by Anderson's and Cull's {{belief that the}} series, with its bespectacled main {{character}} of Joe McClaine, can increase the self-confidence of young viewers who wear glasses: [...] "Suddenly they were proud because they had <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> Joe 90." [...] Since the series' first appearance, the epithet [...] "Joe 90" [...] has become a popular term of endearment for both children and adults with glasses reminiscent of Joe's (such as snooker player Dennis Taylor). During UK repeats in the 1990s, similarities were drawn between Joe and then-Prime Minister John Major, also known for wearing large spectacles. Jeff Evans, writer of The Penguin TV Companion, criticises the plot element of the glasses, writing, [...] "Joe simply dons a pair of scientific glasses, making him look like the class swot than a secret agent." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{idealized}} models of communication systems exist, and all may have <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> Starting <b>with</b> Shannon’s communication model {{and ending with}} the OSI model, this paper presents progressively more advanced forms of modeling of communication systems by tying communication models together based {{on the notion of}} flow. The basic communication process is divided into different spheres (sources, channels, and destinations), each with its own five interior stages: receiving, processing, creating, releasing, and transferring of information. The flow of information is ontologically distinguished from the flow of physical signals; accordingly, Shannon’s model, network-based OSI models, and TCP/IP are redesigned...|$|R

500|$|The Historic Royal Palaces curator Lucy Worsley {{presented}} a BBC film, Food in England', The Lost World of Dorothy Hartley, on 6 November 2015. Worsley, writing in The Telegraph, calls Food in England [...] "the definitive {{history of the}} way the English eat." [...] She describes the book as [...] "laden with odd facts and folklore ... a curious mixture of cookery, history, anthropology and even magic, ... with her own strong and lively illustrations." [...] She admits it is not a conventional history, since Hartley breaks [...] "the first rule of the historian: to cite her evidence. She wasn't fond of footnotes." [...] In a year of filming Hartley's places and people she knew, Worsley discovered that [...] "my frustration with her technique as historian was misplaced." [...] Hartley had travelled continually to gather materials for her weekly Daily Sketch column, sometimes sleeping rough [...] "in a hedge." [...] The work is thus effectively, Worsley argues, an oral history, as Hartley interviewed [...] "the last generation to have had countryside lives sharing <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the Tudors." [...] The emphasis on local, seasonal food chimes well, Worsley suggests, with the modern trend for just those things.|$|E
2500|$|Eli Siegel (August 16, 1902 – November 8, 1978) was the poet, critic, and {{educator}} {{who founded}} Aesthetic Realism, {{the philosophy that}} sees reality as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.

40|$|Australia {{at the end}} of the 19 th {{century is}} an {{especially}} interesting case for research on encyclopedias. Significant social changes were taking place. For the first time, a national self-image was developed in Australia and on 1 January 1901, the Commonwealth of Australia was proclaimed in Centennial Park, Sydney. A new nation was born. The nation has <b>something</b> essentially <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> general knowledge: it is not natural, but constructed. In his famous book about nations and nationalism Benedict Anderson argues that the nation is "an imagined political community". I claim that there are connections between the two constructed concepts of 'knowledge' and 'nation'. In this essay, I would like to show that the Australian Encyclopedia, as a container for knowledge, stands under strong suspicion of being propaganda for the new Australian nation...|$|R
50|$|Among Blomstedt’s first {{independent}} {{designs were}} Defence Corps buildings in Jyväskylä and Hämeenlinna, {{but these were}} never realised. During the 1920s Blomstedt {{took part in a}} number of architectural competitions and made his breakthrough, aged 26, in 1926 after winning the competition for the design of Liittopankki (Union Bank) House in Helsinki, completed in 1929. At the same time, he also won the competition for the design of the Finnish Savings Bank in Helsinki, completed in 1930. Both these buildings were designed in the Nordic Classicism style prominent at that time, which had overtaken the Jugendstil style dominant for prominent buildings in Helsinki {{at the turn of the}} century. His buildings from that time are said to be characterised by a “passionate expressiveness”, with his bank designs having <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> also <b>with</b> the American office building style of Louis Sullivan.|$|R

This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.|$|E

2500|$|Tom Roland, {{from the}} Country Music Association International, {{explains}} country music's global popularity: [...] "In this respect, at least, Country Music listeners {{around the globe}} have <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> those in the United States. In Germany, for instance, Rohrbach identifies three general groups that gravitate to the genre: people intrigued with the American cowboy icon, middle-aged fans who seek an alternative to harder rock music and younger listeners drawn to the pop-influenced sound that underscores many current Country hits." [...] One of the first Americans to perform country music abroad was George Hamilton IV. He was the first country musician to perform in the Soviet Union; he also toured in Australia and the Middle East. He was deemed the [...] "International Ambassador of Country Music" [...] for his contributions to the globalization of country music. Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Keith Urban, and Dwight Yoakam have also made numerous international tours. The Country Music Association undertakes various initiatives to promote country music internationally.|$|E
30|$|As Green {{maintained}} {{in his famous}} lecture, ‘Liberal Legislation and Freedom of Contract’: “When we speak of freedom as something to be highly prized, we mean ‘a positive power or capacity of doing or enjoying something worth doing”. This enjoyment was <b>something</b> we experienced <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> others. Measurement of the progress of society was thus by the development and exercise of powers contributory to the common good. Happiness was only a by product of the moral imperative to pursue the self-development and to became a rational citizenao.|$|R
50|$|In his voluminous {{publication}} “Art Today” Edward Lucie-Smith {{writes in}} one of several chapters dedicated to portrayal painting: One of the most surprising changes brought {{by the development of}} art in the last thirty years is that many artists have once again begun to scrutinize the pre-modernist past.“Contemporary artists have, in fact, made an interesting discovery: {{as a result of the}} gulf between 20th century art and art of a distant past, they have found that there is <b>something</b> held <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> all the works of the masters of old - diversity - such as was once attributed only to art that was not of western origin.“ Some - mostly younger - artists are fascinated by this absurd situation. So as to avoid the danger of convention in overly cheap modern academism that runs to weeds everything in an intensely base form, they rather make a radical return to the past.|$|R

2500|$|Nina Eliade {{fell ill}} with uterine cancer and died during their stay in Lisbon, in late 1944. As the widower later wrote, {{the disease was}} {{probably}} caused by an abortion procedure she had undergone {{at an early stage}} of their relationship. He came to suffer from clinical depression, which increased as Romania and her Axis allies suffered major defeats on the Eastern Front. Contemplating a return to Romania as a soldier or a monk, he was on a continuous search for effective antidepressants, medicating himself with passion flower extract, and, eventually, with methamphetamine. This was probably not his first experience with drugs: vague mentions in his notebooks have been read as indication that Mircea Eliade was taking opium during his travels to Calcutta. Later, discussing the works of Aldous Huxley, Eliade wrote that the British author's use of mescaline as a source of inspiration had <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> his own experience, indicating 1945 as a date of reference and adding that it was [...] "needless to explain why that is".|$|E
2500|$|By this time, {{however, the}} taste in French art for a cool and {{classical}} form of Baroque that {{had set in}} from the 1620s was already reducing the appreciation of Bellange, whose reputation continued to fall, along with that of Mannerism in general. For the same reason, there are no artists who {{can be seen to}} have been directly influenced by Bellange's style. Unlike the Dutch and Italians, French artists had no large collection of biographies until {{the latter part of the}} century, but the great print collector Michel de Marolles was aware of 47 or 48 prints by Bellange, most of which were in his collections; these would not be exactly the same as the 47 or 48 in modern works, but very largely so. By the mid-18th century, the great French authority Pierre-Jean Mariette was scornful and dismissive: [...] "Bellange is one of those painters whose licentious manner, completely removed from a proper style, deserves great distrust. It nevertheless had its admirers, and Bellange had a great vogue. ... Several pieces by him are known, which one cannot bear to look at, so bad is their taste". Many biographical compendiums simply omitted him, even as late as the 1920s. Another judgment of 1767 was quoted with approval by A. P. F. Robert-Dumesnil in his biographical dictionary Le Peintre-Graveur Français (1841), complaining that Bellange's etchings had [...] "much more bizarreness than judgment, and very little correctness". However, Robert-Dumesnil did recognise that his style had <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the Romantics.|$|E

Afterwards, Federlin had given her an ointment, which she had used to hurt people, children and harvests. Since then, she had often visited the Devil, and her demon lover Federlin often visited her and had sex with her, even in the streets at night and in prison.

Yantar had three parts: the aggregate/equipment module (AO - Agregatnyy Otsek), the instrument module (PO - Pribornnyy Otsek) and the special equipment module/special apparatus module (OSA - otsek spetsialnoy apparatury). The special equipment module was the part that returned to earth {{at the end of the}} mission, and contained the Zhemchug-4 (pearl) camera. Each section was shaped like a truncated cone which gave the craft a conical shape. The craft was 6.3m long (although one source says 8.5m) with a maximum diameter of 2.7m. It weighed 6.6 tonnes.|$|R
5000|$|The Inquisition denounced them as witches, {{but often}} {{did not take}} these cases seriously as the accused never {{mentioned}} the Devil in their confessions. The Inquisition did occasionally associate meetings with the elves as events similar to a Witches' Sabbath, but as the local population generally held a positive view of the phenomena, the Inquisition did not press the matter. The accused {{said that they had}} become associated with the fairies because they had [...] "Sweet blood", and that in most cases, went to the meetings in a non-corporeal fashion, leaving their actual bodies behind. This is similar to the concept of astral projection and was <b>something</b> they had <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the Benandanti, a related group that also faced scrutiny by the Inquisition.|$|R
2500|$|Stevens {{also took}} part—illegally—in {{lobbying}} for the statehood bill, {{working closely with}} the Alaska Statehood Committee from his office at Interior. Stevens hired Margaret Atwood, daughter of Anchorage Times publisher Robert Atwood, who was chairman of the Alaska Statehood Committee, to work with him in the Interior Department. [...] "We were violating the law," [...] Stevens told a researcher in an October 1977 oral history interview for the Eisenhower Library. [...] "e were lobbying from the executive branch, and there's been a statute against that for a long time.... We more or less, I would say, masterminded the House and Senate attack from the executive branch." [...] Stevens and the younger Atwood created file cards on members of Congress based on [...] "whether they were Rotarians or Kiwanians or Catholics or Baptists and veterans or loggers, the whole thing," [...] Stevens said in the 1977 interview. [...] "And we'd assigned these Alaskans to go talk to individual members of the Senate and split them down on the basis of people that had <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> them." [...] The lobbying campaign extended to presidential press conferences. [...] "We set Ike up quite often at press conferences by planting questions about Alaska statehood," [...] Stevens said in the 1977 interview. [...] "We never let a press conference go by without getting someone to try to ask him about statehood." [...] Newspapers were also targeted, according to Stevens. [...] "We planted editorials in weeklies and dailies and newspapers in the district of people we thought were opposed to us or states where they were opposed to us so that suddenly they were thinking twice about opposing us." ...|$|E

50|$|These {{fundamental}} {{elements of}} the movement meant that they rejected the validity or even {{the need for the}} Church in favor of an individual approach to God.

They also rejected the secular authorities, citing Christ's injunction forbidding oaths and preached an egalitarian approach to Christianity that did not recognise distinctions of gender. Some have seen them as proto-anarchists in their refusal to acknowledge hierarchies of any kind.
