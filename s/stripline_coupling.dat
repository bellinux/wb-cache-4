Quantum non-demolition measurement is accomplished by coherently driving another resonator mode, referred to as the detector mode, and measuring its response. We show that the sensitivity of such a detection scheme {{is directly related to the}} dephasing rate induced by such an intermode coupling.

40|$|In January 2012, the 10 m South Pole Telescope (SPT) was {{equipped}} with a polarization-sensitive camera, SPTpol, {{in order to measure}} the polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Measurements of the polarization of the CMB at small angular scales (~several arcminutes) can detect the gravitational lensing of the CMB by large scale structure and constrain the sum of the neutrino masses. At large angular scales (~few degrees) CMB measurements can constrain the energy scale of Inflation. SPTpol is a two-color mm-wave camera that consists of 180 polarimeters at 90 GHz and 588 polarimeters at 150 GHz, with each polarimeter consisting of a dual transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers. The full complement of 150 GHz detectors consists of 7 arrays of 84 ortho-mode transducers (OMTs) that are <b>stripline</b> <b>coupled</b> to two TES detectors per OMT, developed by the TRUCE collaboration and fabricated at NIST. Each 90 GHz pixel consists of two antenna-coupled absorbers coupled to two TES detectors, developed with Argonne National Labs. The 1536 total detectors are read out with digital frequency-domain multiplexing (DfMUX). The SPTpol deployment represents the first on-sky tests of both of these detector technologies, {{and is one of the}} first deployed instruments using DfMUX readout technology. We present the details of the design, commissioning, deployment, on-sky optical characterization and detector performance of the complete SPTpol focal plane. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures.

50|$|Coupling between {{lines in}} these {{components}} is usually achieved in stripline by running the lines side-by-side for a distance. Coupling between {{the edges of}} the lines in this way is relatively weak and is limited by the closest distance the lines can be set together. This limit is governed by the maximum resolution of the printing process and, in power applications, by the electric field strength between the lines. For this reason <b>stripline</b> parallel <b>coupled</b> lines are used in directional couplers with a coupling factor no more than −10 dB but power splitters (coupling factor −3 dB) use a direct coupling technique. In air stripline there is another possibility, the lines can be stacked {{one on top of the}} other. This broadside coupling is much stronger than edge coupling so the lines do not need to be so close to achieve the same coupling factor. In dielectric supported stripline, this can be achieved by printing the two lines on opposite sides of the dielectric. Broadside coupling can, of course, be achieved in dielectric filled stripline as well with buried line techniques, but that requires additional dielectric layers and additional manufacturing processes. Another technique available to air <b>stripline</b> to increase <b>coupling</b> is the use of thick rectangular strips to increase side coupling. This also makes mechanical support easier because the lines are more rigid.|$|R

5|$|Early <b>stripline</b> {{directly}} <b>coupled</b> resonator filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was reduced and the compactness successively increased {{with the introduction}} of parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} quantum {{measurement}} of a cantilever using a parametrically-coupled electromagnetic cavity which is driven {{at the two}} sidebands corresponding to the mechanical motion. This scheme, originally due to Braginsky et al. [V. Braginsky, Y. I. Vorontsov, and K. P. Thorne, Science 209, 547 (1980) ], allows a back-action free measurement of one quadrature of the cantilever's motion, and hence the possibility of generating a squeezed state. We present a complete quantum theory of this system, and derive simple conditions on when the quantum limit on the added noise can be surpassed. We also study the conditional dynamics of the measurement, and discuss how such a scheme (when coupled with feedback) {{can be used to}} generate and detect squeezed states of the oscillator.

The variable coupling has been achieved by creating chambers in the dielectric material between the two coupled strips. The chambers have the same length and width as the coupled strips. Conductive fluid is pumped {{in and out of}} each chamber leading to a change in coupling between the broadside coupled strips. Conductive fluids like the solution of ammonium chloride or potassium chloride have been used to change the conductivity of the chamber which provides the coupling variation.

40|$|Modern {{communication}} systems require extraordinarily stringent specifications on microwave and millimeter-wave components. In mobile and integrated {{communication systems}}, miniature, ultra-wideband and high performance filters and multiplexers {{are required for}} microwave integrated circuits (MICs) and monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). In satellite communications and wireless base stations, small volume, high quality, high power handling capability and low cost filters and multiplexers are required. In order to meet these requirements, three aspects are mainly pursued: design innovations, precise CAD procedures, and improved manufacturing technologies. This dissertation is, therefore, devoted to creating novel filter and multiplexer structures, developing full-wave modeling and design procedures of filters and multiplexers, and integrating waveguide structures for MICs and MMICs in Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology. In order to realize miniature and broadband filters, novel multiple-layer <b>coupled</b> <b>stripline</b> resonator structures are proposed for filter designs. The essential of the resonators is investigated, and the design procedure of the filters is demonstrated by examples. Rigorous full-wave mode matching program is developed to model the filters and optimize the performance. The filters are manufactured in LTCC technology to achieve high-integration. In order to obtain better quality than planar structures, new ridge waveguide <b>coupled</b> <b>stripline</b> resonator filters and multiplexers are introduced for LTCC applications. Planar and waveguide structures are combined in such filter and multiplexer designs to improve the loss performance. A rigorous CAD procedure using mode matching technique is developed for the modeling and design. To design wideband multiplexers for LTCC applications, ridge waveguide divider junctions are presented to achieve wideband matching performance. Such junctions and ridge waveguide evanescent-mode filters are cascaded together to realize the multiplexer designs. The design methodology, effects of spurious modes and LTCC manufacturing procedure are discussed. Additional important issues of microwave filter and multiplexer designs addressed in this dissertation are: (1) Systematic approximation, synthesis and design procedures of multiple-band coupled resonator filters.

40|$|The never-ending {{pursuit of}} higher power density and {{efficiency}} has driven researchers {{to explore new}} areas of device integration and fabrication of dc-dc converters. To improve power density and efficiency researchers are developing novel components and packaging technologies, with {{the ultimate goal of}} integrating active and passive components together to realise a heterogeneous Power Supply on Chip (PwrSoC).

The tandem-cascade magic tee first suggested by Carpenter is particularly adapted to realization in stripline and is closely examined here. The fundamentals of coupled transmission line theory are briefly reviewed and the scattering parameters for a transmission line coupler are introduced. <b>Coupled</b> <b>striplines</b> are introduced, and methods to achieve magic T performance are discussed.

40|$|Crosstalk {{is defined}} as an {{unwanted}} coupling between the conductors. By this it is meant that signals {{from one of the}} signal conductors (a generator in this case) are coupled to another signal conductor (receptor), or conductors (receptors), depending on the number of conductors {{in the vicinity of the}} generator. Crosstalk in this way affects the signal level on the receptor and thereby affects the total system performance within the system. This can happen in several ways, one of which is through edge coupling. Edge coupling is a process where two signal conductors are placed beside each other in the same layer while the ground conductor could have been placed either under these conductors, in a separate layer like Mclin (Microstrip coupled lines) and Sclin (<b>Coupled</b> <b>striplines),</b> or beside the signal conductors as in Cpwcpl 2 (Coplanar wave guide coupled lines). This then means that edge coupling occurs through the sides where the generator and the receptor are facing each other. Broadside coupling is another way, where it occurs when the signal conductors are broadside faced to each other in different layers with reference planes above and below these signal conductors. Coupling of the signals from the generator to the receptor can occur through capacitive coupling or inductive coupling. Capacitive coupling, also known as electrical coupling, occurs due to the difference in the characteristic impedance of the generator (usually 50 or 100 §Ù) and its heavy load (1 k§Ù or more) which results in high voltage difference between the generator and the reference conductor (ground). This leads to the creation of a charge across the generator and the receptor-facing sides and finally results in the electric field coupling between them. On the other hand, inductive coupling, also known as magnetic coupling, occurs when the load is less than the characteristic impedance of the generator, and this thereby results in a heavy current flow through the generator which in return results in a strong magnetic field around itself and so leads to magnetic coupling to the receptor. The aim in this thesis is to measure both the capacitive and inductive coupling load¡¯s impacts on both the edge coupling and the broadside coupling models through crosstalk on the receptor. This thesis starts with the background and corresponding theory and equations to the crosstalk coupling. Later on it tests both the edge- and broadside coupling models with different physical properties exploitation. Inductive and capacitive loads are used to measure the resulting crosstalk coupling. Particularly to see the effect of capacitive and inductive coupling in reality in multi layered PCB, a Sbclin (Broadside <b>coupled</b> <b>striplines)</b> model has been used with different angular placement of the generator. Finally mclin physical models are compared with the simulated models and corresponding differences are discussed. It can be concluded that crosstalk effect increases or decreases with physical properties exploitation. Crosstalk also increases with the wrong termination of the load...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 67 - 69) This work {{presents a}} TEM solution of several microstrip transmission line geometries. Treated were geometries having finite and semi-infinite cross sections; in addition, {{the effect of}} the thickness of the conductors was investigated. Microstrip transmission lines with substrate dielectric constants of 10. 1 were analyzed {{as a function of the}} distance from the edge of the strip to the side of the truncated cross section. The results indicate that an increase in impedance with respect to the infinite cross section on the order of 2 percent occurs for the finite geometry when this distance is about 1. 9 linewidths, while the semi-infinite cross section can be reduced to 1. 2 linewidths before a similar change is noted. Embedded microstrip transmission line with a substrate dielectric constant of 2. 54 was also investigated. It was found to be less sensitive to strip location than the uncovered microstrip line, requiring only 1. 4 and 0. 7 strip widths, respectively, for the same impedance deviation. The effect of conductors of practical thickness in most instances was to reduce the impedance by about 1 percent. In most cases the variations in propagation velocity were of the same order as the impedance changes. The solution is based on a method of moments formulation which is readily adaptable to other configurations such as microstrip in a box, <b>stripline,</b> or even <b>coupled</b> lines...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a quantum {{computer}} was invented {{in the beginning of}} the 1980 s as a quantum generalization of the reversible classical computer. After discoveries in the middle of the 1990 s of quantum algorithms, which would solve some problems considered intractable for classical computers, the field of quantum computing has developed rapidly. A wide range of quantum systems are investigated for their possible ability to implement quantum algorithms in practice. The most promising solid state implementations are superconducting electrical circuits based on the Josephson effect, and the Coulomb blockade effect. Superconducting circuits are macroscopic quantum systems which can be fabricated using standard lithography technologies. Superconducting qubits - basic building blocks of a quantum computer - have been developed at several research laboratories, among others the MC 2 here at Chalmers. This thesis presents a theoretical investigation of controllable coupling of superconducting qubits based on the single Cooper-pair box. Two coupling schemes are investigated in detail: current-controlled coupling via large Josephson junctions, and coupling via a superconducting <b>stripline</b> cavity. Both <b>coupling</b> designs are scalable and suitable for the charge regime of the single Cooper-pair box, as well as for the charge-phase regime where the qubit is better protected from environmental noise. Quantum gate protocols which are relevant for these physical couplings are discussed. The investigations show that, for both considered designs, the simplest two-qubit gate is the conditional phase-shift gate. This gate is universal for quantum computing, and it can create maximally entangled qubit pairs in only one run.
