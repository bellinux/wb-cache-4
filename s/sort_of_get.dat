500|$|Clark's adoptive father. Snyder {{explained}} his {{reason for his}} casting the on-screen couple is solely for the realism: [...] "I think the thing you realize {{when you look at}} Diane and Kevin, in our decision to cast them so far, you <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> a sense of how tonally we're looking at the movie, and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors, and we're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys. You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is, our first priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune said [...] "Spears {{delivers}} a performance {{with the same}} sincerity she invests into a Pepsi commercial, only this film contains twice the sugary calories", while New York Daily News writer Elizabeth Weitzma noted, [...] "Here's what Crossroads does not have: Cohesive direction from Tamra Davis, intelligent dialogue, a comprehensible plot". Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide commented that [...] "the film's mealy-mouthed messages about feminine empowerment will almost certainly fall on deaf ears, since even 11-year-olds know Spears's power resides largely in her taut torso". Claudia Puig of USA Today considered it [...] "less a movie than a mind-numbingly dull road trip", while The Washington Post reporter Ann Hornaday said, [...] "not a music video, not yet a movie, but more like an extended-play advertisement for the Product that is Britney". Jane Dark of Village Voice compared Crossroads to Mariah Carey's Glitter, saying, [...] "you {{spend a lot of}} time wondering, 'Better or worse than Glitter?' You think if the projectionist cranked the volume a little you could actually <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> into this".|$|E

5000|$|Fuzzy Nation, Scalzi's ninth novel, {{began as}} a writing exercise. Scalzi {{explained}} {{that it had been}} [...] "basically written just {{for the fun of it}} and for <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> into the habit of actually enjoying writing science fiction again." [...] It was an adaptation of Little Fuzzy, published by H. Beam Piper in 1962, and was authorized by the Piper estate.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} in Metropolis in 2001, Irving Harper also commented on this practice: [...] "...there always had to be one name associated with the work. We couldn't just spread it around… that's fine. I'm grateful to George {{for what he did}} for me. While he was alive, I made no demands whatsoever, but now that he's gone, whenever the Marshmallow Sofa is referred to as a 'George Nelson design', it <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>gets</b> to me. I don't go {{out of my way to}} set things right, but if anybody asks me who designed it, I'm perfectly happy to tell them." ...|$|R

6000|$|March {{began to}} think so too, at times. He was perpetually {{suggesting}} changes in the make-up of the first number, {{with a view to}} its greater vividness of effect. One day he came and said: [...] "This thing isn't going to have any <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> up and howl about it, unless you have a paper in the first number going for Bevans's novels. Better get Maxwell to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do see {{yourself}} a bit ghostish——" [...] said he, [...] "on {{a background of}} your ancestors. I always think when you stop in an old place like this you sort of keep company with your ancestors too much; I sometimes feel like {{a bit of the}} old building walking about; the old feelings of the old folks stick to you like the lichens on the walls; you <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> hoary." ...|$|E

[...] However, he feels the drug was a good plot device to bring Angelus into the series [...] "so that he could interact with our characters without doing some big ‘Angel has turned evil’ arc.

5000|$|Regarding {{the release}} of variant covers for titles, Lee said, [...] "we're only using {{specialty}} variants with comic book shops and variant covers in judicious ways. We're {{not going to have}} a gazillion SKUs across the entire line. We find that, at that point, why publish a story inside at all, if you're just going to build a business based on variant covers. We're still using variant covers, but we're actually using one variant cover artist for each book. They <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> tenure, as it were.

5000|$|Joe Petagno, {{the sleeve}} artist, {{commented on the}} {{influences}} behind the cover concept: [...] "..It's one of my favourite pieces.

I said, [...] "Listen, instead of letting these guys <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> to you, why don't we just pay homage to the death thing? That's cool enough.

5000|$|Its A Bit Complicated was {{recorded}} at London’s Terminal Studios and {{was produced by}} Dan Swift (whose other work includes Futureheads, Franz Ferdinand and Snow Patrol), [...] "a more like-minded producer" [...] according to Argos. With the first album, we were all still at work and stuff, so we couldnt all be in the studio at the time Argos says. We couldnt really gang up on the producer and do what we wanted. This time round, the band had more input in the production, though. Wed all be there at once so we could gang up on him. Wed say [...] "Do it like this!" [...] Youre just more comfortable when youre all there. So, that made it better. In fact, Ian Catskillian lived at the studio for a bit.

5000|$|Joe Boyd, the band's {{longtime}} record producer, {{returned for}} the album. Boyd was flexible with the group's creative development, and rarely interfered with their process. His {{approach to the}} ISB's output was {{to allow them to}} decide what material appeared on the final product as Boyd, who also produced other extravagant acts like Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, encouraged unique musical compositions. Williamson later praised Boyd saying, [...] "He used to just <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> you in there. And if you said to him, 'Well I would like such and such' he would get it for you. But otherwise, just let you get on with it". Boyd, noticing the group's change and potential faults, attempted to intervene, but, in the end, continued allowing the band to develop their new concepts. Another major production member was John Wood, sound engineer at Sound Techniques. The studio initially included only basic recording equipment not yet able to showcase the band's full musical inventiveness. By their third album, the facilities held 16-tracks, allowing the group to overdub and jump tracks to generate their multi-instrumental sound.|$|E
