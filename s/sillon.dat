5|$|The {{northern}} half of Belgium, {{which would}} {{come to be known}} as Flanders, was a largely agricultural area containing the important port of Antwerp, the city of Ghent and the capital, Brussels. In the southern half, which {{would come to}} be known as Wallonia, a number of smaller towns and cities along the valley of the Sambre and Meuse rivers – the <b>sillon</b> industriel ("industrial valley") – became the focus of industrialization. In the west of the valley, around Charleroi, was the Pays Noir ("Black Country"), which held significant coal deposits. In southeast Belgium, along the border with Luxembourg and Prussia (later Germany), was the heavily forested and agricultural region known as the Ardennes.|$|E
5|$|The Industrial Revolution {{is usually}} {{considered}} to have been spread from Britain to Belgium by two British industrialists, William and John Cockerill, who moved to Liège in 1807 and formed a company producing industrial machinery and iron. Industrial development was possible in Belgium because of large coal deposits located in the <b>Sillon</b> industriel along the Sambre-Meuse river valley. Although the town of Ghent, a centre of cotton production in Flanders, industrialised rapidly, {{the effects of the}} Industrial Revolution were most felt in Wallonia, particularly in the cities of Mons, Charleroi, Liège and Verviers. By the 1840s, Cockerill was the world's largest manufacturer of steel. Belgium also rapidly developed a large railway system. From the outset, the Belgian state supported the construction of railways, envisaging a railway link between the industrial region of Mons and the port of Antwerp via Brussels. The first stretch of this line, one of the first railways in Europe, opened in 1835 between Brussels and Mechelen.|$|E

25|$|Cheap {{and readily}} {{available}} coal attracted firms producing metals and glass, {{both of which}} required considerable amounts of coal, and so regions around coal fields became highly industrialised. The <b>Sillon</b> industriel (Industrial Valley), {{and in particular the}} Pays Noir around Charleroi, were the centre of the steel industry until the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|For 50 {{years through}} World War II, French-speaking Wallonia was a {{technically}} advanced, industrial region, with its industry concentrated along the <b>sillon</b> industriel, while Dutch-speaking Flanders was predominantly agricultural with some industry, mainly processing agricultural products and textiles. This disparity {{began to fade}} during the interwar period. When Belgium emerged from World War II with its industrial infrastructure relatively undamaged thanks to the Galopin doctrine, {{the stage was set}} for a period of rapid development, particularly in Flanders. The postwar boom years, enhanced by the establishment of the European Union and NATO headquarters in Brussels, contributed to the rapid expansion of light industry throughout most of Flanders, particularly along a corridor stretching between Brussels and Antwerp, which is the second largest port in Europe after Rotterdam.|$|E
25|$|The modern, private {{enterprise}} economy of Belgium has capitalised on its central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. The first country to undergo an industrial revolution {{on the continent}} of Europe in the early 19th century, Belgium developed an excellent transportation infrastructure of ports, canals, railways, and highways to integrate its industry with that of its neighbors. Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flanders in the north, around Brussels and in the two biggest Walloon cities, Liège and Charleroi, along the <b>sillon</b> industriel. Belgium imports raw materials and semi-finished goods that are further processed and re-exported. Except for its coal, which is no longer economical to exploit, Belgium has few natural resources other than fertile soils. Nonetheless, most traditional industrial sectors are represented in the economy, including steel, textiles, refining, chemicals, food processing, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, electronics, and machinery fabrication. Despite the heavy industrial component, services account for 74.9% of GDP, while agriculture accounts for only 1% of GDP.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the war, Belgium {{had been}} {{regarded}} as the foremost European country for the manufacture of armaments. Its <b>Sillon</b> industriel, or industrial valley, {{was one of the}} first fully industrialized and mechanized regions in Europe. The Poudreries Réunies de Belgique was among the oldest armament manufacturers on the Continent, known for its manufacture of mortars, artillery shells, and land mines. Graham Spicer, an official in the Ministry of Munitions who had worked in Belgium before the war and knew its armaments manufacturing capabilities, suggested that perhaps the Belgians might be able to help. An approach was made, and the result was that 1000 skilled Belgian armaments workers volunteered help train other volunteers. As the result of another suggestion (possibly from Spicer as well) most of these volunteers were drawn from the pool of soldiers who had been badly wounded at the front and declared unfit to return there; they were not so unfit they could not do a job of work, but were not capable of resuming life at the Front.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his distinctive name, Z. Marcas has a remarkable appearance which his neighbors notice immediately. The story's first line refers to his [...] ("striking") appearance.

Ses cheveux ressemblaient à une crinière, son nez était court, écrasé, large et fendu au bout comme celui d'un lion, il avait le front partagé comme celui d'un lion par un <b>sillon</b> puissant, divisé en deux lobes vigoureux."

Sulci were semi-automatically segmented from 3 D MRI data sets. Sulci close to the cavernoma were selected and transferred to the neuronavigation system which allows the superimposition of graphics into the right ocular of the microscope. Selected sulci were displayed on the workstation and superimposed into the ocular of the microscope. Cortical sulci proofed to be useful for the recognition of the anatomical environment. The superimposed sulci helped to optimise location and size of the skin incision as well as to guide the access to the cavernoma by using the course of a sulcus as indirect trajectory. 4 RESUME Les auteurs présentent l’utilisation de <b>sillons</b> corticaux, segmentés à partir d’examens d’Imagerie par Résonance Magnétique (IRM), pour le guidage du geste neurochirurgica...|$|R
40|$|The epithelia of {{the main}} organs likely to be {{involved}} in contaminant uptake, viz. mantle and gill were studied in the Asiatic clam Corbicula fluminea as a base for future ecotoxicological studies. On its margin, the mantle epithelium displays three folds separated by two grooves. The outer epithelium made of cubic cells, and the periostracal groove are involved in the formation is composed of the shell, secreting crystals and the periostracal lamella respectively. In the median area, the inner epithelium is composed of three cell types: ordinary epithelial cells, ciliated cells and mucocytes. The gill epithelium displays two structural-ly and functionally different areas: a respiratory area in the interlamellar chamber and, on the opposite side, a ciliated epithelium. The respiratory epithelium is composed of thin pavement epithelial cells. The ciliated epithelium is made of different cell types: lateral ciliated epithelial cells, secretory cells, latero-frontal ciliated cells and ciliated frontal cells. The role of the secretory cells is particularly discussed in relation to their structural similarity with lower vertebrate chloride cells (ionocytes) involved in iono-and osmoregulation processes.

2500|$|Korean {{nationalist}} historiography {{is a way}} {{of writing}} Korean history that centers on the Korean minjok, an ethnically or racially defined Korean nation. This kind of historiography emerged {{in the early twentieth century}} among Korean intellectuals who wanted to foster national consciousness to achieve Korean independence from Japanese domination. Its first proponent was journalist and independence activist Shin Chaeho (1880-1936). In his polemical New Reading of History (Doksa <b>Sillon),</b> which was published in 1908 three years after Korea became a Japanese protectorate, Shin proclaimed that Korean history was the history of the Korean minjok, a distinct race descended from the god Dangun that had once controlled not only the Korean peninsula but also large parts of Manchuria. Nationalist historians made expansive claims to the territory of these ancient [...] "Korean" [...] kingdoms, by which the present state of the minjok was to be judged.|$|E

2500|$|The {{coming of}} the nation state system to East Asia, during which Korea was corporated into Meiji Japan, {{prompted}} Korean activists to [...] "redefine Korea in terms of internal homogenity and external autonomy". In Shin Chaeho's 1908 essay Doksa <b>Sillon</b> ("A new way of reading history"), Shin equated Korean history (kuksa) {{with that of the}} Korean nation (minjoksa), attempting to redirect people's loyalties to that category which he asserted always existed in history. For example, Shin asserted that Myocheong's rebellion (1135-1136) against Goryeo which was crushed by Kim Bu-sik as a [...] "nationalist" [...] rebellion. Myocheong had demanded that Goryeo move its capital north to sŏgyŏng (modern Pyongyang) and take a more aggressive stance against the Liao and Jin dynasties to the north, which Kim felt would undermine the security of the Goryeo state. Shin's later work, from the Chosŏn sanggo munhwasa, showed more critical evaluation of primary sources, using methods from archaeology, epigraphy, and comparative linguistics, and relying less on Daejonggyo (Dangun-worship) scripture.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the north}} of the Sambre and Meuse valley lies the Central Belgian plateau, which is {{characterized}} by intensive agriculture. The Walloon part of this plateau is traditionally divided into several regions: Walloon Brabant around Nivelles, [...] Western Hainaut ( [...] , around Tournai), and Hesbaye around Waremme. [...] South of the <b>sillon</b> industriel, the land is more rugged and is characterized by more extensive farming. It is traditionally divided into the regions of Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse, Condroz, Fagne-Famenne, the Ardennes and Land of Herve, as well as the Belgian Lorraine around Arlon and Virton. Dividing it into Condroz, Famenne, Calestienne, Ardennes (including Thiérache), and Belgian Lorraine (which includes the Gaume) is more reflective of the physical geography. [...] The larger region, the Ardennes, is a thickly forested plateau with caves and small gorges. [...] It is host to much of Belgium's wildlife but little agricultural capacity. This area extends westward into France and eastward to the Eifel in Germany via the High Fens plateau, on which the Signal de Botrange forms the highest point in Belgium at 694 metres (2,277ft).|$|E
2500|$|Korea is {{alternatively}} {{portrayed in}} nationalist historiography as being continually victimized throughout history by China and Japan, but remaining morally, racially, and culturally superior to them, since theyand more recently, Western powerstried and [...] "failed to suppress Korea's national spirit". Shin Chaeho's work shows {{the influence of}} Social Darwinism by portraying history as a racial struggle between the [...] "Buyeo" [...] (Korean) minjok {{with that of the}} Xianbei, Chinese, Mohe, and Jurchen over territory. He shamed historical figures who preserved or extended [...] "Korean" [...] control over Manchuria, and shamed those who did not, such as Muyeol of Silla. As a result, the search for heroes of the former led his Doksa <b>Sillon</b> to focus more on ancient, rather than recent history. Various self-designations for Koreans in the minjok struggle include [...] "the good race" [...] (sŏnmin) and [...] "the chosen or delivered people" [...] (paedal). In postcolonial North and South Korean historiography, {{there is a tendency to}} emphasize the [...] "superiority" [...] (ususŏng) and [...] "advancedness" [...] (sŏnjinsŏng) of Korea's historical development.|$|E
