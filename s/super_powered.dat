5|$|Following {{his time}} in prison, A.I.M {{scientists}} converted Osborn into a Super-Adaptoid, capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such <b>super</b> <b>powered</b> being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him. He could also levitate, {{and he was able}} to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E
5|$|Having {{become the}} Goblin, he {{generally}} views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. He {{goes out of}} his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that, when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys, or been rescued by the intervention of other <b>super</b> <b>powered</b> beings such as the Human Torch, despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself.|$|E
25|$|In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Captain Britain is {{a member}} of the European Defense Initiative (the EU {{equivalent}} of the Ultimates), along with Captain Italy, Captain France, Captain Spain and several unnamed members most likely from other European countries, all of whom have the same powers: flight, super strength and a force field. All four of them developed their powers from the <b>super</b> <b>powered</b> exo-suits developed by Professor Sir James Braddock, who oversees the EDI super soldier program. Captain Britain and the other members of European Defense Initiative helped the Ultimates track down and contain Thor and they released the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man and the X-Men during the Liberators' attack on America. They are also seen helping to pull up the Statue of Liberty after the battle is over. During Ultimatum, Captain Britain (along with other Captains) is discussing how to take action against Magneto in the Houses of Parliament. However, Multiple Man bursts in and sets off a bomb, destroying the Houses of Parliament and everyone inside. His status is unknown on panel, although he was listed in the in memoriam section at the end of Ultimatum #5. He survived the attack at the Houses of Parliament, although he succumbed to the cancer caused by using one of the first versions of the Captain Britain suit, and his brother James took the mantle of Captain Britain.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, Super Friends revamped its format (first as Super Friends: The Legendary <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> Show {{and then}} as The <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> Team: Galactic Guardians) {{to serve as a}} tie-in to Kenner's <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> Collection.|$|R
50|$|DC Universe Classics takes {{much of its}} {{inspiration}} from Kenner's <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> toyline from the 1980s, from character choices to their general design. All of the characters {{who were in the}} <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line have appeared in DC Universe Classics and DC Superheroes, although four of them (Kalibak, the Penguin, Orion, and Mr. Freeze) are very different from how they looked in <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> (though Freeze would be re-released later with his <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> color scheme, and Penguin will be re-released in a more Super Powers-accurate version). Some characters who were redesigned for the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line (Parademon, Mantis, and Steppenwolf) were released in two versions—a comic-accurate version and a <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> version. Even the characters Cyclotron and Golden Pharaoh - created specifically for the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line—were released in DC Universe Classics. Further, figures that were going to be produced later in the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line were created as part of DC Universe Classics (including characters from Super Friends like El Dorado and the Wonder Twins).|$|R

500|$|In September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, {{who plays}} Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his {{character}} was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed {{due to the}} end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not [...] "want to reveal where [...] and why" [...] in this film. Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, [...] "You've got to kind of choose your roster [...] depending on what kind of fight you want to have." [...] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear {{at the very end of}} the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, [...] " [...] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [...] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie." [...] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross [...] "was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated <b>super</b> <b>powered</b> character to the mix." [...] Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{tells the}} story of Ginji Amano and Ban Mido, a pair of <b>super</b> <b>powered</b> {{individuals}} known as the [...] "GetBackers". The duo operates a freelance repossession service {{out of one of the}} seedier areas of Shinjuku, Tokyo. For a fee, they will recover any lost or stolen item for a client with [...] "an almost 100% success rate". The GetBackers' job often leads them into bizarre and dangerous situations in order to [...] "get back what shouldn't be gone". Their targets range from lost video games to misplaced components of an atomic bomb. The plot mostly revolves around their adventures, often complicated by the pair's convoluted, individual pasts and a mysterious place known as the Infinity Fortress.|$|E

50|$|Mattel's DC Universe Classics line also draws {{inspiration}} from the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> figures. Several figures that were redesigned for the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line (Mantis, Parademon, Steppenwolf, and Mister Freeze) were produced for DC Universe Classics in both comic-accurate and Super Powers-accurate versions. In addition, figures for Cyclotron and Golden Pharaoh were released as part of DC Universe Classics, even though both characters only appeared {{as part of the}} <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line. The Penguin released in the first wave is set to be re-released with a new head sculpt and repaint matching the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> figure. In total, every figure produced for <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> has also been produced for DC Universe Classics and associate lines and much of the figures set to be produced for <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> prior to the line's cancellation has also been produced for DC Universe Classics (save Mr. Mxyzptlk, Shockwave, Black Racer, Atomic Knight, and original <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> characters).|$|R
