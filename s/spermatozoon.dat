60|$|In a highly-organised animal, the gemmules {{thrown off}} from each {{different}} unit {{throughout the body}} must be inconceivably numerous and minute. Each unit of each part, as it changes during development, {{and we know that}} some insects undergo at least twenty metamorphoses, must throw off its gemmules. But the same cells may long continue to increase by self-division, and even become modified by absorbing peculiar nutriment, without necessarily throwing off modified gemmules. All organic beings, moreover, include many dormant gemmules derived from their grandparents and more remote progenitors, but not from all their progenitors. These almost infinitely numerous and minute gemmules are contained within each bud, ovule, <b>spermatozoon,</b> and pollen-grain. Such an admission will be declared impossible; but number and size are only relative difficulties. Independent organisms exist which are barely visible under the highest powers of the microscope, and their germs must be excessively minute. Particles of infectious matter, so small as to be wafted by the wind or to adhere to smooth paper, will multiply so rapidly as to infect within a short time the whole body of a large animal. We should also reflect on the admitted number and minuteness of the molecules composing a particle of ordinary matter. The difficulty, therefore, which at first appears insurmountable, of believing in the existence of gemmules so numerous and small as they must be according to our hypothesis, has no great weight.|$|E
60|$|As each unit, {{or group}} of similar units, {{throughout}} the body, casts off its gemmules, and as all are contained within the smallest ovule, and within each <b>spermatozoon</b> or pollen-grain, and as some animals and plants produce an astonishing number of pollen-grains and ovules (27/48. Mr. F. Buckland found 6,867,840 eggs in a cod-fish ('Land and Water' 1868 page 62). An Ascaris produces about 64,000,000 eggs (Carpenter's 'Comp. Phys.' 1854 page 590). Mr. J. Scott, of the Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh, calculated, {{in the same manner}} as I have done for some British Orchids ('Fertilisation of Orchids' page 344), the number of seeds in a capsule of an Acropera and found the number to be 371,250. Now this plant produces several flowers on a raceme, and many racemes during a season. In an allied genus, Gongora, Mr. Scott has seen twenty capsules produced on a single raceme; ten such racemes on the Acropera would yield above seventy-four millions of seed.), the number and minuteness of the gemmules must be something inconceivable. But considering how minute the molecules are, and how many go to the formation of the smallest granule of any ordinary substance, this difficulty with respect to the gemmules is not insuperable. From the data arrived at by Sir W. Thomson, my son George finds that a cube of 1/10000 of an inch of glass or water must consist of between 16 million millions, and 131 thousand million million molecules. No doubt the molecules of which an organism is formed are larger, from being more complex, than those of an inorganic substance, and probably many molecules go to the formation of a gemmule; but when we bear in mind that a cube of 1/10000 of an inch is much smaller than any pollen-grain, ovule or bud, we can see what a vast number of gemmules one of these bodies might contain.|$|E
