5|$|A flint dagger was {{discovered}} on the site. This type of artefact {{is rare in}} Greater Manchester; the nearest comparable site is in Saddleworth. Its presence has been taken as an indication that during the Bronze Age the <b>site</b> <b>was</b> used for funerary practices. Many of the hills near Mellor are surmounted by Bronze Age funerary monuments such as Brown Low, Shaw Cairn, and Werneth Low, supporting the possibility that Mellor was also a funerary site. Also dating from the Bronze Age and found on the <b>site</b> <b>was</b> a rare high-status amber necklace. Amber does not occur naturally in Britain the nearest source is the Baltic.

5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the <b>site</b> <b>was</b> completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the <b>site</b> <b>was</b> being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E

30|$|Ten {{elements}} (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Co, Zn, Ni, and Cd) {{were detected}} {{in both the}} fennel fruit and soil samples while Pb was not detected in both the fennel fruit and soil samples. The levels of elements however differ significantly among {{each other and to}} some extent between sampling sites.

In all the cases concentration of Ca and Fe are much higher than the other elements in the both the fennel fruit and soil, respectively.
