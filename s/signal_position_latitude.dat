40|$|Although both sensory {{and motor}} signals in {{multiple}} cortical areas are modulated by eye position, {{the origin of}} eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> for cortical neurons remains uncertain. One likely source is the central thalamus which contains neurons sensitive to eye position. Since the central thalamus receives inputs from the brainstem, these neurons may transmit eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> arising from the neural integrator or from proprioceptive feedback. However, since the central thalamus also receives inputs from many cortical areas, eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> in the central thalamus could come from the cerebral cortex. To clarify these possibilities, spatial and temporal properties of eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> in the central thalamus were examined in trained monkeys. Data showed that eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> were decomposed into horizontal and vertical components, suggesting that the central thalamus lies within pathways that transmit brainstem eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> to the cortex. Further quantitative analyses suggested that two distinct groups of thalamic neurons mediate eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> from different subcortical origins, and that the signals are modified dynamically through ascending pathways. Eye <b>position</b> <b>signals</b> through the central thalamus may play essential roles in spatial transformation performed by cortical networks...|$|R
30|$|The FCD {{technique}} {{is based on}} the exchange of information between a fleet of floating cars traveling on a road network and a central data system. The floating cars periodically send the recent accumulated data on their <b>positions</b> (<b>latitude,</b> longitude and altitude) and, optionally, instantaneous speed, whereas the central data system tracks the received floating car data along the traveled routes by matching the related trajectories data to the road network. The reliability of travel time estimates based on FCD is highly dependent on the percentage of floating cars participating in the traffic flow; other factors affecting the reliability of travel time estimates, mainly for lower penetration of floating cars, are traffic conditions and road link capacities.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We {{investigated}} the feeding ecology and habitat use of 32 harbour porpoises by-caught in 4 localities along the Scandinavian coast from the North Sea to the Barents Sea using time-integrative markers: stable isotopes (δ 13 C, δ 15 N) and trace elements (Zn, Cu, Fe, Se, total Hg and Cd), {{in relation to}} habitat characteristics (bathymetry) and geographic <b>position</b> (<b>latitude).</b> Results Among the trace elements analysed, only Cd, with an oceanic specific food origin, {{was found to be}} useful as an ecological tracer. All other trace elements studied were not useful, most likely because of physiological regulation and/or few specific sources in the food web. The δ 13 C, δ 15 N signatures and Cd levels were highly correlated with each other, as well as with local bathymetry and geographic <b>position</b> (<b>latitude).</b> Variation in the isotopic ratios indicated a shift in harbour porpoise's feeding habits from pelagic prey species in deep northern waters to more coastal and/or demersal prey in the relatively shallow North Sea and Skagerrak waters. This result is consistent with stomach content analyses found in the literature. This shift was associated with a northward Cd-enrichment which provides further support to the Cd 'anomaly' previously reported in polar waters and suggests that porpoises in deep northern waters include Cd-contaminated prey in their diet, such as oceanic cephalopods. Conclusion As stable isotopes and Cd provide information in the medium and the long term respectively, the spatial variation found, shows that harbour porpoises experience different ecological regimes during the year along the Scandinavian coasts, adapting their feeding habits to local oceanographic conditions, without performing extensive migration. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} that the Avalon Platform, where the Avalonian lithotectonic belt is best developed, was involved in late Paleozoic displacement was tested by paleomagnetic study of red sandstones of the Upper Devonian Terrenceville Formation of eastern Newfoundland. Two magnetization directions were identified by thermal demagnetization analysis of 60 oriented samples from 10 sites: a high blocking temperature, thermally discrete A component of normal and reversed polarity, and an intermediate blocking temperature, thermally distributed B component of reversed polarity. The B component (D = 185. 9 °, I = - 3. 3 °, a 95 = 7. 2 ° for N = 8 sites) is interpreted as a postfolding secondary magnetization and gives a paleomagnetic pole <b>position</b> (<b>latitude</b> = 43. 6 °N, longitude = 117. 1 °E) near Early to Late Permian paleopoles for North America. The A component (D = 181. 6 °,I = 28. 0 °, a 95 = 10. 1 ° for N = 9 sites) is interpreted as the characteristic magnetization possibly dating from near the time of deposition of the Terrence ville Formation. The corresponding paleomagnetic pole <b>position</b> (<b>latitude</b> = 27. 4 °N, longitude = 123. 5 °E) falls within a group of Late Devonian-early Carboniferous paleopoles obtained from the Acadia displaced terrain, encompassing the coastal areas of New England and the Canadian maritimes which form {{another part of the}} Avalonian belt. These paleopoles are systematically offset by 15 ° to 20 ° in latitude from coeval pole positions obtained from cratonic North America. Thus the Avalonian belt of the northern Appalachians, which is thought to represent a remnant of a Precambrian and early Paleozoic microcontinent on tectonostratigraphic considerations, appears to correspond to a late Paleozoic displaced terrain on the basis of paleomagnetic evidence...|$|R
