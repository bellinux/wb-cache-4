500|$|Following post war tests by the British Navy on German Type XXIII {{submarines}}, it {{was decided}} by the Admiralty to modify eight T-class submarines to enlarge the batteries, increase {{the power of the}} motors and streamline the hulls. In 1950, Tarbards pressure hull was cut at the after end of the engine room and the submarine was lengthened by [...] This gave enough room to add an additional battery compartment and a second pair of electric motors. The propulsion system was changed from direct to dieselelectric transmission. Along with , Tabard was one of two boats which were further modified by incorporating their bridge into a <b>streamlined</b> <b>fin.</b> Other <b>streamlining</b> adjustments were made to the hull with all external fittings removed, including the external torpedo tubes and gun. The periscopes, radar masts, snort mast and wireless mast were all incorporated into the new bridge fin.|$|R

Three compartments equipped with bulkheads to withstand 10 atm pressure {{could be used}} as emergency shelters.|$|R
40|$|Fromtheir {{earliest}} origins, fishes {{have developed}} a suite of adaptations for locomotion in water, which determine performance and ultimately fitness. Even without data from behaviour, soft tissue and extant relatives, {{it is possible to}} infer a wealth of palaeobiological and palaeoecological information. As in extant species, aspects of gross morphology such as <b>streamlining,</b> <b>fin</b> position and tail type are optimized even in the earliest fishes, indicating similar life strategies have been present throughout their evolutionary history. As hydrodynamical studies become more sophisticated, increasingly complex fluid movement can be modelled, including vortex formation and boundary layer control. Drag-reducing riblets ornamenting the scales of fast-moving sharks have been subjected to particularly intense research, but this has not been extended to extinct forms. Riblets are a convergent adaptation seen in many Palaeozoic fishes, and probably served a similar hydrodynamic purpose. Conversely, structures which appear to increase skin friction may act as turbulisors, reducing overall dragwhile serving a protective function. Here,we examine the diverse adaptions that contribute to drag reduction in modern fishes and review the few attempts to elucidate the hydrodynamics of extinct forms...|$|R

Drag-reducing riblets ornamenting the scales of fast-moving sharks have been subject to particularly intense research, but this has not been extended to extinct forms. The crowns of shark scales are exposed directly to the aquatic environment offering a unique opportunity to elucdate scale function in some of their long-extinct Palaeozoic relatives. This thesis is the first comprehensive study of scale function in fossil fishes, and demonstrates that sophisticated adaptations for drag-reduction existed at a remarkably early stage in fish evolution. It is shown that riblet spacing reflects swimming speed in modern sharks, and that drag-reduction morphology evolved in the denticles of the earliest vertebrates, including the oldest examples known (460 million years ago). Comparative analysis between modern sharks and fossil taxa reveals distinct and diverse regionalisation of scale features across the body, as well as ontogenetic changes. In addition to riblet spacing, the variation of other scale features is investigated quantitatively in modern sharks, revealing the importance of riblet angle in overall drag reduction. Furthermore, experimental skin friction measurements of fossil fish scales demonstrate the potential drag reduction of a diverse range of morphologies, even without riblets. ...|$|R
50|$|Between 1958 and 1960 Alliance was {{extensively}} modernised {{by having}} the deck gun and external torpedo tubes removed, the hull <b>streamlined</b> and the <b>fin</b> replaced with a larger (26 feet 6 inch high), more streamlined one constructed of aluminium. The purpose of these modifications {{was to make the}} submarine quieter and faster underwater. Following the modifications the wireless transmitting aerial was supported on a frame behind the fin; but was later replaced with a whip aerial on the starboard side of the fin which could be rotated hydraulically to a horizontal position.|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} heat transfer and pressure drop associated with forced flow of deionized water over five micro pin fin heat sinks of different spacing, arrangements, and shapes was conducted experimentally. Nusselt numbers and friction factors were obtained over Reynolds numbers ranging from 14 to 720. The thermal and hydraulic results were obtained {{to evaluate and}} compare the heat sinks performances at fixed mass flow rate, fixed pressure drop, and fixed pumping power. Two distinct regions of the Nusselt number dependency on the Reynolds number separated by a critical Reynolds number have been identified for unstreamlined pin fin devices while the streamlined device showed no slope change. The effects of spacing, shape of pin fins, and arrangement on friction factor and heat transfer were in agreement with existing literature. The results indicate that utilizing <b>streamlined</b> pin <b>fin</b> heat sinks can significantly enhance the thermal-hydraulic performance of the heat sink, but only at moderate Reynolds numbers. ...|$|R
50|$|The Farman F.250, nicknamed Gros 230, {{did look}} rather like Farman's little two F.230 trainer {{but was a}} much larger aircraft, with a span about ⅓ bigger and {{weighing}} some 2.5 times more. It was designed to carry four passengers over long distances. Wood was used both in the structure and skin of the whole aircraft, which had low, cantilever wings and a flat sided fuselage containing the passenger cabin, located over the wing and lit by three square windows. The pilot's open cockpit was further aft, {{on top of the}} fuselage in a <b>streamlined</b> fairing. The <b>fin</b> had a straight, swept leading edge and a squared-off top, with a deep, almost rectangular rudder moving in a cut-out between the elevators; the latter were mounted, with the tailplane, on top of the fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|The popular name [...] "spiny sharks" [...] is {{a partial}} misnomer for these early jawed fishes. The name was coined {{because they were}} superficially shark-shaped, with a <b>streamlined</b> body, paired <b>fins,</b> and a {{strongly}} upturned tail; stout, largely immovable bony spines supporting all the fins except the tail - hence, [...] "spiny sharks"; in retrospect, however, their close relation to modern cartilaginous fish can lead them to be considered [...] "stem-sharks". Fossilized spines and scales are often {{all that remains of}} these fishes in ancient sedimentary rocks. Although not sharks or cartilaginous fish, acanthodians did, in fact, have a cartilaginous skeleton, but their fins had a wide, bony base and were reinforced on their anterior margin with a dentine spine. The earliest acanthodians were marine, but during the Devonian, freshwater species became predominant.|$|R
40|$|The {{flow and}} heat {{transfer}} characteristics inside a rectangular channel embedded with pin fins were numerically and experimentally investigated. Several differently shaped pin fins (i. e., circular, elliptical, and drop-shaped) {{with the same}} cross-sectional areas were compared in a staggered arrangement. The Reynolds number based on the obstructed section hydraulic diameter (defined as {{the ratio of the}} total wetted surface area to the open duct volume available for flow) was varied from 4800 to 8200. The more <b>streamlined</b> drop-shaped pin <b>fins</b> were better at delaying or suppressing separation of the flow passing through them, which decreased the aerodynamic penalty compared to circular pin fins. The heat transfer enhancement of the drop-shaped pin fins was less than that of the circular pin fins. In terms of specific performance parameters, drop-shaped pin fins are a promising alternative configuration to circular pin fins...|$|R
500|$|Tuna {{and other}} fast-swimming ocean-going fish {{maintain}} their muscles at higher temperatures than their environment for efficient locomotion. Tuna achieve muscle temperatures [...] or even higher above the surroundings {{by having a}} counterflow {{system in which the}} metabolic heat produced by the muscles and present in the venous blood, pre-warms the arterial blood before it reaches the muscles. Other adaptations of tuna for speed include a <b>streamlined,</b> spindle-shaped body, <b>fins</b> designed to reduce drag, and muscles with a raised myoglobin content, which gives these a reddish colour and makes for a more efficient use of oxygen. In polar regions and in the deep ocean, where the temperature is a few degrees above freezing point, some large fish, such as the swordfish, marlin and tuna, have a heating mechanism which raises the temperature of the brain and eye, allowing them significantly better vision than their cold-blooded prey.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{production}} variant was the BR.20bis {{which was a}} complete redesign. It had a fully glazed nose, a retractable tail wheel, and more <b>streamlined</b> fuselage, pointed <b>fins,</b> although the main change was increased engine power from two 932 kW (1,250 hp) Fiat A.82 RC 42 radial engines and improved and heavier armament. The nose held a simple machine gun position rather than the turret used on earlier aircraft and two waist blisters were fitted over the wing trailing edge while the dorsal turret was a Breda Type V instead of the earlier Caproni Lanciani type. While this {{was considered to be}} an improvement over the previous versions, planned production was limited, as the Regia Aeronautica had placed large orders for the CRDA CANT Z.1018. Originally, 98 were ordered, but only 15 BR.20bis were built from March to July 1943, with heavy Allied bombing of Fiat's Turin factory preventing further production. [...] There is no evidence that they were used operationally.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{diesel engine}} {{requires}} close tolerances {{to achieve its}} compression ratio. The air entering the engine must be clean, free of debris and as cool as possible. Also to improve engine’s efficiency, the compressed air must be cooled after being compressed. Development of Variable Countercurrent Distribution Control (VCDC) technology ensures proper air intake and exhaust system. In this regard, design of valve controller and most importantly valve mixer mechanism with fin arrangements has taken into consideration. Valve controller controls the intake airflow at a significant level and the valve mixture distributes the air {{to a form of}} <b>streamline</b> through the <b>fin</b> arrangements. There is no possibility of vortex generation which is important for smooth and linear flow of air inside the engine cylinder. A swirl combustion inside the combustion chamber take place that results uniform combustion, increase the flame propagation speed, overcoming the differences of turbulent flow, reduce the flame to burn, improves the function of the flame diffusion and serves to reduce the airflow noise. Pressure distribution ensures greater combustion pressure that results higher compression ratio as the air is compressed first and then the fuel injected which allow the IC diesel engine to be efficient...|$|R
40|$|The use of polymer tubes {{for heat}} {{exchanger}} tube bundles {{is of interest}} in many applications where corrosion, mineral build-up and/or weight are important. The challenge of overcoming the low thermal conductivity of polymers may be met by using many small-diameter, thin-walled polymer tubes and this route is being pursued by industry. We propose the use of unique shaped tubes that are easily extruded using polymeric materials. The shaped tubes are streamlined to reduce form drag yet the inside flow passage is kept circular to maintain the pressure capability of the tube. Special treatment is required to predict convective heat transfer rates because the temperature distribution along the outer surface of the shaped tubes is non-uniform. The average forced convection Nusselt number correlations developed for these non-circular tubes {{can not be used}} directly to determine heat transfer rate. In this paper, heat transfer rates of shaped tubes are characterized by treating the tubes as a base circular tube to which longitudinal fin(s) are added. Numerical solution of an energy balance on the fin provides the surface temperature distribution and a shaped tube efficiency, which can be used {{in the same manner as}} a fin efficiency to determine the outside convective resistance. The approach is illustrated for three <b>streamlined</b> shapes with <b>fins</b> of lenticular and oval profile. The presentation highlights the effects of the geometry and the Biot number on the tube efficiency and heat transfer enhancement. Convective heat transfer is enhanced for the oval shaped tube for 2000 ≤ Re ≤ 20, 000 when Bi < 0. 3. For polymeric materials, the Biot number in most applications will be greater than 0. 3, and adding material to the base tube reduces the heat transfer rate. The potential benefit of reduced form drag remains...|$|R
