40|$|An Oil filter is {{a filter}} to remove {{contaminants}} from engine oil, transmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic oil. Oil filters {{are used in}} {{many different types of}} hydraulic machinery. A chief use of the oil filter is in internal-combustion engines in on- and off-road motor vehicles, light aircraft, and various naval vessels. Other vehicle hydraulic systems, such as those in automatic transmissions and power steering, are often equipped with an oil filter. Gas turbine engines, such as those on jet aircraft, require the use of oil filters. And oil production, transport, and recycling facilities employ filters.

40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the 20 -foot propeller-research tunnel to {{investigate}} the possibility of obtaining increased net efficiencies of propeller-nacelle units by enclosing the engines in the wings and by using extension shafts. A wing of 5 -foot chord was fitted with a propeller drive assembly providing for several axial locations of tractor propellers and pusher propellers. A three-blade 4 -foot propeller and a three-blade 3 1 / 2 -foot propeller of special design were tested in this wing with spinners and fairings ranging in diameter from 6 to 16 inches. A 16 -inch NACA cowling was tested for comparative purposes. Two types of cuffs were also employed. It was found that the net efficiency of a conventional round-shank propeller mounted on an extension shaft in front of or behind a wing increased with an increase in the diameter of the spinner and the <b>shaft</b> <b>housing</b> within the scope of the tests. The largest spinner used had a diameter that might favorably compare with that of a radial engine cowling. The efficiencies for the pusher position appeared to be more critically affected by spinner size than those for the tractor position. The spinners with large diameters for the pusher position resulted in a higher efficiency than those for the corresponding tractor arrangements; the reverse was true for the small spinners. The use of propeller cuffs in combination with a spinner of small diameter generally resulted in net efficiencies that were comparable with those found for the large-spinner combinations...|$|E
40|$|Shaft {{bearing system}} {{analysis}} codes were developed, improved, {{and used to}} investigate Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Liquid Oxygen (LOX) turbopump bearing problems, and to support the Marshall Space Flight Center Bearing and Seal Materials Test (BSMT) program. Thermal network modeling uses the SINDA thermal code, and the modeling of bearing quasi-dynamic characteristics uses the SHABERTH bearing/shaft code. These codes are solved concurrently for a bearing/shaft system using software developed for this purpose. Simulation of the SSME LOX turbopump turbine and pump end bearings and the MSFC BSMT operating in liquid nitrogen (LN sub 2) and LOX was done. The thermal network models include the bearing components, bearing carriers, <b>shaft,</b> <b>housing,</b> frictional heat, and viscous fluid energy. A cage model was included to account for heat generation between the cage and rolling elements. Since most bearing surfaces operate at temperatures well above the coolant saturation temperature, and move at high speed relative to the coolant, forced convection boiling is the dominant mechanism for heat removal. Improved modeling of forced convection film boiling was incorporated {{to take into account}} the local vapor generation at the high temperature surfaces. Rearing preloads in the pump and tester are provided by preload springs. As bearing operating clearances and contact angles change due to thermal effects and loading, the bearing preload changes with these varying conditions. These characteristics were modeled and are included in the overall system models. Results from these models indicate an operational limit which, if exceeded, predicts a thermal excursion...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical Seals {{are used}} {{throughout}} the world as the principle method whereby fluid containment may be achieved between a rotating shaft and the <b>shaft</b> <b>housing.</b> As a key component in fluid transportation, storage, and containment, the reliability and performance of mechanical seals is very important. This paper deals with the design, development, and optimization of unique macro/micro- features, used to improve the mechanical seal performance. This Thesis begins with an introductory background of mechanical seal component design, followed by an introduction of external forces and boundary conditions {{used to describe the}} seal as an axis-symmetric model. A derivation of the governing equation (Reynolds equation) used to describe fluid pressure between two surfaces is then summarized. Followed with a simplification of the Reynolds equation used to describe hydrodynamic lift under the influence of periodic features. The theory behind laser machining, and the method of creating unique features using a laser is then described. The iterative logic structure of code that I developed is then described; A software tool which uses user defined operation (conducted on imported line segments defining the mask and beam shape boundaries) to define and simulate the laser process, which in turn generates the three dimensional geometry. One of the output files from this software (describing the ablated seal interface geometry) is then imported into a proprietary finite element analysis/ fluid mechanics package. The results of the analysis are used for an optimization study to predict the performance of one such unique macro/micro-feature called a tapered channel (patent pending). Following the FEA analysis, actual testing was performed at the Flowserve facility in Temecula, CA. From the test results, it is concluded that laser ablated macro/micro-feature on the sealing interface of a mechanical seal face can be optimized to improve the sealing performance. This is evident by the 65 % reduction in torque, and 69 % reduction in the temperature change measured at the sealing interface in comparison to an un-textured seal fac...|$|E

40|$|PaperPg. 47 - 54. This paper {{describes}} how a serious field vibration problem {{on a high}} speed centrifugal compressor using tilting pad bearings was identified, following the introduction in the plant of simple methods of vibration recording and analysis, as being due to fractional frequency whirl at around 40 % of the running speed. A clear correlation was discovered between the vibration behavior and the bearing clearance. This correlation is shown to match closely the predictions of a theoretical study {{of the effect of}} bearing geometry (clearance and preload) on the stability of the particular rotor/bearing system, when a commonly used empirical criterion for stability is employed, namely that the logarithmic decrement of the system should be at least 0. 25 for instability to be avoided. The study shows that adequate stability could only be achieved in this particular system for bearings lying within a limited range of clearance and preload. Tight clearance, high preload bearings or loose clearance, negative preload bearings both give instability, and variations in bearing dimensions between nominally identical units are shown to be capable of moving the system from the stable to the unstable zone. The vibration problems have now been overcome by proper pad selection aimed at achieving an optimum bearing clearance and preload of about 7 mils and 0. 15, respectively. The marginal stability in this machine is associated {{with the fact that the}} shaft first critical speed is about 44 % of the full running speed, while machines of the same type, but with stiffer shafts giving a critical speed of about 55 % of the running speed, have been free of instability problems. To provide a long term solution to the problem, and to cater for some increase of the maximum running speed in the future, stiffer rotors are being manufactured for the machines to raise the rigid bearing first critical speed to 57 % of the current maximum running speed. In future purchase specifications for high pressure compressors a stability analysis will be requested for machines having a rigid bearing critical less than 60 % of the maximum running speed, which will be required to demonstrate a logarithmic decrement of not less than 0. 4 over the full possible range of bearing geometries, allowing for <b>shaft,</b> <b>housing</b> and pad tolerances, and wear. A main recommendation of the paper is that a refined rule of this type should be developed and incorporated in API 617...|$|E
