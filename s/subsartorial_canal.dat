50|$|The {{femoral artery}} (arteria femoralis) {{is the second}} largest artery in the body (second to the aorta) {{and is in the}} thigh and the main {{arterial}} supply to the lower limb. It enters the thigh from behind the inguinal ligament as the common femoral artery, a continuation of the external iliac artery. Here, it lies midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis. The common femoral artery gives off the profunda femoris artery and becomes the superficial femoral artery to descend along the anteromedial part of the thigh in the femoral triangle. It enters and passes through the adductor (<b>subsartorial)</b> <b>canal,</b> and becomes the popliteal artery as it passes through an opening in adductor magnus near the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the thigh.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that entrapment of the saphenous nerve may occur {{at the point where the}} nerve goes through the fascia between the vastus medialis and adductor magnus muscles 2, but the cases of the two patients in this report involve different situations. In the first patient, the nerve was compressed between the femoral artery and a branch of the artery, with the accompanying vein. In the second patient, the nerve was compressed between the branch of the femoral artery and the tendon of the adductor magnus. In both patients, the compression occurred more proximally than the usual site of entrapment, namely the <b>subsartorial</b> <b>canal.</b> Case Reports CASE 1. A thirteen-year-old girl had a two-year history of increasing pain in the medial aspect of the left knee. While running, the patient ha...|$|E
40|$|Crush {{injuries}} {{of severe}} magnitude involving lower limbs require complex bone and soft tissue reconstructions {{in the form}} of microvascular free tissue transfers. However, satisfactory recipient vessels are often unavailable in the leg due to their vulnerability to trauma and post traumatic vessel disease (PTVD), which extends well beyond the site of original injury. In such situations, healthy recipient vessels for free flap anastomosis can be made available by constructing temporary arteriovenous loops with saphenous vein grafts, anastomosed to corresponding free flap vessels. Our study included 7 patients with severe crush injuries of leg due to rail and road traffic accidents. Long and short saphenous vein grafts were anastomosed to Femoral artery in the <b>subsartorial</b> <b>canal</b> in 2 cases and to large muscular branches and accompanying veins in rest of the cases. Free flap transfers were performed in the same sitting in 6 cases. One case showed insufficient dilatation of the vein loop and hence free flap transfer was staged. Free Latissimus dorsi, Gracilis and Rectus abdominis flaps were performed. There were two cases of flap necrosis - one {{in the case of a}} pathologic vein graft with staged flap transfer which showed vein thrombosis on re exploration. The other case of flap failure was caused by a hematoma underneath the flap. In another patient, secondary haemorrhage occurred on day 18, without any consequence to the flap. All the other cases had complete free flap survival. We consider the use of single stage arteriovenous loops, a valuable tool to increase the applications of free flap, whenever healthy recipient vessels are not available in the periphery of the trauma...|$|E
50|$|The {{adductor}} <b>canal</b> (<b>subsartorial</b> or Hunterâ€™s <b>canal)</b> is an aponeurotic tunnel in {{the middle}} third of the thigh, extending from {{the apex of the}} femoral triangle to the opening in the adductor magnus, the adductor hiatus.|$|R
