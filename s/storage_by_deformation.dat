40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{relative}} severity of regulatory impacts onto an essentially rigid target to impacts at higher velocities onto real targets. For impacts onto the essentially rigid target all of the kinetic energy of the package is absorbed <b>by</b> <b>deformation</b> of the package. For impacts onto real targets the kinetic energy is absorbed <b>by</b> <b>deformation</b> of the target as well as <b>by</b> <b>deformation</b> of the package. The amount of kinetic energy absorbed by the target does not increase the severity of the impact...|$|R

40|$|Energy <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> cyclic {{electron}} flow through photosystem I (PSI) {{was measured in}} vivo using the photoacoustic technique. A wide variety of photosynthetic organisms were considered and all showed measurable energy <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> PSI-cyclic {{electron flow}} except for higher plants using the C- 3 carbon fixation pathway. The capacity for energy <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> PSI-cyclic electron flow alone {{was found to be}} small in comparison to that of linear and cyclic electron flows combined but may be significant, nonetheless, under conditions when photosystem II is damaged, particularly in cyanobacteria. Light-induced dynamics of energy <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> PSI-cyclic electron flow were evident, demonstrating regulation under changing environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{kernel of}} scientific {{software is the}} multiplication of a sparse matrix by a vector. The efficiency of the algorithm on a vector computer depends on the storage scheme. With a <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> rows, performances are limited in general by the small vector length. Therefore a <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> so-called generalized colums has been designed, which provides long vectors and consequently good performances. However, it is not adapted to the symmetric case. A new type of <b>storage,</b> <b>by</b> sparse diagonals, has then been defined. It still exhibits long vectors, with performances as good as previously, {{but it is also}} well-suited to symmetric matrices. Results on a Cray 2, with various sparse matrices, compare the three algorithms, and show the efficiency of the <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> sparse diagonale...|$|R

In the case of superconducting cavities, these are commonly tuned <b>by</b> <b>deformation</b> of the cavity wall in specific places of the geometry. Nevertheless, considering the mechanical properties and the frequency versus displacement sensitivity of some accelerating structures, tuning <b>by</b> <b>deformation</b> does not allow meeting the requirements.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{several possible}} generalizations of tomography for quadratic surfaces. We analyze {{different types of}} elliptic, hyperbolic and hybrid tomograms. In all cases {{it is possible to}} consistently define the inverse tomographic map. We find two different ways of introducing tomographic sections. The first method operates <b>by</b> <b>deformations</b> of the standard Radon transform. The second method proceeds by shifting a given quadric pattern. The most general tomographic transformation can be defined in terms of marginals over surfaces generated <b>by</b> <b>deformations</b> of complete families of hyperplanes or quadrics.

We wanted to see memory and processor influence in battery energy consumption. We have created a program which can do matrix multiplication and sparse matrix „storage by columns“ multiplication. During multiplication program takes battery information and saves it into the file. After that I have investigated the result and saw, that sparse matrix <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> columns multiplication is much more effectived than normal matrix multiplication. Sparce matrix <b>storage</b> <b>by</b> columns multiplication take less memory and more processor commands then normal matrix multiplication.
