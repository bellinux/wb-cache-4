40|$|Needleless {{connectors}} {{are being}} increasingly used for {{direct access to}} intravascular catheters. However, the potential for microbial contamination of these devices and subsequent infection risk is still widely debated. In this study the microbial contamination rate associated with three-way stopcock luers with <b>standard</b> <b>caps</b> attached was compared to those with Y-type extension set luers with Clearlink® needleless connectors attached. Fifty patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery who required a central venous catheter (CVC) {{as part of their}} peri- and postoperative management were studied for microbial contamination of CVC luers following 72 hrs in situ. Each patient's CVC was randomly designated to have either the three-way stopcocks with caps (control patients) or Clearlink® Y-type extension sets (test patients). Prior to, and following each manipulation of the three-way stopcock luers or Clearlink® devices, a 70 % (v/v) isopropyl alcohol swab was used for disinfection of the connections. The microbial contamination of 393 luers, 200 with <b>standard</b> <b>caps</b> and 193 with Clearlink® attached, was determined. The internal surfaces of 20 of 200 (10 %) three-way stopcock luers with <b>standard</b> <b>caps</b> were contaminated with micro-organisms whereas only one of 193 (0. 5 %) luers with Clearlink® attached was contaminated (P < 0. 0001). These results demonstrate that the use of the Clearlink® device with a dedicated disinfection regimen reduces the internal microbial contamination rate of CVC luers compared with <b>standard</b> <b>caps.</b> The use of such needle-free devices may therefore reduce the intraluminal risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection and thereby supplement current preventive guidelines. © 2006 The Hospital Infection Society...|$|R

50|$|Contrary to throttling, {{in order}} to use {{bandwidth}} when available, but prevent excess, each node in a proactive system should set an outgoing bandwidth cap that appropriately limits the total number of bytes sent per unit time.

50|$|A {{player who}} closes the betting round by calling or overcalling is {{entitled}} to greater freedom by doing so, since he does not face the threat of subsequent raises. This is especially true when comparing limit hold'em games with a <b>standard</b> <b>cap</b> (3 raises) to an elevated cap (4 raises) or capless game. A player can cap with as much as 80% of his flat calling range when he knows he cannot be {{forced out of the}} pot and no opponent can make his hand appear much stronger by raising. This is particularly correct when closing the action on the river in Texas hold'em or on the 7th street in stud poker, where a player can make calldowns with hands that are unlikely to win simply because of the pot odds he is getting and the fact he cannot be bluffed out of the pot.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPost-combustion {{chemical}} absorption {{is regarded}} as the state-of-the-art commercially-available CO 2 capture process.

The reference <b>standard</b> <b>CAP</b> and the advanced crystallizer-based CAP are simulated in Aspen using the Extended UNIQUAC thermodynamic model. The two CAP solutions are compared in term of the different energy penalties introduced applying the capture process to a conventional Ultra Super Critical (USC) power plant.

40|$|Background. Brain {{computer}} interfaces (BCI) {{based on}} electro-encephalography (EEG) {{have been shown}} to detect mental states accurately and non-invasively, but the equipment required so far is cumbersome and the resulting signal is difficult to analyze. BCI requires accurate classification of small amplitude brain signal components in single trials from recordings which can be compromised by currents induced by muscle activity. Methodology/Principal Findings. A novel EEG cap based on dry electrodes was developed which does not need time-consuming gel application and uses far fewer electrodes than on a standard EEG cap set-up. After optimizing the placement of the 6 dry electrodes through off-line analysis of <b>standard</b> <b>cap</b> experiments, dry cap performance was tested {{in the context of a}} well established BCI cursor control paradigm in 5 healthy subjects using analysis methods which do not necessitate user training. The resulting information transfer rate was on average about 30 % slower than the <b>standard</b> <b>cap.</b> The potential contribution of involuntary muscle activity artifact to the BCI control signal was found to be inconsequential, while the detected signal was consistent with brain activity originating near the motor cortex. Conclusions/Significance. Our study shows that a surprisingly simple and convenient method of brain activity imaging is possible, and that simple and robust analysis techniques exist which discriminate among mental states in single trials. Within 15 minutes the dry BCI device is set-up, calibrated and ready to use. Peak performance matched reported EEG BCI state of the art in one subject.

40|$|A new deprotection {{procedure}} in {{the synthesis of}} (partially) phosphate-methylated oligodeoxynucleotides has been developed, involving treatment of fully protected DNA fragments with methanolic potassium carbonate. It is shown that base deprotection can be accomplished in potassium carbonate/methanol without affecting the methyl phosphotriesters. This methodology enables us to synthesize, both in solution and on a solid support, DNA fragments which are phosphate-methylated at defined positions. The solid phase synthesis, however, {{turns out to be}} accompanied by considerable demethylation of the phosphotriesters.

40|$|EEG data {{recorded}} during simultaneous fMRI are {{contaminated by}} large voltages generated by time-varying magnetic field gradients. Correction {{of the resulting}} gradient artefact (GA) generally involves low-pass filtering to attenuate the high-frequency voltage fluctuations of the GA, followed by subtraction of a GA template produced by averaging over repeats of the artefact waveforms. This average artefact subtraction (AAS) process relies on the EEG amplifier having a large enough dynamic range to characterise the artefact voltages and on invariance of the artefact waveform over repeated image acquisitions. Saturation of the amplifiers and changes in subject position can leave unwanted residual GA after AAS. Previous modelling work suggested that modifying the lead layout and the exit position of the cable bundle on the EEG cap could reduce the GA amplitude. Here, we used simulations and experiments to evaluate the effect of modifying the lead paths on {{the magnitude of the}} GA and on the residual artefact after AAS. The modelling work showed that for wire paths following great circles, the smallest overall GA occurs when the leads converge at electrode Cz. The performance of this new cap design was compared with a <b>standard</b> <b>cap</b> in experiments on a spherical agar phantom and human subjects. Using gradient pulses applied separately along the three Cartesian axes, we found that the GA due to the foot-head gradient was most significantly reduced relative to a <b>standard</b> <b>cap</b> for the phantom, whereas the anterior-posterior GA was most attenuated for human subjects. In addition, there was an overall 37 % reduction in the RMS GA amplitude produced by a standard EPI sequence when comparing the two caps on the phantom. In contrast, the subjects showed an 11 % increase in the average RMS of the GA. This work shows that the optimal design reduces the GA on a spherical phantom however; these gains are not translated to human subjects, probably due to the differences in geometry...|$|E

The whole detection electronics was placed in a plastic screw holder compatible with the electroencephalography <b>standard</b> <b>cap</b> for measurement on brain or with custom probe holders. The SiPM is inserted into a transparent and insulating resin to avoid the direct contact of the scalp with the 100 -V bias voltage.

40|$|Genomic RNA of primate lentiviruses {{serves both}} as an mRNA that encodes Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins and as a {{propagated}} genome. Translation of this RNA is initiated by <b>standard</b> <b>cap</b> dependant mechanism or by internal entry of the ribosome. Two regions of the genomic RNA are able to attract initiation complexes, the 5 ′ untranslated region and the gag coding region itself. Relying on probing data and a phylogenetic study, we have modelled the secondary structure of HIV- 1, HIV- 2 and SIVMac coding region. This approach brings to light conserved secondary-structure elements that were shown by mutations to be required for internal entry of the ribosome. No structural homologies with other described viral or cellular IRES can be identified and lentiviral IRESes show many peculiar properties. Most notably, the IRES present in HIV- 2 gag coding region is endowed with the unique ability to recruit up to three initiation complexes on a single RNA molecule. The structural and functional properties of gag coding sequence define {{a new type of}} IRES. Although its precise role is unknown, the conservation of the IRES among fast evolving lentiviruses suggests an important physiological role...|$|E
