5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skunk. Such prey often send clear and honest warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such warning signs is correlated {{with the level of}} toxicity of the organism.|$|E
25|$|Kiba, {{an injured}} lone white wolf, goes to Freeze City {{following}} the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lunar Flower, {{which is the}} key to opening Paradise. There he encounters Tsume, Hige and Toboe, three other wolves who were drawn to Freeze City by the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lunar Flower and are now living in the city. The wolves encounter Quent Yaiden, a former Sheriff of Kyrios who is obsessed with hunting down wolves, and his dog Blue. Cheza, the Flower Maiden who is destined to lead the wolves to Paradise, is being studied at a laboratory under the care of Cher Degré. She is awakened by the smell of wolf's blood. As Kiba and Hige approach the lab to find her, she is stolen away by Lord Darcia the Third, whose people created Cheza.|$|E
25|$|Fractionation: Through {{the use of}} a {{fractionation}} column, different fractions distilled from {{a material}} can be selectively excluded to modify the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final product. Although the product is more expensive, this is sometimes performed to remove unpleasant or undesirable scents of a material and affords the perfumer more control over their composition process.|$|E

25|$|During the nesting season, {{burrowing}} owls {{will collect}} {{a wide variety}} of materials to line their nest, some of which are left around the entrance to the burrow. The most common material is mammal dung, usually from cattle. At one time it was thought that the dung helped to mask the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> juvenile owls, but researchers now believe the dung helps to control the microclimate inside the burrow and to attract insects, which the owls may eat.|$|E
25|$|Some {{plant species}} co-evolved with a {{particular}} pollinator species, such as the bee orchid. The species is almost exclusively self-pollinating in its northern ranges, but is pollinated by the solitary bee Eucera in the Mediterranean area. The plant attracts these insects by producing a scent that mimics the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female bee. In addition, the lip acts as a decoy, as the male bee confuses it with a female that is visiting a pink flower. Pollen transfer occurs during the ensuing pseudocopulation.|$|E
25|$|Ethyl acetate is used {{primarily}} as a solvent and diluent, being favored because of its low cost, low toxicity, and agreeable odor. For example, {{it is commonly used}} to clean circuit boards and in some nail varnish removers (acetone and acetonitrile are also used). Coffee beans and tea leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent. It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener. Ethyl acetate is present in confectionery, perfumes, and fruits. In perfumes, it evaporates quickly, leaving only the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perfume on the skin.|$|E

25|$|The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), {{a distant}} {{relative}} of the European red fox, is also hunted in North America. It is an adept climber of trees, making it harder to hunt with hounds. The <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gray fox is {{not as strong as}} that of the red, therefore more time is needed for the hounds to take the scent. Unlike the red fox which, during the chase, will run far ahead from the pack, the gray fox will speed toward heavy brush, thus making it more difficult to pursue. Also unlike the red fox, which occurs more prominently in the northern United States, the more southern gray fox is rarely hunted on horseback, due to its densely covered habitat preferences.|$|E
25|$|Nathan of Gaza’s prophecy about Shabbetai Zevi was not {{his only}} mental visualization. On the contrary, as the years passed, he would have many other visions, all of which would aid his {{movement}} and promote the belief in Shabbetai Zevi. His second vision in fact came {{on the evening of}} the Shavu’ot festival in the spring of 1665. Unlike his prophetic awakening, here, Nathan of Gaza was said to have undergone a spiritual possession by a maggid, or a divine spirit. At the moment of this spiritual takeover, he was described as dancing wildly and emitting a special kind of odor. This smell is described in the Zohar and is believed {{to be associated with the}} <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garden of Eden as well as of the prophet Elisha and Rabbi Isaac Luria.|$|E
25|$|Research studies provide {{evidence}} that the fetus becomes familiar with chemical cues in the intrauterine environment. Intrauterine olfactory learning may be demonstrated by behavioral evidence that newborn infants respond positively to the smell of their own amniotic fluid. Infants are responsive to the olfactory cues associated with maternal breast odors. They are able to recognize and react favorably to scents emitted from their own mother’s breasts, {{despite the fact that}} they also may be attracted to breast odors from unfamiliar nursing females in a different context. The unique <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother (to the infant) is referred to as her olfactory signature. While breasts are a source of the unique olfactory cue of the mother, infants are also able to recognize and respond with familiarity and preference to their mother’s underarm scent.|$|E

50|$|For a {{long period}} there weren't any ruins {{identified}} as Ashli. Vasily Tatishchev assumed that the ruins near Yantikovsky (Kirelsky) in what is today Kamsko-Ustyinsky District (Kama-Ustjin District) were <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> Ashla. Another supporter of this version, A. Smirnov, advanced that <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city comes from <b>the</b> Esegel tribe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Volga Bulgars. Yantikovsky's ruins were flooded with <b>the</b> infill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kuybyshev Reservoir in the 1950s, however, they were totally explored.

25|$|This {{new version}} of Krypto has all the {{physical}} abilities of his pre-Crisis predecessor, but with a normal canine intellect. This initially causes {{a great deal of}} trouble for his new master when, for instance, he would scratch at a door to indicate he wanted to go out and unintentionally gouged big chunks out of the door with his super strength, or inflicting grievous bodily harm when combating villains (since Krypto bites the way a regular canine would, only without being careful about his super strength). As a result, Krypto is for some time locked away in the Fortress of Solitude under the care of one of Superman's robots. This robot is programmed to emit the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dog's real master. Superman has {{gone to great lengths to}} train the dog, and he now occasionally accompanies the Man of Steel on missions. Batman never misses an opportunity to poke fun at Krypto when Batman and Superman don't see eye-to-eye.|$|E
25|$|From {{this period}} {{there are many}} {{examples}} of formal gardens created for nobles, gentry and lairds. By {{the end of the}} seventeenth century there were at least 141 formal gardens and orchards in Scotland. The gardens of Aberdour Castle were redeveloped along with the building for the regent James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton (c. 1516–81), perhaps as an area for public display. Extensive gardens were developed at Pinkie House by Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline (1555–1622), with lawns, fountains, ponds and aviaries, designed for the entertainment of guests. Dunfermline's nephew, George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (1584–1650), planted a herb garden at Seaton House in 1620. The Earl of Sutherland's castle at Dunrobin was surrounded by orchards, herbs and flowers. The best surviving garden from the early seventeenth century is that at Edzell Castle, where, between 1604 and 1610, David Lindsay (1551?–1610) created an enclosure of Renaissance-style walls, adorned with sculptures of the seven Cardinal Virtues, the seven Liberal Arts and the seven Planetary Deities, the expense of which eventually bankrupted him. The change to walled gardens may have been because of a change of attitudes to smells, with the walls helping to intensify the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> herbs and flowers that grew there.|$|E
500|$|A major {{difference}} in hunting performance {{is whether a}} dog is hot-nosed, meaning it will skip an older scent to follow a fresher one, or cold-nosed, meaning it will follow an older <b>scent.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> six coonhound breeds, the hot-nosed Treeing Walker Coonhound is the most popular. Some hunters also use Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dogs, although this breed is not a hound but a cur.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFlowers of many {{angiosperms}} attract fly pollinators through mimicry {{of animal}} carrion and faeces. This phenomenon of “sapromyiophily” {{is also evident}} in <b>the</b> sporophytes <b>of</b> some mosses and fruiting bodies of “stinkhorn” fungi, both of which use flies as agents of spore dispersal. We studied <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> chemistry <b>of</b> a stinkhorn fungus (Clathrus archeri) and seven fly-pollinated plant species with foetid odours to determine {{the degree to which}} these organisms mimic <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> carrion and faeces (reference scent samples were collected from rotting meat, a rat carcass and horse and dog faeces), as well as <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> convergent evolution between the fungus and angiosperm flowers. We found that <b>scents</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> fungus and angiosperms tended to contain compounds typical of carrion, such as oligosulphides, and of faeces, such as phenol, indole and p-cresol. This study provides compelling new evidence for mimicry of carrion and faeces, as well as a striking pattern <b>of</b> convergence in <b>the</b> putrid <b>scents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fungus and the angiosperms, relative to those <b>of</b> confamilial species. <b>The</b> syndrome <b>of</b> sapromyiophily thus encompasses at least two kingdoms (Plantae and Fungi) and provides an effective means of exploiting flies as agents of pollen and spore dispersal...|$|R
30|$|From a {{chemical}} perspective, the human scent {{is a complicated}} mixture of several thousand compounds that significantly differ (Curran et al. 2010; Curran et al. 2005; Doležal et al. 2017; Gallagher et al. 2008) in concentration and chemical properties. The human scent can usually be classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary categories (Curran et al. 2005). The primary scent category includes compounds that {{are assumed to be}} genetically conditioned. Their relative concentrations are approximately stable over time regardless of environmental factors, diet, weather, humidity, visceral state, emotional state, illness, menstrual cycle, medication, etc. On the other hand, the skin scent compounds, whose amounts depend on these internal and external factors, are in the secondary category. Finally, tertiary scents originate from the external environment, e.g., from cosmetics used, <b>scents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workplace, gasoline, smoking, <b>scents</b> <b>of</b> other people, and domestic animals.|$|R

500|$|The University of California at Berkeley {{commissioned}} American neoclassical composer Roger Sessions (1896–1985) to set {{the poem}} as a cantata to commemorate their centennial anniversary in 1964. Sessions did not finish composing the work until the 1970s, dedicating it to the memories of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. and political figure Robert F. Kennedy, both assassinated in 1968. Sessions first became acquainted with Leaves of Grass in 1921 and began setting the poem {{as a reaction to}} the death of his friend, George Bartlett, although none of the sketches from that early attempt survive. [...] He returned to the text almost fifty years later, composing a work scored for soprano, contralto, and baritone soloists, mixed chorus and orchestra. The music is described as responding [...] "wonderfully both to the Biblical majesty and musical fluidity of Whitman's poetry, and here to, in the evocation of the gray-brown bird singing from the swamp and of the over-mastering <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lilacs, he gives us one of the century's great love letters to Nature." ...|$|E
500|$|Interspecific {{competition}} between the great white shark and the orca is probable in regions where dietary preferences of both species may overlap. An incident was documented on 4 October 1997, in the Farallon Islands off California in the United States. An estimated [...] female orca immobilized an estimated [...] great white shark. The orca held the shark upside down to induce tonic immobility and kept the shark still for fifteen minutes, causing it to suffocate. The orca then proceeded to eat the dead shark's liver. It is believed that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slain shark's carcass caused all the great whites {{in the region to}} flee, forfeiting an opportunity for a great seasonal feed. Another similar attack apparently occurred there in 2000, but its outcome is not clear. After both attacks, the local population of about 100 great whites vanished. Following the 2000 incident, a great white with a satellite tag was found to have immediately submerged to a depth of [...] and swum to Hawaii. In 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a great white shark off South Australia. In 2017, along the South African coast, four great whites were found washed ashore with their livers removed with what was described as 'surgical precision'. Local scientists claim that pods of orcas in the area were to blame for the attacks.|$|E

[...] Helen Bushby from BBC commented that [...] "he book is certainly detailed, and will no doubt keep Madonna fanatics happy, although it is perhaps more of a reference book than a page-turner.

[...] Michael Sneed from Chicago Sun-Times gave a negative review {{of the book and}} felt that Morton's previous works had been better. George Rush from New York Daily News commented: [...] "Despite her best efforts to discourage friends from cooperating with him, Andrew Morton has come forth with a book that portrays Madge as an insecure manipulator so ravenous for affection that she scared off some boyfriends, cheated on most of them and made a lot of foolish choices." [...] In another review, Sherryl Connelly from the same publication was of the opinion that Madonna was mostly similar to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography on her, [...] She added, [...] "At least, it's the story made familiar by Madonna, a woman who has always taken for granted the world's interest in her life." ...|$|E
