50|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} to compensate for display technologies other than CRT. It relies on one or several infrared light emitters placed near the screen, and one IR sensor on the muzzle of the gun.

Then, by projecting the muzzle on the screen with the measured angles the impact point is determined.

5000|$|Changes in <b>screen</b> <b>angle</b> (panning) may be {{necessary}} to prevent closeups between two speakers where only one person is visible in the pan-and-scan version and both participants seem to speak alternately to persons off camera; this comes at the cost of losing the smoothness of scenes. Inversely, the cropping of a film originally shown in the standard ratio to fit widescreen televisions may cut off foreground or background, such as a tap-dance scene in which much attention is directed appropriately at a dancer's feet. This situation will commonly occur whenever a widescreen TV is set to display full images without stretching (often called the zoom setting) on images with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 or less.

40|$|Abstract. Moire, an {{abnormal}} printing pattern formed by irregular screen tone, may adversely affect the printing quality {{and should be}} avoided during printing. Hence, {{it is necessary to}} understand the factors contributing to its formation. Being {{one of the most important}} factors, the effect of <b>screen</b> <b>angle</b> is discussed in this paper. To obtain the most suitable <b>screen</b> <b>angle</b> and confirm its rationality, Photoshop is used to simulate Moire patterns under different <b>screen</b> <b>angle</b> conditions and analyze the relationship between screen angles and formation of Moire pattern. When mixing two of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black colors randomly while keeping the others constant, the size of the Moire is not affected by screen angles but by the angle differences. When the difference is at 28 ° and 38 °, Moire pattern is not obvious and the dots are evenly distributed. The <b>screen</b> <b>angle</b> difference and the <b>screen</b> <b>angle</b> of the key color are also analyzed from the Moire pattern obtained by varying <b>screen</b> <b>angle</b> between C, M, and K (Black) in the simulation study.

40|$|From the {{pioneering}} {{efforts of the}} early 1960 2 ̆ 7 s, flexography has shown steady progress {{in the development of}} four color process printing. However, the ability to consistently produce it is limited to an elite group. The vast majority of companies have yet to competitively enter this demanding area of printing. For these companies the time, expense, and expertise required to conduct an indepth study is a major deterrent. Outside information must be made available to aid the companies. The FTA and its members have greatly contributed by publishing an array of information; although, some basic questions have yet to be answered. Of these questions, proper <b>screen</b> <b>angling</b> for the elimination of moire 2 ̆ 7 patterns is an open topic. The occurrence of moire 2 ̆ 7 patterns in flexography {{is the result of the}} 45 degree cellular pattern of the anilox combined with the 45 degree tonal pattern of the plate image. To eliminate the moire 2 ̆ 7, most f lexographers 2 ̆ 2 offset 2 ̆ 2 the four <b>screening</b> <b>angles</b> by a predetermined amount. For example, instead of screening at 45, 75, 90, and 105 degrees, a company may screen at 52, 82, 97, and 112 degrees. The recommendation of offsetting the four <b>screening</b> <b>angles</b> was given in 1968 and was based on tests conducted with 200 and 220 anilox rolls. Since that time, Parmarco, Inc., has introduced finer count anilox rolls under the trade name of 2 ̆ 2 Tone and Process. 2 ̆ 2 It is the belief of Mr. Douglas E. Tuttle, Vice President, Marketing, Parmarco, Inc., that when using Tone and Process anilox rolls, the following is true: [1] A moire 2 ̆ 7 will not be produced with the 45 degree plate image. [2] The standard angles can be used by f lexographers when printing four color process work via flexography. [3] A Tone and Process anilox roll will produce a moire 1 once it is sufficiently worn. The thesis hypothesis addresses the topic of <b>screen</b> <b>angling</b> when printing four color process work with 4 00 TPB anilox rolls and 100 line plate images. The methodology focuses on three separate tests. Tests one and two investigate the suggestion that the standard angles can be used without a moire 2 ̆ 7 appearing in the final print. Test three considers the suggestion that a moire 1 will be produced with the 45 degree printer once the 400 TPB anilox is sufficiently worn. The results of tests one and two support the hypothesis that the standard angles of 45, 75, 90, and 105 degrees can be used by the flexographer when printing with 4 00 TPB anilox rolls and 100 line plate images. It is also concluded that a 400 TPB anilox will produce a moire 2 ̆ 7 once it is sufficiently worn...|$|R

40|$|For {{electrophotographic}} printers, periodic clustered screens are preferable due {{to their}} homogeneous halftone texture, robustness to dot gain, and increased dot stability. In traditional periodic clustered-dot color halftoning, to avoid the complete dot-on-dot printing, each color plane is independently rendered with a different screen at a different angle. However, depending on the <b>screen</b> <b>angle</b> and frequency, the final halftone may have strong visible moire due to {{the interaction of the}} periodic structure. Additionally, the slight displacement between each color plane may cause significant color shifts in the final halftone. This thesis addresses issues on finding optimal color screen sets which produce the minimal visible moire and are also robust to registration errors. To achieve these goals, this thesis proposes new techniques including common periodicity, halftone microtexture spectrum, and registration sensitivity analysis. The common periodicity of two different periodic screens characterizes the structural patterns of the mixed colors. In particular, large common periodic patterns are found to inherently produce dot-on-dot patterns with good robustness against registration errors. The halftone microtexture spectrum method is shown to predict the visible moire more accurately than the conventional moire-free conditions. In our registration sensitivity analysis, three propositions are established using the periodicity of periodic screens. From the established propositions, we derive the conditions for registration insensitivity. Our results demonstrate significant improvements of clustered-dot screens in terms of the resilience against registration errors and minimizing the visible moire over the conventional periodic screens. ...|$|E

In the graphic arts, the term moiré means an excessively visible moiré pattern.

40|$|In {{the graphic}} arts, {{objectionable}} moire patterns are often observed on films or printed products {{due to the}} interaction of various periodic structures of halftone images. A particular type of moire pattern that results from digital halftoning at arbitrary angles and frequencies using a virtual screen function has been studied. A computer program was developed that produces uniform digital halftone patterns using a virtual screen approach and that calculates the corresponding amplitude spectra. It was found that aliasing due to the sampling of the virtual screen causes low frequency components in the amplitude spectrum. Moire patterns with fundamental vector frequencies equal {{to those of the}} strong aliased components were observed in halftone images reconstructed on a film recorder. Moire was also observed at frequencies not represented or under represented in the amplitude spectrum. It is shown that this moire effect is due to the additive beating of two or more higher frequency components that differ by the frequency of the observed moire. It is suggested that the non-linearities of the film recording process amplify this effect. The effects on the resulting moire patterns of varying the halftone parameters of dot size, dot shape, <b>screen</b> <b>angle,</b> and screen frequency were examined. In general, the amplitude spectra are complex, indicating many overlapping patterns. Screener induced moire was found to behave in a nearly identical manner to that induced by digital scanning of an existing halftone...|$|E
40|$|Due to some {{inherent}} advantages, rotated dot screens are {{the most}} common halftoning method. The color re-production of rotated dot schemes is more robust with respect to mis-registration errors than color reproduc-tion using other halftoning schemes (e. g., dot-on-dot or dot-off-dot). In order to achieve good overall print qual-ity, however, the angles between the different color sepa-rations have to be precisely controlled, or moiré will occur. This precise control of the screen angles is gener-ally not possible in digital systems with their inherent discrete resolution. At the high resolutions commonly used in offset printing (e. g., ≥ 2400 × 2400 dpi), the dis-crete nature of the screen is normally not a critical is-sue. The problem persists, however, at resolutions commonly found in xerographic printers. Because moiré is a strong function of the relative screen angles, especially of the c,m,k separations, many approaches have been explored for mitigating moiré pat-terns via halftone screen and <b>screen</b> <b>angle</b> design. How-ever, as will be shown in this paper, moiré is also a strong function of the geometry of the individual halftone dot, specifically the dot area coverage of the halftone dot. It is this dependence that is described and exploited in this paper. More specifically, a method is described that reduces the c,m,k moiré by using a variable undercolor removal (UCR) and gray component replacement (GCR) scheme for a given halftone screen. Preliminary work was published in a conference proceeding. 10 This article is a more detailed and complete description of the work. Modeling Moiré In Color Printing The effect of moiré in color printing has long been known and has led to the common color layout of using cyan and magenta at plus and minus 15 °, black, or key, at 45 ° and yellow at 0 °. In this scenario, cyan, magenta and black use the identical screen frequencies. In this way, the interaction, or moiré, between cyan and ma-genta has identical frequency and orientation as the black separation. The result is a zero frequency moir...|$|E

Structured VEP and „pattern” electroretinogram (PERG) was performed on Mistral-Medelec computerized machine; with angle of stimulation CHESS of 30 minutes, <b>screen</b> <b>angle</b> of 15 – 19 degrees and maximal CHESS contrast. We performed a total of 128 stimulations with use of surface skin electrodes and stimulus frequency of 2 Hz. In {{patients with}} high myopia, visual acuity was between 1. 0 and 0. 1. The average latency value of P- 100 waves of PVEP in patients with high myopia was 119. 4 msec and was in correlation with the reduction of visual acuity of the researched eye (p< 0. 05). The average values of P- 100 waves amplitudes were statistically significantly lower compared to the control group (3. 9 msec). The amplitude values P 1 and N 2 of PERG were significantly lower compared to the values from the control group (p< 0. 01). The decrease in amplitude value was in correlation with the decline of visual acuity and the degree of degenerative changes at eye base. Latency values of P 1 and N 2 waves of PERG were slightly prolonged without any statistical significance. Considering that „pattern” electroretinogram maintains electrical activity of inner layers of retina, most of all of ganglion cells, and PVEP records the electrical response of ganglion cells which mostly originate from macula, these methods can, therefore, give us an insight as to the degree of their damage in high myopia. In this way we can use these methods in evaluation of these patients and the assessment of functional retina damage in progressive myopia...|$|E
