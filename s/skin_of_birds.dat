40|$|Bacteriological studies {{revealed}} that normal tissue, air sacs, feathers, <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds,</b> poultry feed, gut, and chicken droppings were {{sources of the}} predominant organisms, including staphylococci, found in bruised poultry tissue. Further investigation of normal tissue {{revealed that}} after the intramuscular injection of Staphylococcus aureus, marker strain (MS), the organism was eliminated from these tissues within 7 days. However, when these tissues were traumatized 3 days after injection, {{the number of the}} test organism increased, and the organism was present on the 7 th day after inoculation. Poultry feed and fecal material contained a large number of staphylococci identical to those isolated from bruised tissue (McCarthy, Brown, and Hamdy, 1963), thereby implicating the gut as a possible portal of entry. When a pathogenic marker strain of S. aureus was established in the intestinal tract of chickens by administering an active culture of this organism either in their drinking water or by gavage, it was recovered from the traumatized tissue. The incidence of positive culture of S. aureus MS in these tissues correlated with age of bruise, reaching 22 to 33 % immediately after contusion and at the early stages of healing (1 to 3 days post bruise) and decreasing thereafter from 11 to 0 % on the 4 th through 6 th days after bruise infliction. The air sac was also found to be a site by which bacteria may enter the traumatized tissues, but to a limited extent...|$|E
40|$|This poster {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a study (Le Souëf et al, in press) aimed to create an aging tool for black cockatoos using pentosidine analysis. Prior to this study {{it was not possible to}} estimate the age of black cockatoos past juvenile stages, however, recently age estimation of several avian species has been achieved using pentosidine measurement. Pentosidine, an advanced glycation end-product (AGE), accumulates in the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> over time and can be used as a biomarker of aging (Iqbal et al. 1999). Skin samples were collected from 51 black cockatoos of known age from the genus Calyptorhynchus and analysed for pentosidine concentration using high performance liquid chromatography. The plot of Ps against age was found to have a curvilinear relationship with a significant statistical association (R 2 = 0. 86). This study offers the most accurate (within approximately two years (Fallon 2009)) model of age prediction in these birds past juvenile stages. This age tool will be used in ongoing demographic research in the Black Cockatoo Health and Ecology project at Murdoch University. The method will enable the estimation of age of black cockatoos entering rehabilitation programs, providing valuable data on the life histories of injured and debilitated wild birds. It is also being used to study the age demographics of wild populations, including cockatoos that were killed during a heat event in Hopetoun and Munglinup in 2010, providing further insight into the current status of these endangered birds...|$|E

The tail is, like that of Paradisea, composed of 12 feathers, of which the central pair is much elongated, like in P. apoda and minor, but the barbs are a little longer, those of the outer web are longer than those of the inner web and of a metallic green colour.
