Well-established knowledge of RC <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> behavior is necessary because severe damage within a joint panel may trigger deterioration of the overall performance of RC beam-column connections or frames. However, despite the importance of understanding RC <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> behavior, a consensus on the ways in which some parameters affect <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength has not been reached. In addition, there has generally been no accepted behavior model for RC <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> stress vs. <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strain. Therefore, in this research a more systematic understanding of RC <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> behavior has been achieved by completing the following tasks: construction of an extensive experimental database, characterization of RC <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> behavior, and development of RC <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength models and proposed <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> behavior models. An extensive experimental RC beam-column connection database (of 341 subassemblies in total) was constructed and classified by governing failure mode sequence, in-plane geometry, outof- plane geometry, and joint eccentricity. All included subassemblies were made at a minimum of one-third scale, and all used conventional types of reinforcement anchorages. RC <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> behavior was described as an envelope curve by connecting key points displaying the most distinctive stiffness changes. The first point indicates initiation of diagonal cracking within a joint panel, the second point results from yielding of reinforcement, and the third point corresponds to maximum response. An RC <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength model was then developed using the experimental database in conjunction with the Bayesian parameter estimation method. A simple and unified <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> deformation model (at maximum response) was also developed, following the same procedure used to develop the simple and unified <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength model. Full RC <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> behavior models were constructed by employing the Bayesian method at each key point and also by adjusting the simple and unified <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength and deformation models for maximum response.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{there has been a}} shift to using more {{lightweight}} materials for the potential of fuel consumption reduction. In the Aerospace Industry, conventional metal structures are being replaced by advanced composite structures. The major advantage of an advanced composite structure is the huge {{reduction in the number of}} parts and joints required. Also composite materials provide better resistance to creep, corrosion, and fatigue. However, one cannot eliminate all the joints and attachments in an aircraft’s structure. Eliminating structural joints is impractical in present-day aircraft because of the requirements for inspection, manufacturing breaks, assembly and equipment access, and replacement of damaged structures. Currently, composite joints are overdesigned which leads to weight penalties. Understanding how to optimize the ultimate bearing strength of a composite joint by altering the cure cycle might be beneficial to the composite joint design process. This study investigates, through numerical and experimental analysis, the mechanical behavior of double shear joints. The first task is to test Aluminum double <b>shear</b> <b>joint</b> specimens inside the double <b>shear</b> <b>joint</b> fixture at a loading rate of 0. 05 in. /min. (quasi-static). The second task is to numerically model and validate the aluminum double <b>shear</b> <b>joint</b> specimen. The third task is to test the Unidirectional MTM 49 carbon fiber pre-preg double shear composite joint specimens with two different cure cycles and five different loading rates (0. 05 in. /min., 0. 1 in. /min., 1 in. /min., 2 in. /min. and 6 in. /min.). The double shear composite joint specimens are made, using a heat press, with a quasi-isotropic laminate orientation of [0 0 + 45 - 45 + 45 - 45 90 90]s. The first cure cycle used is called the alternate cure cycle, which is Cytec’s MTM 49 Unidirectional Carbon Fiber pre-preg material cure cycle, and the second cure cycle used is called the datasheet cure cycle, which is Umeco 2 ̆ 7 s MTM 49 Unidirectional Carbon Fiber pre-preg material cure cycle. The recommended datasheet cure cycle and an alternate cure cycle are both compared to see how they affect the mechanical characteristics of the matrix along with the bearing stress. The fourth task is to adjust the Aluminum double <b>shear</b> <b>joint</b> numerical model for the double shear composite joint specimen. The numerical results for both the Aluminum and the composite specimens are in agreement with the experimental results. The theoretical in-plane material properties of the quasi-isotropic laminate were in agreement with the experimental results. One can see that at 0. 05 in. /min. and 0. 1 in. /min. (for both cure cycles) the composite double shear specimens carried more load compared to the higher loading rates of 1 in. /min., 2 in. /min. and 6 in. /min.

40|$|Steel-plate {{composite}} (SC) {{walls are}} {{being used in the}} containment internal structures (CIS) of safety-related nuclear facilities. CIS are labyrinthine in plan, and typically composed of numerous SC walls that intersect each other. This dissertation focuses on the <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength of SC wall-to-wall connection regions in the CIS. ^ SC wall joints and intersections are typically designed to fail with flexural yielding of the connected SC walls. Plastic hinges are expected to form in the SC walls and dissipate energy through inelasticity. In order to ensure that flexural yielding of the SC walls occur prior to <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> failure, it is important to estimate the <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength of SC wall-to-wall joint regions. ^ Due to the lack of information on the <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength of SC wall-to-wall joints, the equation for reinforced concrete (RC) beam-column <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength given in ACI 349 - 06 Section 21. 5. 3 was adopted in this research. The overall goal of this research is to develop knowledge of the fundamental behavior and <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength of typical SC wall-to-wall joints in safety-related nuclear facilities. Two of the most common joint configurations in the CIS, namely, T-joints and L-joints are considered in this study. However, the focus is primarily on SC wall-to-wall T-joints. ^ A total of four SC wall-to-wall T joint specimens were tested under cyclic loading to investigate the <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> behavior and <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength. The governing failure mode of each test specimen was evaluated based on the experimental results. The measured <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength was compared with values computed using the equation for RC beam-column <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength given in ACI 349 - 06 (2006), Section 21. 5. 3. ^ Three dimensional finite element models were also developed and analyzed to verify the experimental results and to gain additional insight into the <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> behavior of the test specimens. Analytical parametric studies were conducted using the benchmarked finite element models to expand the database of SC wall-to-wall T joints and L joints. The parameters included in the analytical studies were the SC wall thickness, SC wall length, steel reinforcement ratio, and concrete strength. ^ The experimental and analytical results indicate that the fundamental behavior and <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength of SC wall-to-wall joints are governed by the steel faceplate reinforcement ratios of the connected SC walls. The effects of steel tie reinforcement ratio and shear stud layout in the joint region are not significant. Finally, the <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength of SC wall-to-wall joints can be estimated conservatively using the applicable ACI 349 RC beam-column <b>joint</b> <b>shear</b> strength equation. ...|$|R
