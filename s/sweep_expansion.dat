40|$|Continuous and discrete-time Successive Backward Sweep (SBS) {{methods for}} solving {{nonlinear}} optimal control problems involving terminal and control constraints are proposed in this dissertation. They closely resemble the Neighboring Extremals and Differential Dynamic Programming algorithms, {{which are based}} on the successive solutions to a series of linear control problems with quadratic performance indices. The SBS methods are relatively insensitive to the initial guesses of the state and control histories, which are not required to satisfy the system dynamics. Hessian modifications are utilized, especially for non-convex problems, to avoid singularities during the backward integration of the gain equations. The SBS method requires the satisfaction of the Jacobi no-conjugate point condition and hence, produces optimal solutions. The standard implementation of the SBS method for continuous-time systems incurs terminal boundary condition errors due to an algorithmic singularity as well as numerical inaccuracies in the computation of the gain matrices. Alternatives for boundary error reduction are proposed, notably the aiming point and the switching between two forms of the <b>sweep</b> <b>expansion</b> formulae. Modification of the sweep formula expands the domain of convergence of the SBS method and allows for a rigorous testing for the existence of conjugate points. Numerical accuracy of the continuous-time formulation of the optimal control problem can be improved with the use of symplectic integrators, which generally are implicit schemes in time. A time-explicit group preserving method based on the Magnus series representation of the state transition is implemented in the SBS setting and is shown to outperform a non-symplectic integrator of the same order. Discrete-time formulations of the optimal control problem, directly accounting for a specific time-stepping method, lead to consistent systems of equations, whose solutions satisfy the boundary conditions of the discretized problem accurately. In this regard, the second-order, implicit mid-point averaging scheme, a symplectic integrator, is adapted for use with the SBS method. The performance of the mid-point averaging scheme is compared with other methods of equal and higher-order non-symplectic schemes to show its advantages. The SBS method is augmented with a homotopy- continuation procedure to isolate and regulate certain nonlinear effects for difficult problems, in order to extend its domain of convergence. The discrete-time SBS method is also extended to solve problems where the controls are approximated to be impulsive and to handle waypoint constraints as well. A variety of highly nonlinear optimal control problems involving orbit transfer, atmospheric reentry, and the restricted three-body problem are treated to demonstrate the performance of the methods developed in this dissertation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cancer {{progression}} is {{an evolutionary}} {{process that is}} driven by mutation and selection in a population of tumor cells. We discuss mathematical models of cancer progression, starting from traditional multistage theory. Each stage {{is associated with the}} occurrence of genetic alterations and their fixation in the population. We describe the accumulation of mutations using conjunctive Bayesian networks, an exponential family of waiting time models in which the occurrence of mutations is constrained to a partial temporal order. Two opposing limit cases arise if mutations either follow a linear order or occur independently. We derive exact analytical expressions for the waiting time until a specific number of mutations have accumulated in these limit cases {{as well as for the}} general conjunctive Bayesian network. Finally, we analyze a stochastic population genetics model that explicitly accounts for mutation and selection. In this model, waves of clonal <b>expansions</b> <b>sweep</b> through the population at equidistant intervals. We present an approximate analytical expression for the waiting time in this model and compare it to the results obtained for the conjunctive Bayesian networks.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{production}} of sterile neutrinos in the region T∼ M_W in an extension beyond the standard model with the see-saw mass matrix originating in Yukawa couplings to Higgs-like scalars with masses and vev's {{of the order of}} the electroweak scale. Sterile neutrinos are produced by the decay of scalars and standard model vector bosons. We obtain the index of refraction, dispersion relations, mixing angles in the medium and production rates including those for right-handed sterile neutrinos, from the standard model and beyond the standard model self-energies. For 1 ≲ M_W/T ≲ 3 we find narrow MSW resonances with k ≲ T for both left and right handed neutrinos even in absence of a lepton asymmetry in the (active) neutrino sector, as well as very low energy (k/T ≪ |ξ|) narrow MSW resonances {{in the presence of a}} lepton asymmetry consistent with the bounds from WMAP and BBN. For small vacuum mixing angle, consistent with observational bounds, the absorptive part of the self-energies lead to a strong damping regime very near the resonances resulting in the exact degeneracy of the propagating modes with a concomitant breakdown of adiabaticity. We argue that cosmological <b>expansion</b> <b>sweeps</b> through the resonances, resonant and non-resonant sterile neutrino production results in a highly non-thermal distribution function enhanced at small momentum k < T, with potentially important consequences for their free streaming length and transfer function at small scales.
