In both 1915 and 1921, BSAC again failed to set up a <b>single</b> <b>administration</b> for both Rhodesias.

40|$|Somatic {{gene therapy}} has been {{proposed}} {{as a means to}} achieve systemic delivery of therapeutic proteins. However, there is limited evidence that current methods of gene delivery can practically achieve this goal. In this study, we demonstrate that, following a <b>single</b> intramuscular <b>administration</b> of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector containing the β-galactosidase (AAV-lacZ) gene into adult BALB/c mice, protein expression was detected in myofibers for at least 32 weeks. A <b>single</b> intramuscular <b>administration</b> of an AAV vector containing a gene for human erythropoietin (AAV-Epo) into mice resulted in dose-dependent secretion of erythropoietin and corresponding increases in red blood cell production that persisted for up to 40 weeks. Primary human myotubes transduced in vitro with the AAV-Epo vector also showed dose-dependent production of Epo. These results demonstrate that rAAV vectors are able to transduce skeletal muscle and are capable of achieving sustained expression and systemic delivery of a therapeutic protein following a <b>single</b> intramuscular <b>administration.</b> Gene therapy using AAV vectors may provide a practical strategy for the treatment of inherited and acquired protein deficiencies...|$|R
25|$|The {{end of the}} war in August 1945 did not {{immediately}} affect operations at the Salt Wells Pilot Plant. Indeed, the process chosen for manufacturing the explosives, that of melting and casting, more or less mandated that operations continue, as it was undesirable to allow a full kettle of high explosive to freeze solid. There were administrative changes, however. On 6 August 1945, Sage proposed that Salt Wells and China Lake Pilot Plants be placed under a <b>single</b> <b>administration.</b> Sage was the only candidate for the administrator position, and this change was implemented with the concurrence of both the Manhattan Project and the Bureau of Ordnance. Another major change was that all civilian staff were transferred from Caltech to the United States federal civil service in October 1945. All employees of the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, whether military or civilian, had to hold Q clearances.|$|E

2500|$|Pancuronium is {{a typical}} non-depolarizing curare-mimetic muscle relaxant. It {{competitively}} inhibits the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction by blocking the binding of acetylcholine. It has slight vagolytic activity, causing an increase in heart rate, [...] but no ganglioplegic (i.e., blocking ganglions) activity. It is a very potent muscle relaxant drug, with an ED95 (i.e., the dose that causes 95% depression of muscle twitch response) of only 60µg/kg body weight. Onset of action is relatively slow compared to other similar drugs, {{in part due to}} its low dose - an intubating dose takes 3–6 minutes for full effect. Clinical effects (muscle activity lower than 25% of physiological) last for about 100 minutes.

2500|$|The medieval {{period was}} {{the period of}} the Imperial Cholas when the entire south India was under a <b>single</b> <b>administration.</b> [...] The period between the 11th and the 13th centuries, during which the Chola power was at its peak, there were {{relatively}} few foreign incursions and the life for the Tamil people was one of peace and prosperity. It also provided the opportunity for the people to interact with cultures beyond their own, as the Cholas ruled over most of the South India, Sri Lanka and traded with the kingdoms in southeast Asia. [...] The Cholas built numerous temples, mainly for their favourite god Siva, and these were celebrated in numerous hymns. [...] The Prabhanda became the dominant form of poetry. The religious canons of Saiva and Vaishnava sects were beginning to be systematically collected and categorised. Nambi Andar Nambi, who was a contemporary of Rajaraja Chola I, collected and arranged the books on Saivism into eleven books called Tirumurais. The hagiology of Saivism was standardised in Periyapuranam (also known as Tiruttondar Puranam) by Sekkilar, who lived during the reign of Kulothunga Chola II (1133–1150 CE). Religious books on the Vaishnava sect were mostly composed in Sanskrit during this period. The great Vaishnava leader Ramanuja lived during the reigns of Athirajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola I, and had to face religious persecution from the Cholas who belonged to the Saiva sect. One of the best known Tamil works of this period is the Ramavatharam by Kamban who flourished during the reign of Kulottunga III. Ramavatharam is the greatest epic in Tamil Literature, and although the author states that he followed Valmiki, his work is not a mere translation or even an adaptation of the Sanskrit epic. Kamban imports into his narration the colour and landscape of his own time. A contemporary of Kamban was the famous poet Auvaiyar who found great happiness in writing for young children. Her works, Athichoodi and Konraiventhan are even now generally read and taught in schools in Tamil Nadu. Her two other works, Mooturai and Nalvali were written for slightly older children. All the four works are didactic in character. They explain the basic wisdom that should govern mundane life.|$|E

We assessed the effects of <b>single</b> <b>administrations</b> of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone on systolic blood pressure until 2 hours after treatments injection and on in vitro vascular contraction of mesenteric artery rings to phenylephrine at 3 hours, in normal and endotoxemic rats. Intravenous fludrocortisone (5 and 20 μg/kg) and hydrocortisone (4 and 20 mg/kg) were administered in 16 groups (8 without and 8 with lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemic shock) of 10 Wistar rats according to four 2 × 2 -factorial designs. Fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone similarly increased systolic blood pressure (P 0. 001 for both) but more in endotoxemic than in normal animals. Fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone significantly modified contractile response to phenylephrine (P = 0. 039 and P = 0. 007, respectively). At dose 1, fludrocortisone had no effect and hydrocortisone decreased contraction, whereas, at dose 2, both fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone increased contraction, especially in endotoxemic rats and with additive effect. Our results show that <b>single</b> intravenous <b>administrations</b> of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone increase blood pressure and contractile response of mesenteric arteries to phenylephrine. The magnitude of these effects depends on dose and pathophysiological conditions and is higher in endotoxemic than in normal rats...|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the bacterial load at the infection site could impact considerably on the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of fluoroquinolones. Using a rat lung infection model, we measured the influence of different marbofloxacin dosage regimens on selection of resistant bacteria after infection with a low (105 CFU) or a high (109 CFU) inoculum of Klebsiella pneumoniae. For daily fractionated doses of marbofloxacin, prevention of resistance occurred for an area-under-the-concentration-time-curve (AUC) /MIC ratio of 189 h for the low inoculum, whereas for the high inoculum, resistant-subpopulation enrichment occurred for AUC/MIC ratios up to 756 h. For the high-inoculum-infected rats, the AUC/MIC ratio, Cmax/MIC ratio, and time within the mutant selection window (TMSW) were not found to be effective predictors of resistance prevention upon comparison of fractionated and <b>single</b> <b>administrations.</b> An index corresponding to the ratio of the time that the drug concentrations were above the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) over the time that the drug concentrations were within the MSW (T>MPC/TMSW) was the best predictor of the emergence of resistance: a T>MPC/TMSW ratio of 0. 54 was associated with prevention of resistance for both fractionated and <b>single</b> <b>administrations.</b> These results suggest that the enrichment of resistant bacteria depends heavily on the inoculum size at the start of an antimicrobial treatment and that classical PK/PD parameters cannot adequately describe the impact of different dosage regimens on enrichment of resistant bacteria. We propose an original index, the T>MPC/TMSW ratio, which reflects the ratio of the time that the less susceptible bacterial subpopulation is killed over the time that it is selected, as a potentially powerful indicator of prevention of enrichment of resistant bacteria. This ratio is valid only if plasma concentrations achieve the MPC...|$|R
