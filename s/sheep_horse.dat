50|$|The {{role of the}} {{placenta}} in progestogen production varies by species. In the <b>sheep,</b> <b>horse,</b> and human, {{the placenta}} takes over the majority of progestogen production, whereas in other species the corpus luteum remains {{the primary source of}} progestogens. In the sheep and human, progesterone is the major placental progestogen.|$|E
50|$|Warning {{signs are}} {{triangular}} and have red borders, but {{in contrast with}} those of most other countries that use triangular warning signs, Swedish signs have yellow backgrounds, rather than white.

50|$|The {{stifle joint}} (often simply stifle) {{is a complex}} joint in the hind limbs of quadruped mammals such as the <b>sheep,</b> <b>horse</b> or dog.

50|$|Under the Manchukuo period, Hsingan was {{primarily}} an agricultural area, with food grains, particularly wheat, soy and corn, {{as well as}} cattle, <b>sheep,</b> <b>horse</b> and other livestock. The primary economic asset of Hsingan was its extensive coal deposits, primarily at Chalai Nor hill, 25 kilometers from the frontier station of Manchouli, where 290,000 metric tonnes were extracted annually. Hsingan was also a trade zone between Manchukuo, the Soviet Union, and Soviet-dominated Mongolia.|$|E

50|$|BEVs were {{originally}} classified into seven serotypes, but are now accepted as falling into two serotypes, 1 and 2, which are further classified into subtypes. BEV strain VG-5-27 of serotype 1, subtype 1, {{is the most}} extensively studied. The tissue tropism of serotype 1 is extremely broad, including human, <b>sheep,</b> <b>horse,</b> dog, camel, and other mammalian hosts. BEV-like sequences have even been reported in shellfish from water contaminated with bovine faeces. Serotype 2 viruses are only found in domestic cattle.|$|E

50|$|A venomous bite may {{be treated}} with antivenom, which is created by dosing an animal such as a <b>sheep,</b> <b>horse,</b> goat, or rabbit {{with a small amount}} of the {{targeted}} venom. The immune system of the subject animal responds to the dose, producing antibodies to the venom's active molecules. The antibodies are harvested from the animal's blood, and used to produce antivenom. This treatment is effective for only a limited number of times for a given individual, as antibodies to the foreign antigens in the antivenom will develop. This is called sensitization. Alternatively, the patient's immune system may destroy the antivenom before the antivenom can destroy the venom. Though most individuals never require even one treatment of anti-venom in their lifetime, let alone several, those routinely exposed to snakes or other venomous animals may become sensitized to antivenom due to previous exposure.|$|E

50|$|A {{successful}} generalist predator, the cougar {{will eat}} any animal it can catch, from insects to large ungulates (over 500 kg). Like all cats, {{it is an}} obligate carnivore, meaning it needs to feed exclusively on meat to survive. The mean weight of vertebrate prey (MWVP) that pumas attack increases with the puma's body weight; in general, MWVP is lower in areas closer to the equator. Its most important prey species are various deer species, particularly in North America; mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk and even bull moose are taken. Other species such as the bighorn and Dall's <b>sheep,</b> <b>horse,</b> fallow deer, caribou, mountain goat, coyote, pronghorn, and domestic livestock such as cattle and sheep are also primary food bases in many areas. A survey of North America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer. Only the Florida panther showed variation, often preferring feral hogs and armadillos.|$|E
50|$|The zun {{can be seen}} in {{a variety}} of {{different}} vessel forms from a limited amount of decoration to detailed. Some are square, some cylindrical while others are modeled after animals. Some of the animals they are modeled after are an elephant, ox, <b>sheep,</b> <b>horse,</b> rhinoceros and a bird. The basic shape used throughout many is cylindrical and the shape itself is repeated but with modifications. Some Zuns are tall and slender while others may be short and round. The decoration used on the vessels varies not only in content but the relief height. The height of the relief may give off the impression of texture or it may emphasize the form of the vessel by being smooth and round like the vessel. The taller vessel forms may have flanges on the sides that start at the upper lip and follow down {{to the foot of the}} vessel.|$|E
50|$|Ficksburg, after Bethlehem, South Africa (the chief {{administrative}} town) is {{the second}} busiest and important town in the Eastern Free State region of the Freestate province. It is an important agricultural region of the Free State where crops like corn and mealies (maize) and asparagus are grown. The {{most important part of}} the annual crop of Ficksburg is the harvesting of the cherries on the numerous cherry farms surrounding the town. The cherries are harvested from October to December. Annually in November the Cherry Festival is held. The festival stretches over 3 days and attracts up to 30,000 people. The festival presents family shows and activities like the herding of <b>sheep,</b> <b>horse</b> rides, camel rides, helicopter flips, steam train rides at Sandstone Estate, tours through town to see the sandstone building architecture which Ficksburg is also very well known for. There are also tours of the surrounding countryside, tours to the cherry and asparagus farms where people are shown everything about the industry, and airplane trips to the Katsedam in Lesotho.|$|E
