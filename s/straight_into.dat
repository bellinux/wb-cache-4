5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and held back from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would hardly have benefited from advancing <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out of the woods and charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E

Some tickets were being resold on the secondary market for prices of up to $7,500. Additionally, pre-sale passwords were being sold on eBay for bids of up to $400. Although some artists {{were known to be}} holding back tickets from general sale and delivering them <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> the secondary market, Live Nation said that U2 did not engage in this practice.|$|E

Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews would soon be arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon have Hungarian salami. When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian salami. He had to escape not only for himself, he wrote, but also to raise the alarm.|$|E

5|$|He {{accepted}} a teaching {{position in the}} Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, having decided on Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater, Purdue, because it had a small aerospace department; he hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he came <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> a professorship with only the USC master's degree. He began the work while stationed at Edwards years before, and finally completed it after Apollo11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight. The official job title he received at Cincinnati was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. After teaching for eight years, he resigned in 1979 without explaining his reason for leaving.|$|E
5|$|Manuel made serious {{tactical}} errors, such as {{failing to}} properly scout out the route ahead. These failings {{caused him to}} lead his forces <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> a classic ambush. On 17 September 1176 Manuel was decisively defeated by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass. The Byzantines were too dispersed, and were surrounded. The army's siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw – without siege engines, the conquest of Iconium was impossible. According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both {{during and after the}} battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement; according to William of Tyre, he was never the same again.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{signed for}} Second Division club Leicester City on 2 March 1989 {{as part of}} the deal that saw Phil Turner join County for a fee of £125,000, with over two months of 1988–89 remaining.

He made 13 consecutive appearances for Leicester before missing the last two matches of 1988–89, his new club finishing 15th in the Second Division. His first goal for Leicester was the only goal in a 1–0 win away to Stoke City on 25 November 1989. Other than a spell out of the team from early September to mid November 1989, Mills was a regular in the Leicester team that ranked 13th place in the Second Division in 1989–90, making 30 appearances and scoring four goals. He established himself as a popular player with the supporters, and was named the club's Player of the Year.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the start}} of the second half in extra time, Galatasaray's first {{opportunity}} came, when Şükür attempted a shot from a Popescu cross, but the ball hit the side netting. After seven minutes, Kanu beat a defender, dribbled into the Galatasaray area and shot the ball twice, only to be denied twice by Taffarel. In the dying minutes both teams continued to create decisive chances – Galatasaray's Popescu was given a free–kick, after Şükür was brought down by Keown. However, the ball flew <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> Seaman's arms. Arsenal's Sylvinho put in a cross into the Galatasaray area to Henry, but ball was cleared away. The final whistle was blown and the match moved into a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for {{the race}} were overshadowed by {{speculation}} over IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard's job, after he tweeted that some team owners {{were trying to get}} him fired. Dixon claimed pole position {{for the race}}, the first IndyCar event in Detroit since 2008, and maintained his lead throughout the race. After 38 laps, James Hinchcliffe hit a dislodged piece of the track and continued <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> the tire wall. Further investigation discovered that the track was disintegrating in various places, and the event was red flagged. After a two-hour break, in which track officials ripped out the damaged sections of track and filled the holes with concrete, the race was restarted, shortened to 60 laps. Rain also started to fall lightly, and shortly after the restart a caution was issued when Hélio Castroneves spun. Dario Franchitti gained four places after the red flag, benefiting from his softer red tires, to finish second behind his teammate.|$|E
