5|$|As {{early as}} 1898, without {{building}} a dam, the original Lower Bonnington Power Plant was generating hydroelectricity from Bonnington Falls in the Kootenay River near {{the confluence of}} the Slocan River in order to <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> to mines in Rossland, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|At Port Tennant, {{the course}} of the canal has been covered over by railways, roads and other {{facilities}} of the port, but continues to <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> to the Prince of Wales dock through a large culvert, which helps to maintain water levels in the docks. The Tennant canal is still owned by the Coombe-Tennant family.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{and water}} {{conservation}} projects markedly changed practices {{in the state and}} led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.|$|E

5|$|Electricity {{distribution}} {{is the responsibility}} of Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire), which is wholly owned by MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company. There is no domestic gas mains <b>supply.</b> <b>Water</b> is supplied by Yorkshire Water from Embsay Reservoir. Yorkshire Water is responsible for wastewater disposal, and a small-scale treatment plant is located adjacent to the River Wharfe south of Hebden Beck. Refuse collection is handled by Craven District Council, and North Yorkshire County Council provides a household waste and recycling centre at Skibeden, between Bolton Abbey and Skipton.|$|E
5|$|The Birmingham Corporation Water Department {{was set up}} in 1876 to <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> to Birmingham, {{up until}} 1974 when its {{responsibilities}} were transferred to Severn Trent Water. Most of Birmingham's water is supplied by the Elan aqueduct, opened in 1904; water is fed by gravity to Frankley Reservoir, Frankley, and Bartley Reservoir, Bartley Green, from reservoirs in the Elan Valley, Wales.|$|E

5|$|In 1606 Adam Mort {{bought the}} manor house and land in Astley. He was {{a wealthy man}} who built the first Astley Chapel as a chapel of ease for the parish church in Leigh. The chapel was consecrated in 1631, the year that he died. He built a grammar school that stood for over 200years until 1833, when it was {{demolished}} and rebuilt. Adam Mort's grandson, also Adam, rebuilt Damhouse in 1650 and his initials are carved in the plaque over the front door. The stone and timber structure was named from the stream which was dammed to <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> to a waterwheel powering a corn mill near the house. It is possible the hall was once surrounded by a moat.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{springs in}} the Senchal Range provide most of Darjeeling's water <b>supply.</b> <b>Water</b> {{collected}} is routed through stone conduits to two lakes that were constructed in 1910 and 1932, {{from where it}} is piped to the town after purification at the Jorebungalow filtration plant. During the dry season, when water supplied by springs is insufficient, water is pumped from Khong Khola, a nearby small perennial stream. Increasing demand {{has led to a}} worsening shortfall in water supply; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal water supply system. Various efforts made to augment the water supply, including the construction of a third storage reservoir in 1984, have failed to yield desired results.|$|E
5|$|Under colonial rule, {{tanks were}} {{the only source of}} water in Mumbai, with many localities having been named after them. The MCGM {{supplies}} potable water to the city from six lakes, most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes. The Tansa lake supplies water to the western suburbs and parts of the island city along the Western Railway. The water is filtered at Bhandup, which is Asia's largest water filtration plant. India's first underground water tunnel was completed in Mumbai to <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> to the Bhandup filtration plant.|$|E

5|$|Advanced {{technology}} {{was required for}} the planning and construction of large reservoirs and canals. When constructing reservoirs, the gaps between low ridges in the dry zone plains were used for damming water courses. Two different techniques were used in construction; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to reservoirs. All the reservoirs and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network, so that excess water from one will flow into the other. The locations of these constructions indicate that the ancient engineers were aware of geological formations in the sites as well, and made effective use of them. Underground conduits have also been constructed to <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> to and from artificial ponds, {{such as in the}} Kuttam Pokuna and the ponds at Sigiriya.|$|E
5|$|In 1725, Mayfair {{became part}} of the new parish of St George Hanover Square, running as far east as Bond Street and to Regent Street north of Conduit Street. It ran as far north as Oxford Street and south near to Piccadilly. The parish {{continued}} into Hyde Park to the west and extended southwest to St George's Hospital. Most of the area belonged to (and continues to be owned by) the Grosvenor family, though the freehold of some parts of Mayfair belongs to the Crown Estate. A water supply to the area was built by the Chelsea Water Works, and a royal warrant was issued in 1725 for a reservoir in Hyde Park that could <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> into Mayfair, at what is now Grosvenor Gate. In 1835, the reservoir was decorated with an ornamental basin and a fountain in its centre. In 1963, following the widening of Park Lane, it was rebuilt as the Joy of Life Fountain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the main {{industries}} in the watershed of Roaring Brook included agriculture, brick making, and coal mining. Around this time, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad followed the stream throughout much of its length and the Erie Railroad followed the stream from Elmhurst to its mouth. The former was created by an 1852 merger of the Cobbs Gap and Delaware Railroad and the Lackawanna and Western Railroad, which were previously in the stream's watershed. The main stem {{was used as a}} water supply for Scranton by the Scranton Gas and Water Company. It was also used as an industrial water supply by the Spencer Coal Company. The watershed continues to <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> to the Lackawanna Valley in the 21st century. In the early 1900s, major communities in the watershed included Scranton, Dunmore, Moscow, and Elmhurst. At the time, their populations were 129,867, 17,615, 650, and 379, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Barnes Run {{has been}} one of several streams used as a <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> in Hazleton. It and two other streams (Wolffs Run and Stony Creek) <b>supplied</b> <b>water</b> to as many as 14,400 people in 1974. In the early 1900s, Barnes Run and Wolffs Run made up 25 percent of the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> of Hazleton. In 1963, Barnes Run was one of ten {{suppliers}} of water to Hazleton. It also <b>supplied</b> <b>water</b> to West Hazleton and Humboldt.|$|R

5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. Because {{of the way}} the system of locks work, water is lost from the upper part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> to the summit pound of the canal, opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's {{electricity}} supply was, {{until the early}} 2000s, generated almost entirely from hydroelectric sources; power stations on Lakes Burera and Ruhondo provided 90% of the country's electricity. A combination of below average rainfall and human activity, including the draining of the Rugezi wetlands for cultivation and grazing, caused the two lakes' water levels to fall from 1990 onwards; by 2004 levels were reduced by 50%, leading to {{a sharp drop in}} output from the power stations. This, coupled with increased demand as the economy grew, precipitated a shortfall in 2004 and widespread loadshedding. As an emergency measure, the government installed diesel generators north of Kigali; by 2006 these were providing 56% of the country's electricity, but were very costly. The government enacted a number of measures to alleviate this problem, including rehabilitating the Rugezi wetlands, which <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> to Burera and Ruhondo and investing in a scheme to extract methane gas from Lake Kivu, expected in its first phase to increase the country's power generation by 40%. Only 18% of the population had access to electricity in 2012, though this had risen from 10.8% in 2009. The government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013–18 aims to increase access to electricity to 70% of households by 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Ellesmere Canal {{company had}} been {{constructing}} canals to the west, linking Llangollen to Frankton, but the route from there to Chester had not been decided. In 1796, they obtained an Act of Parliament, authorising a line from near the great aqueduct at Pontcysyllte running roughly northwards through Ruabon, Bersham, Gwersyllt and Pulford to join the River Dee opposite the canal basin at Chester. The Chester company, {{who were trying to}} put their financial affairs into order, noticed that the 1796 Act failed to mention a connection with their canal. They decided to obtain an Act to enforce a connection, and to stop supplying water to the Wirral line. The Ellesmere company responded quickly, agreeing to make changes to their Act, and the Chester company continued to <b>supply</b> <b>water.</b> On the strength of this, they were also able to raise some money to put the canal into good order and to repay some of their debts. The Ellesmere company extended their canal eastwards from Frankton to Whitchurch, and in 1802, the two companies reached agreement on a line from near Whitchurch to Hurleston Junction, just to the north of Nantwich. It opened on 25 March 1805, and water supply was enhanced by the construction of a navigable feeder through Llangollen to Horseshoe Falls on the River Dee at Llantisilio.|$|E

25|$|The {{sources of}} the {{municipal}} water supply are various spring fed tanks located around the island. The three island communities <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> within a limited but expanding part of their jurisdictions. Homes outside the municipal water system use wells or cisterns to collect rain water. There are plans to construct an artificial lake {{in the area of}} Panormos to <b>supply</b> <b>water</b> to farmers. Private water wells supply some agricultural needs and water from these wells can be transported by lorry to outlying areas to refill cisterns or swimming pools. The municipal water is good quality.
