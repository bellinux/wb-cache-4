Our approach is based on the application of game theory concepts. We define a flexible scheduling policy, named SSB (<b>Slot</b> <b>Sell</b> and Buy) : the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium for the policy is proved, together with properties of convergence of these equilibria. These findings allows us to state that our SSB scheduling policy achieves 100 % throughput both in isolated input-queued switches and in networks of input-queued switches. Simulation results are used to further validate the approach and to show its flexibility in dealing with differentiated QoS guarantees...|$|R

50|$|The {{practice}} of <b>selling</b> <b>slots</b> for tourists {{to participate in}} sanctioned hunts and culls, though seemingly innocent, can serve to impact populations negatively through indirect means. Though culls can and do serve {{a crucial role in}} the maintenance of several ecosystems’ health, the lucrative nature of these operations lends itself to mimicry by unofficial groups and/or groups which are not fully aware of the potential negative impact of their actions. This is especially true of big-game and highly marketable species. Such unofficial organizations can promote the hunting or collecting of wildlife for profit without participating in or being sanctioned by wildlife management authorities while mimicking organized operations to fool unwary tourists. Though not sanctioned by any authority, the fact that these operations are funded by tourists and fueled by wildlife classifies such illicit hunting activity as “wildlife tourism”.|$|R
50|$|After first rejecting an idea {{to develop}} the Grumman Widgeon as an {{executive}} transport, the company studied producing an executive transport based on a turbine-powered variant of the naval utility transport Grumman TF-1 Trader. The company had already determined that any new aircraft {{would have to be}} turboprop-powered and the Rolls-Royce Dart engine was chosen. Further studies showed that the Trader-based design would not sell and they needed an all-new design with a low-wing and room to stand up in the cabin. In June 1957 the design of G-159 was finalised and Grumman started <b>selling</b> <b>slots</b> on the production line at $10,000 each. The initial customers worked with Grumman on the detailed design and avionics fit. The G-159 was given the name Gulfstream and on 14 August 1958 the first aircraft, registered N701G, took off from Bethpage, New York on its maiden flight. By 2 May 1959 the aircraft was awarded a type certificate by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).|$|R
40|$|The {{generalized}} second price auction {{has recently}} become a much studied model for sponsored keyword auctions for Internet advertisement. Though {{it is known}} not to be incentive compatible, properties of its pure Nash equilibria have been well characterized under the single bidding strategy of each bidder. In this paper, we study the properties of pure Nash equilibria of the generalized second price auction when each bidder is allowed to submit more than one bid. This multi-bidding strategy is noted to have been adopted by companies for keyword advertisements on search engines. In consideration of the pure Nash equilibria, we completely characterize conditions {{on the number of}} <b>selling</b> <b>slots</b> for a pure Nash equilibrium to exist, assuming all the advertisers are allowed to use multi-bidding strategies or only one advertiser will use a multi-bidding strategy. Our findings reveal interesting properties of limitation and potentials of the market place of online advertisement. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|Most {{search engines}} <b>sell</b> <b>slots</b> to place {{advertisements}} {{on the search}} results page through keyword auctions. Advertisers offer bids for how much {{they are willing to}} pay when someone enters a search query, sees the search results, and then clicks on one of their ads. Search engines typically order the advertisements for a query by a combination of the bids and expected clickthrough rates for each advertisement. In this paper, we extend a model of Yahoo‟s and Google‟s advertising auctions to include an effect where repeatedly showing less relevant ads has a persistent impact on all advertising on the search engine, an impact we designate as the pollution effect. In Monte-Carlo simulations using distributions fitted to Yahoo data, we show that a modest pollution effect is sufficient to dramatically change the advertising rank order that yields the optimal advertising revenue for a search engine. In addition, if a pollution effect exists, it is possible to maximize revenue while also increasing advertiser, and publisher utility. Our results suggest that search engines could benefit from making relevant advertisements less expensive and irrelevant advertisements more costly for advertisers than is the current practice...|$|R
50|$|On August 12, 2009, Delta Air Lines and US Airways {{announced}} a landing slot and terminal swap in separate press releases. Under the swap plan, US Airways {{would have given}} Delta 125 operating slot pairs at LaGuardia. US Airways, in return, would have received 42 operating slot pairs at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., and be granted the authority to begin service from the US to São Paulo, Brazil and Tokyo, Japan. When the swap plan was complete, Delta Shuttle operations would have moved from the Marine Air Terminal to Terminal C (the present US Airways terminal), and Terminals C and D would have been connected together. US Airways Shuttle flights would have moved to the Marine Air Terminal, and mainline US Airways flights would have moved to Terminal D (the present Delta terminal). The United States Department of Transportation announced that they would approve the Delta/US Airways transaction {{under the condition that}} they <b>sell</b> <b>slots</b> to other airlines. Delta and US Airways dropped the slot swap deal in early July 2010 and both airlines filed a court appeal. In May 2011, both airlines announced that they would resubmit their proposal of the slot swap to the US DOT. It was tentatively approved by the US DOT on July 21, 2011. The slot swap received final approval from the US DOT on October 10, 2011.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of competition laws {{in the field of}} air transport within the Italian-Community legal system. The work addresses particularly one issue which currently hinders a further development of competition laws in this sector, namely the subject of slot allocation. In fact, within infrastructure issues, slot and gate scarcities, which are also seen as ‘non commercial’ entry barriers, represent the most obvious physical barrier to entry, as without a slot and a gate, an airline cannot operate. The thesis is divided into four parts. In {{the first part of the}} work, it has been analyzed the deregulation and liberalization process, both in EU and in US. It has been pointed out that slot allocation is a means by which governments intervene in the air transport sector regulating it, but in a way very different from the past, when flag carriers dominated the market. Moreover, competition issues have been analyzed internationally, especially under the ICAO and IATA umbrella. In the second part of the thesis, the ratio and the legal nature have been addressed deeply. It has been backed up the idea that slots are natural resources which belong to States, which in turn exert their sovereignty over them. Slots are complex goods, and they relate to the time, from one hand, and to the air space, from the other hand. This is why slots are considered public goods, hence they are not tradable in the marketplace as a private good. Neither air carriers nor others (whoever they are) could claim property rights over slots, which according to Regulation No. 95 / 93 are “permissions” allocated by a public authority, namely the so-called airport Coordinator. Then, the air traffic airport coordination has been studied, taking into account the threefold classification of congested airports: coordinated, not coordinated and facilitated. In terms of airport congestion, a very important difference we did is that between traffic rights and airport slots. In this regard, in January 2010 the Italian Constitutional Court clarified that the two profiles have to be kept separated, because they refer to different aspect of airport congestion. A different stance is taken by ICAO and some States (especially African ones), which have pointed out the linkage between traffic rights and airport slots. Furthermore, the legal nature of the airport Coordinator has been addressed. According to our research, it seems to be a private entity responsible for public functions. In the third part of the work, the slot allocation and the slot mobility have been dealt with. Particularly, the slot allocation is an administrative process under which slots are allocated as permissions by a Coordinator. Consequently, slots may be freely exchanged or transferred, but not traded or sold, because of the public nature of the good “slot”, and in light of both Community and international Regulations in this subject. It has been criticized a recent Communication issued by the European Commission which de facto introduced arbitrarily the secondary trading in the European legal system. The last part of the thesis is devoted to the Italian, Community and international public controls in the slot allocation system. In Italy, the Minister of Transportation together with ENAC (Ente Nazionale Aviazione Civile) carry out administrative controls over the activities and duties of the Italian Coordinator (Assoclearance). As concerns judicial reviews, administrative and civil Courts have jurisdiction in the field of slot allocation according to the nature of breaking. In the European Union, the European Commission is tasked of controlling - under an administrative point of view - the Member States’ entities appointed to allocate slots. The judicial review is carried out by the European Court of Justice and by the European Court of Human Rights. Internationally, dispute settlement mechanisms are worked out at IATA and ICAO. These lust mechanisms are not binding for airlines and States respectively, so they have little effectiveness. The conclusion is that the slot allocation system should remain of administrative nature, because in those systems where market mechanisms have been developed (such as in the US) competition issues have not been solved; rather, much more problems have been created as incumbent airlines are reluctant to <b>sell</b> <b>slots</b> to their competitors. It is suggested to reinforce the application of the use-it-or-lose it rule in order to enable new air carriers to have access to the market. In this way, competition might be fostered in the European legal system and the aims of Regulation no. 95 / 93 attained. ...|$|R
