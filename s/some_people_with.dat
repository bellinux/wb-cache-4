5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> AML may {{experience}} {{swelling of the}} gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue. Rarely, {{the first sign of}} leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow, called a chloroma. Occasionally, a person may show no symptoms, and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{mutations}} are {{detected by}} sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> the clinical diagnosis have mutations {{that are not}} detectable by current technology, or that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of {{and to provide a}} means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family even if they have not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Most of the cancer-causing {{mutations}} {{cause the}} protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus. The C-terminal end of folliculin has {{shown to be}} the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway. FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a missense mutation in <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at this position {{is found to be}} conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating {{that it is important to}} the protein's function.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy {{is often}} given {{together}} with chemotherapy, {{and may be}} used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|According to Dewey, freedom {{had been}} {{associated}} <b>with</b> individuality by <b>some</b> <b>people</b> and <b>with</b> rationality, or law, by others. It {{has also been}} associated with the farming class by <b>some</b> <b>people</b> and <b>with</b> capitalists by others. Individualism (or liberty) and social control (or law) have been proposed as two extremes between which freedom has to navigate. In reality, the individual and the social forces interact in various ways, rather than being two distinct extremes.|$|R

5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The stigma may result in <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E

5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E
