5|$|After his tournament {{victory in}} July 2007, Asashōryū decided {{to skip the}} {{regional}} summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury. The medical forms submitted to the Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries to his left elbow and a stress fracture in his lower back would require six weeks of rest to heal. However, he was then <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia. He {{was reported to have}} done so {{at the request of the}} Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Mongolian government. However, the suggestion that he had exaggerated the extent of his injuries to avoid his duties on the exhibition tour caused a media storm.|$|E
5|$|Research by the Glasgow Media Group {{indicates}} that coverage of Sinn Féin by the BBC before the ban was minimal. In 1988 Sinn Féin was only heard or <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> 93 times, had only 17 of the 633 formal BBC interviews {{as compared to}} 121 interviews with the Conservative Party and 172 with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the civil service, and were never interviewed in the studio like many other participants. However, after the ban there was a steep decline in coverage of Sinn Féin and Republican views, with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in the following year, and the delays and uncertainties caused by ambiguities, voice-overs and subtitles often led to coverage and films being dropped entirely.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} the second serial, The Daleks, that the {{programme}} caught the imaginations of viewers and began to ingrain itself in the popular consciousness. This was primarily due to the Dalek creatures introduced in this story. Devised by scriptwriter Terry Nation and designer Raymond Cusick, they were completely un-humanoid and like nothing that had been <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> before. Lambert had in fact been strongly advised against using Nation's script by her direct superior Donald Wilson, but used the excuse that they had nothing else ready in order to produce it. Once it was clear what a great success it had been, Wilson admitted to Lambert that he would no longer interfere with her decisions as she clearly knew the programme better than he did.|$|E

25|$|McMahon {{then began}} to lead his WCW wrestlers against his father and the WWF wrestlers, {{eventually}} turning heel by joining forces with Paul Heyman and his brand of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) wrestlers, along with their new owner, McMahon's sister Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. Calling themselves The Alliance, they pledged to finally run the WWF (and specifically their father) out of business. Ultimately, The Invasion {{came to a head}} at Survivor Series in a match to determine which power would ultimately have control. The team, each respectively representing The Alliance and the WWF, of McMahon, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, and Booker T lost to the team of The Rock, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The following night on Raw, Vince publicly fired both Shane and Stephanie, which Shane took in stride, admitting that he lost to the better man, while Stephanie pleaded with her father before being forcefully removed from the arena. Aside from a brief appearance on the July 15, 2002 episode of Raw, McMahon would not be <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> for almost two years.|$|E
500|$|On June 23, 1988, the ACLU filed {{a federal}} lawsuit {{on behalf of}} Nelson against the three aldermen who were <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> {{handling}} the painting.

The ACLU sought $100,000 (1988, $182,000 in 2008) to compensate Nelson for damage to the painting, and to [...] "punish" [...] the aldermen and police for their actions.|$|E
500|$|The second design {{concept was}} similar to the Akira-class {{starship}} as <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> in the [...] and Voyager era, with the producers initially intending to use that class of vessel for Enterprise before Herman Zimmerman convinced them to go with a design with greater inspiration from The Original Series.

500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{was made}} in 1993 for the first season and remained unchanged until Duchovny left the show.

The latter was created when Carter found a video operator who was able to create the effect.

500|$|... "Last Gasp" [...] is {{the fourth}} episode of the first series of British dark comedy {{anthology}} television programme Inside No. 9. It first aired on 26 February 2014 on BBC Two. The story revolves around the ninth birthday of the severely ill Tamsin (Lucy Hutchinson). Tamsin's parents Jan (Sophie Thompson) and Graham (Steve Pemberton) have arranged with charity WishmakerUK for singer Frankie J Parsons (David Bedella) to visit as a treat for their daughter. Frankie dies after blowing up a balloon, leading to arguments between Graham, WishmakerUK representative Sally (Tamsin Greig) and Frankie's assistant Si (Adam Deacon) over the now-valuable balloon containing Frankie's last breath. The story, written by Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, was inspired by someone Pemberton had <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> who collected air from different places. The episode is more comedic than others in the series, and critiques celebrity culture and human greed.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Nicholaus Goossen and was released on January 27, 2012.

500|$|Rathborne {{chose to}} open the episode with a shot {{centered}} on Sherilyn Fenn, finding the actress to be [...] "seductive" [...] and [...] "absorbing" [...] {{in a similar manner}} to screen icon Marilyn Monroe. Rathborne had initially worried that the episode featured too many static scenes of characters sitting and talking, with little action, and asked Lynch if she could borrow some of the imagery of the previous episode's surreal dream sequence to keep these conversations more interesting, adding brief snippets of footage as Cooper discussed the dream with the others. Rathborne has noted that this dream-centric approach to the character of Cooper is rooted in Carl Jung's theories of analytical psychology. She felt this was something that had not been <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> before, and credits Lynch with introducing it to the series. She has also described the narrative, both of [...] "Episode 3" [...] and of Twin Peaks as a whole, as a [...] "Bildungsroman" [...] showing Cooper's development into a more rounded and enlightened person.|$|E

500|$|... "The One Hundredth" [...] was co-written by show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman and {{directed}} by Kevin S. Bright. The episode {{takes place in a}} hospital, meaning none of the usual filming sets were used, thus surprising several members of the audience. Crane commented that the hundred episode was a [...] "big milestone" [...] for the series and to mark the major event, Lisa Kudrow's character Phoebe would give birth to triplets. This brought a culmination to the surrogacy story arc, which began in the fourth season; it was developed to accommodate Lisa Kudrow's real life pregnancy. When Kudrow accepted the surrogate mother storyline, the idea of having more than one baby was [...] "comically funny" [...] to Kauffman, and giving birth to triplets or [...] "their brother's children" [...] was something never <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television.</b> Phoebe's pregnancy gave the writers incredible license for her to [...] "be just outrageously mean and still have it be funny". In order to prepare for the labor and birthing scenes, Kauffman watched a video of her cousin giving birth.|$|E
500|$|Following the debates, Perot did not {{campaign}} {{and was not}} <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> until {{later in the week}} when ABC aired a 30-minute sequel to an autobiographical infomercial shown on October 17. The spot cost Perot $370,000. CBS aired an infomercial on October 24 entitled The Ross Perot Nobody Knows, and two days later another was shown on ABC, preceding the kickoff of Monday Night Football, which cost $940,000. Perot hoped to better explain his earlier exit as Election Day neared. Reports circulated that a security official from the campaign had contacted the Dallas Police in August to urge them to perform a sting operation targeting Bush campaign adviser James Oberwetter, in response to allegations that Republicans planned to wiretap Perot's office. Perot claimed during an interview with 60 Minutes that [...] "Republican operatives" [...] also threatened to disrupt his daughter's wedding, which forced him to withdraw in July. He reported the story to the FBI, but no evidence of any wrongdoing was found. The New York Times argued that the story could help Perot with voters and his overall image by presenting him as a man [...] "who was willing to give up his goal to protect his family"; nevertheless, his lack of evidence drew criticism.|$|E

VanDerWerff felt that the story failed to work [...] "despite featuring Don Most and Valerie Mahaffey doing their very best". Canning thought Most's role as Emma's [...] "racist Ginger Supremacist father was perhaps the greatest bit of casting I've <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> all year". Urban thought the subplot [...] "worked really well", though she added that there were [...] "missteps".
