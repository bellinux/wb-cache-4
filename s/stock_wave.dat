40|$|Corporate events {{happen in}} waves. In this paper, {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between five different types of corporate event waves (mergers, IPOs, SEOs, stock repurchases, and debt issues) using a comprehensive dataset of more than 264, 000 corporate transactions over the 25 -year period 1980 - 2004. Our results show considerable overlap between all types of waves, especially during the 1990 s. The general pattern seems to start with new issue waves (SEO and IPO), followed by cash- and stock-financed M&A waves, followed in turn by repurchase and debt issue waves. Merger waves continue well after SEO and IPO waves have ended. There is also considerable overlap between stockfinanced M&A and <b>stock</b> repurchase <b>waves,</b> suggesting that most <b>stock</b> repurchases in <b>waves</b> occur when the market is overvalued.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays that {{examine the effects of}} corporate culture and investor psychology on corporate decisions and financial markets. The first essay focuses on the role of corporate culture in acquisitions, whereas the last two essays investigate deviations from market efficiency. The first essay uses textual analysis of firms annual reports to develop an estimate of the differences in corporate cultures of the combining firms, and finds that greater cultural differences between the firms lead to higher synergistic gains, but only when the acquirer has a stronger culture than its target. The synergy gains concentrate among deals where the acquirers values are not antagonistic to the targets. Further analysis of profitability and productivity (measured as earnings per employee) around the acquisition transaction corroborates these findings. Overall, the evidence suggests that differences in corporate culture are an important driver of announcement returns in mergers and acquisitions. The second essay investigates whether stock misvaluation drives industry-level merger waves by examining intra-wave patterns in acquirers valuation levels in a sample of acquisitions during 1981 - 2010. The essay contrasts two types of merger waves: <b>stock</b> <b>waves</b> defined on pure stock acquisitions, and cash waves formed on pure cash offers. Consistent with the misvaluation hypothesis, the essay finds that the occurrence of <b>stock</b> merger <b>waves</b> is tightly associated with industry stock valuation, and bidder stock valuation is negatively associated with long-run abnormal returns, especially so during <b>waves</b> of <b>stock</b> mergers. In contrast, there is little evidence of such patterns using the cash wave definition. The third essay investigates the effects of sunshine, wind, rain, snow, and temperature on daily index returns of 49 countries from 1973 to 2012. The paper finds pervasive weather effects that vary across temperature regions (cold, hot, and mild) and months. A hedge strategy that exploits the return predictability of daily weather generates up to 25 % (11. 8 %) annualized out-of-sample gross (net) profits during 1993 - 2012. The systematic patterns of weather effects together with the relationship between their strength and timing and individuals seasonal propensity to spend time outdoors, suggest a plausible mechanism through which weather-induced mood influences index returns...|$|R
40|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis exemplifies significant uncertainties in corporate financing conditions. We develop a unified dynamic q-theoretic framework where firms have both a precautionary-savings motive and a market-timing motive for external financing and payout decisions, induced by stochastic financing conditions.

40|$|Why do {{corporate}} financing events {{occur in}} waves? We challenge recent {{evidence of the}} importance of valuation cycles in driving financing waves by documenting that the aggregate pattern of stock repurchases mirrors that of equity issuance and mergers, despite repurchases involving an opposite transaction. We then show that trends in financing decisions result from differing responses to the same economic stimulus: growth in GDP. Specifically, economic expansion reduces the cost of equity relative to the cost of debt, inducing firms to issue equity, and increases cash flow and also causes varying degrees of uncertainty, increasing stock repurchases. We document similar trends and provide similar motivation for merger <b>waves.</b> <b>Stock</b> repurchases Distribution policy Market timing Undervaluation...|$|R

S. air-ports {{in general and the}} Federal Aviation Administration airport privatization pilot program in particular. The lack of success of this program is analyzed in terms of general airline opposition to privatization and the inherent advantages to the air-lines of the current airport financial system. Those advantages are primarily (a) the historic cost method of calculating landing fees and (b) the subsidization of the cap-ital improvement program. Reference is made to other airport financial systems that may be more successful, such as the management of Indianapolis Airport by the British Airport Authority U. S., Inc.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the return}} behaviour of German <b>stocks</b> following a <b>wave</b> of 10 - for- 1 stock splits. The splits were {{triggered by a}} legislative initiative (KmfG), designed to enhance the attractiveness of the German stock market. To avoid any size effects, the sample of 40 firms that executed a split during 1994 - 1996, was {{divided into two groups}} according to their market capitalization. Split-induced positive abnormal returns, as suggested by the signaling hypothesis, could not be revealed over the 30 -day observation period. A decrease in daily trading volume was found for the sample of high market capitalization stocks. The mean difference in daily trading volume was approximately 21. 9 %. The results also indicate an inverse correlation between firm size and the change in trading volume. The volatility of both stock samples' daily returns has increased, supporting the results of most of the previous research. While only the high cap sample displayed a decrease in systematic risk, both samples experienced an increase in non-systematic risk following the split. These results cannot support the rationale behind the KmfG with regard to suggested effects of stock splits on stock return characteristics. ...|$|R

60|$|If, however, our coco-nut {{is lucky}} enough to escape the robber-crabs, the pigs, and the monkeys, {{as well as to}} avoid falling into the hands of man, and being {{converted}} into the copra of commerce, or sold from a costermonger's barrow in the chilly streets of ungenial London at a penny a slice, it may very probably succeed in germinating after the fashion I have already described, and pushing up its head through the surrounding foliage to the sunlight above. As a rule, the coco-nut has been dropped by its mother tree on the sandy soil of a sea-beach; and this is the spot it best loves, and where it grows to the stateliest height. Sometimes, however, it falls into the sea itself, and then the loose husk buoys it up, so that it floats away bravely till it is cast by the waves upon some distant coral reef or desert island. It is this power of floating and surviving a long voyage that has dispersed the coco-nut so widely among oceanic islands, where so few plants are generally to be found. Indeed, on many atolls or isolated reefs (for example, on Keeling Island) it is the only tree or shrub that grows in any quantity, and on it the pigs, the poultry, the ducks, and the land crabs of the place entirely subsist. In any case, wherever it happens to strike, the young coco-nut sends up at first a fine rosette of big spreading leaves, not raised as afterwards on a tall stem, but springing direct from the ground in a wide circle, something like a very big and graceful fern. In this early stage nothing can be more beautiful or more essentially tropical in appearance than a plantation of young coco-nuts. Their long feathery leaves spreading out in great clumps from the buried <b>stock,</b> and <b>waving</b> with lithe motion before the strong sea-breeze of the Indies, are the very embodiment of those deceptive ideal tropics which, alas, {{are to be found in}} actual reality nowhere on earth save in the artificial palm-houses at Kew, and the Casino Gardens at too entrancing Monte Carlo.|$|R
40|$|A common {{feature of}} many {{aggregate}} variables in economics and finance {{is that they}} exhibit oscillatory behaviour, showing boom-and-bust patterns. Examples are fad and bandwagon behaviour in sociology, business cycles in economics, bubbles in <b>stock</b> market prices, <b>wave</b> behaviour in the adoption of innovation technology. We study consumption behaviour in systems with heterogeneous interacting agents. Two different models are introduced, respectively with long and short range interactions among agents. At any time step an agent decides {{whether or not to}} consume a good, doing so if this provides positive utility. Utility is affected by idiosyncratic preferences (noise) and costs as well as externalities from other agents. Agents are ranked in classes, with interactions among agents depending on the agents' ``distance'' (such as, for example, differences in wealth), and they recognize peer, distinction and aspiration groups. We simulate the system numerically for different choices of the parameters as well as for different class (wealth) distributions and identify different complex patterns: a steady state regime with a variety of consumption modes of behaviour, and a wave/cycle regime. The cases of fashion (fad) and value goods are both analyzed. The crucial point in this model is not the exact description of individual behaviour but the interrelation between individuals and the statistical properties of consumers' characteristics. We want to identify which are the relevant mechanisms that determine the large scale behaviour of aggregate consumption. In our model the macro-level organization, manifests in complex consumption patterns, which emerge purely from the micro-level interactions among agents, without the coordinating effect of any aggregate signal. Particular emphasis is given to the dynamical properties of the model, and we provide examples of complex patterns, such as non-periodic consumption cycles and turbulent behaviour with boom and busts in consumption activity. Our model bears resemblance with models of statistical mechanics of disordered systems and provides an example of how the development of appropriate numerical approaches may provide fundamental advances in the understanding of the complex behaviour that arise from the nonlinear spatio-temporal interactions among a large number of units. ...|$|R

This work belongs to ‘Task 3. 1 – Transition Prediction’. In Task 3. 1, based on EUROLIFT (I) findings and the effects of prescribed laminar areas investigated in WP 1. 2 of EUROLIFT (II), taking into account transition prediction (location and type) directly within CFD computations was investigated. An extension to 3 D of the different prediction tools was carried out, and different coupling strategies with RANS solvers were compared. Objectives of Task 3. 1 are: A) Extension of EUROLIFT (I) methods for transition prediction from 2. 5 D to 3 D basic flow, based on databases or on local theory B) Validation of internal transition prediction in RANS. Extension of FLOWer by internal coupling with exact stability code LILO C) Improvement of the physical understanding of specific 3 D transition mechanisms, transfer from 2. 5 D to full 3 D mean flow D) Effect of transition in laminar separation bubbles The DLR work is located in part B) of this task and is defined as follows: The DLR FLOWer code will be extended using empirical criteria to allow the detection of transition inside separation bubbles, bypass transition and attachment line contamination. These extensions will be added to the transition module, that consists of a laminar boundary layer method for swept, tapered wings (Horton/Stock), an eN database method for TS <b>waves</b> (<b>Stock)</b> and an eN database method for CF instabilities (Casalis&Arnal). The resulting code will be applied to the 3 D high lift system of KH 3 Y high lift model (DLR F 11 model) from task 1. 2 A further improvement of this strategy will consist in replacing the approximate database methods with a fast, exact stability computation, relying on the Airbus Deutschland code LILO.

40|$|Rogue events {{otherwise}} known as outliers and black swans are singular, rare, events that carry dramatic impact. They appear in seemingly unconnected systems {{in the form of}} oceanic rogue <b>waves,</b> <b>stock</b> market crashes, evolution, and communication systems. Attempts to understand the underlying dynamics of such complex systems that lead to spectacular and often cataclysmic outcomes have been frustrated by the scarcity of events, resulting in insufficient statistical data, and by the inability to perform experiments under controlled conditions. Extreme rare events also occur in ultrafast physical sciences where it is possible to collect large data sets, even for rare events, in a short time period. The knowledge gained from observing rare events in ultrafast systems may provide valuable insight into extreme value phenomena that occur over a much slower timescale and that have a closer connection with human experience. One solution is a real-time ultrafast instrument that is capable of capturing singular and randomly occurring non-repetitive events. The time stretch technology developed during the past 13 years is providing a powerful tool box for reaching this goal. This paper reviews this technology and discusses its use in capturing rogue events in electronic signals, spectroscopy, and imaging. We show an example in nonlinear optics where it was possible to capture rare and random solitons whose unusual statistical distribution resemble those observed in financial markets. The ability to observe the true spectrum of each event in real time has led to important insight in understanding the underlying process, which in turn has made it possible to control soliton generation leading to improvement in the coherence of supercontinuum light. We also show a new class of fast imagers which are being considered for early detection of cancer because of their potential ability to detect rare diseased cells (so called rogue cells) in a large population of healthy cells. © 2010 EDP Sciences and Springer. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
