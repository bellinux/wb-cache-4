2500|$|Distribution centers {{help reduce}} {{the need to keep}} {{buildings}} such as warehouses in city centers accessible by Tractor units. They allow the tractor units to unload their products in the distribution center, which is placed outside of the city center.

2500|$|As Diesel {{locomotives}} {{began to}} replace steam on most railroads during the mid-20th century, it was {{realized that the}} new locomotives were unable to utilize the steam whistles then in use. [...] Early internal combustion locomotives were initially fitted with <b>small</b> <b>truck</b> horns or exhaust-powered whistles, but these {{were found to be}} unsuitable and hence the air horn design was scaled up and modified for railroad use. Early train horns often were tonally similar to the air horns still heard on road-going trucks today. It was found that this caused some confusion among people who were accustomed to steam locomotives and the sound of their whistles; when approaching a grade crossing, when some people heard an air horn they expected to see a truck, not a locomotive, and accidents happened. So, locomotive air horns were created that had a much higher, more musical note, tonally much more like a steam whistle. This is why most train horns have a unique sound, different from that of road going trucks, although many switch engines, which didn't see road service (service on the main lines), retained the deeper truck-like horns.|$|E
