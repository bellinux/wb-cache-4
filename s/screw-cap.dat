5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Australian wine {{industry}} was interested in the idea of sealing wines with the Stelvin <b>screw-cap,</b> consumers did not agree. Because consumers saw the use of a metallic cap as an indication of an inferior product, the winery stopped using the Stelvin <b>screw-cap</b> in 1984. [...] Pewsey Vale never fully gave up on the idea, and reintroduced the Stelvin in 1995 for their riesling wines intended for museum use. [...] In 2000, current winemaker Louisa Rosa was quoted as saying: Pewsey Vale Rieslings are renowned for their exceptional aging ability. While Australian wine consumers may not be quite ready to go back to Pewsey Vale in Stelvin, at least we can rest assured that the aging potential of these (museum) wines will be maximised.|$|E
30|$|Per treatment, moss samples (10 plantlets per bottle, top 3  cm) {{from each}} site were {{incubated}} in 180  ml plastic Scholl flasks and closed with septum containing <b>screw-caps.</b> Before incubation, the fresh weight (FW) of the mosses was determined. All bottles received 5 % 15 N–N 2 in the headspace, {{except for the}} background controls. 13 C–CH 4 treated samples received additionally 5 % 13 C–CH 4 in the headspace. The headspace of the ambient O 2 condition consisted of air. Low O 2 conditions were achieved by replacing (four cycles of vacuum—helium gassing) the headspace with an artificial gas mixture consisting of N 2 gas (80 %), CO 2 (0.04 %) and helium (20 %). Oxygen was not added, so that {{the only source of}} oxygen was photosynthesis by the mosses.

40|$|Large {{sections}} of the population encounter difficulty in opening consumer packaging of many kinds. <b>Screw-caps</b> in particular can cause problems {{for a range of}} people with a variety of impairments. This paper describes the development and initial testing of a novel multi-axial force and torque transducer, designed for the study of loading conditions when tamper-evident bottle closures are opened manually. The transducer, which comprises seven beams that are sensitive to direct forces and torques in each of three axes, can provide comprehensive information on the loading conditions that occur when an instrumented bottle is opened. Importantly, the transducer has been designed to fit inside a typical 500 ml capacity plastic soft drinks bottle so that it does not interfere with {{the way in which the}} subject grips the bottle and cap, or applies forces and torques, in order to open the bottle. The method to obtain load data from the calibration matrix, along with initial opening force and torque test data from two user groups, elderly and young, is described. It is clear from the results of these tests that the elderly and young groups exhibit significantly different torque and force profiles to open bottles. It is anticipated that the transducer will be a valuable tool in future studies of opening strategies...|$|R

5000|$|Fungi, notably zygomycetes, ascomycetes {{and higher}} basidiomycetes, {{regardless}} of sporulation, {{are able to}} be stored in liquid nitrogen or deep-frozen. Crypreservation is a hallmark method for fungi that do not sporulate (otherwise other preservation methods for spores can be used at lower costs and ease), sporulate but have delicate spores (large or freeze-dry sensitive), are pathogenic (dangerous to keep metabolically active fungus) or are {{to be used for}} genetic stocks (ideally to have identical composition as the original deposit). As with many other organisms, cryoprotectants like DMSO or glycerol (e.g. filamentous fungi 10% glycerol or yeast 20% glycerol) are used. Differences between choosing cryoprotectants are species (or class) dependent, but generally for fungi penetrating cryoprotectants like DMSO, glycerol or polyethylene glycol are most effective (other non-penetrating ones include sugars mannitol, sorbitol, dextran, etc.).

5000|$|The patent {{specifies}} that it {{was issued}} to Peter Durand, a merchant of Hoxton Square, Middlesex, United Kingdom, for a method of preserving animal food, vegetable food and other perishable articles using various vessels made of glass, pottery, tin or other suitable metals. The preservation procedure was to fill up a vessel with food and cap it. Vegetables were {{to be put in}} raw, whereas animal substances might either be raw or half-cooked. Then the whole item was to be heated by any means, such as an oven, stove or a steam bath, but most conveniently by immersing in water and boiling it. The boiling time was not specified, and was said to depend on the food and vessel size. Neither was the patent clear on the preservation time, which was merely said to be [...] "long". The cap was to be partly open during the whole heating and cooling procedure, but right after that, the vessel should be sealed airtight by any means, such as a cork plug, a <b>screw-cap</b> with a rubber seal, cementing, etc.|$|E

40|$|Between 1 July 1970 and April 1971, in many {{hospitals}} in this country, there were outbreaks of nosocomial septicemia caused by Enterobacter cloacae of E. agglomerans (formerly Erwinia, herbicola-lathyri). All of these hospitals used infusion {{products manufactured by}} one company, Abbott Laboratories, and all affected patients had onset of septicemia while receiving the company's infusion products. Septicemia was epidemiologically and microbiologically traced to intrinsic contamination of the company's <b>screw-cap</b> closure for infusion bottles which was sealed with a newly introduced elastomer liner. Epidemic organisms were isolated from these closures. Investigations both in the laboratory and in the manufacturing plant into the mechanism of contamination of these products revealed the following. (i) Epidemic strains were present in numerous areas throughout the manufacturing plants. (ii) Viable microorganisms gained access to the interior of <b>screw-cap</b> closures after the autoclave step of production. (iii) Cooling closures actively drew moisture through the thread interstices into the inner-most depths of the closure. (iv) Transfer of contaminants from closures to fluid was easily effected by simple manipulations duplicating normal in-hospital use. (v) The red-rubber liner used in the company's <b>screw-cap</b> closures before the introduction of elastomer contained a broad-spectrum antimicrobial inhibitor.

40|$|The {{dispensing}} closure used for containers {{plays an important}} role in protecting cosmetics from in-use microbial contamination. This hypothesis was tested by aseptically packing unpreserved shampoo and skin lotion into containers with three different closure types which provided various degrees of protection against consumer and environmental microbial insults. Shampoo was packed in containers with slit-cap (n = 25), flip-cap (n = 25), or <b>screw-cap</b> (n = 28) closures. Skin lotion was packed in containers with pump-top (n = 21), flip-cap (n = 18), or <b>screw-cap</b> (n = 21) closures. The products were then used by volunteers under actual in-use conditions for 3 (shampoo) or 2 (skin lotion) weeks. After use, the products were evaluated for microbial contamination by using standard methods for enumeration and identification. The standard <b>screw-cap</b> closure provided only minimal protection against microbial contamination of both the shampoo (29 % contamination incidence) and the skin lotion (71 %). The slit-cap closure on the shampoo container and the flip-cap closure on the skin lotion container provided slightly enhanced degrees of protection (21 and 39 % contamination incidence, respectively). The greatest amount of protection (i. e., lowest contamination incidence) was provided by the flip-cap closure for the shampoo container (0 %) and the pump-top closure for the skin lotion container (10 %).
