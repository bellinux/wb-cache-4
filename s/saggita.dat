50|$|The {{otoliths}} {{begin to}} form {{shortly after the}} fish hatches. Otoliths are composed of a crystalline calcium carbonate structure, {{in the form of}} aragonite, on a protein matrix. Calcium carbonate is diffused through the endolymph cell membrane and the aragonite layers are permanently deposited in discrete increments. These increments are permanently stored in layers and their composition is not altered over time. Along with calcium carbonate, other chemicals are deposited in trace amounts. The most common trace elements found in otoliths are the alkaline earth metals Strontium (Sr), Barium (Ba), and Magnesium (Mg) because they are in the alkaline earth metal group like Calcium and therefore have the same bonding affinity. This allows these alkaline earth metals to substitute in for calcium in the aragonite without affecting the crystalline structure. Other elements and stable isotopes can be deposited in lower concentrations within the aragonite structure and in the protein matrix. The uptake of chemicals into the otolith is multi-stage and complex, but the chemical composition of the discrete layers are proportional to that of the ambient water in which the fish is inhabiting at the time of deposition. These discrete layers create a temporal record of the water in which the fish has inhabited. There are 3 pairs of otoliths in bony fish, but only the largest, known as the <b>saggita,</b> is commonly used for microchemical analysis. The core of the otolith corresponds to the earliest larval period of the fish’s life. Thus the microchemistry of the core of the otolith {{can be used as a}} means of inferring natal origin of fish.|$|E

The regression method and Lee (Fraser-Lee) 's method were used to estimate the back-calculated length. Growth of pointhead flounder was expressed as Lt= 251. 9 (1 -exp-O. 261 (t-O. 142)) for males and Lt = 315. 1 (1 -exp-o. 219 (t-o. 200)) for females using back-calculated lengths by the regression method and Lt = 251. 6 (1 -exp-O. 263 (t-O. 142)) for males and Lt= 333. 0 (1 -exp-O. 204 (t-O. 186)) for females using back-calcu-lated lengths by Lee's method, where Lt is the standard length (mm) at estimated age t. Small differ-ences in the theoretical lengths of older female fish were found between the two methods. However, the theoretical standard lengths predicted by the two methods were very similar at most estimated ages and indicated the approximate actual length at each age.

40|$|Common snook Centropomus unidecimalis is an {{important}} commercial and fishery species in Southern Mexico, however the high exploitation rates {{have resulted in a}} strong reduction of its abundances. Since, the information about its population structure is scarce, the objective of the present research was to determine and compare the age structure in four important fishery sites. For this, age and growth of common snook were determined from specimens collected monthly, from July 2006 to March 2008, from two coastal (Barra Bosque and Barra San Pedro) and two riverine (San Pedro and Tres Brazos) commercial fishery sites in Tabasco, Mexico. Age was determined using sectioned <b>saggitae</b> otoliths and data analyzed by von Bertalanffy and Levenberg-Marquardt among others. Estimated ages ranged from 2 to 17 years. Monthly patterns of marginal increment formation and the percentage of otoliths with opaque rings on the outer edge demonstrated that a single annulus was formed each year. The von Bertalanffy parameters were calculated for males and females using linear adjustment and the non-linear method of Levenberg-Marquardt. The von Bertalanffy growth equations were FLt= 109. 21 (1 -e- 0. 21 (t+ 0. 57)) for Barra Bosque, FLt= 94. 56 (1 -e- 0. 27 (t+ 0. 48)) for Barra San Pedro, FLt= 97. 15 (1 -e- 0. 17 (t+ 1. 32)) for San Pedro and FLt= 83. 77 (1 -e- 0. 26 (t+ 0. 49)) for Tres Brazos. According to (Hotelling’s T², p< 0. 05) test growth was significantly greater for females than for males. Based on the Chen test, von Bertalanffy growth curves were different among the study sites (RSS, p< 0. 05). Based on the observed differences in growth parameters among sampling sites (coastal and riverine environments) future research need to be conducted on migration and population genetics, in order to delineate the stock structure of this population and support management programs...|$|R

The influence of seasonal fluctuations in water levels on tropical fish species from fluvial environments was evaluated by comparing the ecology of resident piscivores and habitat use of prey fish within a floodplain river. Ecological data were collected for three species of sympatric Cichla (Cichlidae) from the Cinaruco River in Venezuela from November 1993 to June 1994. Cichla intermedia showed an affinity for structured habitats in the main channel. Cichla orinocensis and C. temensis were captured in both main channel and lagoon habitats. Cichla temensis was more numerous and significantly larger than the other two species. Hydrologic seasonality influenced prey availability, and consequently reproductive timing. Prey fishes from predator stomachs were significantly larger during the falling-water period than during rising water. All three species of Cichla had spawning peaks during the late low-water and early rising-water periods. Marginal increment analysis of <b>saggita</b> otoliths revealed a slow growth period that coincided with low water and peak spawning activity. Based on annuli counts from otoliths, Cichla from the Cinaruco system can live up to seven years. Increased fishing pressure at the Cinaruco, especially during the reproductive season, may disrupt adult reproductive success and survival of substrate-guarded young. Management activities aimed at maintaining healthy Cichla stocks should be directed at protecting spawning adults. Seine collections from sand beach habitats revealed high species diversity. One hundred and five fish species from 22 families and 8 orders were found in lagoon and main river beach habitats. The order Characiformes comprised 68. 5 % of the species and 83. 5 % of the individuals. Most samples were numerically dominated by 1 - 3 species of small characids. Perciforms were more diverse in lagoon beaches than in main or side channel areas. Many fish species were never numerically abundant but occurred in most collections. There was little similarity in species assemblages among lagoon samples, or among main river samples, suggesting little fine-scale habitat specialization for fishes inhabiting sand beach areas...|$|E
