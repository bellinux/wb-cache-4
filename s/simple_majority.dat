5|$|As well as rugby sevens, {{baseball}} and softball, which were {{dropped from the}} Olympic programme in 2005, karate, squash, golf and roller sports (inline speed skating) were all seeking {{to be included in}} the 2016 games and leaders of the seven sports made formal presentations to the IOC executive board in June 2009. A new system was in place at this session in which a sport now needs only a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rather than the two-thirds majority that was required before.|$|E
5|$|By {{calling a}} federal referendum, {{a group of}} {{citizens}} may challenge a law passed by parliament, if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> whether to accept or reject the law. Any 8 cantons together can also call a constitutional referendum on a federal law.|$|E

5|$|Changes to the {{fundamental}} rights require a constitutional amendment, which has to be passed by a special majority of both houses of Parliament. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting. However, the number of members voting should not be less than the <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> of the house – whether the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5|$|In early November, about 50 players renewed {{talks of}} union {{decertification}} if the union went lower than 52.5% of BRI or agreed to additional restrictions on contracts, salary-cap exceptions, or free agency. Decertifying {{would require that}} 30% of the union—about 130 players—sign a petition, allowing an election {{under the auspices of}} the NLRB by all NBPA members to decertify with a <b>simple</b> <b>majority.</b> The NLRB traditionally does not consider a decertification petition while a charge is pending, such as the NBPA's unfair labor practice charges filed in August.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Polk {{narrowly}} defeated Clay, who opposed annexation. Lame-duck President Tyler organized a joint House–Senate {{vote on the}} Texas treaty which passed, requiring only a <b>simple</b> <b>majority.</b> he signed a bill of annexation on March 1, With President Polk's support, the Texas annexation treaty {{was approved by the}} Texas Republic in 1845.

Quorum systems are the key mathematical abstraction for ensuring consistency in fault-tolerant and highly available distributed computing. Critical for many applications {{since the early days of}} distributed computing, quorum systems have evolved from <b>simple</b> <b>majorities</b> of a set of processes to complex hierarchical collections of sets, tailored for general adversarial structures. The initial non-empty intersection property has been refined many times to...|$|R
5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over {{the legality of the}} annexation of Texas {{stems from the fact that}} Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with <b>simple</b> <b>majorities</b> in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|R
5|$|Its {{decisions}} are made by qualified majority voting in most areas, unanimity in others, or just <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> for procedural issues. Usually where it operates unanimously, it only needs to consult the Parliament. However, in most areas the ordinary legislative procedure applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass. In a few limited areas the Council may initiate new EU law itself.|$|E
5|$|Of the 42,617 Wildrose members {{eligible}} {{to vote on}} July 22, 2017, there was a 57 per cent turnout with 23,466 voters (95%) in favour of the agreement and 1,132 (5%) against, clearing the 75% threshold required by the party's constitution. The Progressive Conservative membership also approved the agreement {{by a margin of}} 95% to 5%. With a turnout of 55% of eligible members, 25,692 PC members voted yes and 1,344 voted no with 24 spoiled ballots; the party's constitution required a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> of its membership to approve the merger.|$|E
5|$|The Council {{votes in}} one of three ways; unanimity, <b>simple</b> <b>majority,</b> or {{qualified}} majority. In most cases, the Council votes on issues by qualified majority voting, meaning that there must be a minimum of 55% of member states agreeing (at least 15) who together represent at least 65% of the EU population. A 'blocking minority' can only be formed by at least 4 member states representing at least 35% of the EU population.|$|E
5000|$|These reforms {{required}} a rapprochement between Jackson and Biddle {{on the matter}} of recharter, with McLane and Livingston acting as liaisons. [...] The president insisted that no bill arise in Congress for recharter in the lead up to his reelection campaign in 1832. He viewed the issue as a political liability - recharter would easily pass both Houses with <b>simple</b> <b>majorities</b> - and as such, would confront him with the dilemma of [...] "approving or disapproving" [...] the legislation. A delay would obviate these risks. Jackson, however, remained convinced of the Bank's unconstitutionality.|$|R
50|$|The Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform {{surprised}} many when it {{proposed an}} STV electoral model called BC-STV and recommended {{it to the}} electorate. In the ensuing electoral reform referendum held on May 17, 2005, BC-STV achieved a majority 57.7% Yes support. However, this did not give it the 60% province-wide support set as a requirement by the government (British Columbia Liberal Party) for the referendum outcome to be automatically binding. Nevertheless, the <b>simple</b> <b>majorities</b> in 77 ridings (of 79) far exceeded the 48 ridings that was also a requirement set by the government (British Columbia Liberal Party).|$|R
50|$|In the House of Representatives, the Turkish Cypriots {{were elected}} {{separately}} {{by their own}} community. The House had no power to modify the basic articles of the Constitution in any respect and any other modification required separate majorities of two thirds of both the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot members. Any modification of the Electoral Law and the adoption of any law relating to municipalities or any fiscal laws required separate <b>simple</b> <b>majorities</b> of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot members of the House. It was thus impossible for representatives of one community alone to pass a bill.|$|R

5|$|The Sejm had mostly {{advisory}} powers, {{although it}} could legislate on some strictly local matters, such as communal self-government and spending of some local taxes. It could opine legal acts {{relevant to the}} Grand Duchy. Its deputies {{had the right to}} file petitions and complaints to the King of Prussia, who could consent or reject (as was often the case) the Sejm proposals. Proposals from and to the King required a two-thirds majority; other proposals required a <b>simple</b> <b>majority.</b>|$|E

5000|$|On December 10, the Assembly's Final Report, titled [...] "Making Every Vote Count: The Case for Electoral Reform in British Columbia" [...] was {{presented}} to the B.C. legislature by the Assembly. In May 2005, the recommendations from the Assembly were accepted by 57.7% of voters in a referendum and were supported by a majority in 77 of the 79 electoral districts. However, the referendum required approval by 60% of votes and <b>simple</b> <b>majorities</b> in 60% of the 79 districts in order to pass. Consequently, no change ensued. The recommendations were rejected by 60.9% of voters in a follow-up referendum.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{judicial}} {{systems are}} largely grounded {{on the principle}} of the ‘presumption of innocence’, which is intended to protect individuals from receiving inappropriate punishments. While we are extremely careful to prevent wrongful convictions in courts, however, the laws which are enforced by courts are typically passed by <b>simple</b> <b>majorities</b> in a national legislature. Arguing that it is perhaps no less of an injustice to be convicted {{on the basis of a}} flawed law, than it is to be wrongly convicted on the basis of an appropriate one, Patrick Tomlin writes that it may be time to consider a new approach, such as using supermajorities for criminalisation decisions...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Rachel Lahela Kekoa Bolt, a native Hawaiian heir of Henry Maui, {{and some of}} her {{descendants}} filed federal lawsuits claiming her inherited interest in Palmyra and challenging the legality of the Newlands Resolution that annexed Hawaii in 1898 by <b>simple</b> <b>majorities</b> in Congress (after an Annexation Treaty had failed to get the required two-thirds majority in the U.S. Senate). The lawsuits challenged American sovereignty over both the State of Hawaii and the United States Territory of Palmyra Island. [...] On similar grounds they intervened in a federal marine salvage claim for a sunken treasure ship at Palmyra. [...] The cases were dismissed on procedural grounds before trial.|$|R
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a <b>simple</b> <b>majority,</b> but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
5|$|Denver has {{a strong}} mayor/weak city council government. The mayor can approve or veto any {{ordinances}} or resolutions approved by the council, makes sure all contracts with the city are kept and performed, signs all bonds and contracts, {{is responsible for the}} city budget, and can appoint people to various city departments, organizations, and commissions. However, the council can override the mayor's veto with a nine out of thirteen member vote, and the city budget must be approved and can be changed by a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> vote of the council. The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually based on financial reasons.|$|E
5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, {{the government may}} decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E
5|$|In June 1844, the Senate, {{with its}} Whig majority, soundly {{rejected}} the Tyler–Texas treaty.

In December 1844, lame-duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by <b>simple</b> <b>majorities</b> in each house. The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery {{provisions of the}} Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill (by the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.|$|R

5000|$|The {{election}} {{was the second}} one in history to be held under the census suffrage (and weighted voting) law of July 1866, with a two-round system where <b>simple</b> <b>majorities</b> were not decided in one session. The First College comprised voters who owned more than 300 ducats in property, and the Second included those who declared 100-300 ducats; they each elected 33 deputies with direct elections. The Third College corresponded roughly to a [...] "third estate", specifically designed for urban constituencies, directly electing 58 deputies {{in proportion to the}} respective town population. A Fourth College, representing taxpayers not comprised in the other categories, designated 33 of the total 157 deputies through electors. In 1866-1867, there was a 1:50 ratio of electors to registered voters.|$|R
