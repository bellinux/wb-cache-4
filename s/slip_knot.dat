5|$|Years earlier, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, {{alongside}} Cutter {{and assistant}} Julia, Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped {{in a water}} tank from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a riskier <b>slip</b> <b>knot.</b> Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, devastating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden.|$|E
25|$|This process {{continues}} {{until the}} whole skein is wound. The time to skein yarn on a niddy-noddy {{depends on the}} yardage, and thus how many wraps need to be made. A larger niddy-noddy can speed up the skeining, but a very large one can be bulky, and thus slow down {{the time to do}} one wrap. At this point, the skein is secured by loose figure eight knots between each crossbar. This can be done with scrap yarn, or with slip knots {{from the end of the}} skein. In either case, loosely securing each end with a <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> makes it easier to find the ends in the finished skein. Generally 4 or more knots are tied.|$|E
25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a single length of monofilament nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament butt length or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.|$|E

50|$|The Siberian hitch (or Evenk knot) is a hitch knot used {{to attach}} a rope to an object. It {{is a type of}} slipped figure-eight noose. The hitch is known for having a tying method {{suitable}} even while wearing heavy gloves or mittens in cold climates. As a <b>slipped</b> <b>knot</b> it can be released simply by pulling the working end of the rope.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are several}} more secure {{alternatives}} to the common shoelace bow, with names such as Turquoise Turtle Shoelace Knot, or Shoemaker's Knot, Better Bow Shoelace Knot, Surgeon's Shoelace Knot, and Ian's Secure Shoelace Knot, or double <b>slip</b> <b>knot.</b> One such knot has been patented in 1999 under the title [...] "Shoelace tying system". These are all variations of the same concept of looping the top part of the knot twice instead of once, which results in a finished bow of almost identical appearance but with the laces wrapped twice around the middle. This double-wrap holds the shoelaces more securely tied while still allowing them to be untied with a (slightly firmer) pull on the loose end(s).|$|E
2500|$|The first {{method of}} hanging was [...] "hoisting" [...] {{in which a}} rope would be thrown over a beam and the convicted person would then be hoisted into the air by others pulling on the rope. The <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> would then tightly close around the neck until strangulation. A {{variation}} of this included the person with a rope around the neck to stand on a cart {{and then it would}} be pushed from under him. This {{led to the development of}} suspension in which [...] "the drop" [...] caused by jerking something from underneath the offender became the main component of the execution. Executioners experimented with the length of the rope for the drop. They discovered new ways of causing instant unconsciousness and quick death upon hanging. In 1872, the length of a drop extended to nearly five feet which dislocated the neck perfectly. Almost one year later, the length of the drop was extended to seven feet.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} make a <b>slipped</b> <b>knot</b> (also <b>slipped</b> loop and quick release knot), a bight must be passed, rather than the end. This slipped form of the knot is more easily untied. The {{traditional}} bow knot used for tying shoelaces is simply a reef knot with the final overhand knot made with two bights instead of the ends. Similarly, a slippery hitch is a slipped clove hitch.|$|R
50|$|The highpoint hitch (or high post hitch) {{is a type}} of knot used {{to attach}} a rope to an object. The main feature of the hitch is that it is very secure, yet if tied as a <b>slipped</b> <b>knot</b> it can be {{released}} quickly and easily with one pull, even after heavy loading. The highpoint hitch is a buntline hitch with an extra half turn, making it more secure.|$|R
50|$|The <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> is a stopper knot {{which is}} easily undone by pulling the tail (working end). The <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> {{is related to}} the running knot, which will release when the {{standing}} end is pulled. Both knots are identical and are composed of a slipped overhand knot, where a bight allows the knot be released by pulling on an end; the working end for a <b>slip</b> <b>knot,</b> and the standing end for a running knot. The <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> is used {{as a starting point for}} crochet and knitting.|$|E

50|$|When casting {{on at the}} beginning, {{one end of the}} yarn must {{be secured}} to the {{knitting}} needle by knotting it, usually with a <b>slip</b> <b>knot.</b> This knot is unnecessary when casting on {{in the middle of the}} fabric (e.g., when making the upper edge of a buttonhole) since the yarn is already secured to the fabric. The original <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> can also be pulled out (after a few rows have been knitted) without damaging the knitted fabric.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> {{is closely}} related to the {{overhand}} knot, {{the difference between the two}} being in the treatment of the end. In the former the end is doubled before it is finally tucked. To untie, all that is required is a smart pull on the end of the rope, which withdraws the loop and causes the knot to spill instantly. A <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> may be tied in the bight as readily as in the end, but the load must be on the standing part of the knot only. It is used wherever the necessity to cast off suddenly may arise. The Ashley Book of Knots ...|$|E

5000|$|Double cast-on : A common method, {{in which}} all the loops are made with one yarn, while the other end (the {{dangling}} end from the original <b>slip</b> <b>knot)</b> is used to secure the base of each loop. This method is also called the [...] "knit half-hitch cast on" [...] or the [...] "long-tail cast on." [...] Although popular, this method requires that the knitter estimate the length of the dangling yarn before the stitches are cast on; if the dangling yarn is too short, the knitter will run out of yarn with which to secure the stitches before the full number of stitches have been cast on. In that case, the knitter will have to pull everything out, re-position the <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> to give a longer tail, and begin anew. Despite this shortcoming, it's a good all-around method for casting on. Another variation for this method is to use two different yarns, one the main yarns that you are using for your project, and the second a piece of contrasting waste yarn. You attach the two with a <b>slip</b> <b>knot,</b> and then using the waste or contrast yarn as your long tail, start your row. This is useful if you need to pick up stitches on your cast on edge in order to knit in the opposite direction. You can also use it decoratively, making the contrast or waste yarn a part of your pattern design. To execute it, you start by figuring out how much yarn you expect your cast-on row to require and pulling out that amount of yarn. Once you have that, put a <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> on the needle (this is not absolutely necessary, since the first cast-on stitch will create a <b>slip</b> <b>knot</b> for you in the process, but it is generally more secure to start with a <b>slip</b> <b>knot).</b> Hold the needle in your right hand and the yarn in your left, with the long tail pulled around your thumb and hanging in front, and the yarn from ball around your first or second finger, with the ball tail heading toward the back. Once you have that, take the needle under the front of the long tail, picking up a half hitch, then back to the yarn over your finger from the top side of the yarn, pulling the loop through the half hitch you had formed. This cast on can also be done in a purl and a twisted stitch version as well.|$|E
