40|$|We numerically {{study the}} {{scattering}} coefficients of linear water waves on stationary flows above a localized obstacle. We compare the scattering on trans- and <b>subcritical</b> <b>flows,</b> and then {{focus on the}} latter which {{have been used in}} recent analog gravity experiments. The main difference concerns the magnitude of the mode amplification: whereas transcritical flows display a large amplification (which is generally in good agreement with the Hawking prediction), this effect is heavily suppressed in <b>subcritical</b> <b>flows.</b> This is due to the transmission across the obstacle for frequencies less than some critical value. As a result, <b>subcritical</b> <b>flows</b> display high- and low-frequency behaviors separated by a narrow band around the critical frequency. In the low-frequency regime, transmission of long wavelengths is accompanied by non-adiabatic scattering into short wavelengths, whose spectrum is approximately linear in frequency. By contrast, in the high-frequency regime, no simple description seems to exist. In particular, for obstacles similar to those recently used, we observe that the upstream slope still affects the scattering on the downstream side because of some residual transmission.

50|$|A Froude number {{greater than}} one is {{supercritical}}, and a Froude number {{less than one}} is subcritical. In general, supercritical flows are shallow and fast and <b>subcritical</b> <b>flows</b> are deep and slow. These different flow classifications are also represented on M-y diagrams where {{different regions of the}} graph represent different flow types. Figure 5 shows these regions, with a specific momentum curve corresponding to a q = 10 ft2/s. As stated previously, critical flow is represented by the minimum momentum that exists on the curve (green line). Supercritical flows correspond to any point on the momentum curve that has a depth less than the critical depth with <b>subcritical</b> <b>flows</b> having a depth greater than critical depth.|$|R
