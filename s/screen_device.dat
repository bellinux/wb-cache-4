500|$|For example, the {{original}} window system, called 8½, exploited these possibilities as follows. Plan 9 represents the user interface on a terminal {{by means of}} three pseudo-files: , which can be read by a program to get notification of mouse movements and button clicks, , {{which can be used}} to perform textual input/output, and , writing to which enacts graphics operations (see bit blit). The window system multiplexes these devices: when creating a new window to run some program in, it first sets up a new namespace in which , [...] and [...] are connected to itself, hiding the actual device files to which it itself has access. The window system thus receives all input and output commands from the program and handles these appropriately, by sending output to the actual <b>screen</b> <b>device</b> and giving the currently focused program the keyboard and mouse input. The program does not need to know if it is communicating directly with the operating system's device drivers, or with the window system; it only has to assume that its namespace is set up so that these special files provide the kind of input and accept the kind of messages that it expects.|$|E

DRUID is a project in the 6 th framework programme focussed on establishing guidelines and measures to combat impaired driving. The purpose of task 3. 2 is to evaluate the analytical reliability of {{a limited number of}} promising on-site oral fluid <b>screening</b> <b>devices.</b> This task is closely linked to task 3. 1, the practical evaluation of on-site oral <b>screening</b> <b>devices,</b> since it was necessary to ensure that the findings from both studies were comparable. Hence the devices evaluated in task 3. 2 were selected from only those oral <b>screening</b> <b>devices</b> which were deemed as promising devices in task 3. 1. Further the results of both the practical and analytical evaluation of oral fluid <b>screening</b> <b>devices</b> (tasks 3. 1 and 3. 2 respectively) will serve as input to the cost-benefit analyses of task 3. 3 “Cost-benefit analyses”.

50|$|Handwriting {{recognition}} (or HWR) is {{the ability}} of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens and other devices. It allows users to use a touch <b>screen</b> <b>device</b> much like a notepad on which they can write without the need for a keyboard, and the software finds the closest match in its symbol database to replace the handwritten letters with. Handwriting recognition primarily uses either optical character recognition which uses an optical scanner to scan the words written by the user to determine the best suitable match, or by using a pen-based computer interface to track the movements of the tip of the pen as the user is writing.|$|E

After this educational embarrassment, the nerds decide to modernize Springfield Elementary School by cutting a massive check directly to Skinner (similar to Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million direct donations to the public schools of Newark, NJ) which enables each student to receive a tablet connected to a school network, replacing the blackboards with a giant touch <b>screen</b> <b>device</b> and even building a 3D printing lab.|$|E

50|$|The {{design by}} Wilson had {{elements}} of both the Mark I and the Whippet: a similar but smaller tracked rhomboid chassis of the former and fixed turret like the latter. A novel feature was the separate compartment in the back, housing the 100 hp (75 kW) engine (a four-cylinder shortened Ricardo design) and behind it the epicyclic transmission. Two fuel tanks at the back held 85 imperial gallons (386 L) of petrol. Other innovations were the ability to lay a smoke screen {{and the use of}} sloped armour {{in the front of the}} hull. The smoke <b>screen</b> <b>device</b> consisted of a sulphonic acid reservoir located over the exhaust pipe. Armament consisted of a maximum of five machine guns in the superstructure and two in the side doors. These hull doors looked a bit like miniature sponsons. The machine guns were removable and in practice fewer guns would have been taken along, the machine-gunner moving his gun when switching position; most sources give an estimate of four.|$|E

A 2014 survey found that touch screens were the most frequently used object for play among American {{children under the age of}} 12. Touch screen devices were used more often in play than game consoles, board games, puzzles, play vehicles, blocks and dolls/action figures.

As of 2014, nearly two-thirds of American 2- to 10-year-olds have access to a tablet or e-reader. The large use of tablets by adults is as a personal internet-connected TV. A 2015 study found that a third of children under five have their own tablet device.
