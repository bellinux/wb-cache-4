40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of ionic strength and equilibration {{time on the}} appearance of the <b>sub-main</b> transition in fully hydrated multilamellar vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholines has been investigated by means of calorimetry and densitometry. The heat capacity measurements show that the transition enthalpy of the <b>sub-main</b> transition is affected by both salt concentration (KCl) and equilibration time. The small heat capacity peak appearing in vesicles made in pure water is significantly increased upon addition of salt. Furthermore, equilibration of the multilamellar vesicles at low temperatures for several weeks results in a pronounced enhancement of the transition enthalpy of the <b>sub-main</b> transition. Neither salt concentration nor equilibration time affected the transition temperature of the <b>sub-main</b> transition. In the densitometry measurements a small volume change is detectable for high salt concentrations. In order to gain further insight into the physical mechanisms involved in the <b>sub-main</b> transition, a Monte Carlo computer simulation study has been carried out using a microscopic model. The combined experimental and simulation results suggest that the <b>sub-main</b> transition involves an acyl chain disordering of phospholipids in lipid bilayer regions that are characterized by a locally decreased lateral pressure most likely caused by a curvature stress...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{land use}} policy and {{agricultural}} water management were analyzed in Africa {{within the past}} half of century. Number of 18 indices (as the main and <b>sub-main</b> indices) were selected to assess land use policy and agricultural water management based on their importance and other indices were not studied {{due to lack of}} adequate data. The changes of the main indices in 2011 showed that they had similar values in some regions and had very different values in other regions due to nature of the indices and conditions of the countries. In the next step, the land use policy index was estimated using the other main indices. Using the obtained functions, not only the mentioned index in any year (with a relative error < 20  %) was estimated, but also the importance of each index for every region was assessed. In addition, the amount of changes of the land use policy index for increase or decrease of each index in future years was predicted. The prioritization of the main indices showed that permanent crops to cultivated area, HDI, and value added to GDP by agriculture significantly affect the estimation of the land use policy index. The classification of the countries based on the main indices showed that Egypt had a better desirability of condition for land use policy and agricultural water management than the other countries. Evaluation of the trend of the main indices shows that increasing slope of land use policy index (due to decrease of rural development, labour force and value added to GDP by agriculture) was less than increasing slope of HDI and even water deficit (difference between NRI and irrigation water requirement) did not encourage governments and/or farmers for considerable increase in irrigation systems. Study of the <b>sub-main</b> indices showed that although status of pressurized irrigation was increasing, value of conservation agriculture area was not desirable. The results indicated that try and error policies should be avoided and expert comments be applied to the irrigation systems for any crop. The analysis of land use policy and agricultural water management for Africa in the past half of century provided a list of strengths and weaknesses. However, the only way to meet sustainable development is use of the past experiences to view bright horizons for future of land use policy and agricultural water management.|$|E

We utilize deep MIPS imaging and a mass-limited sample of 85 spectroscopic members to identify 16 24 {$μ$}m bright sources within the cluster, and measure their 24 {$μ$}m star formation rates (SFRs) down to ~{} 6 M $_{⊙}$ yr$^{- 1 }$. Based on their line-of-sight velocities and stellar ages, MIPS cluster members {{appear to be an}} infalling population that was recently accreted from the field with minimal environmental dependency on their star formation. However, we identify a double-sequenced distribution of star-forming galaxies among the members, with one branch exhibiting declining specific SFRs with mass. The members along this <b>sub-main</b> sequence contain spectral features suggestive of passive galaxies. Using caustic diagrams, we kinematically identify these galaxies as a virialized and/or backsplash population. Moreover, we find a mix of dynamical histories at all projected radii, indicating that standard definitions of environment (i. e., radius and density) are contaminated with recently accreted interlopers, which could contribute to a lack of environmental trends for star-forming galaxies. A cleaner narrative of their dynamical past begins to unfold when using a proxy for accretion histories through profiles of constant (r/r $_{ 200 }$) {	imes} ({$Delta$}v/{$σ$}$_{ v }$); galaxies accreted at earlier times possess lower values of (r/r $_{ 200 }$) {	imes} ({$Delta$}v/{$σ$}$_{ v }$) with minimal contamination from the distinct infalling population.

30|$|According to Fig.  14, {{variations}} of permanent crops to cultivated area {{and percentage of}} total cultivated area drained were not significant {{and the value of}} NRI was variable during the previous half of century due to many different factors such as greenhouse gases (Sauerborn et al. 1999), global warming (Michaels 1990), climate change (Muzik 2002), etc. However, trend of rural population to total population, total economically active population in agriculture to total economically active population, and value added to GDP by agriculture were declining. In the first two decades (1962 – 1982), the difference between rural development and labor force was significant hence; value added to GDP by agriculture was decreased. From 1982 to 1997, values of rural population to total population and total economically active population in agriculture to total economically active population were close together hence; value added to GDP by agriculture was almost constant. From 1997 to 2011, the difference between rural development and labor force was declining again hence; value added to GDP by agriculture was also decreased. Thus, slope of land use policy index was less than slope of HDI and water deficit (difference between NRI and irrigation water requirement) did not encourage governments and/or farmers to increase irrigation systems. It is a big warning for developing countries (Hussain 2007). Although mechanization and use of new technologies have an important role in enhancement of agricultural knowledge and increasing productivity (Kirpich et al. 1999), labour force has a vital and irreplaceable role in agricultural scheduling and macroeconomic perspectives (Kuper et al. 2009). However, other parameters as well as probable disadvantages of irrigation systems (the <b>sub-main</b> indices) are also affective on agricultural water management that their comprehensive study is not possible due to limited information in Africa.|$|E
40|$|AbstractModulating the {{relative}} humidity (RH) of the ambient gas {{phase of a}} phospholipid/water sample for modifying the activity of phospholipid-sorbed water [humidity-controlled osmotic stress methods, J. Chem. Phys. 92 (1990) 4519 and J. Phys. Chem. 96 (1992) 446] has opened a new field of research of paramount importance. New types of phase transitions, occurring at specific values of this activity, have been then disclosed. Hence, it is become recognized that this activity, like the temperature T, is an intensive parameter of the thermodynamical state of these samples. This state can be therefore changed (phase transition) either, by modulating T at a given water activity (a given hydration level), or, by modulating the water activity, at a given T. The underlying mechanisms of {{these two types of}} transition differ, especially when they appear as disorderings of fatty chains. In lyotropic transitions, this disordering follows from two thermodynamical laws. First, acting on the activity (the chemical potential) of water external to a phospholipid/water sample, a transbilayer gradient of water chemical potential is created, leading to a transbilayer flux of water (Fick's law). Second, water molecules present within the hydrocarbon region of this phospholipid bilayer interact with phospholipid molecules through their chemical potential (Gibbs–Duhem relation) : the conformational state of fatty chains (the thermodynamical state of the phospholipid molecules) changes. This process is slow, as revealed by osmotic stress time-resolved experiments. In thermal chain-melting transitions, the first rapid step is the disordering of fatty chains of a fraction of phospholipid molecules. It occurs a few degrees before the main transition temperature, Tm, during the pretransition and the <b>sub-main</b> transition. The second step, less rapid, is the redistribution of water molecules between the different parts of the sample, as revealed by T-jump time-resolved experiments. Finally, in lyotropic and thermal transitions, hydration and conformation are linked but the order of anteriority of their change, in each case, is probably not the same. In this review, first, the interactions of phospholipid submolecular fragments and water molecules, in the interfacial and hydrocarbon regions of phospholipid/water multibilayer stacks, will be described. Second, the coupling of the conformational states of phospholipid and water molecules, during thermal and lyotropic transitions, will be demonstrated through examples...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Water {{scarcity}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} problems for crop production. Using drip irrigation as an effective method in the efficient use of water is expanding in arid and semi-arid regions. One of the problems in under pressure irrigation during use of saline, unconventional and waste is emitters clogging. There are several ways to prevent particle deposits in pipes and clogging of emitters. Generally, conventional methods are divided into two categories: physical and chemical methods. In physical method, suspended solids and inorganic materials are removed using particles sediment sand and disc filters. In the chemical method the pH drops by adding acid to water resulting in the dissolution of carbonate sediments. With chlorine handling, organisms (i. e. algae, fungi and bacteria) that are the main causes of biological clogging are destroyed. However, the application of these methods is not successful in all cases. It has been observed that the emitters have gradually become obstructed. Magnetic water is obtained by passing water through permanent magnets or through the electromagnets installed in or on a feed pipeline. When a fluid passes through the magnetized field, its structure and some physical characteristic such as density, salt solution capacity, and deposition ratio of solid particles will be changed. An experimental study showed that a relatively weak magnetic influence increases the viscosity of water and consequently causes stronger hydrogen bonds under the magnetic field. There exist very few documented research projects related to the magnetization of water technology and its application to agricultural issues in general and emitter clogging in drip irrigation method, in particular. This technology is already used in some countries, especially in the Persian Gulf states. This research was designed and implemented aimed at increasing knowledge about the application of magnetic technology and its effects on emitters clogging in the drip irrigation system. Materials and Methods: A field experiment was carried out in 2011 in Gorgan Agricultural Research Station to study emitter clogging in drip irrigation using magnetic, non-magnetic and acidic water under salinity condition. The geographical location of the farm was 36 ° 55 ′ N, 54 ° 25 ′ E and 13. 3 m above mean sea level with annual rainfall 400 - 450 mm. The experiment was laid out with a split plot in a complete randomized block design with three replications. The treatments included three treatments of the management of emitters clogging including, magnetized water (M), non-magnetized water (N) and acidic water (A) plus using three water quality levels namely, well water (S 1), saline waters 7 (S 2) and 14 (S 3) dS m- 1. Two methods were simultaneously used to magnetize water. In the first method, an electromagnet was installed around the <b>sub-main</b> pipe before the flow of water to the laterals. The amount of power required to magnetize the irrigation water was 0. 03 kW-h of electricity per m 3 of water. In the second method, the permanent magnets (ceramic magnets) were installed around the <b>sub-main</b> pipe before the laterals. In the second method the power requirement was 0. 3 Tesla. To assess the emitter clogging, discharge and its variations as a function of time, emission uniformity, uniformity coefficient, and coefficient of variation were estimated and analyzed. Results and Discussion: The results of variance analysis showed that the effect of different irrigation management in irrigation system (N, M and A treatments) and different levels of water quality on all parameters were significant. Statistical comparison showed that in all cases there were no significant differences between magnetized water and non-magnetized water treatments. However, acidic water was statistically different from the two types of water mentioned. Both magnetic and conventional indices were examined in this study. However, no significant difference was observed. But in all cases, using magnetic water is advantageous compared with using non-magnetized water. The overall results have shown that the use of magnetized water in this study, in the non-saline water condition, does not offer a relatively higher advantage compared to the use of non-magnetized water. Conclusion: For saline water, insignificant differences were observed between magnetic and non-magnetic water treatments, however magnetic water was slightly preferable. Most of the indicators that were assessed showed that acid water treatment was significantly different from magnetic and non-magnetic water treatments. Thus, acid water treatment is not preferable. Emitter clogging with increase of time and the salinity level of irrigation water increased; the greatest difference between the treatments occurred in S 3 and the last irrigation treatments. Magnetic water up to salinity level of 7 dS m- 1, had no effect on the flow rate and thus on the emitter clogging. However, when using saline irrigation water and also with the increase of time, emitter clogging in magnetic water treatment was lower compared with non-magnetic treatment.
