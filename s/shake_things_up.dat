500|$|Badler had {{a four-month}} guest {{contract}} with the show and she began filming her first scenes in April which were due to air in June 2010. Badler admitted that filming her first scenes were hard and she [...] "could not get it together". She said [...] "I noticed {{a few of the}} other new people. They all went through the same thing, where you have a day where you just go, 'Wow, I can't seem to function!'". Badler also said that occasionally there were no rehearsals and that it was [...] "very daunting" [...] and challenging. She added that the cast were [...] "really nice" [...] and that she got used to the quick pace of filming. Badler's debut episode aired on 22 June 2010. When Badler was asked if the door would be left open for Diana to return, she said [...] "Oh yes, absolutely. I was contracted for four months and the way that it ended is very {{up in the air and}} I'm sure that they will use me whenever they need to <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> a bit, you know".|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "Saw VI is the thinnest, draggiest, and most tediously preachy of the Saw films. It's {{the first one}} that's more or less {{consumed}} by backstory—which is to say, it's one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks." [...] He said, [...] "If {{your goal is to}} do a quick study for a round of Saw Trivial Pursuit, then this may be the movie for you. If you're looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter, skip this sequel and hope that the producers get their sick act together next time." [...] Rob Nelson of Variety wrote, [...] "Squeezing another pint of blood from its torture-porn corpus, Lionsgate slays again with Saw VI, a film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called 'Saw It Already'. At least the requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition", but added, [...] "Presumably owing to director Kevin Greutert's work as editor of all five previous Saw pics, the film's juggling of chronology is the franchise's best...." [...] Christopher Monfette of IGN Movies rated Saw VI three out of five and wrote that [...] "while Saw VI certainly offers a redemption for the series and the promise of a coming power struggle for Jigsaw's legacy, Saw Ⅶ will no doubt mark the time to either <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> or watch this franchise get the ax".|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Book Job" [...] has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? We {{think it has to}} do with the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays to <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> and give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. Maybe they should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode." [...] He noted that while [...] "the rest of the gags have some thrust to them, [...] cross the line into cute pandering to the audience. Fortunately, they are over in about ten seconds." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott Foundas of Variety {{was less}} {{impressed}} with the film, describing it as [...] "formulaic", though he praised its voice acting and technical artistry: [...] "The tactile, snow-capped Arendelle landscape, including Elsa's ice-castle retreat is Frozens other true marvel, enhanced by 3D and the decision to shoot in widescreen– {{a nod to the}} CinemaScope richness of Sleeping Beauty and Lady and the Tramp... That's almost but not quite enough {{to make up for the}} somewhat slack plotting and the generic nature of the main characters. Neither princess here is a patch on Tangleds babe-in-the-woods Rapunzel, while both Hans and Kristoff are cut from pretty standard-issue hero cloth until a reasonably surprising third-act twist somewhat ups the ante. Only Olaf is unimpeachable: Get this snowman a spinoff feature to call his own." [...] The Seattle Times gave the film two out of four stars, stating that [...] "While it is an often gorgeous film with computer-generated fjords and ice sculptures and castle interiors, the important thing that glues all this stuff together– story– is sadly lacking." [...] Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch also criticized the story as the film's weakest point. Writing on Roger Ebert's website, Christy Lemire gave a mixed review in which she awarded two-and-a-half stars out of four. Lemire praised the visuals and the performance of [...] "Let It Go," [...] as well as the positive messages Frozen sends. However, she referred to the film as [...] "cynical" [...] and criticized it as an [...] "attempt to <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> without shaking them up too much." [...] She also noted the similarity between Elsa and another well-known fictional female who unleashes paranormal powers when agitated, Carrie White.|$|E
2500|$|Science-fiction writer David Brin {{describes}} cyberpunk as [...] "the finest free {{promotion campaign}} ever waged {{on behalf of}} science fiction." [...] It may not have attracted the [...] "real punks," [...] but it did ensnare many new readers, and it provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary critics found alluring. Cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive to academics, argues Brin; in addition, it made science fiction more profitable to Hollywood and to the visual arts generally. Although the [...] "self-important rhetoric and whines of persecution" [...] {{on the part of}} cyberpunk fans were irritating at worst and humorous at best, Brin declares that the [...] "rebels did <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up.</b> We owe them a debt." ...|$|E
5000|$|Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic gave 4/5 to {{the episode}} [...] "...while [...] "Me? Jealous?" [...] once again {{featured}} {{a lot of}} in-fighting, I'm happy to note the sitcom finally <b>shook</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> and took the familial squabbles to new territory." ...|$|R

His officers and opponents had become too used to his propensity for flanking movements; Sherman later wrote {{that he wanted to}} <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> and demonstrate that he was capable of different tactics, if a favorable opportunity arose. [...] With rain and mud rendering movement difficult, Sherman decided to assault Johnston head-on at Kennesaw Mountain, a 1,808-foot ridge that dominated the surrounding countrysideincluding the railroad on which he depended for supplies. [...] Johnston had constructed miles of trenches and fortifications on Kennesaw and nearby hills; Cleburne's Division was ordered to take a position {{in the center of the}} Confederate line.|$|E

The series was written by Derren Litten. The BBC issued a press release saying: [...] "It's 1988 and Young Mr Grace is determined to drag Grace Brothers into, well 1988, but he has a problem on his hands. Mr Humphries, Captain Peacock, Mr Rumbold and Mrs Slocombe all seem to be stuck in another era.

2500|$|Deadline.com's Dominic Patten called Luke Cage [...] "one of {{the most}} {{socially}} relevant and smartest shows {{on the small screen}} you will see this year... Linking to the Greater Marvel Universe with finesse, hip-hop’s alternating swagger and reserve, the zeitgeist, and the iconic legacy of Harlem, the series reaches both back and forward into the culture of heroes and an America looking for a true game-changer." [...] David Milner for Digital Spy also gave positive thoughts on the season, saying [...] "When it's not fulfilling its duties as a Marvel-licensed product, Luke Cage is basically a précis of the last 100 years of African-American history – especially in relation to Harlem itself." [...] Conversely, Milner felt Ali's Cottonmouth was not [...] "as imposing a figure as Daredevils Wilson Fisk and isn't nearly as darkly charismatic as David Tennant's Kilgrave from Jessica Jones." [...] Maureen Ryan of Variety felt Luke Cage [...] "has a more than adequate supply of pleasures", with the cast strong enough to [...] "power" [...] the season [...] "through its rough spots, which include a somewhat clunky pilot and a notable tendency to sprawl". She also felt that [...] "Where the drama tends to stumble is in meandering expositional scenes, which quite often go on too long and drain the show of momentum... when [...] can’t make a long dialogue scene work, the problem is in the writing, not the performances." [...] Merrill Barr, writing for Forbes, called the season [...] "another winner for Marvel and Netflix that shouldn’t be missed," [...] saying, [...] "Arcs are beautifully handled, often taking zigs when a zag is not only expected but often encouraged. Fans of the characters are going to rejoice at the level of quality they are getting with this one after waiting so long for Cage to be realized in live action, and fans of Marvel in general should really enjoy the 70s stylings that <b>shake</b> <b>things</b> <b>up</b> real well." ...|$|E
