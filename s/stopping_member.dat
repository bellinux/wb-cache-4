Thirteen years after its creation, the GAA enacted Rule 21 in 1897, which banned all members of the British Armed Forces and the police from participation; both in Ireland and Great Britain itself.

40|$|In No Equal Justice, I {{examine the}} ways in which race and class disparities have an effect at each stage of the {{criminal}} justice system. Much of the disparity concerns discriminatory police practices. My argument is that the Supreme Court, and our society, have constructed a set of rules that virtually ensure there will be racially disparate prosecution of the criminal law by the police. The way the Court has done that, I suggest, is by creating pockets of discretion that police can use without having to identify any objective, individualized basis for suspicion. When the police are free to act without having to point to an objective, individualized basis for suspicion, they tend to revert to stereotypes. One that they rely upon is the stereotype that 2 ̆ 2 a minority {{is more likely to be}} engaged in crime 2 ̆ 2 and therefore police most frequently <b>stop</b> <b>members</b> of minority groups...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the current}} {{regulatory}} frame in the EU, transmission planning is {{done at the}} national level to maximize national welfare, rather than European welfare. In this paper, we develop a competitive equilibrium model that calculates the impact of this imperfect regulatory framework on the cost of renewable energy. We apply the model to a power system with two interconnected zones, and find that the impact is case specific, but significant. We also find that the negative impact of national transmission planning on the cost of renewable energy is more significant in a state {{of the world in which}} Member States trade renewable energy, but that this negative effect is much smaller than the positive effect of renewable energy trade between Member States. We conclude that the imperfect regulatory framework for transmission investment is a significant cost for renewable energy in the EU, but that it should not <b>stop</b> <b>Member</b> States from trading renewable energy...|$|R
