2500|$|After the {{publication}} of the first volume, Rossiter was asked to run the NSF's program on the History and Philosophy of Science while its director took a year of leave during 1982–1983. In 1983–1984 she was a visiting professor at Harvard, where she continued work on her second volume. Still unable to find a tenure-track position, she applied for the NSF's Visiting Professorships for Women program, and received a one-year appointment to Cornell, which <b>she</b> <b>stretched</b> to two years (1986–1988). Cornell agreed to keep her on for another three years, but her funding was split between three departments including women's studies, agriculture, and history. In many ways, at this stage of her career she felt like some of the women she wrote about, saying [...] "I guess I am like a 78 [...] record in a 33 world".|$|E

6000|$|LOUKA (innocently). Perhaps {{you would}} like some coffee, sir? (<b>She</b> <b>stretches</b> her hand across the table for the coffee pot.) ...|$|R
6000|$|CLEOPATRA (coaxingly). Never mind. To-day {{you are to}} be {{like other}} people: idle, luxurious, and kind. (<b>She</b> <b>stretches</b> her hand to him along the table.) ...|$|R
60|$|Smiling, <b>she</b> <b>stretched</b> out her hand, {{and he held}} it for a moment.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stretched</b> a hand towards him, and {{dropping}} {{her head on}} his bosom, wept.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stretched</b> out {{her arms}} to the shadows and the shadows within the shadow.|$|E
60|$|As he did her bidding, <b>she,</b> <b>stretching</b> up a soft, warm arm round his neck, {{drew his}} face down to hers. His hand closed convulsively on her waist.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You Dynevors don't {{resemble}} my sea-pink. See how <b>she</b> <b>stretches</b> her elegant fringes {{for this}} very unpleasant bit of meat! There! I won't torment you any more; read, and stop my mouth!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do it; do it" [...] (said <b>she,</b> <b>stretching</b> out her neck). [...] "Execute your orders, {{and then}} I shall {{go and see}} my children, my poor children, whom I so much and so tenderly loved." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stretched</b> out her hand, {{and he took}} it, {{his eyes}} all blurred, unable to speak.|$|E
60|$|Miss Kinnaird made {{no reply}} to this; {{but in a}} moment <b>she</b> <b>stretched</b> out a {{pointing}} hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stretched</b> forth {{a hand to}} me. I took it {{and held}} it tight, looking up into her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|ANNYS [She has let {{fall the}} {{flowers on the}} table. She crosses to where GEOFFREY still stands by the desk, his back towards her. <b>She</b> <b>stretches</b> out her hand, touches him. He does not move.] Geoffrey! ...|$|R
60|$|Nemesis is lame, {{but she is}} of colossal stature, {{like the}} gods; and sometimes, while her sword is not yet unsheathed, <b>she</b> <b>stretches</b> out her huge left arm and grasps her victim. The mighty hand is invisible, but the victim totters under the dire clutch.|$|R
5000|$|One day, as Nak is {{preparing}} nam phrik, she drops a lime off the porch. In her haste to retrieve it, <b>she</b> <b>stretches</b> her arm {{to pick it}} up from the ground below. Mak sees it and at last realizes his wife is a ghost. Terrified, he tries {{to find a way to}} flee without alarming her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stretched</b> out {{her hand}} restlessly and {{took one of the}} Russian {{cigarettes}} from a bowl by her side.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stretched</b> it out, white, blue-veined, {{the skin}} fine as satin, the lines graceful and flowing, a round, firm, strong arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stretched</b> out an arm, took {{a volume}} from the {{swinging}} table by her side, {{and threw it}} across to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{good news}} it'll be for him," [...] said Mrs Kelly; [...] "the best he heard since the ould man died.

50|$|Ubasute {{has left}} its mark on Japanese folklore, where it {{forms the basis}} of many legends, poems, and koans. In one Buddhist allegory, a son carries his mother up a {{mountain}} on his back. During the journey, <b>she</b> <b>stretches</b> out her arms, catching the twigs and scattering them in their wake, so that her son {{will be able to}} find the way home.|$|R
6000|$|From {{the brink}} her paws <b>she</b> <b>stretches,</b> [...] Very hands {{as you would}} say! [...] And afflicting moans she fetches, [...] 35 [...] As he breaks the ice away.

60|$|When Judy has {{by these}} means {{set him up}} again in his chair, with a white face and a frosty nose (but still clawing), <b>she</b> <b>stretches</b> out her weazen {{forefinger}} and gives Mr. George one poke in the back. The trooper raising his head, she makes another poke at her esteemed grandfather, and having thus brought them together, stares rigidly at the fire.|$|R
5000|$|Carol Otis Hurst {{writing for}} Teaching K-8 Magazine said, [...] "The fantasy must be {{grounded}} in reality {{in order for}} us to [...] "get into it". Sometimes the author accomplishes this with attention to detail, sometimes by showing us the real world that surrounds the magic, sometimes by giving us very believable characters. Which techniques did Elizabeth Winthrop use? When, if ever, did <b>she</b> <b>stretch</b> your credulity too far?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And so behold him {{following}} the tail [...] Of that mud-hovel of his slowly-rambling spouse, [...] Like some unhappy bull {{at the tail}} of a cow, [...] But with more than bovine, grim, earth-dank [...] persistence, [...] Suddenly seizing the ugly ankle as <b>she</b> <b>stretches</b> [...] out to walk, [...] Roaming over the sods, [...] Or, if it happen to show, at her pointed, heavy tail [...] Beneath the low-dropping back-board of her shell.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stretched</b> out the {{arm with}} which she had {{shielded}} herself, and as she went on, pointed at the object of her anger.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his review}} for Allmusic, critic Ronnie D. Lankford {{wrote of the}} album, [...] "While it might be hard for a post-millennium roots fan to understand, Odetta—in her heyday—was the kind of folk artist who drove purists crazy... even at her most {{experimental}} she can hardly {{be compared to the}} Kingston Trio or the Limeliters. My Eyes Have Seen is a nice portrait of a performer bucking conformity as <b>she</b> <b>stretches</b> her artistic legs a bit.." ...|$|R
6000|$|ZOE: (Her head perched {{aside in}} mock pride) Is {{that the way}} to hand the pot to a lady? (<b>She</b> <b>stretches</b> up to light the {{cigarette}} over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beautyspot of my behind? ...|$|R
