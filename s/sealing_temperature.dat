The CNT film annealed at 400 °C in air contains less amorphous carbon phase, and shows better field emission properties comparing to the as-grown CNT film. Annealing at 450 °C causes serious oxidative damage along the tube walls, resulting in the poor field emission performance. The CNTs annealed at 500 °C are all burned out.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} heat <b>sealing</b> <b>temperature,</b> time, and {{pressure}} on the heat sealing strength of five commercially available packaging films has been evaluated {{in order to obtain}} the strongest peelable seal for ‘easy-open ’ packaging applications. The mechanical and physical properties of the seal are evaluated. An innovative method and technique to measure the heat sealing properties of different packaging materials is outlined. Inflection points on the temperature– time sealing profile were obtained and determined to be equivalent to the fusion temperature. The fusion temperatures correlated well with the highest peel strength of seals made at the experimentally determined temperatures. The highest peel seal strength has been achieved at a temperature near the fusion point, but below the melting point. The seals made above the fusion point result in weld seals.

One of the hurdles {{in the use of}} edible packaging for moisture rich foods is its ability to successfully seal the package, which is critical due to the lower strength and elastic characteristics of edible films compared to plastic based films. Three important sealing parameters, namely, adhesive concentration, pressure, and temperature during sealing, were investigated to assess sealing performance of the edible film. The edible film was prepared from blend of three polymers (sodium alginate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and gelatin) based on previous research work.

40|$|The {{heat sealing}} {{behavior}} of novel polyethylene-based nanocomposite films was investigated, as they re-late to flexible packaging of fresh-cut vegetables, processed foods and biomedical devices. Appropriately designed sealant nanocomposites, which include dispersed montmorillonite nanofillers and ethyl vinyl ac-etate copolymer, produce a hermetic but peelable heat seal across a broad, 30 – 40 ◦C, range of heat sealing temperatures, outperforming optimized commercial polyethylene-based sealants that achieve peelable seals {{in a much}} narrower heat <b>sealing</b> <b>temperature</b> range, of less than 15 ◦C. Appropriate nanocomposite design leads to a general easy-open/peelable character of heat seals, which is: (a) independent of sealing conditions and apparatus — ranging from long dwell times at very high sealing pressures to very short heat impulses at very low sealing pressures; (b) markedly independent of {{the opposite side of}} the heat seal — for example, when sealed on itself, on unfilled sealant, or on high density polyethylene; and (c) rather insensitive to for-mulation variations of the sealant — for example, variations of the polyethylene of the ethyl vinyl acetate type and concentration, and of nanofiller loading.

The X- 38 control surfaces require high <b>temperature</b> <b>seals</b> to limit hot gas ingestion and transfer of heat to underlying low-temperature structures to prevent over-temperature of these structures and possible loss of the vehicle. This paper presents results for thermal analyses and flow and compression tests conducted on as-received and thermally exposed seals for the rudder/fin location of the X- 38. A thermal analysis of the rudder/fin dual seal assembly based on representative heating rates on the windward surface of the rudder/fin area predicted a peak <b>seal</b> <b>temperature</b> of 1900 F. The temperature-exposed seals were heated in a compressed state at 1900 F corresponding to the predicted peak temperature. Room temperature compression tests were performed to determine load versus linear compression, preload, contact area, stiffness, and resiliency characteristics for the as-received and temperature-exposed <b>seals.</b> <b>Temperature</b> exposure resulted in permanent set and loss of resiliency in these seals.

40|$|Improper base {{vacuum level}} in any vacuum microelectronic device, {{such as a}} Plasma Display Panel(PDP), will damage the overall {{performance}} of the device due to impurities such as H 2, O 2, CO, CO 2, and N 2. In conventional tubulation packaging technology, the obtainable base vacuum level before plasma gas filling will be very poor because of the pumping conductance limitation for such a large panel size with a small gap of 150 µm, especially due to the barrier ribs inside the PDP panel. The time required to reach any reasonable level will be too long. In this study, we performed the sealing of the two glass plates composing the PDP panel, a plasma gas filling into the panel and a hole-off (named instead of a conventional ‘tip-off’) process, all in a vacuum chamber, called as ‘vacuum in-line sealing’. Several factors related with the heating process of a frit glass were investigated. A prepared frit glass was successfully applied for the vacuum in-line sealing approach without suffering bubbles.

The structure and composition of materials obtained at different levels of platinum dosing into a flame reactor has been determined. The size of the noble metal-containing entities ranged at about 3. 5 - 5. 5 nm.

40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) is {{currently}} storing plutonium {{materials in the}} K-Area Materials Storage (KAMS) facility. The materials are packaged per the DOE 3013 Standard and transported and stored in KAMS in Model 9975 shipping packages, which include double containment vessels sealed with dual O-rings made of Parker Seals compound V 0835 - 75 (based on Viton{reg_sign} GLT). The outer O-ring of each containment vessel is credited for leaktight containment per ANSI N 14. 5. O-ring service life depends on many factors, including the failure criterion, environmental conditions, overall design, fabrication quality and assembly practices. A preliminary life prediction model has been developed for the V 0835 - 75 O-rings in KAMS. The conservative model is based primarily on long-term compression stress relaxation (CSR) experiments and Arrhenius accelerated-aging methodology. For model development purposes, seal lifetime {{is defined as a}} 90 % loss of measurable sealing force. Thus far, CSR experiments have only reached this target level of degradation at temperatures {ge} 300 F. At lower temperatures, relaxation values are more tolerable. Using time-temperature superposition principles, the conservative model predicts a service life of approximately 20 - 25 years at a constant <b>seal</b> <b>temperature</b> of 175 F. This represents a maximum payload package at a constant ambient temperature of 104 F, the highest recorded in KAMS to date. This is considered a highly conservative value as such ambient temperatures are only reached on occasion and for short durations. The presence of fiberboard in the package minimizes the impact of such temperature swings, with many hours to several days required for <b>seal</b> <b>temperatures</b> to respond proportionately. At 85 F ambient, a more realistic but still conservative value, bounding <b>seal</b> <b>temperatures</b> are reduced to {approx} 158 F, with an estimated seal lifetime of {approx} 35 - 45 years. The actual service life for O-rings in a maximum wattage package likely lies higher than the estimates due to the conservative assumptions used for the model. For lower heat loads at similar ambient <b>temperatures,</b> <b>seal</b> lifetime is further increased. The preliminary model is based on several assumptions that require validation with additional experiments and longer exposures at more realistic conditions. The assumption of constant exposure at peak temperature is believed to be conservative. Cumulative damage at more realistic conditions will likely be less severe but is more difficult to assess based on available data. Arrhenius aging behavior is expected, but non-Arrhenius behavior is possible. Validation of Arrhenius behavior is ideally determined from longer tests at temperatures closer to actual service conditions. CSR experiments will therefore continue at lower temperatures to validate the model. Ultrasensitive oxygen consumption analysis {{has been shown to be}} useful in identifying non-Arrhenius behavior within reasonable test periods. Therefore, additional experiments are recommended and planned to validate the model...|$|R
