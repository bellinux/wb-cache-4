40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the inertia tensor governs many instances of haptic perception. However, the evidence is inconclusive because other candidate mechanical parameters (i. e., invariants) were not or were insufficiently controlled for in pertinent experiments. By independently varying all candidate mechanical parameters, the authors were able to test the role of the inertia tensor relative to that of other mechanical parameters. The results showed that length perception during rod wielding is not governed by the inertia tensor alone but also by the <b>static</b> <b>moment.</b> In contrast to previous reports, length perception during rod holding and heaviness perception during rod wielding were found to be unrelated to the inertia tensor and strongly related to the <b>static</b> <b>moment.</b> Humans routinely manipulate objects without looking at them, as when they drive a golf ball from the tee, play the drums, or hoist a pint. In order to perform such activities successfully, one needs to haptically perceive action-relevant object properties, such as an object’s spatial dimensions and weight. In object manipulation, this haptic perception is typically achieved through holding, toss-ing, or wielding the object. In ecological psychology, this form o...|$|E

40|$|Gusset-plate and metal-plated {{connectors}} {{are commonly}} used in joints of upholstered furniture frames due to their high load resistance. To successfully introduce oriented strandboard (OSB) into furniture frames, basic data {{on the performance of}} the joints constructed of OSB members is needed. In this study, out-of-plane <b>static</b> <b>moment</b> capacity and rotational stiffness of T-shaped joints with gusset-plates and metal-plate connectors (MPC) were determined experimentally for different configura- tions. On average, gusset-plate joints exhibited about 80 percent higher out-of-plane <b>static</b> <b>moment</b> capacity than MPC joints. The rotational stiffness of gusset-plate joints without glue was similar to that of MPC joints; however, the stiffness of glued gusset-plate joints was, on average, 70 percent higher. Among MPC joints tested, those with two pairs of 2 - by 6 -in metal plates showed the highest unit resistance. For gusset-plate joints, an increase in length of the gusset plate from 4 to 8 inches increased the moment capacity for both glued and unglued joints, but a further increase of the length did not result in any significant increase in the strength. It can be concluded that for the studied joint geometry, the 8 -in gusset-plate presented the optimum design. Comparisons with previous in-plane bending tests on the joints of the same type and configurations showed that the in-plane moment capacity was 4 to 6 times higher than that out-of-plane.

40|$|The {{identification}} of the rotary and unsteady force derivatives through flight tests is very difficult because {{the sensitivity of the}} force coefficients with respect to spin rate and time derivatives of the aerodynamic angles is quite small in comparison with the variations of the aerodynamic coefficients caused by the angle of attack. Here, to avoid this difficulty, the estimation of these force derivatives through flight measurements, is carried out using an aero- dynamic model based on the Tait-Kirchhoff theorem which provides the ana- lytical expression of each aerodynamic coefficient. The model, which exhibits several free parameters, allows to express the rotary force derivatives in terms of apparent mass tensor and of the <b>static</b> <b>moment</b> derivatives whose iden- tifiability is verified about in nearly the entire flight envelope. The model free parameters are identified using an identification method proposed by the author in a previous work. Thus, the main idea of the present study is that the measurements of the <b>static</b> <b>moment</b> derivatives and the knowledge of the apparent mass tensor lead to an estimation of these force derivatives. The method is here used to identify the aerodynamic coefficients of a self- launching glider. Several flight tests were accomplished, whose results are compared with those obtained by CFD simulations, using a boundary ele- ments code. This comparison shows that the model free parameters -and the unsteady and rotary force derivatives- estimated with the proposed method, are in agreement with the results calculated by the code...|$|E
