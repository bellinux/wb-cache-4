40|$|In {{geophysical}} transient electromagnetics (TEM) measurements with HTS SQUID magnetometers, {{a so-called}} 'frequency dependence' of the stacked time transients on the repetition {{frequency of the}} transmitter, {{and the appearance of}} so-called 'sign reversals', the crossover of the stacked time transients to negative values, have been observed frequently. Recently, we have shown that both of these effects {{can be attributed to the}} summing of remnant responses from earlier transmitted pulses of the repetitive transmitter waveform [1], [2]. Although the step function inductive response for many TEM targets decays monotonically and is positive at all times, instances of sign reversal do occur. We postulate that this sign reversal is due to the typical bipolar waveform of the TEM transmitter and the stacking procedure. In this contribution, we systematically extend our analysis to binary and ternary power-law expressions for the <b>step</b> <b>function</b> <b>response,</b> modeling measured responses for typical ground structures. The conditions are determined under which sign reversals appear.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{large-scale}} mountains on atmospheric variability is studied {{in a series}} of GCM experiments in which a single mountain is varied in height from 0 to 4 km. High-frequency (τ 30 days) variability are largest in the jet exit region, while the intermediate-frequency (7 < τ < 30 days) variability has its maximum upstream of the mountain where it exhibits enhanced equatorward propagation. High and intermediate frequencies change from zonal wave trains to localized wave packets as orographic forcing is increased, but they retain their characteristic scale and frequency. The dominant pattern of low-frequency is variability changes from a zonally symmetric oscillation, for which transient eddy-zonal flow interaction is the dominant mechanism, to a more localized oscillation of the jet downstream of the mountain. The transient eddy forcing still plays a significant role in maintaining the variations of this more localized jet, however. The total amount of wave energy remains almost constant as the mountain height is increased, but the distribution of wave energy shifts from transient to stationary and from high frequencies to low frequencies. Low-frequency variability shows a <b>step</b> <b>function</b> <b>response</b> to orographic forcing in that it shows no response to a 1 -km mountain, increases substantially in response to a 2 -km mountain, and then shows little further increase as the mountain is raised to 3 and 4 km.

40|$|Tunneling based {{field effect}} {{transistors}} (TFETs) {{have the potential}} for very sharp On/Off transitions. This can drastically reduce the power consumption of modern electronics. They can operate by either electrostatically controlling the thickness of the tunneling barrier or by exploiting a sharp step in the density of states for switching. We show that current TFETs rely on controlling the thickness of the tunneling barrier but they do not achieve the desired performance. In order to get better performance we need to also exploit a sharp step in the density of states. In order to have a sharp density of states turn on, a variety of non-idealities need to be accounted for. A number of effects such as thermal vibrations, heavy doping, and trap assisted tunneling are analyzed and engineered. After accounting for the various non-idealities, the ideal density of states will determine the on state characteristics. The nature of the quantum density of states is strongly dependent on dimensionality. Hence we need to specify both the n-side and the p-side dimensionality of pn junctions. For instance, we find that a typical bulk 3 d- 3 d tunneling pn junction has only a quadratic turn-on function, while a pn junction consisting of two overlapping quantum wells (2 d- 2 d) would have the preferred <b>step</b> <b>function</b> <b>response.</b> Quantum confinement on each side of a pn junction has the added benefit of significantly increasing the on-state tunnel conductance at the turn-on threshold.

40|$|Sensory receptors often receive {{strongly}} dynamic, or time varying, inputs {{in their}} natural environments. Characterizing their dynamic properties requires control andmeasurement of the stimulus over a frequency range that equals or exceeds the receptor response. Techniques for dynamic stimulation of olfactory receptors have lagged behind other major sensory modalities because of difficulties in controlling and measuring the concentration of odorants at the receptor.

40|$|During {{aircraft}} design,multiple {{tools are}} utilised {{to inspect the}} performance of the configuration. As the design matures, higher fidelity analyses are conducted to predict the flight dynamics of the aircraft. These analyses are conducted by using semi-empirical relations, numerically analysing flow behaviour, conducting wind-tunnel tests and performing scaled test flights. However, Semi-empirical relations might not hold for next generation aircraft and wind tunnel testing and scaled test flights are extensive and are also prone to accuracy issues. A best of both worlds can be found in numerical analysis. However, an increase in flow fidelity modelling comes with an increase in computational cost. Besides, complete analysis of all possible manoeuvres of a design increases the number of computations significantly. Current methods cope with this issue by using flight dynamics models based on so called stability derivatives, instantaneous values which couple flight state parameters to aerodynamic loads to predict aircraft flight dynamics. However, these models do not take into account time dependency. Therefore, these methods do not accurately predict the flight dynamics of agile aircraft, such as unmanned combat aerial vehicles, undergoing rapid manoeuvres where unsteadiness dominates flow behaviour. This conventional reduced-order modelling method, in which samples of the full-order model are taken in the form of stability derivatives, causes design iterations to be analysed inaccurately. The objective of this report is to investigate reduced-order modelling for flight dynamics prediction, thereby comparing conventional techniques to a method which does take into account unsteadiness in flow behaviour. The method investigated is based on indicial <b>step</b> <b>response</b> <b>functions,</b> which are samples in the form of unsteady aerodynamic flow behaviour functions of the full-order model. The idea is that once these samples are known, any flight manoeuvre can be analysed within minutes. Research found in literature has assessed some of the capabilities and limitations of this method, but not yet applied this to flight dynamics prediction. The research described within this report will address this gap by using two test cases. The first testcase is used to assess the assumptions made in literature, on aerodynamics loads modelling, by applying the method on a two-dimensional airfoil in subsonic flow conditions. It was found that the indicial <b>step</b> <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> are indeed representing the full-order model, thereby taking into account unsteady flow behaviour in aerodynamic loads prediction. In longitudinal motions, the angle of attack and pitch rate effect need {{to be taken into account}} to predict lift, drag and pitching moments. Multiple frequencies of the same manoeuvre can be analysed within minutes once the samples are calculated. Results show that the accuracy of the predictions becomes a trade-off issue between samples calculated and accuracy required. The second testcase is used to apply the indicial <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> to flight dynamics prediction of an agile unmanned bomber aircraft undergoing fast manoeuvres. A longitudinal-directional climbing manoeuvre was calculated by developing a flight dynamics model based on stability derivatives. The flow behaviour encountered during this manoeuvre was analysed to include highly unsteady and non-linear phenomena (e. g. vortices and flow separation) at higher angles of attack. By comparing the results of themethod under investigation to the full-order solutions, it was shown that aerodynamic flight dynamics predictions were accurate in capturing unsteady behaviour and weak non-linear flow behaviour. However, the samples proved to be inaccurate in representing behaviour in highly non-linear regions. Concluding, this means that indicial <b>step</b> <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> provide more accurate flight dynamics predictions than conventional stability derivatives in representing unsteady flow behaviour. The accuracy of the predictions are highly dependent on the samples chosen. Several samples suffice to predict the unsteady behaviour for linear and weak non-linear flow regions of the flightmanoeuvre. If surrogate modelling is applied, the method can become more computational efficient than conducting multiple full-order time-marching numerical calculations. It is recommended that more research is performed on indicial <b>step</b> <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> in capturing highly non-linear flow behaviour, as the research showed that the size of the samples affects the flow behaviour representation.

We investigate the robustness of traditional charts to data correlation when the correlation can be described by an ARMA(1, 1) model. We compare {{the performance of the}} Shewhart chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart to the performance of the Special-Cause Control (SCC) chart and the Common-Cause Control (CCC) chart proposed by Alwan and Roberts (1988), which are designed to account for data correlation. We also explore the possibility of putting limits on the CCC chart, in order to predict quality abnormalities. The measure of performance used is the average run length (ARL). The results show that the ability of the EWMA chart to detect shifts in the process mean is quite robust to data correlation, while the corresponding individuals Shewhart chart rarely detects such shifts more quickly than the other charts. The SCC and CCC charts are shown to be preferred in most cases when a shift in the process mean exceeds 2 standard deviations. The experimental results can aid practitioners in deciding which chart would be most effective at detecting specified shifts in the process mean given the nature of their particular correlated environments. Two methodologies are utilized to explain the relative performance of the SPC charts compared: the dynamic <b>step</b> <b>response</b> <b>function,</b> and <b>response</b> surface methodology.

The derivative of the <b>step</b> <b>function</b> is usually taken to be the Dirac delta function, which is discussed in the next Section: H 0 (x ¡ x 0) · d dx H(x ¡ x 0) = –(x ¡ x 0) : (B. 2) The x dependence of the <b>step</b> and delta <b>functions</b> are shown schematically i...|$|R
