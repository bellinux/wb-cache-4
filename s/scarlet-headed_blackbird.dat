50|$|The <b>scarlet-headed</b> <b>blackbird</b> (Amblyramphus holosericeus) is an icterid bird of {{southern}} South American wetlands.|$|E
50|$|As a result, the aviary {{has many}} {{species that are}} rarely found in other zoos or aviaries, for example, green-backed trogon, <b>scarlet-headed</b> <b>blackbird,</b> and blue-winged {{mountain}} tanager.|$|E
40|$|One hundred eighty {{species in}} a {{preliminary}} inventory were identified. From these, 166 were {{in an area of}} 832. 5 ha (Mata São Francisco State Park), 84 in another of 9. 7 ha (Manoel Júlio de Almeida Municipal Forest) and 99 in the third remnant, briefly sampled, of 218 ha (Mata São Paulo). Comparing these numbers to inventories of nearby sites was considered that the larger area is poor in number of bird species, and believe this to be mainly due to the high degree of environmental degradation. Was considered that the smaller area is rich in birds, but its proximity (375 meters) to the third remnant certainly exeits strong influence. This paper presents the list of birds by site and with their relative frequency of occurrence. A new record for Paraná (<b>Scarlet-headed</b> <b>Blackbird</b> Amblyramphus holosericeus), two new ones for the interior of the state (Uniform Crake Amaurolimnas concolor and Yellow-lored Tody-flycatcher Todirostrum poliocephalum) and several other important records are commented (e. g. Red-legged Seriema Cariama cristata, Vinaceous Parrot Amazona vinacea, and Black-banded Owl Ciccaba huhula). Locally extinct species are discussed (e. g. Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja), as well as the ones that colonized landscapes created by men (e. g. pastures, agricultural areas). When discussing Atlantic Forest endemism, some species were shown not to be endemic to this biome. Because the north of Paraná is almost totally deforested, the presence of the forest remnants by itself conter them great importance for conservation, besides the existence of species endemic to the Atlantic Forest and considered to be under the threat of extinction. Conservation and management measures are also proposed...|$|E
50|$|<b>Scarlet-headed</b> <b>blackbirds</b> are monogamous, and territories {{are grouped}} together. The nest {{is an open}} cup placed in the crotch of a shrub or woven into vegetation, in which they lay two eggs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scarlet-headed</b> <b>blackbirds</b> {{occur in}} pairs in large reed beds in {{southern}} Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northeastern Argentina; Bolivia has an isolated population at altitudes {{up to about}} 600 m. They often perch conspicuously on top of stems. They are uncommon, particularly away from the coast.|$|R
