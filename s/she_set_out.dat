5|$|On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was {{declared}} of {{age at the}} Parlement of Rouen, {{but he was never}} able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government. Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the Edict of Amboise and revive loyalty to the crown. To this end, <b>she</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> with Charles and the court on a progress around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565. Catherine held talks with Jeanne d'Albret, the Protestant queen regnant of Navarre (and the wife of Antoine de Bourbon) at Mâcon and Nérac. She also met her daughter Elisabeth at Bayonne near the Spanish border, amidst lavish court festivities. Philip II excused himself from the occasion. He sent the Duke of Alba to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to the Ministry of War Transport, which renamed her Empire Simba and assigned Andrew Weir & Co. of London to manage her. After spending six weeks at Methil, where she had an advanced ship degaussing system installed among other repairs, Empire Simba proceeded to Oban via Lyness in mid November. <b>She</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> for North America in Convoy OB-253 on 2 December. Four days out, heavy weather dispersed the convoy, and Empire Simba proceeded independently. The ship continued to take a beating from heavy seas which opened the number one cargo hold to the ocean. Because the water was coming in faster than the bilge pumps in the hold number one could pump, the crew cut through the bulkheads into cargo hold number two to double the pumping capacity and were able to keep the ship under control long enough to arrive in Bermuda on 26 December. After temporary repairs were made there, Empire Simba sailed on 6 January 1942 first to Halifax and then to Baltimore for more permanent repairs.|$|E

25|$|In If I'm Lucky (1946), her {{follow-up}} {{film for}} Fox {{when she was}} no longer under contract, Miranda was again fourth on the bill with her stock screen persona firmly in evidence: heavily-accented English, comic malapropisms, and bizarre hairstyles recreating her famous turbans. When Miranda's contract with 20th Century Fox expired on January 1, 1946, she decided to pursue an acting career free of studio constraints. Miranda's ambition was to play a lead role showcasing her comic skills, which <b>she</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do in Copacabana (1947, an independent production for United Artists with Groucho Marx). Although her films were modest hits, critics and the American public did not accept her new image.|$|E
25|$|Olga, who was tradition-conscious {{and deeply}} devout, {{suffered}} a terrible blow when her second son, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich contracted an unequal marriage in San Remo on 26 February 1891. The marriage {{was not only}} morganatic but also illegal under the statute of the Imperial Family and caused a great scandal at the Russian court. Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich was deprived of his military rank and of his position as adjutant at the Imperial Court and also forbidden to return to Russia for life. When Olga heard of her son’s morganatic marriage, she was deeply wounded and fell ill.

Between 18 December 1949 and 14 February 1950 the Gripsholm was rebuilt at Howaldtswerke, Kiel with amongst others new funnels, a new bow and modern navigational equipment. In March 1950 the company placed an order for a new combined cruise ship/ocean liner with De Schelde shipyard at Vlissingen, Netherlands. On 18 January 1951 the Swedish American Line re-commenced cruise service {{for the first time}} since 1941, when the Stockholm embarked on a cruise to the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|When Alice Liddell {{was a young}} woman, <b>she</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> on a grand tour of Europe with Lorina and Edith. One {{story has}} it that she became a romantic {{interest}} of Prince Leopold, the youngest son of Queen Victoria, during the four years he spent at Christ Church, but the evidence for this is sparse. It is true that years later, Leopold named his first child Alice, and acted as godfather to Alice's second son Leopold. (A recent biographer of Leopold suggests {{it is far more}} likely that Alice's sister Edith was the true recipient of Leopold's attention.) Edith died on 26 June 1876, possibly of measles or peritonitis (accounts differ), shortly before she was to be married to Aubrey Harcourt, a cricket player. At her funeral on 30 June 1876, Prince Leopold served as a pall-bearer.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, {{a former}} servant came {{by the house}} and covertly informed them that a refractory priest would be presiding at a secret Mass at a farm in Marsyllis, about ten miles (15km) away. This was the Abbé Andrew Fournet, the underground pastor of Maillé, who would give Bichier a new direction in her life, answering her longings. The following week <b>she</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> at night on a donkey, led by the same former servant, {{to take part in}} the service. After a journey of three hours, they arrived at the site. After the Mass, Fournet began to hear the confessions of the people. As Bichier approached him, the peasants gave way to her, an aristocrat. Fournet challenged Bichier over her presumption and she let him hear the confessions of the entire congregation, going last just as the sun was rising.|$|E

25|$|The cordial {{relationship}} between the two countries extends back to 48AD, when Queen Suro, or Princess Heo, travelled from the kingdom of Ayodhya to Korea. According to the Samguk Yusa, the princess had a dream about a heavenly king who was awaiting heaven's anointed ride. After Princess Heo had the dream, she asked her parents, the king and queen, for permission to set out and seek the man, which the king and queen urged with the belief that god orchestrated the whole fate. Upon approval, <b>she</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> on a boat, carrying gold, silver, a tea plant, and a stone which calmed the waters. Archeologists discovered a stone with two fish kissing each other, a symbol of the Gaya kingdom that is unique to the Mishra royal family in Ayodhya, India. This royal link provides further evidence that there was an active commercial engagements between India and Korea since the queen's arrival to Korea. Current descendants live in the city of Kimhae as well as abroad in America's state of New Jersey and Kentucky. Many of them became prominent and well-known around the world like President Kim Dae Jung, Prime Minister Jong Pil Kim.|$|E
25|$|Home, however, was {{not easily}} reached. Louis and Eleanor, on {{separate}} ships {{due to their}} disagreements, were first attacked in May 1149 by Byzantine ships attempting to capture both on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor. Although they escaped this attempt unharmed, stormy weather drove Eleanor's ship far to the south to the Barbary Coast and caused her to lose track of her husband. Neither was heard of for over two months. In mid-July, Eleanor's ship finally reached Palermo in Sicily, where she discovered {{that she and her}} husband had both been given up for dead. She was given shelter and food by servants of King Roger II of Sicily, until the king eventually reached Calabria, and <b>she</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to meet him there. Later, at King Roger's court in Potenza, she learned of the death of her uncle Raymond, who had been beheaded by Muslim forces in the Holy Land. This news appears to have forced a change of plans, for instead of returning to France from Marseilles, they went to see Pope Eugene III in Tusculum, where he had been driven five months before by a revolt of the Commune of Rome.|$|E
