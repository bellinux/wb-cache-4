5|$|After several {{variants}} were proposed {{but later}} abandoned, some industry observers became <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> new aircraft proposals from Boeing. However, in early 2004, Boeing announced tentative {{plans for the}} 747 Advanced that were eventually adopted. Similar in nature to the 747-X, the stretched 747 Advanced used technology from the 787 to modernize the design and its systems. The 747 remained the largest passenger airliner in service until the Airbus A380 began airline service in 2007.|$|E

Despite these unusual circumstances, Lynette manages to impress Nina's boss, Ed Ferrara (Currie Graham), who hires her on the spot.|$|E

5|$|Seeing no {{alternative}} to avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from the federation. Goh Keng Swee, who had become <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> merger's economic benefits for Singapore, convinced Lee Kuan Yew that the separation had to take place. UMNO and PAP representatives worked out the terms of separation in extreme secrecy in order to present the British government, in particular, with a fait accompli.|$|E
5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., {{he met with}} the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about all the things he had seen. He tried to {{convince}} them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E

5|$|According to FN, the 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} has {{an effective}} range of 200m (219yd) {{and a maximum}} range of 1,800m (1,969yd) when fired from the P90, and an effective range of 50m (55yd) and a maximum range of 1,510m (1,651yd) when fired from the Five-seven. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> the bullet's terminal performance, {{and it is a}} subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E
5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E
5|$|Although {{guarantees}} by {{the league}} and organization indicated a return for 2007–08, many fans in New Orleans were still <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> a permanent return due to {{the popularity of the}} team in Oklahoma City. Meanwhile, the Hornets opened their season in Oklahoma City with a 26-point win over the Sacramento Kings on November 1, 2005. They played their first game in Louisiana in a loss to the Phoenix Suns on December 21, 2005, and they played the first professional sports event in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina on March 8, 2006, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of the orbits of comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. If these orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a declination of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> this analysis, notes that many different forces influence the orbits of comets.|$|E
5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conflicting}} issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's {{relations with}} the Russian Empire. Darejan had been <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, especially after the Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians {{to their own devices}} {{in the face of a}} disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795. The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia.|$|E

40|$|Skeptical theism {{combines}} theism {{with skepticism}} about {{our capacity to}} discern God’s morally sufficient reasons for permitting evil. Proponents have claimed that skeptical theism defeats the evidential argument from evil. Many opponents have objected that it implies untenable moral skepticism, induces appalling moral paralysis, and the like. Recently Daniel Howard-Snyder has tried to rebut this prevalent objection to skeptical theism by rebutting it as an objection to the <b>skeptical</b> part <b>of</b> <b>skeptical</b> theism, which part he labels “Agnosticism” (with an intentionally capital “A”). I argue that his rebuttal fails as a defense of Agnosticism against the objection {{and even more so}} as a defense <b>of</b> <b>skeptical</b> theism...|$|R

5|$|Burton hired Danny Elfman, his {{collaborator}} on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, {{to compose}} the music score. For inspiration, Elfman was given The Dark Knight Returns. Elfman was worried, {{as he had}} never worked on a production this large in budget and scale. In addition, producer Jon Peters was <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> hiring Elfman, but was later convinced {{when he heard the}} opening number. Peters and Peter Guber wanted Prince to write music for the Joker and Michael Jackson to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson's songs together for the entire film score.|$|E
5|$|Charlie {{has barely}} made it into his new flat in London when his father dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy. The factory makes good quality men's shoes, {{but they are not}} stylish and not cheap, and the market for them is drying up. Charlie is {{determined}} to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> the new management.|$|E
5|$|Ebert was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, {{as compared to the}} usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see. Ebert was <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> the recent resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.|$|E

5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> the {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the Solar System, nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the Solar System, might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly {{seen as a}} threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of the architects of the modern synthesis—were extremely <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E
5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and <b>skeptical</b> <b>of</b> its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
