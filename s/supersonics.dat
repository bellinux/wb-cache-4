5|$|He was {{inducted}} into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975. Russell, who had a difficult relationship with the media, did not attend either event. After retiring as a player, Russell had stints as head coach of the Seattle <b>SuperSonics</b> (1973 to 1977) and Sacramento Kings (1987 to 1988). His time as a non-player coach was lackluster; although he led the struggling <b>SuperSonics</b> into the playoffs {{for the first time in}} franchise history, Russell's defensive, team-oriented Celtics mindset did not mesh well with the team, and he left in 1977 with a 162–166 record. Russell's stint with the Kings was considerably shorter, his last assignment ending when the Kings went 17–41 to begin the 1987–88 season.|$|E

50|$|In <b>supersonic</b> flight (Mach numbers {{greater than}} 1.0), wave drag {{is the result}} of shockwaves present in the fluid and {{attached}} to the body, typically oblique shockwaves formed at the leading and trailing edges of the body. In highly <b>supersonic</b> flows, or in bodies with turning angles sufficiently large, unattached shockwaves, or bow waves will instead form. Additionally, local areas of transonic flow behind the initial shockwave may occur at lower <b>supersonic</b> speeds, and can lead to the development of additional, smaller shockwaves present on the surfaces of other lifting bodies, similar to those found in transonic flows. In <b>supersonic</b> flow regimes, wave drag is commonly separated into two components, <b>supersonic</b> lift-dependent wave drag and <b>supersonic</b> volume-dependent wave drag.|$|R

5|$|In retrospect, Don Nelson, who {{had once}} coached the Bucks, had an {{outstanding}} trade instinct, essentially trading future career underachievers Traylor and Garrity for two future NBA MVPs in Nowitzki and Nash; in addition, the new recruits quickly became close friends. Nowitzki became only the fourth German player in NBA history, following pivots Uwe Blab and Christian Welp and All-Star swingman Detlef Schrempf, who was a 35-year-old veteran of the Seattle <b>SuperSonics</b> when his young compatriot arrived. Nowitzki finished his DJK career as the only Würzburg player to have ever made the NBA.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1991–92 season, with the Rockets' record only 26–26, Chaney was fired and {{replaced}} by his assistant Rudy Tomjanovich, a former Houston player himself. While the Rockets {{did not make the}} playoffs, Tomjanovich's arrival was considered a step forward. In the next year, the Rockets improved their record by 13 games, getting the Midwest Division title, and winning their first playoff series in 6 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers, before an elimination by the <b>SuperSonics</b> in a closely contested Game 7 overtime loss.|$|E
