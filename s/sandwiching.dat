The eastbound lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway, <b>sandwiching</b> it between the E. C Row Expressway. Ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area.|$|E

50|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety of fish <b>sandwiches</b> in their product portfolio since 1975. The Whaler <b>sandwich</b> was the first iteration, designed to compete with rival burger-chain McDonald's Filet-O-Fish <b>sandwich.</b> With {{the addition of the}} company's Specialty <b>Sandwich</b> line in 1978, the <b>sandwich</b> was reformulated as the Long Fish <b>sandwich.</b> With the discontinuation of the Specialty <b>Sandwich</b> line, the <b>sandwich</b> was returned to its original recipe and name. With the introduction of the company's BK Broiler chicken <b>sandwich</b> in 1990, the fish <b>sandwich</b> became tied to the development cycle of the broiled chicken <b>sandwich</b> and was again reformulated and renamed as the Ocean Catch Fish fillet. When the broiled chicken <b>sandwich</b> underwent another reformulation in 2002, the fish <b>sandwich</b> was also redone and renamed as the BK Big Fish <b>sandwich.</b> By 2015, the <b>sandwich</b> had undergone several more modifications and went through a series of names including the BK Fish and Premium Alaskan fish <b>sandwich.</b> It is currently sold as the BK Big Fish <b>sandwich</b> in the United States and Canada. Internationally the fish <b>sandwich</b> is also known as the BK Fish, BK Fish'n Crisp burger and Fish Royale in those markets.|$|R

25|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{nature of}} ferroelectric materials {{can be used}} to make capacitors with tunable capacitance. Typically, a ferroelectric capacitor simply consists of a pair of electrodes <b>sandwiching</b> a layer of ferroelectric material. The permittivity of ferroelectrics is not only tunable but commonly also very high in absolute value, especially when close to the phase transition temperature. Because of this, ferroelectric capacitors are small in physical size compared to dielectric (non-tunable) capacitors of similar capacitance.|$|E

25|$|In {{a typical}} wooden sailboat, the hull is {{constructed}} of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often {{referred to as}} ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a keel. In fiberglass or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent, or be of a monocoque arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by <b>sandwiching</b> thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, balsa wood, impregnated paper honeycomb or other material.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Sandwich</b> bread (also {{referred}} to as <b>sandwich</b> loaf) is bread that is prepared specifically {{to be used for}} the preparation of <b>sandwiches.</b> <b>Sandwich</b> breads are produced in many varieties, such as white, whole wheat, sourdough, rye, multigrain and others. <b>Sandwich</b> bread may be formulated to slice easily, cleanly or uniformly, and may have a fine crumb (the soft, inner part of bread) and a light texture. <b>Sandwich</b> bread may be designed to have a balanced proportion of crumb and crust, whereby the bread holds and supports fillings in place and reduces drips and messiness. Some may be designed to not become crumbly, hardened, dried or have too squishy a texture. <b>Sandwich</b> bread can refer to cross-sectionally square, sliced white and wheat bread, which has been described as [...] "perfectly designed for holding square luncheon meat". The bread used for preparing finger <b>sandwiches</b> is sometimes {{referred to}} as <b>sandwich</b> bread. Pan de mie is a <b>sandwich</b> loaf. Some <b>sandwich</b> breads are designed for use in the creation of specific types of <b>sandwiches,</b> such as the submarine <b>sandwich.</b> For barbecuing, use of a high-quality white <b>sandwich</b> bread has been described as suitable for toasting over a fire.

A disadvantage is that, unlike the Čech complex, the Vietoris–Rips complex does not directly provide information about gaps in communication coverage, but this flaw can be ameliorated by <b>sandwiching</b> the Čech complex between two Vietoris–Rips complexes for different values of δ.|$|E
25|$|HMS Penn, with Dales still aboard, was one {{of several}} British destroyers that came {{alongside}} the Ohio to render assistance. The crews made attempts to tow the crippled tanker, before eventually <b>sandwiching</b> it between HMS Penn and HMS Bramham in order to drag it along while preventing it from sinking. Seeing that one of the Ohios anti-aircraft guns could be repaired, another survivor from the Santa Elisa, junior third officer Frederick August Larsen, boarded the ship.

25|$|Traditional jian blades {{are usually}} of sanmei (three plate) construction, which {{involved}} <b>sandwiching</b> {{a core of}} hard steel between two plates of softer steel. The central plate protrudes slightly from its surrounding pieces, allowing for a sharp edge, while the softer spine protects the brittle core. Some blades had wumei or five plate construction, with two more soft plates being used at the central ridge. Bronze jian were often made in a somewhat similar manner: in this case an alloy with a high copper content {{would be used to}} make a resilient core and spine, while the edge would be made from a high-tin-content alloy for sharpness and welded onto the rest of the blade.|$|E

25|$|The window, {{designed}} and installed by the Blum Art Company of Louisville in 1883, depicts the crowning of the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven. It {{is one of}} the oldest American-made stained glass windows. This window, in the early half of the 20th century had been moved to the front of the tower, with a new Assumption window replacing it. During restoration, the windows were switched to place the Coronation window in its original place in the sanctuary. It was in this crane-operated delicate process that the building was cracked, temporarily halting all work. Conrad Schmitt Studios conserved the historic glass and restored the original appearance of the windows by painting the missing artwork on 2mm slide glass and <b>sandwiching</b> them to the conserved glass before re-leading.|$|E

25|$|Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) {{have gained}} {{a lot of}} {{attention}} because they are much less susceptible to development of microbial resistance. Other antibiotics may be susceptible to bacterial resistance, like multi-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which is known as a common relic in the healthcare industry while other bacterial strains have become more of a concern for waste water treatment in local rivers or bays. AMPs can be functionalized onto a surface by either chemical or physical attachment. AMPs can be physically attached by using oppositely charged polymeric layers and <b>sandwiching</b> the polypeptide between them. This may be repeated to achieve multiple layers of AMPs for the recurring antibacterial activity. There are, however, a few drawbacks to this mechanism. Assembly thickness and polymer-peptide interactions can affect the diffusion of peptide to bacterial contact. Further research should be carried out to determine the effectiveness of the adsorption technique. However, they chemical attachment of AMPs is also widely studied.|$|E
