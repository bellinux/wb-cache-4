Existing solutions rely on specialized APIs or XPath querying tools and are therefore not easily accessible to non technical end users. In this paper we describe our new comprehensive, non-XPath integration platform which allows end users to extract web page fragments using a simple query-by-example approach and then to combine these fragments into custom, integrated web pages.

2500|$|In 1842 the Rev John Stevens Henslow, a {{professor}} of Botany at St John's College, Cambridge, discovered coprolites just outside Felixstowe in Suffolk in the villages of Trimley St Martin, Falkenham and Kirton and investigated their composition. Realising their potential {{as a source of}} available phosphate once they had been treated with sulphuric acid, he patented an extraction process and set about finding new sources. [...] Very soon, coprolites were being mined on an industrial scale for use as fertiliser due to their high phosphate content. The major <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> occurred over the east of England, centred on Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely with its refining being carried out in Ipswich by the Fison Company. There is a Coprolite Street near Ipswich docks where the Fisons works once stood. The industry declined in the 1880s but was revived briefly during the First World War to provide phosphates for munitions. A renewed interest in coprolite mining in the First World War extended the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> interest into parts of Buckinghamshire as far west as Woburn Sands.|$|R

40|$|Recent (2007) {{developments}} in automated integration of vector geospatial data with image data combine techniques for extracting point features from image data with algorithms that match point features between data layers. The {{precision and accuracy}} of an image-extracted point feature depend on various factors related to the feature extraction technique and {{to the quality of}} the image in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction.</b> Furthermore, the precision and accuracy of image-extracted points affect the reliability of the subsequent process for matching points between layers, and consequently, the overall adequacy of the data integration approach. Several approaches for detecting and removing improperly matched points are available. The USGS is investigating the use of a weighted affine transformation to filter point matches during automated integration of vector roads with images. The transformation is applied to a local <b>area</b> <b>of</b> match points to detect probable blunders and remove them from the rubber-sheeting algorithm. Aside from blunder detection capabilities, advantages of this approach include the ability to weight control coordinates relative to estimated precisions of extracted point features, and the ability to estimate the precision of the integrated vector layer through error propagation...|$|R

40|$|Context: The {{prediction}} of implant treatment is directly {{influenced by the}} quality of the remaining bone after tooth extraction. Aims : The purpose of this experimental study was to, histologically and histometrically, evaluate the bone repair process in the central <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> sockets filled with platelet-rich plasma. Materials and Methods: Four young adult male Cebus apella monkeys were used. The <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> both right and left inferior second premolars was accomplished. After <b>extraction,</b> in one <b>of</b> the <b>extraction</b> sockets, coagulum was maintained while in the other it was removed; the alveolus was dried with gauze compress and filled up with platelet concentrate. For PRP production, Sonnleitner&#x 2032;s protocol was followed. The specimens for histological and histometric assessment were obtained in 30, 90, 120 and 180 days intervals. Results: In 30 days new bone formation was intense in both experimental and control sockets and no significant differences were observed between the two groups. After 90 days <b>of</b> the <b>extraction,</b> while the control group showed signs of decrease in osteogenesis, in the experimental unit, the process of bone formation and fibroblast-like cell proliferation remained intense. After 120 days, the PRP treated socket was occupied by large trabeculae of bone. After 180 days, the control unit was occupied mostly with bone marrow. The experimental unit remained occupied with large amounts of bone tissue. Conclusions: It was possible to conclude that bone repair was enhanced by the use of platelet- rich plasma in alveolar sockets...|$|R
