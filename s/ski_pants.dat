50|$|Smith, {{a natural}} showman, was always {{popular with the}} crowds, for his muscular physique, love of surfing and his {{eye-catching}} dress sense - he famously competed in cranberry-colored, psychedelic <b>ski</b> <b>pants.</b>|$|E
50|$|A ski jacket {{covers the}} arms and torso, {{sometimes}} just to the waist while other times reaching down over the buttocks. It can be a separate item or part of a two-piece ski suit together with matching <b>ski</b> <b>pants.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} gear configuration {{with the main}} gear legs of sprung steel and brakes are standard equipment. Wheel <b>pants,</b> <b>skis</b> and pontoons were optional.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ski</b> <b>pants,</b> or salopettes, when {{part of a}} two-piece ski suit, {{is usually}} made in the same fabric and color as the {{corresponding}} ski jacket. It is sometimes {{in the form of}} bib-and-brace and the jacket is worn over it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} of even one woman involved extra planning for equipment, accommodation and bathroom facilities. Lane Walker Rudkin, a local clothing manufacturer, gave her woollen jerseys and <b>ski</b> <b>pants,</b> {{as well as}} “two pairs of special long-johns in the finest of creamy white wool”, so she didn't have to wear men’s ones.|$|E
50|$|Ellesse grew in {{popularity}} during the 1970s {{as a producer}} of skiwear such as quilted jackets and <b>ski</b> <b>pants.</b> In 1979, Ellesse's Jet Pant, a ski pant featuring padded knees and a wide lower leg to fit around a ski boot, was included in an event at the Pompidou Centre in Paris celebrating Italian design.|$|E
5000|$|The {{forerunner of}} the company, a men's retail store called Ishimoto Shoten, {{was founded in}} 1935. It started {{developing}} skiwear in 1954, and registered the Descente trademark in 1961. The [...] "Demopants" [...] <b>ski</b> <b>pants</b> style was launched in 1974, followed in 1979 by the [...] "Magic Suit". A wearable heating system called the [...] "Mobile Thermo" [...] jacket was introduced in 1998.|$|E
50|$|Another early {{woman was}} Lucille Brinkman {{who was one}} of the first girls to do all of her degree work at Michigan College of Mines. Lucille’s brother helped her though school and later gave an {{interview}} about her to the Daily Mining Gazette. He said that his sister had to endure a lot of abuse from the other students and even her professors. One story he told was one day she went to class dressed in <b>ski</b> <b>pants</b> because she didn’t have enough time to change before her class started. At one point during the lecture the professor began to tell filthy stories about his or his friends experiences with women. When the professor realized that there was a woman in his class he told Lucille that “this is an engineering school and absolutely no place for a woman.” The professor later said if she had worn a dress and not <b>ski</b> <b>pants</b> he would have been aware of her presence and would not had told those stories.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 four {{designs were}} {{introduced}} that all {{rose to a}} point just under the knee. They were normal ski boots below, but used an extended tongue that fastened around the upper leg {{using a variety of}} methods. They offered much greater edging control, and were quickly copied by many other companies. They all disappeared by 1983, a victim largely of fashion - <b>ski</b> <b>pants</b> wouldn't fit over them. None are produced today.|$|E
5000|$|Established in 1956 to make high-altitude balloons, Raven was {{launched}} {{by a group}} of General Mills employees, including General Mills High Altitude Research division employee Ed Yost. [...] After its establishment, the company's product offerings expanded to include items such as commercial and recreational hot air balloons, large plastic storage containers for use in agriculture, and <b>ski</b> <b>pants.</b> The U.S. military and other government agencies are among its clients, and besides the U.S. Department of Defense, Raven Industries has other big name customers such as Google.|$|E
50|$|The {{truth is}} told through flashbacks, when Stephanie {{is on the}} ski trip at her school, (none of her friends know of her pregnancy; and she doesn't reveal it to anyone) she begins to go into labour and {{makes it to the}} bathroom, where she quietly but painfully {{delivers}} the child on her own, and it is revealed through Lydie's explanation that the baby fell into the leg of Stephanie's <b>ski</b> <b>pants.</b> Stephanie says she wrapped the baby in toilet paper and left it there, but still maintains she was dead.|$|E
50|$|Arriving in New York {{with the}} wave of European artists during World War II, Rogers-Altmann gravitated to {{painters}} of the New York School. She quickly established herself as a leading skiwear designer. Beginning her fashion career as a stylist with Herzmansky, Vienna's largest department store, she subsequently launched Bloomingdale's first skiwear center, introduced to America a never-before-seen stretch fabric for <b>ski</b> <b>pants</b> she discovered while in Paris, designed the first ski jacket that had a concealed hood built into the collar in 1938, and in 1951 founded Ruth Rogers Enterprises (RRE), a management consulting service for apparel manufacturers specializing in design and styling.|$|E
5000|$|The Women's Division uniform {{was based}} on the British WAAF uniform.

5000|$|Following {{his stay}} as a POW during World War II, Bogner Sr. {{returned}} to his business in 1947. Two of his innovations were the first stretch <b>ski</b> <b>pants</b> in 1948 which were modeled {{by the likes of}} Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, and Ingrid Bergman, and the tip-top hat in 1955. The American women's ski team even used his clothing line when they complained that their own American-made clothes were improperly fitted on them at the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo. In 1933, he participated together with Matthias Wörndle and Gustav [...] "Gustl" [...] Müller at the first Trofeo Mezzalama event, where they placed third.|$|E
50|$|During the Vietnam War, Australia {{was one of}} the {{destinations}} soldiers {{could pick}} for a week-long R & R. At the Sydney airport the USO had different activities that could be chosen if the soldier wished. One option was skiing at Thredbo at a reduced rate. The package included round trip transportation (part by air, part bus), and for each night of lodging, breakfast and dinner, equipment, a group lesson, and a lift ticket. Also included were gloves, <b>ski</b> <b>pants,</b> and a warm jacket; soldiers in Vietnam didn't have any of that so needed it all to be furnished. At {{the end of the season}} mats were placed on the lower slopes enabling one to ski to the bottom.|$|E
50|$|Later that evening, Tanner strangled McLean, then {{forced her}} head face down and tied a {{ligature}} around her neck. In his confession, Tanner told detectives {{that he spent}} several hours looking for a hiding place for {{the body in the}} house. It took police searchers seventeen days to locate the body hidden in an eight-inch-high gap at the back of a cupboard under the stairs, crammed with household junk. After emptying the cupboard's contents, Tanner had dragged McLean's body, clothed in <b>ski</b> <b>pants</b> and a T-shirt, from the adjacent bedroom, along the hall, and into the recess under the floor. He then crawled along under the hallway to hide the body under the floorboards of her bedroom.|$|E
50|$|After the {{successful}} introduction of race sweaters, Jacobs added <b>ski</b> <b>pants</b> to the catalog offering. One {{of the earliest}} creations was a navy blue racing pant with yellow striped pads extending from the knee to the hip. His son Billy mentioned that skiers were calling them “spider” pants, due to their spider leg-like appearance. Jacobs recognized {{this as an opportunity}} to have a powerful, lasting name and logo associated with his products, and renamed the company. A passionate sports car fan, he borrowed the spelling with a “y” from the Ferrari Spyder. The early mail order catalogs included race pants, padded sweaters, Vuarnet sunglasses, bent downhill poles and other racing accessories. For two years, Spyder operated out of Jacobs' kitchen. At the end of two years, sales were in the six figures and his kitchen was too crowded.|$|E
50|$|A ski suit {{can either}} be one-piece, {{in the form of}} a jumpsuit, or two-piece, {{in the form of a}} ski jacket and {{matching}} trousers, called salopettes or <b>ski</b> <b>pants.</b> A ski suit is made from wind- and water-resistant or waterproof fabric, and has a non-removable liner made of nylon, silk, cotton or taffeta. Its main function is to keep a person warm while participating in winter sports, especially Nordic (cross-country) or Alpine (down-hill) skiing. It is generally a unisex garment. A ski suit is meant to be worn with a base layer, which consists of long johns and a warm shirt, usually designed for skiing. Ski suits are often made of Gore-Tex or similar materials. They are often in the form of a shell suit, to which the skier adds more or less warm underwear depending on the weather. Pockets are usually made to be waterproof, so items put in them should stay dry.|$|E
5000|$|Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} aggregator, reports that 62% of 89 {{surveyed}} critics {{gave it a}} positive review, and the average rating was 5.8/10; the site's consensus is: [...] "Writer/director Adam Green has the beginnings of an inventive, frightening yarn in Frozen, but neither the script nor the cast are quite strong enough to truly do it justice." [...] Critic Richard Roeper called the film [...] "an entertaining, suspense-filled, sometimes wonderfully grotesque little scarefest", though The Hollywood Reporter commented that it [...] "is not written, directed, or acted well {{enough to be a}} first-rate thriller". [...] Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times made it a NYT Critics' Pick and wrote, [...] "A minimalist setup delivers maximum fright in Frozen, a nifty little chiller that balances its cold terrain with an unexpectedly warm heart." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety wrote, [...] "Don’t be surprised if the movie’s most wince-inducing moments come not from the [...] "disturbing images" [...] (as the MPAA describes the sight of a leg bone sticking six inches out of one character's <b>ski</b> <b>pants)</b> but rather of the bad acting and worse dialogue." ...|$|E
5000|$|American {{members of}} the Force arrived for {{training}} in Helena in standard US Army attire: green twill coveralls, some wearing khaki pants and fatigue hats. Others were dressed in trousers and green uniform jackets and wore green caps. Ultimately, however, the American uniforms did not differ widely from one another. The Canadian troops, however, arrived in all different manners of uniform: some wore kilts, others tartan trousers (trews) and others Bermuda shorts. Headgear differed just as widely, depending on where the soldier was from - wedge caps for some, black berets for troops taken from armoured regiments and large khaki Tam o' Shanters for soldiers from Scottish regiments. Eventually, {{it was decided that}} the uniforms would come from an American supplier and olive drab trousers and blouses were issued. The only thing that differentiated an American Force member from a Canadian one was the identification disc, aka [...] "dog tags," [...] worn by the soldier (Americans wore American metal ID tags and Canadians wore Canadian ID discs). Forcemen also wore a red, white and blue aiguillette. For mountain warfare, the men were given baggy <b>ski</b> <b>pants,</b> parkas and a helmet. Standard boots were originally the same as those issued to parachuting regiments, but these were substituted for infantry combat boots in Italy.|$|E
