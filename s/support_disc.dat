Some of the songs from that disc have been released by others (PMS and the Progday <b>Support</b> <b>disc</b> 2005). In 1996, Daughtrey and Poulin left and were briefly replaced by what {{appears to have been a}} revolving door system of line-ups.|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{functions}} required for formation of the imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster larvae, from which adult structures are derived, are disc-specific and not required for formation of other larval tissues. Mutants blocked in disc-specific functions can produce mature viable larvae, indicating that larval development is not dependent on concomitant disc development. Some of the mutant larvae have no detectable discs (discless mutants), and other have small discs that cannot differentiate into adult structures (small disc mutants). From the results of genetic complementation and mapping experiments with such mutants, {{it was estimated that}} the genome of D. melanogaster contains around a thousand complementation groups, or about a fifth of all complementation groups in the genome, that are essential specifically for the development of all the discs. The developmental defects in some of the disc mutants appear to involve autonomous functions of the imaginal cells, and in other mutants functions provided by the larval environment to <b>support</b> <b>disc</b> development. This distinction was {{made on the basis of}} two functional tests. The purpose of one of the tests was to detect the presence in young embryos of determined imaginal cells capable of differentiating after transplantation to a wild-type host; the other test measured the capacity of early third-instar larvae to act as hosts for the further development of immature discs transplanted from a wild-type donor. Three discless mutants that were tested in this way appeared to be defective in autonomous functions of the imaginal cells, since the embryos contained no imaginal cells that could be detected in the first test, whereas the larvae, although devoid of discs, showed a normal capacity to <b>support</b> <b>disc</b> development in the second test. One of the small disc mutants tested was defective in a larval rather than an imaginal cell function, since the embryos had a normal complement of functional imaginal cells, whereas the larvae were incapable of supporting disc development. Thus, both types of disc-specific functions are essential for normal disc development...|$|E
40|$|Extending upon {{development}} efforts last quarter to produce ''free-standing'', copper and palladium alloy films, the goal this quarter {{has been to}} produce pinhole-free, Pd-Cu alloy films up to 5 x 5 inches in area (1 - 3 microns thick) using both magnetron sputtering and e-beam evaporation on PVA (Solublon) and polystyrene backing materials. A set of experiments were conducted to assess processing methods/solutions chemistry for removing the polymer backing material from the Pd-Cu film. For all of the alloy films produced to this point, {{we were unable to}} produce pinhole-free films on plastic although we were able to produce free-standing Pd-Cu films at less than 0. 5 microns thick with minimal intrinsic stress. Subsequently, to evaluate gas permeation and leakage across the films, two films were sandwiched together on top of a porous Monel <b>support</b> <b>disc</b> (25 mm in diameter) and then tested in a leak test apparatus. Using two Cu films (10 micron thickness total) in the sandwich configuration, leak rates were about 20 % of the background leak rate...|$|E
40|$|Continuous imaging of live tissues {{provides}} clear temporal {{sequence of}} biological events. The Drosophila imaginal discs have been popular experimental subjects {{for the study}} {{of a wide variety of}} biological phenomena, but long term culture that allows normal development has not been satisfactory. Here we report a culture method that can sustain normal development for 18 hours and allows live imaging. The method is validated in multiple discs and for cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. However, it does not <b>support</b> <b>disc</b> growth and cannot support cell proliferation for more than 7 to 12 hr. We monitored the cellular behavior of retinal basal glia in the developing eye disc and found that distinct glia type has distinct properties of proliferation and migration. The live imaging provided direct proof that wrapping glia differentiated from existing glia after migrating to the anterior front, and unexpectedly found that they undergo endoreplication before wrapping axons, and their nuclei migrate up and down along the axons. UV-induced specific labeling of a single carpet glia also showed that the two carpet glia membrane do not overlap and suggests a tiling or repulsion mechanism between the two cells. These findings demonstrated the usefulness of an ex vivo culture method and live imaging...|$|E
40|$|We {{suggest that}} the bulge-to-disc ratios of spiral galaxies are {{primarily}} determined by the angular momenta of their host haloes predicted in current hierarchical clustering models for structure formation. Gas with low specific angular momentum becomes self-gravitating and presumably forms stars before it can settle into a rotationally <b>supported</b> <b>disc.</b> We assume {{this part of the}} gas in a dark halo to form a bulge, while the rest is assumed to settle into a rotationally <b>supported</b> <b>disc.</b> With these assumptions the predicted bulge-to-disc ratios in mass and in size, and other correlations between the bulge and disc components can match current observational results. This model predicts the existence of a population of low-surface-brightness galaxies which are bulgeless. The model also predicts that the bulge component has many properties in common with the disc component, because both form through similar processes. In particular, many bulges should be supported (at least partially) by rotation. Comment: 5 pages, 4 ps figures, submitted to MNRA...|$|R

40|$|DISC 1 was {{discovered}} in a Scottish pedigree in which a chromosomal translocation that breaks this gene segregates with psychiatric disorders, mainly depression and schizophrenia. Linkage and association studies in diverse populations <b>support</b> <b>DISC</b> 1 as a susceptibility gene {{to a variety of}} neuropsychiatric disorders. Many Disc 1 mouse models have been generated to study its neuronal functions. These mouse models display variable phenotypes, some of them relevant to schizophrenia, others to depression. The Disc 1 mouse models are popular genetic models for studying gene-environment interactions in schizophrenia. Five different Disc 1 models have been combined with environmental factors. The environmental stressors employed can be classified as either early immune activation or later social paradigms. These studies cover major time points along the neurodevelopmental trajectory: prenatal, early postnatal, adolescence, and adulthood. Various combinations of molecular, anatomical and behavioral methods have been used to assess the outcomes. Additionally, three of the studies sought to rescue the resulting abnormalities. Here we provide background on the environmental paradigms used, summarize the results of these studies combining Disc 1 mouse models with environmental stressors and discuss what we can learn and how to proceed. A major question is how the genetic and environmental factors determine which psychiatric disorder will be clinically manifested. To address this we {{can take advantage of the}} many Disc 1 models available and expose them to the same environmental stressor. The complementary experiment would be to expose the same model to different environmental stressors. DISC 1 is an ideal gene for this approach, since in the Scottish pedigree the same chromosomal translocation results in different psychiatric conditions...|$|E

In the present study, the prospects of success of two hydrogels functionalized with anti-angiogenic peptides and seeded with bone marrow derived mononuclear cells (BMC), respectively, were investigated in an ovine nucleotomy model. Methods In a one-step procedure iliac crest aspirates were harvested and, subsequently, separated BMC were seeded on hydrogels and implanted into the ovine disc. For the cell-seeded approach a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel was used. The anti-angiogenic potential of newly developed VEGF-blockers was investigated on ionically crosslinked metacrylated gellan gum hydrogels. Untreated discs served as nucleotomy controls. 24 adult merino sheep were used. After 6 weeks histological, after 12 weeks histological and biomechanical analyses were conducted. Results Biomechanical tests revealed no differences between any of the implanted and nucleotomized discs. All implanted discs significantly degenerated compared to intact discs. In contrast, there was no marked difference between implanted and nucleotomized discs. In tendency, albeit not significant, degeneration score and disc height index deteriorated for all {{but not for the}} cell-seeded hydrogels from 6 to 12 weeks. Cell-seeded hydrogels slightly decelerated degeneration. Conclusions None of the hydrogel configurations was able to regenerate biofunctionality of the intervertebral disc. This might presumably be caused by hydrogel extrusion. Great importance should be given to the development of annulus sealants, which effectively exploit the potential of (cell-seeded) hydrogels for biological disc regeneration and restoration of intervertebral disc functioningThis work was supported by the EU-project Disc Regeneration (NMP 3 -LA- 2008 - 213904).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of stars {{that may be the}} progenitors of long-soft gamma-ray burst (GRBs) [...] rotating naked helium stars presumed to have lost their envelopes to winds or companions. Our aim is to investigate the formation and development of single and binary systems and from this population evaluate the rates of interesting individual species. Using a rapid binary evolution algorithm, that enables us to model the most complex binary systems and to explore the effect of metallicity on GRB production, we draw the following conclusions. First we find that, if we include an approximate treatment of angular momentum transport by mass loss, the resulting spin rates for single stars become too low to form a centrifugally <b>supported</b> <b>disc</b> that can drive a GRB engine. Second massive stars in binaries result in enough angular momentum [...] due to spin-orbit tidal interactions [...] to form a centrifugally <b>supported</b> <b>disc</b> and are thus capable of supplying a sufficient number of progenitors. This holds true even if {{only a small fraction of}} bursts are visible to a given observer and the GRB rate is several hundred times larger than the observed rate. Third low-metallicity stars aid the formation of a rapidly rotating, massive helium cores at collapse and so their evolution is likely to be affected by the local properties of the ISM. This effect could increase the GRB formation rate by a factor of 5 - 7 at Z=Z_solar/ 200. Finally we quantify the effects of mass loss, common-envelope evolution and black-hole formation and show that more stringent constraints to many of these evolution parameters are needed in order to draw quantitative conclusions from population synthesis work.

We present also a higher resolution simulation performed using the particle-splitting technique showing that the binary orbital decay is efficient down to a separation of ~ 0. 1 pc, comparable to our new resolution limit.
