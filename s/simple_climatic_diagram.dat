40|$|International audienceAim: Soil {{water is}} {{essential}} for the physiological processes of plant growth and fitness. Owing to the difficulty of assessing wide variations in soil water reserves, plant distribution models usually estimate available water for plants through such climatic proxies as precipitation data (P) or climatic water balance (P minus potential evapotranspiration). We evaluated the ability of <b>simple</b> <b>climatic</b> proxies and soil water balance indices to predict the ecological niches of forest tree species. Location: France Methods: Soil water content and deficits were computed and mapped at a resolution of 1 × 1 km throughout France. The predictive abilities of these indices were compared to those of P and climatic water balance to model the distributions of 37 of the most common European tree species. We focused on two species with contrasting water tolerance, Quercus robur and Quercus pubescens, to illustrate the differences between climatic proxies and soil water balance in species response curves and distribution maps. Results: Throughout France, soil water content was poorly correlated with P and climatic water balance, because low P in the lowlands can be compensated for by water provided by deeper soils, which is not the case in most mountainous areas. Soil water balance performed better than <b>simple</b> <b>climatic</b> water variables for explaining tree species distribution, improving 82 % of the models for hygrophilous, meso-hygrophilous, meso-xerophilous, and meso-xerophilous species. Main conclusions: Our results showed that <b>simple</b> <b>climatic</b> values do not accurately represent available water for trees and that soil water balance indices perform better than do climatic proxies for most species. This point is crucial in avoiding underestimating the importance of water in studies aiming to determine the ecological niches of plant species and their responses to climate change...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the wheatbelt {{of eastern}} Australia, {{rainfall}} shifts from winter dominated {{in the south}} (South Australia, Victoria) to summer dominated in the north (northern New SouthWales, southern Queensland). The seasonality of rainfall, together with frost risk, drives the choice of cultivar and sowing date, resulting in a flowering time between October {{in the south and}} August in the north. In eastern Australia, crops are therefore exposed to contrasting climatic conditions during the critical period around flowering, which may affect yield potential, and the efficiency in the use of water (WUE) and radiation (RUE). In this work we analysed empirical and simulated data, to identify key climatic drivers of potential water- and radiation-use efficiency, derive a <b>simple</b> <b>climatic</b> index of environmental potentiality, and provide an example of how a <b>simple</b> <b>climatic</b> index could be used to quantify the spatial and temporal variability in resource-use efficiency and potential yield in eastern Australia. Around anthesis, from Horsham to Emerald, median vapour pressure deficit (VPD) increased from 0. 92 to 1. 28 kPa, average temperature increased from 12. 9 to 15. 2 ◦C, and the fraction of diffuse radiation (FDR) decreased from 0. 61 to 0. 41. These spatial gradients in climatic drivers accounted for significant gradients inmodelled efficiencies: median transpiration WUE (WUEB/T) increased southwards at a rate of 2. 6 % per degree latitude and median RUE increased southwards at a rate of 1. 1 % per degree latitude.

The sea ice/snow cover line for the model is between the pole and 53 deg latitude and the line's position is the forcing for the glaciation cycle.

A latitude-resolved climate model originally devised for terrestrial climate studies is applied to Martian conditions, with the difference between absorbed solar flux and emitted long-wave flux to space per unit area attributed to the divergence of the meridional heat flux and the poleward heat flux assumed to equal the atmospheric eddy heat flux. The global mean energy balance is calculated as a function of atmospheric pressure to assess the CO 2 /H 2 O greenhouse liquid water hypothesis, and some latitude-resolved cases are examined in detail in order to clarify the role of atmospheric transport and temperature-albedo feedback.

Grain yield (range 1 - 7 t/ha) measured in field experiments across South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland (n = 55) was unrelated to the photothermal quotient (Pq = PAR/T) around anthesis, but was significantly associated (r 2 = 0. 41, P < 0. 0001) with newly developed climatic index: a normalised photothermal quotient (NPq = Pq.

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} dryness and drought {{phenomena}} {{in one of}} the subsidence areas of the Romanian Plain, namely Titu Plain, located in its central-north part, a region frequently affected by such phenomena, under the influence of persistent continental antyciclones. The topic approached in this study is in line with the current concerns of agriculture stakeholders to undertake climate change adaptation measures for a better management of water resources for crops in the the main agricultural regions of the country. In this paper we focused mainly on the impact of dryness and drought on agricultural landscape, although their direct and indirect effects affect not only agriculture, but also the whole economic activity of the region.

Based on previous experimental results, this study developed a model (Pouloud) {{to predict the}} dynamics of aggregate stability following the incorporation of various organic residues under field conditions. Following Monnier's conceptual model and previously published data, a lognormal function is first used to describe changes in aggregate stability after organic inputs under laboratory conditions. Using principal component analysis, the parameters of the lognormal function are associated with the biochemical characteristics of the organic products such as water-extractable polysaccharide, cellulose and hemicellulose, and lignin contents. To simulate aggregate stability dynamics under field conditions, the effects of soil moisture, soil temperature, and N availability are taken into account by specific functions obtained from the literature. When model simulations were compared with experimental results under field conditions, variations in aggregate stability were generally well reproduced. The sensitivity of the model to climate variations and organic residue characteristics was tested. Soil N availability and the substrate lignin content are major factors that influence the prediction of aggregate stability dynamics.

Subzones with similar environments and land uses were grouped in agroecological clusters. These in turn were evaluated for relevance to current and future CIAT research. By this method it was possible to quantify pre-determined aspects of sustainability problems based on both environmental and social variables.

A simulation model was developed to determine whether this sheep producing area has the capability to provide sufficient numbers of sheep under variable climatic conditions while sustaining the land resources. Maximum capacity for sustainability of resources (as described by stock numbers) was derived from an in-depth study of the agricultural and pastoral potential of Queensland. Decades of sheep production and climatic data spanning differing seasonal conditions were collated for analysis. A ruminant biology model adapted from Grazplan was used to simulate pregnancy rate. Empirical equations predict mortalities, marking rates, and weight characteristics of sheep of various ages from <b>simple</b> <b>climatic</b> measures, stocking rate and reproductive status. The initial age structure of flocks was determined by running the model for several years with historical climatic conditions. Drought management strategies such as selling a proportion of wethers progressively down to two-tooth and oldest ewes were incorporated.

The high price of water and the uncertainty that went with it was important in making the decision to look at sites within Queensland.

40|$|Aim It is {{commonly}} asserted that climate presents the primary constraint on species’ geographic distributions, and therefore, that species' ranges shift {{in response to}} changing climate given their specific climatic tolerances. However, supporting evidence is surprisingly inconsistent. Alternatively, spatially structured processes (e. g., dispersal) could more strongly determine species’ geographic distributions. Is climate the primary determinant of species’ geographic distributions, or might non-climatic, spatial processes constitute a stronger influence, such {{that the effect of}} climate is indirect? This study tests a number of predictions made by each of these hypotheses, during a single period of time. Location Contiguous United States and southern Canada. Methods We used 19 species of passerine birds whose distributions fall entirely within the area sampled by the North American Breeding Bird Survey from 1990 - 2000. We related these distributions to the mean breeding season climate, geographic locations and neighbourhood effects. Two spatial scales were addressed to assess the geographic location of species’ ranges and species' distributions within ranges. Results On average, geographic coordinates and a model representing neighbourhood occupancy outperform a <b>simple</b> <b>climatic</b> model. After controlling for geographic coordinates, species occupancy is poorly related to climate. A neighbourhood model on average accounts for the majority of variance captured by geographic coordinates within ranges, and more for the continental placement of ranges. Spatially explicit variables are more important than macroclimatic variables in a predictive model of species occupancy on average. Main Conclusions The geographic distributions of wide-spread North American passerine birds appear not to be primarily determined by climate. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that localized spatial processes such as dispersal are stronger determinants of both continental range placement and within-range distributions of North American birds...|$|R

40|$|More than 30 % of Europe's land {{surface is}} made up of karst exposures. In some countries, water from karst {{aquifers}} constitutes almost half of the drinking water supply. Hydrological simulation models can predict the large-scale impact of future environmental change on hydrological variables. However, the information needed to obtain model parameters is not available everywhere and regionalisation methods have to be applied. The responsive behaviour of hydrological systems can be quantified by individual metrics, so-called system signatures. This study explores their value for distinguishing the dominant processes and properties of five different karst systems in Europe and the Middle East with the overall aim of regionalising system signatures and model parameters to ungauged karst areas. By defining ten system signatures derived from hydrodynamic and hydrochemical observations, a process-based karst model is applied to the five karst systems. In a stepwise model evaluation strategy, optimum parameters and their sensitivity are identified using automatic calibration and global variance-based sensitivity analysis. System signatures and sensitive parameters serve as proxies for dominant processes and optimised parameters are used to determine system properties. To test the transferability of the signatures, they are compared with the optimised model parameters and <b>simple</b> <b>climatic</b> and topographic descriptors of the five karst systems. By sensitivity analysis, the set of system signatures was able to distinguish the karst systems from one another by providing separate information about dominant soil, epikarst, and fast and slow groundwater flow processes. Comparing sensitive parameters to the system signatures revealed that annual discharge can serve as a proxy for the recharge area, that the slopes of the high flow parts of the flow duration curves correlate with the fast flow storage constant, and that the dampening of the isotopic signal of the rain as well as the medium flow parts of the flow duration curves have a non-linear relation to the distribution of groundwater dynamics. Even though, only weak correlations between system signatures and climatic and topographic factors could be found, our approach enabled us to identify dominant processes of the different systems and to provide directions for future large-scale simulation of karst areas to predict the impact of future change on karst water resources...|$|R
40|$|Central Chile (30 - 40 °S) has {{experienced}} a rainfall decline since the early 80 s. Such long-term drying has been accentuated by an intense rainfall deficit from 2010 to date. Moreover, the maximum air temperatures have risen since the late 70 s, with warm anomalies between 0. 5 ° and 1 °C relative to the past 30 years, resulting {{in the use of}} the term megadrougth for the 2010 - 2015 period. In this work, we used two drought indices to analyze the contribution of precipitation and temperature on recent droughts, and to improve our understanding about the onset, duration and magnitude thereof. First, the traditional Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is used to describe the effect of lack of precipitation on drought conditions. Second, the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), based on a <b>simple</b> <b>climatic</b> water balance (precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration), is used to assess the effect of temperature -throughout changes in evaporation- on drought severity at different time scales. Data from 781 raingauges and 281 temperature stations were analyzed for the period 1981 - 2015, but only 21 stations with 98 % of days with information (or more) were used to compute SPI and SPEI at 12 -month scale (SPI- 12 and SPEI- 12, respectively), as representative of the long-term effects of meteorological droughts on hydrology. Results reveal that in almost all the analyzed stations both SPI and SPEI are close or below zero since August 2010 onwards, with stations located northern to 32 °S recovering in July 2015 due to extreme rainfall events. We note that the SPEI- 12 was able to identify drought events even after some above-normal rainfall periods, which was in agreement with reported socioeconomic impacts on agriculture and water supply. Comparison of moving averages of SPI- 12 and SPEI- 12 during the megadrought against their historical values (1966 - 2010), for selected stations, reveals two different conditions. In the arid north, the SPI- 12 was low but not extraordinary, whilst the SPEI- 12 was well beyond the historical distribution, indicating that the increase in temperature have worsened the rainfall deficit by increasing evaporation. In the humid south, we found little difference between SPI- 12 and SPEI- 12 during the megadrought, but both values were extraordinary in their historical context...|$|R
