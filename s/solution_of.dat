25|$|Each {{method has}} {{noteworthy}} limitations. The method of {{mechanics of materials}} is limited to very simple structural elements under relatively simple loading conditions. The structural elements and loading conditions allowed, however, are sufficient to solve many useful engineering problems. The theory of elasticity allows the <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> structural elements of general geometry under general loading conditions, in principle. Analytical solution, however, is limited to relatively simple cases. The <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> elasticity problems also requires the <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> a system of partial differential equations, which is considerably more mathematically demanding than the <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> mechanics of materials problems, which require at most the <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> an ordinary differential equation. The finite element method {{is perhaps the most}} restrictive and most useful at the same time. This method itself relies upon other structural theories (such as the other two discussed here) for equations to solve. It does, however, make it generally possible to solve these equations, even with highly complex geometry and loading conditions, with the restriction that there is always some numerical error. Effective and reliable use of this method requires a solid understanding of its limitations.|$|E
