40|$|The Kwandonkaya {{complex is}} one of the Mesozoic Nigerian Younger Granite complexes, which belong to the within-plate A-type granite spectrum. The complex, {{comprised}} of three main intrusive centers, contains <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks,</b> plutonic rocks, and localized occurrences of altered granite. In this study, the field, petrographic and mineral chemical characteristics of the complex are investigated, a model of evolution of the <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> is formulated, and the mode of genesis of the parental melt are proposed. The Fe-rich mafic minerals documented in the <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> suggest a comagmatic suite, and low f(O$ sb 2) $ at the time of crystallization (ca. QFM). The <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> are inferred, from mica chemistry, to have equilibrated with a fluid phase characterized by low average $f sb{ rm(HF) }/f sb{ rm(HCl) }$ values ($ 10 sp{- 1. 74 }$ at 773 K); values of the same ratio are higher in plutonic rocks (10 $ sp{- 0. 67 }$ at 673 K), and they are even higher values in the drusy and mineralized variants of the biotite granite. The occurrence of orthoclase, orthoclase + microcline, and microcline reflects decreases in the degree of undercooling, related to size of intrusive unit, and in the An content of sanidine$ rm sb{ss},$ which precluded complete ordering. The successful conversion of a monoclinic precursor to microcline indicates an increase in degree of volatile build-up and retention, and in extent of rock-fluid interactions in the subsolidus range of temperatures. The temperature of closure was between 450 and 300 $ sp circ$C for orthoclase-bearing rocks, and between 450 and 300 $ sp circ$C for those with microcline $ pm$ orthoclase. This granite also contains dark enclaves, formed by mingling of a hybrid magma with the evolved, but not on a scale that noticeably affected its geochemical features. Petrologic modelling of the felsic <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> show that the rock suite could have evolved by 29 % Rayleigh fractionation of liquidus phases (cumulate: sanidine$ rm sb{ss}$: 88 %, fayalite: 6 %, hedenbergite: 5 %, ilmenite: 1 %). Trace element evolution requires 50 % fractionation of the same phases. This disagreement, between the major and trace element models, results from the role of zircon, chevkinite, and allanite, not required in the major-element model. Selective trace-element enrichment followed by nonmodal melting of a lower crustal rocks, of granulitic composition, could produce the required parental melt by 20 to 60 % melting...|$|R

These rocks are present at three different localities: (a) Serrania Chilla (with Cerro Chilla rising to 4825 m), south of Tiwanaku, (b) Sewenkani and other creeks, north of Jesus de Machaca, and (c) several hills NW and N of Caquiaviri. the two first series of outcrops present a complex sedimentary sequence consisting of deep water, dark laminated shales and siltstones, interbedded with thin sandstone beds displaying typical Bouma sequences, and thicker beds of coaster sand, conglomerates and diamicitites. This sequence is here interpreted {{as part of a}} deep-sea fan system, although marine fauna and/or ichnofossils are yet to be found (palynological analysis gave no positive results). Thick (up to 50 m) beds of basic volcanic and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> are also included in the sequence. These are identified by relics of pillow-lavas and flow structures, columnar jointing, differential core-to-contact crystallization degrees, and synsedimentary interaction with the soft sediment.

50|$|In 2004, {{volcanologist}} Jack Souther of the Geological Survey of Canada {{convinced that}} Flute Summit is an exposed subvolcanic intrusion {{of an ancient}} volcano. Nearby mountains, such as Whistler Mountain and Piccolo Summit, consist of lava flows that were erupted from a volcano about 100 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. The <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rock</b> that comprises Flute Summt is igneous rock that solidfied inside the Late Cretaceous volcano. Subvolcanic rocks can remain semi-molten and hot for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Because the magma that forms subvolcanic rocks solidifies and crystallizes slower than magma erupted on the surface, mineral grains grow larger. This produces a coarse grained rock. As subvolcanic magma heats and sets up convention in nearby groundwater, a hydrothermal system is created. This hydrothermal system can form quartz veins like those found at Flute Summit, combined with sulfurous gasses released from the magma, cause chemical alteration of both the crystallizing subvolcanic intrusion and the neighbouring rocks. This is how Flute Summit got its red colour.|$|E

Clasts with sizes ranging from granule to boulder show geochemical and mineralogical features comparable with those of Ferrar Supergroup rocks. They display a subalkaline affinity and compositions ranging from basalts to dacite. Three different petrographic groups with distinct textural and grain size features (subophitic, intergranular-intersertal, and glassy-hyalopilitic) are recognised and {{are related to the}} emplacement/cooling mechanism. In the sand to silt fraction, the few glass shards that have been recognised are strongly altered: however chemical analyses show they have subalkalic magmatic affinity. Mineral compositions of the abundant free clinopyroxene grains found in the core, are less affected by alteration processes, and indicate an origin from subalkaline magmas. This excludes the presence, during the deposition of CRP- 3 rocks of alkaline volcanic activity comparable with the McMurdo Volcanic Group. Strong alteration of the magmatic body intruded the Beacon sandstones obliterates the original mineral assemblage.

Analysis of amphiboles and pyroxenes have led to the conclusion that they and other sediments originate from volcanic and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> from the Central Valley and the Andean Cordillera.

40|$|Abstract—The {{alteration}} {{process of}} a <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rock</b> with calcic plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine as major components was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and analytical and {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM/AEM). Experimental interaction with 1 M NaOH solution {{led to the formation}} of dioctahedral beidellite to Fe-rich montmorillonite after 1 and 3 d of reaction. This range of smectite composition is similar to that from natural subvolcanic-derived soil formed from the same parent material. After 14 d of reaction, a berthierine-smectite (B-S) interstratified clay had partially replaced the smectite. Although, the presence of smectite interlayers prevented analysis of pure berthierine, berthierine-rich B-S interstratifications have a composition similar to pure berthierine. After 40 d, the alteration process led to a 7 -A ˚ S interstratification whose composition falls between greenalite and lizardite. A series of amor-phous materials were also found in the 14 and 40 -d experiments. The most abundant of these is a Si-Ca-Fe-rich material, whose chemical composition approaches that of the starting rock. In contrast, two other amorphous materials had a smectitic composition...|$|E

The bedrock geology of the district is comprised of two distinctive chronostratigraphic sequences: 1. Mesozoic carbonatc and clastic scdiments unconformably overlain by, 2. Tertiary tuffaceous sediments and Pliocene felsic Luffs. The Alshar deposit is of hydrothermal low temperature origin, genetically associated with thc Pliocene subvolcanic dacite andcsitic intrusive. The age of lhe volcanic activity is about 7 to 5 million years (Boev, 1988). Small bodies of intrusiv • mineralized, porphyrytic <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rock,</b> intrusive cross both Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks. Several major structural sets (northwest,northeast and northherly dissect and juxtapose the bedrock sequence in a complex contact relationship.

40|$|In the Argentinean {{side of the}} Andes at 34 ° 40 'S, the Cenozoic Andean orogeny {{produced}} the thick-skinned Malargüe fold-and-thrust belt and the easternmost basement uplift of the Cordillera Frontal. Integrating balanced structural cross-sections with previous studies of Cenozoic synorogenic rocks and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of coeval volcanic and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks,</b> we propose a Miocene to Quaternary sequential structural evolution of this sector of the Andes. Andean deformation {{in the study area}} begun around 14. 5 Ma with the growth of thick-skinned structures at the western region, formed by large basement wedges that propagated along detachment horizons within the cover generating thin-skinned structures. The development of these genetically linked thick and thin-skinned structures finished with the insertion of a third basement wedge and its associated deformation in cover rocks along the Sosneado thrust, before the extrusion of 10. 8 Ma volcanic rocks. These structures imply ~ 10 km of shortening, representing an important Middle Miocene compressive period (2. 7 mm/a). Systems of fractures measured in basement, cover and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> indicate an E-W direction of compression. A supercritical Coulomb wedge attained after the Middle Miocene deformation, was responsible of new basement-involved faulting into the foreland, the west-dipping Carrizalito thrust. The absence of efficient detachment levels in the cover rocks of the eastern region difficulted the development of large basement wedges and instead important backthrusting occurred in the hangingwall of the Carrizalito thrust. Widespread <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> (10. 5 to 5. 5 Ma) exposed in this region suggest a close relationship between magmatism and antithetic faulting. With continuing compression, the Carrizalito thrust breaks through to the surface thrusting pre-Jurassic and Mesozoic sequences over Cenozoic rocks although in the southern region it remains as a blind thrust. This different configuration along the strike of the Carrizalito thrust is due to an ENE trending oblique fault. Thick-skinned structures in the eastern sector, that involve ~ 4 km of shortening, were covered discordantly by horizontal basalts of ~ 0. 5 Ma. A shortening rate of 0. 42 mm/a from Late Miocene to Middle Pleistocene indicates that Andean contraction diminished, which is in agreement with most geodynamic models of plate tectonics...|$|R

40|$|In {{southern}} Brazil, the Florianopolis Batholith {{results from}} prolonged, mainly granitic magmatism, {{as part of}} the Neoproterozoic Dom Feliciano Belt. Plutonic associations in this belt are related to transpressive tectonism (650 - 580 Ma) in post-collisional setting, where the translithospheric discontinuities of the Southern Brazilian Shear Belt have triggered magmatism, acting as channels for melts originated in deep crustal or mantle sources. In the region of Garopaba-Paulo Lopes, a fraction of this magmatism was studied, resulting in a formal proposition for its stratigraphic organization in igneous suites. A small volume of gneissic host rocks is found as roof pendants. The Paulo Lopes Suite comprises the foliated Paulo Lopes Granite, Garopaba Granitoids and Silveira Gabbro. It is characterized as porphyritic granitoids of high-K tholeiitic affinity, coeval with mafic, tholeiitic magmatism. It is followed by metaluminous, alkaline series granitoids of the Pedras Grandes Suite, namely the Vila da Penha Granite, comprising heterogranular and porphyritic facies, and the Serra do Tabuleiro Granite, comprising heterogranular, equigranular and porphyritic facies. The Cambirela Suite, last magmatic episode in the study area, encompasses alkaline plutonic, volcanic and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rock</b> types, as the Ilha Granite, the Cambirela Rhyolite and the Itacorumbi Granite. Hypabissal rocks are also part of this suite, and result from recurrent acid and basic magma pulses emplaced either as idividual dykes or composite ones. The magmatic associations described in this region attest to magma emplacement under a moderate to low stress field, possibly extinguished by the time the Cambirela Suite crystallized. Their age values indicate that they are mostly contemporaneous to the post-collisional, syntectonic magmatism of the Southern Brazilian Shear Belt, and the preservation of magmatic structures such as modal layering, relatively uncomon in granitoids, may also be attributed to their emplacement far from the main deformation sites. Features indicative of coeval mafic and felsic magmas are described in all three magmatic associations, and are especially significant in the Paulo Lopes and Cambirela suites. They attest to continuous mantle participation in the batholith construction...|$|E
40|$|The Lights Creek {{stock is}} located in the {{northern}} Sierra Nevada of California and is intruded into Mesozoic metavolcanic rocks with lesser gabbro and diorite. The stock has a surface area of about seven square miles and consists mainly of quartz monzonite and granodiorite with lesser granite and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rock</b> equivalents. Porphyry copper-type mineralization is present in several broad marginal areas. Rock samples were collected from 98 cores and 31 surface outcrops distributed over the stock with an elevation range of 2, 700 ft, and analyzed for copper, lead, and zinc. In spite of large variance (coefficient of variation up to 76 %) at the outcrop or local scale, significant regional distributions are also present which, in the case of copper, correlate with the areas of mineralization as well as with some variations in the local-scale variance. Analysis of frequency distributions of pooled local-scale metal data suggests the copper mineralization has been introduced on a scale larger than that of individual drill cor. es, and is not merely a small-scale segregation of magmatic-stage constituents into subsequent adjacent fractures. In three-dimensional regressions for the three elements, the only significant trend in the vertical dimension occurs in the regression on copper, with a pattern of mar-ginal or peripheral "peel-like " concentrations which increase with elevation. These areas of variable mineralization tend to surround a barren or low copper (< 200 ppm) core in the north-central portion of the stock. Although the base metal regression patterns and frequency distributions do not superficially serve to select among processes proposed for porphyry copper mineraliza-tion (i. e., magmatic-hydrothermal and convecting meteoric or formation waters), their relationship to certain geologic features suggests a largely magmatic source of the metals in this stock. Among these features are the locations of some orebodies, simi-larities of mineralization within and outside the stock, contrasts in metal contents of xenoliths and wall rocks or inliers at the contacts and within the stock, and the presence of variable disseminated sulfides in all rock facies of the stock...|$|E
40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Artykuł jest abstr. referatu z konferencji. Bibliogr. s. 132 - 133. A metasomatic column (or metasomatic zone pattern) is the {{complete}} sequence of metasomatic zones characterising an individual metasomatic facies (Zharikov et al. 2007). The genesis of this column {{is the result}} of a series of processes, in the case of basic rock protolith leading to the formation of apobasite listvenites (in the sense of Sazonov 1975). It includes three partial processes: 1) carbonatization, 2) silicification and 3) formation of mica (e. g. Plissart et al. 2009) involving the infiltration of a CO 2 -rich fluids and shows similarity to processes of listvenitisation (e. g. Clayton 1993). Field research in Slovinky-Gelnica ore field has revealed the presence of such a metasomatic column (cf. Ivan 1987). It comprises metabasites as the protolith, carbonatised metabasites, listvenite-type metasomatites and listvenites s. s. The metabasites have features of <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rock</b> types (Ivan 2009), what makes them comparable with similar rocks from Ural. The petrographic study of selected samples has showed that amphibole, chlorite and albite became progressively unstable in this sequence of alterations, replaced by carbonate, silica and lastly by the muscovite minerals, sericite or fuchsite (Ivan 1987). Carbonates change their quantity as well as mineralogical composition with the development of the column in two trends of changes: towards Mg-Fe carbonates or Mg-Ca carbonates. Regarding the samples from Ural, Fe-dolomites and ankerites predominate, the metasomatic columns derived from gabbros and dolerites are essentially the same. The geochemical study of rock samples from the study area (22 whole rock analyses) as well as the comparison with similarly metasomatised rock series from Ural (56 analyses) allowed as to give more detailed characterization of the metasomatic column. The most obvious change is a clear increase of K with decreasing Na as a sign of the albite break-up and Krich minerals (such as muscovite) formation. The increase of LOI and CO 2 indicate the process of carbonatisation. Listvenitisation is often associated with the hydrothermal ore veins formation and the rare metal mineralization with concentration of elements such as Au, Co, Sb, Cu, Ni (e. g. Dinel et al. 2008, Buckman & Ashley 2010). This could be significant as regards the genesis of stratiform ore deposits within the Slovinky-Gelnica ore field. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

The mineralization is related to <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks.</b> There are several outcrops of subvolcanic intrusions in the area which intruded into Paleocene–Eocene volcanic rocks (andesite, trachy-andesite and pyroclastic rocks). Petrographic studies indicate that <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> consist mainly of diorite, monzonite, quartz-monzonite, monzodiorite and quartz-monzodiorite. Mineralogically, these rocks contain plagioclase, K-feldspar, amphibole, pyroxene, biotite and quartz.

Primitive mantle normalized trace element spider diagrams display enrichment in LILE, such as Rb, Ba, and Cs, compared to HFSE. Chondrite-normalized REE plots show moderately LREE enriched patterns (7. 45 < LaN/YbN < 10. 54), and no significant Eu anomalies. Tectonic discrimination diagrams also show affinities with modern convergent margin magmas, suggesting that magmas of Khunik area formed in volcanic arc setting related to subduction of the oceanic crust under the Lut Block plate. The initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (0. 704196 – 0. 704772) and eNdi values (+ 1. 3 to + 3. 3) are compatible with an origin of the parental melts in a supra-subduction mantle wedge.

The Porphyry Copper mineralization in the Iranian plate occurs dominantly along the Urumieh-Dokhtar arc, which has resulted from the subduction of the Arabian plate beneath the central Iran and the closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean during the Alpine orogeny (Hassanzadeh, 1993). The Iju porphyry copper deposit with 25 million tons of ore reserves is one of the main copper deposits within the Kerman copper belt. The mining area is composed of upper Miocene volcanic and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> (mineralized and barren <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks)</b> and quaternary deposits. Two hydrothermal alteration zones of quartz-sericite-pyrite and propylitic zones can be identified in the Iju area. The copper mineralization in the Iju deposit occurs as disseminated, stockwork and hydrothermal breccia. In the hypogene zone, the mineral paragenesis include chalcopyrite, pyrite, with minor occurrences of bornite and magnetite. This paper reports geological, mineralogical, fluid inclusion and S isotope data from the Iju deposit in order to investigate ore-bearing fluids’ characteristics and the mechanisms of ore deposition. Materials and methods Fifteen samples of syngenetic quartz+pyrite bearing veinlets within the quartz-sericite-pyrite zone were selected from different depths across the seven boreholes. Quartz was used for double-polished thin sections and pyrite was used for sulfur isotope analysis. Fluid inclusion studies were performed using the Linkam cooling and heating stage, the THMSG 600 model. The syngenetic pyrite with thermometry quartz sample was used for the sulfur isotope experiments. Stable isotope analysis was performed at the Hatch Stable Isotope Laboratory in the University of Ottawa, Canada.

40|$|We {{describe}} the mineralogy, geochemistry, and mesomicrostructure of fresh subvolcanic blocks erupted during the 5 April 2003 paroxysm of Stromboli (Aeolian Islands, Italy). These blocks represent ∼ 50 vol. % {{of the total}} erupted ejecta and consist of fine- to medium-grained basaltic lithotypes ranging from relatively homogeneous dolerites to strongly or poorly welded magmatic breccias. The breccia components are represented by angular fragments of dolerites entrapped in a matrix of vesiculated (lava-like to scoriae) crystal-rich (CR) basalt. All of the studied blocks are cognates with the CR basalt of the normal Strombolian activity or lavas and they are often coated by a few-centimeter thick layer of crystal-poor (CP) basaltic pumice erupted during the paroxysm. We suggest that they result from the rapid increase of pressure and related <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rock</b> failure that occurred shortly before the 5 April 2003 explosion, when the uppermost portion of the edifice inflated and suffered brecciation {{as the result of}} the sudden rise of the gas-rich CP basalt that triggered the eruption. Dolerites and magmatic matrix of the breccias show major and trace element compositions that match those of the CR basalts erupted during normal Strombolian activity and effusive events at Stromboli volcano. Dolerites consist of (a) phenocrysts normally found in the CR basalts and (b) late-stage magmatic minerals such as sanidine, An 60 - 28 plagioclase, Fe–Mn-rich olivines (Fo 68 - 48), phlogopite, apatite, and opaque mineral pairs (magnetite and ilmenite), most of which are never found both in lava flows and scoriae erupted during the persistent explosive activity that characterizes typical Strombolian behavior. Subvolcanic crystallization of the Stromboli CR magma, leading to slowly cooled equivalents of basalts, could result from transient drainage of the magma from the summit craters to lower levels. Fingering and engulfing of the material that collapsed from the summit crater floor into the shallow basaltic system during the late evening of 28 December 2002 coupled with the short break in the summit persistent explosions between December 2002 and March 2003 permitted the CR magma pockets to solidify as dolerites, which were confined to the uppermost portion of the system and thus not involved in the ongoing flank effusive activity. Crystal size distribution of the basaltic blocks and crystallization of the finer-grained (< 0. 1 mm) mafic minerals of the dolerites over a time interval of ∼ 100 days closely agrees with the above interpretation. Vesicle filling (miarolitic cavities) locally found in some dolerites, with minerals deposited as vapor-phase crystallization is a result of continuous gas percolation through the rocks of the uppermost portion of the volcanic system. Poorly welded magmatic breccias formed during syn-eruptive processes of 5 April 2003, when the paroxysm strongly shattered the shallow subvolcanic system and many dolerite fragments were entrapped in the CR magma. In contrast, the high degree of welding between the dolerite clasts and the CR basaltic matrix in the strongly welded magmatic breccias provides a snapshot of subvolcanic intrusions of the CR basalt into the dolerite when, after a 2 -month break in activity, CR magmas started to rise again to the summit craters. Blocks similar to these subvolcanic ejecta of 5 April 2003 were also erupted during previous paroxysms (e. g., 1930) suggesting that changes in the usual Strombolian activity (e. g., short breaks in the persistent mild explosions and/or flank effusive activity) lead to transient crystallization of dolerites in the shallow plumbing system...|$|E
40|$|Pyrometamorphic ejecta erupted {{during recent}} {{paroxysmal}} explosions and hydrothermally altered volcanic and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> from Stromboli volcano (Aeolian Islands, Italy) were studied by combined polarizing microscopy, electron microprobe, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, {{transmission electron microscope}} and whole-rock inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry-mass spectrometry analysis. The pyrometamorphic ejecta are compositionally heterogeneous at the macro- and micro-scale, and are classified as buchites; that is, glass coupled with a high-temperature, low-pressure modal mineralogy. Three distinct facies (i. e. cordierite-plagioclase, mullite-plagioclase palisade and tridymite-clinopyroxene) are recognized among the buchites, whose bulk-rock chemistry is compatible with aluminous- to silica-rich protoliths. Abundant mineral growth (e. g. plagioclase palisades and clinopyroxene coronae) occurs at the contact between the ejecta and the crystal-rich host shoshonitic basalt, which typically coats the pyrometamorphic blocks. Mineral constraints, pseudoporphyritic microstructures, plagioclase relict phenocrysts and major and trace element compositions strongly support {{the origin of the}} buchite ejecta as hydrothermally altered rocks from theVancori edifice (a period of activity spanning > 10 kyr), which underwent high-temperature, low-pressure contact metamorphism. In the uppermost magmatic system of an active island arc volcano, such as Stromboli, volcanic and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> usually undergo alteration processes induced by acid-sulphate hydrothermal systems. The circulation of acidic fluids results in leaching of the Stromboli rocks (in {{the upper part of the}} volcano edifice) and, depending on the pH, temperature and exposure time to the hydrothermal fluids, production of different alteration facies. The hydrothermally altered Stromboli rocks show facies consistent with argillic to silicic alteration, containing abundant hydrous sulphate and hydroxy-sulphate minerals such as the alunite group minerals, hexahydrite, millosevichite, pickeringite and kieserite. The hydrothermally altered wall-rocks, heated by contact with the basaltic magma of the feeder dyke system of Stromboli, can easily undergo pyrometamorphic processes, inducing partial melting and subsolidus crystallization of the volcanic protoliths. This results in the development of buchite rocks at the magma-hydrothermal system interface...|$|R
40|$|Kajan <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Urumieh–Dokhtar magmatic arc (UDMA), Central Iran, form a Late Miocene-Pliocene shallow-level intrusion. These subvolcanics {{correspond}} {{to a variety}} of intermediate and felsic rocks, comprising quartz diorite, quartz monzodiorite, tonalite and granite. These lithologies are medium-K calc-alkaline, with SiO 2 (wt. %) varying from 52 % (wt. %) to 75 (wt. %). The major element chemical data also show that MgO, CaO, TiO 2, P 2 O 5, MnO, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 define linear trends with negative slopes against SiO 2, whilst Na 2 O and K 2 O are positively correlated with silica. Contents of incompatible trace elements (e. g. Ba, Rb, Nb, La and Zr) become higher with increasing SiO 2, whereas Sr shows an opposite behaviour. Chondrite-normalized multi-element patterns show enrichment in LILE relative to HFSE and troughs in Nb, P and Ti. These observations are typical of subduction related magmas that formed in an active continental margin. The Kajan rocks show a strong affinity with calc-alkaline arc magmas, confirmed by REE fractionation (LaN/YbN = 4. 5 – 6. 4) with moderate HREE fractionation (SmN/YbN = 1. 08 – 1. 57). The negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* < 1), the low to moderate Sr content (< 400 ppm) and the Dy/Yb values reflect plagioclase and hornblende (+- clinopyroxene) fractionation from a calc-alkaline melt Whole–rock Sr and Nd isotope analyses show that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr initial ratios vary from 0. 704432 to 0. 705989, and the 143 Nd/ 144 Nd initial ratios go from 0. 512722 to 0. 512813. All the studied samples have similar Sr-Nd isotopes, indicating an origin from a similar source, with granite samples that has more radiogenic Sr and low radiogenic Nd isotopes, suggesting a minor interaction with upper crust during magma ascent. The Kajan <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> plot within the depleted mantle quadrant of the conventional Sr-Nd isotope diagram, a compositional region corresponding to mantle-derived igneous rocks...|$|R

In this area, dacitic to rhyolitic rocks, are interfingered within a detritic sequence, showing {{a very complex}} spatio-temporal relationship. This starts with dacitic coherent and volcaniclastic facies, followed by rhyolitic pyroclastics and other volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks. The whole sequence was finally intruded by shallow <b>subvolcanic</b> acid <b>rocks</b> in various styles. These local, complex variations in igneous processes cannot be interpreted in terms {{of any of the}} evolutionary models for the IPB magmatism, implying that current larger-scale general models of igneous evolution in this region should be considered with cautio...|$|R
40|$|A late Mesozoic belt of volcanic–intrusive {{complexes}} {{occurs in}} SE China. Volcanic activity at Xiangshan in the NW {{of the belt}} took place mainly in the Late Jurassic (158 – 135 Ma). The volcanic rocks from the Xiangshan volcanic complex include rhyolitic crystal tuffs, welded tuffs, rhyolite lavas, porphyritic lavas, and associated <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks.</b> Mineral assemblages in these magmatic rocks include K-feldspar, plagioclase, quartz, Fe-rich biotite and minor amphibole, orthopyroxene and almandine. Mineral geothermometry indicates a high crystallization temperature (> 850 C) for the Xiangshan magmas. The volcanic rocks are generally peraluminous; SiO 2 contents are between 654 % and 768 % and the samples have high alkalis, rare earth elements (REE), high field strength elements and Ga contents and high Ga/Al ratios, but are depleted in Ba, Sr and transition metals. Trace element geochemistry and Sr–Nd–O isotope systematics imply that the Xiangshan magma...|$|R
40|$|Basic {{volcanic}} and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> {{have been}} geochemically studied to provide new {{evidence for the}} location of the axis of the Cambrian rift of the Ossa-Morena Zone. The results of the analysis of various subvolcanic gabbros point to the location proposed by Giese and Bühn (7993), who studied lava-flows of a traverse of the Ossa-Morena Zone. This study has shown that gabbros of the northern limb of the Monesterio Antiform show an alkaline character, whereas those of the southern limb are clearly more subalkaline, showing MORB or volcanic-arc characteristics. Basic volcanics of the northern limb and some of the southern limb plot on within-plate environments, whereas those on the southernmost studied sector show a plate-margin emplacement enviroment. Finally, lava-flows and gabbros from the northern limb show an alkaline-transitional within-plate basalt character, those of the Jerez de los Caballeros sector indicate an alcaline or tholeiitic within-plate and MORB nature and those of the Lora del Rio area show a MORB or volcanic-arc natur...|$|R
40|$|The GuarguarÆz Complex, {{basement}} of the Cordillera Frontal, included in the proposed Chilenia Terrane, consists of metasedimentary rocks deposited in clastic and carbonatic platforms. Turbiditic sequences point out to slope or external platform environments. According to geochemical data, the sedimentary protoliths derived through erosion of a mature cratonic continental basement. Volcanic and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> with N and E-MORB signature were interbeded in the metasedimentary rocks during basin development. A compressional stage, starting with progressive deformation and metamorphism, followed this extensional stage. Continuing deformation led to the emplacement of slices of oceanic crust, conforming an accretionary prism during Late Devonian. The GuarguarÆz Complex and equivalent units in western Precordillera {{and also in the}} Chilean Coastal Cordillera share common evolutional stages, widely represented along the western Gondwana margin. These evidences imply that Chilenia is not an allochthonous terrane to Gondwana, but a portion of its Early Paleozoic margin. Regional configuration indicates that the GuarguarÆz Complex and equivalent units represent the accretionary prism of the Famatinian arc (Middle Ordovician-Late Devonian) ...|$|R

It is constituted by rocks of paleoproterozoic age of Rio Apa Complex, Alto Tererê Group and the plutonic-volcanic suites of the Amoguijá Group, subdivided in Alumiador Intrusive suits and Serra da Bocaina Volcanic. The Volcanic Suite is represented by São Francisco and Bocaina mountains and is constituted by terms of the composition of alkali - rhyolitic to rhyolitic, including in minor amounts riodacite, andesite and dacite. It consists {{of a variety of}} textual <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks,</b> volcanic and varied volcanoclastics. The pyroclastic deposits are very expressive and consist of pyroclastic particle immerse in aphanitic matrix, fine grained or amorphous, where quartz, feldspar, chlorite, sericite, microlithes of carbonate, sparse spherulites and reliquiar volcanic glass can be distinguished. The pyroclastic rocks are represented by breccias, ignimbrites, agglomerate, tuffs, lapillistones and pumices and contain commonly vitroclasts, lithoclasts and crystalloclasts, pumices, fiammes, glass shards, spherulites, vesicles and amygdales. They are calc-alkaline rocks with dominant peraluminous character high to middle potassium series and define a sin-colisional dominant tectonic and are genetically associated to the evolution of the Amoguijá Magmatic Arc...|$|R
40|$|The Astaneh area {{belongs to}} the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone (SSZ) in Western Iran. The igneous rocks in this area consist of tonalite, granodiorite, monzogranite and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> (rhyodacites). The mineral {{chemistry}} and microprobe analysis of mineral assemblages in these rocks indicate that the magma in this area has a metaluminous to slightly peraluminous composition, related to calc-alkaline, arc-type magmas and displays features typical of I-type granitoids. Also, the average of minimum pressure is estimated at 1. 37 kbars in tonalites whereas the maximum pressure is 6. 58 kbars in pargasite in dacitic enclaves. The maximum temperature is 767 °C in pargasitic amphibole crystallized in dacitic enclave whereas the minimum temperature is 650 °C in tonalite. All analyzed samples have log fO 2 in the range between - 13 (in dacitic enclave) to - 18. 3 (in tonalite) and - 15 (in tonalitic enclave), respectively, which show this magma crystallized in high fO 2. The presence of phenocrysts of plagioclase (An = 80 - 90) together with plagioclase (An = 35 - 40), pargasitic amphibole in dacitic enclave and oscillatory zoned plagioclase in rhyodacites might {{be accounted for by}} a magma mixing model in the subvolcanics of Astaneh...|$|R
40|$|The Delitzsch Complex {{consists}} of late Cretaceous ultramafic lamprophyres and carbonatitic rocks. They form dikes and diatremes, emplaced into Palaeozoic to lower Permian volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and {{are covered by}} up to 120 m thick sequences of Tertiary sedimentary rocks. The complex includes a diversity of magmatic and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks.</b> The lithologies range from monchiquites and alkali picrites to dolomite– and calcite–carbonatites (rauhaugites, beforsites, and alvikites), and ultramafic lamprophyres (alnöites, aillikites). Contact relationships {{and the distribution of}} xenolithic material indicate that phases of carbonatitic and ultramafic lamprophyre magmatism overlapped. New U–Pb ages (72 ± 1 Ma on baddeleyite) from a dolomite–carbonatite (beforsite), Rb–Sr ages (73 ± 2 Ma on phlogopite) from an ultramafic lamprophyre (alnöite) in combination with modeling of the effect of the initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of phlogopite on the isochron ages of dolomite– and calcite–carbonatites demonstrate: (1) a short duration of magmatic activity for the main phases of the subvolcanic emplacement of the Delitzsch Complex; (2) phlogopite crystals in carbonatites of the Delitzsch Complex are xenocrysts; (3) the calculated initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr composition of xenocrystic phlogopite equals the initial Sr composition of phlogopite from the alnöite...|$|R
500|$|Ages of 5.3 to 1.6 mya {{have been}} {{estimated}} via potassium-argon dating of the andesite lavas and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks.</b> An age of 5.3±1.9 mya on lavas {{in the northern}} part of the volcanic complex is the oldest obtained date. Other dating has resulted in ages of 3.9±1.3 mya for Pico Laco's dome, 3.8±0.9 mya for lavas beneath San Vicente Bayo, 3.7±0.9 mya for a lava front next to Laco Norte, 2.6±0.6 for Crystales Grandes, 2.1±0.4 for Hueso Chico, and 1.6±0.5 for [...] "Volcano 5009". Cordon de Puntas Negras has younger dates. Another date from Pico Laco is 2.0±0.3 mya. Later alteration included hydrothermal alteration and glacial erosion; the former has left bleached rocks and exhalation deposits. Some minor metasomatic alteration occurred at the contact sites between andesites and iron-containing rocks. Hydrothermal alteration has also been described for lower portions of the volcanic pile and probably occurred because of gases escaping from intruded magma. Moraines found west of El Laco were generated by glaciation both on El Laco and Puntas Negras. Surface exposure dating has indicated ages of 226 and 287 ka for some ice-affected lavas. Further, andesitic volcanism in neighbouring volcanoes has blanketed El Laco. Reports exist of continuing fumarolic activity and hot springs with the deposition of clay and other minerals.|$|R
40|$|Neyshabour {{turquoise}} mine {{is located}} in northwest of Neyshabour, southern Quchan volcanic belt. Eocene andesite and dacite forming as lava and pyroclastic rocks cover most of the area. Subvolcanic diorite to syenite porphyry (granitoids of magnetite series) intruded the volcanic rocks. Both volcanic and <b>subvolcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> are highly altered. Four types of alteration are recognized including: silicification, argillic, calcification and propylitic. Silicification is dominant followed by argillic alteration. Mineralization is present as stockwork, disseminated and hydrothermal breccia. Hypogene minerals are pyrite, magnetite, specularite, chalcopyrite, and bornite. Secondary minerals are turquoise, chalcocite, covellite, and iron oxides. A broad zone of gossan has developed in the area. Oxidized zone has a thickness of about 80 m. Mineralized samples show high anomalies of Cu, Au, Zn, As, Mo, Co, U, LREE, Nb, and Th. Both aeromagnetic and radiometric (U and Th) maps show very strong anomalies (10 × 5 km) within the mineralized area. Based on geology, alteration, mineralization, geochemistry, and geophysics, Neyshabour turquoise mine is a large Iron oxide Cu-Au-U-LREE (IOCG) mineralized system. In comparison with other IOCG deposits, it has some similarities with Olympic Dam (Australia) and Candelaria (Chile). In comparison with Qaleh Zari and Kuh Zar mines, Neyshabour turquoise mine is the first Iron oxide Cu-Au-U-LREE (IOCG) mineralized system discovered in Iran. ...|$|R
