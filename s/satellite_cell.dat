40|$|Sensory neurones from nodose ganglia of new-born rats {{were grown}} in dissociated tissue culture either {{with or without}} <b>satellite</b> <b>cells.</b> When cultured without <b>satellite</b> <b>cells,</b> most neurones {{developed}} sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh); time-course experiments indicated that the neurones acquire their sensitivity during the second to third week in culture. Most neurones co-cultured with <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> did not develop ACh sensitivity. Delayed removal of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> 8 - 12 days after plating resulted in few neurones acquiring ACh sensitivity. Delayed addition of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> to neuronal cultures that were initially grown without <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> {{had no effect on}} the number of ACh-sensitive neurones. The potential to develop ACh sensitivity in culture without <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> decreases with the age of the neurones at the time of culturing; few neurones from 2 -week-old animals developed sensitivity to ACh when cultured without <b>satellite</b> <b>cells.</b> These results indicate that there is some influence from <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> that prevents nodose neurones from developing ACh sensitivity in culture and suggests that this influence may also operate in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish the optimum protocol for the isolation and culture of porcine muscle <b>satellite</b> <b>cells.</b> Mononuclear muscle <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> are a kind of adult stem cell, which is located between the basal lamina and sarcolemma of muscle fibers and is the primary source of myogenic precursor cells in postnatal muscle. Muscle <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> are a useful model to investigate the mechanisms of muscle growth and development. Although the isolation and culture protocols of muscle <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> in some species (e. g. mouse) have been established successfully, the culture system for porcine muscle <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> is very limited. In this study, we optimized the isolation procedure of porcine muscle <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> and elaborated the isolation and culture process in detail. Furthermore, we characterized the porcine muscle <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> using the immunofluorecence. Our study provides a reference for the isolation of porcine muscle <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> and will be useful for studying the molecular mechanisms in these cells...|$|R
50|$|In {{undamaged}} muscle, {{the majority}} of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> are quiescent; they neither differentiate nor undergo cell division.

50|$|MEGF10 is a {{regulator}} of <b>satellite</b> <b>cell</b> myogenesis and {{interacts with}} Notch1 in myoblasts. It {{has been shown}} to be the cause of early-onset myopathy, areflexia, respiratory distress and dysphagia.|$|E
50|$|Satellite {{cells are}} small {{mononuclear}} cells that abut the muscle fiber. Satellite cells are normally activated upon injury or exercise. These cells then differentiate and fuse into the muscle fiber, helping {{to maintain its}} function.

50|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>cell</b> {{activation}} {{has also}} been demonstrated on an ultrastructural level following exercise. Aerobic exercise {{has been shown to}} significantly increase granular endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes, and mitochondria of the stimulated muscle groups. Additionally, satellite cells have been shown to fuse with muscle fibers, developing new muscle fibers. Other ultrastructural evidence for activated satellite cells include increased concentration of Golgi apparatus and pinocytotic vesicles.|$|E

40|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>cells,</b> {{normally}} quiescent {{underneath the}} myofibre basal lamina, are skeletal muscle stem cells responsible for postnatal muscle growth, repair and regeneration. Since their scarcity and small size have limited study on transverse muscle sections, techniques to isolate individual myofibres, bearing their attendant <b>satellite</b> <b>cells,</b> were developed. Studies on mouse myofibres have generated much information on <b>satellite</b> <b>cells,</b> but the limited availability and {{small size of}} human muscle biopsies have hampered equivalent studies of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> on human myofibres.

40|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>cells</b> provide {{skeletal}} muscle with a remarkable capacity for repeated repair and regeneration. Quiescent <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> are MyoD-ve, with MyoD being induced in > 98 % of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> within 24 hrs of activation (Zammit, Exp. Cell Res. 281, 39, 2002). Here, we explore the subsequent fate of these <b>satellite</b> <b>cells,</b> as they proliferate {{and begin to}} differentiate. <b>Satellite</b> <b>cells</b> associated with myofibres, cultured without exposure to serum/CEE, still activated MyoD but the majority failed to divide, demonstrating an uncoupling of the two events. In contrast, myofibres cultured with serum/CEE had clones of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells.</b> MyoD-ve cells were detected in these clones, in which {{the rest of the}} cells were MyoD+ve, implying they had arisen after division but were not adopting the same fate. Three possible explanations for MyoD-ve cells were explored: phosphorylated histone markers and BrdU labelling showed that the lack of MyoD was not cell cycle dependent; myogenin immunostaining demonstrated that <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> committing to differentiation initially contained MyoD; Pax 7 expression was generally down-regulated in the majority of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> by 72 hrs, but some remained strongly Pax 7 +ve. Together, these data suggest that MyoD-ve cells are returning to a quiescent state...|$|R
50|$|A {{rapid and}} {{transient}} localization of the IL-6 receptor and increased IL-6 expression occurs in satellite cells following contractions. IL-6 {{has been shown}} to mediatehypertrophic muscle growth both in vitro and in vivo. Unaccustomed exercise can increase IL-6 by up to sixfold at 5 hours post-exercise and threefold 8 days after exercise. Also telling is the fact that NSAIDs can decrease <b>satellite</b> <b>cell</b> response to exercise, thereby reducing exercise-induced protein synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Human {{studies have}} shown that both high {{resistance}} training and endurance training have yielded an increased number of satellite cells. These results suggest that a light, endurance training regimen may be useful to counteract the age-correlated <b>satellite</b> <b>cell</b> decrease. In high-resistance training, activation and proliferation of satellite cells are evidenced by increased cyclin D1 mRNA, and p21 mRNA levels. This is consistent with the fact that cyclin D1 and p21 upregulation correlates to division and differentiation of cells.|$|E
5000|$|There is a known {{relationship}} between inflammation and muscle growth. [...] For instance, {{high doses of}} anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g., NSAIDs) are able to blunt muscle growth.

Long term effects include less muscular hypertrophy and an altered cell structure of muscle fibers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>cells</b> {{express a}} number of {{distinctive}} genetic markers. Current thinking is that most <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> express PAX7 and PAX3. <b>Satellite</b> <b>cells</b> in the head musculature have a unique developmental program, and are Pax3-negative. Moreover, both quiescent and activated human <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> can be identified by the membrane-bound neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM/CD56/Leu-19), a cell-surface glycoprotein. Myocyte nuclear factor (MNF), and c-met proto-oncogene (receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)) are less commonly used markers.|$|R

In 1349 it became independent from Kenilworth {{with the right to}} elect its own prior. It was always a small and relatively poor establishment. After the death of the prior in 1530 only one canon remained in residence and in 1532 the house was suppressed and handed over to Rocester Abbey for disposal. By 1543 the property had been acquired by the Fleetwood family, who converted the priory buildings into a dwelling house.|$|E
50|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>cells</b> are {{described}} as quiescent myoblasts and neighbor muscle fiber sarcolemma.

40|$|SummaryAdult {{skeletal}} muscle possesses a remarkable regenerative capacity, {{due to the}} presence of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells,</b> adult muscle stem cells. We used fate-mapping techniques in avian and mouse models to show that trunk (Pax 3 +) and cranial (MesP 1 +) {{skeletal muscle}} and <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> derive from separate genetic lineages. Similar lineage heterogeneity is seen within the head musculature and <b>satellite</b> <b>cells,</b> due to their shared, heterogenic embryonic origins. Lineage tracing experiments with Isl 1 Cre mice demonstrated the robust contribution of Isl 1 + cells to distinct jaw muscle-derived <b>satellite</b> <b>cells.</b> Transplantation of myofiber-associated, Isl 1 -derived <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> into damaged limb muscle contributed to muscle regeneration. In vitro experiments demonstrated the cardiogenic nature of cranial- but not trunk-derived <b>satellite</b> <b>cells.</b> Finally, overexpression of Isl 1 in the branchiomeric muscles of chick embryos inhibited skeletal muscle differentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this gene plays a role in the specification of cardiovascular and skeletal muscle stem cell progenitors...|$|R
40|$|Sensory neurones from new-born rat nodose ganglia {{were grown}} in tissue culture, either {{with or without}} the ganglionic <b>satellite</b> <b>cells,</b> in order to {{investigate}} influences of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> on sensory neurone development. To learn more about the post-natal development of nodose ganglia in rats neuronal counts of the ganglion were made at three different developmental stages. There were no significant differences of neuronal number in nodose ganglia in new-born rats, rats 3 weeks of age, and adult rats. Up to 60 % of the neurones formed synapses with each other when they developed in culture without ganglion <b>satellite</b> <b>cells.</b> Pharmacological experiments indicated that the transmitter at these synapses was ACh and the post-synaptic receptors were nicotinic. Neurones co-cultured with <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> rarely formed functional synapses and most (85 %) were not sensitive to ACh: 75 % of neurones cultured without <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> were ACh sensitive. These results provide evidence that mammalian sensory neurones form synapses among each other in culture. The results also suggest that ganglionic <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> prevent functional synapses among these neurones from occurring, in part because the neurones do not express ACh sensitivity when co-cultured with <b>satellite</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Satellite cells proliferate {{following}} muscle {{trauma and}} form new myofibers {{through a process}} similar to fetal muscle development. After several cell divisions, the satellite cells begin to fuse with the damaged myotubes and undergo further differentiations and maturation, with peripheral nuclei as in hallmark. One of the first roles described for IGF-1 was its involvement in the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells. In addition, IGF-1 expression in skeletal muscle extends the capacity to activate <b>satellite</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation (Charkravarthy, et al., 2000), increasing and prolonging the beneficial effects to the aging muscle.|$|E
50|$|CD34 and Myf5 markers {{specifically}} {{define the}} majority of quiescent satellite cells. Activated satellite cells prove problematic to identify, especially as their markers change with the degree of activation; for example, greater activation results in the progressive loss of Pax7 expression {{as they enter the}} proliferative stage. However, Pax7 is expressed prominently after <b>satellite</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. Greater activation also results in increased expression of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors MyoD, myogenin, and MRF4 - all responsible for the induction of myocyte-specific genes. HGF testing is also used to identify active satellite cells. Activated satellite cells also begin expressing muscle-specific filament proteins such as desmin as they differentiate.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{research}} indicating that <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> are negatively regulated by a protein called myostatin.

40|$|During ageing, muscle stem-cell {{regenerative}} function declines. At advanced geriatric age, {{this decline}} is maximal owing to {{transition from a}} normal quiescence into an irreversible senescence state. How <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> maintain quiescence and avoid senescence until advanced age remains unknown. Here we report that basal autophagy is essential to maintain the stem-cell quiescent state in mice. Failure of autophagy in physiologically aged <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> or genetic impairment of autophagy in young cells causes entry into senescence by loss of proteostasis, increased mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, resulting in {{a decline in the}} function and number of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells.</b> Re-establishment of autophagy reverses senescence and restores regenerative functions in geriatric <b>satellite</b> <b>cells.</b> As autophagy also declines in human geriatric <b>satellite</b> <b>cells,</b> our findings reveal autophagy to be a decisive stem-cell-fate regulator, with implications for fostering muscle regeneration in sarcopenia...|$|R
40|$|Myogenic {{precursors}} {{in adult}} skeletal muscle (<b>satellite</b> <b>cells)</b> are mitotically quiescent but can proliferate {{in response to}} a variety of stresses including muscle injury. To gain further understanding of adult myoblasts, we are analyzing myogenesis of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> on fibers isolated from adult rat muscle. In this culture model, <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> are maintained in their in situ position underneath the fiber basement membrane. Employing two different approaches to monitor proliferation of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> on isolated fibers (autoradiography following ~H-thymidine incorporation and immunofluorescence of cells positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)), we show in the present study that <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> initiate cell proliferation at 12 to 24 hours following fiber culture establishment and that cell proliferation is reduced to minimal levels by 60 to 72 hours in culture. Maximal number of proliferating cells is seen at 36 to 48 hours in culture. These PCNA+ <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> transit into the differentiated, myogenin+ state following about 24 hours in the proliferative state.

50|$|It is {{suggested}} that exercise triggers the release of signaling molecules including inflammatory substances, cytokines and growth factors from surrounding connective tissues and active skeletal muscles. Notably, HGF, a cytokine, is transferred from the extracellular matrix into muscles through the nitric-oxide dependent pathway. It is thought that HGF activates satellite cells, while insulin growth factor-I (IGF-1) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) enhance <b>satellite</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation rate following activation. Studies have demonstrated that intense exercise generally increases IGF-1 production, though individual responses vary significantly. More specifically, IGF-1 exists in two isoforms: mechano growth factor (MGF) and IGF-IEa. While the former induces activation and proliferation, the latter causes differentiation of proliferating satellite cells.|$|E
5000|$|During aging, {{there is}} a gradual {{decrease}} {{in the ability to}} maintain skeletal muscle function and mass, known as sarcopenia.

Sarcopenia is a normal aspect of aging, and is not actually a disease state yet can be linked to many injuries in the elderly population as well as decreasing quality of life.|$|E
50|$|Protein in the {{residual}} yolk {{is the source}} of antibodies from the chicken. To be effective, it is important that maternal antibodies move from {{the residual}} yolk into the bloodstream but also to sites of vulnerability such as the mucosal surfaces where bacteria and viruses can enter the body. Dibner et al. (1998) evaluated the effect of early feeding {{on the development of the}} immune system in broiler chickens. They showed that providing nutrients immediately post hatch resulted in heavier bursa weight, earlier appearance of biliary IgA and germinal centers (secondary lymphoid organs), and an improved resistance to a disease challenge. In broiler chickens the first week of life is not only important for further development of the gastrointestinal tract and important immune related organs but is also an important period for muscle production. Halevy et al. (2000) showed that the length and timing of fasting post hatch affects <b>satellite</b> <b>cell</b> activity. Short-term fasting can enhance <b>satellite</b> <b>cell</b> number. However, long-term fasting almost completely arrests cell mitosis and decreases the number of satellite cells. In the study of Halevy et al., (2000) the chickens that fasted during the first days of life did not regain their body weight or breast muscle weight by day 41, however chickens that fasted between day 4 and 6 post hatch had full growth compensation by day 41. Halevy et al. (2000) concluded that sufficient feed directly post hatch may be critical for later muscle development. A study of Noy and Sklan (1999) also showed that early feeding increased body weight and breast size at marketing age in chickens and poults. They showed that early feeding reduced mortality numerically.|$|E
50|$|These acute {{increases}} in cytokines, {{as a response}} to muscle contractions, help initiate the process of muscle repair and growth by activating <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> within the inflamed muscle. <b>Satellite</b> <b>cells</b> are crucial for skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise.

Information on <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> is not abundant; however, {{they appear to}} provide mechanical and metabolic support for neurons by forming an envelope surrounding their cell bodies. Although there is a heterogeneous population of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> have been described to be a homogeneous group of perineuronal cells. Our objective was to characterize the ultrastructure, immunohistochemistry, and histochemistry of the <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> of the dorsal root ganglia of 17 adult 3 - 4 -month-old Wistar rats of both genders. Ultrastructurally, the nuclei of some <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> are heterochromatic, whereas others are euchromatic, which may result from different amounts of nuclear activity. We observed positive immunoreactivity for S- 100 and vimentin in the cytoplasm of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells.</b> The intensity of S- 100 protein varied according {{to the size of}} the enveloped neuron. We also noted that vimentin expression assumed a ring-like pattern and was preferentially located in the cytoplasm around the areas stained for S- 100. In addition, we observed nitric oxide synthase-positive small-sized neurons and negative large-sized neurons equal to that described in the literature. <b>Satellite</b> <b>cells</b> were also positive for NADPH-diaphorase, particularly those associated with small-sized neurons.

40|$|SummaryPax 7 is a nodal {{transcription}} factor {{that is essential}} for regulating the maintenance, expansion, and myogenic identity of <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> during both neonatal and adult myogenesis.

Here, we show that ectopic expression of the constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch 1 (NICD 1) rescues the loss of Pax 7 -deficient <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> and restores their proliferative potential. Strikingly NICD 1 -expressing <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> do not undergo myogenic differentiation and instead acquire a brown adipogenic fate both in vivo and in vitro. NICD-expressing Pax 7 −/− <b>satellite</b> <b>cells</b> fail to upregulate MyoD and instead express the brown adipogenic marker PRDM 16.
