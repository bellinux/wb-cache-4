We {{extend our}} spiral galaxy models that {{successfully}} describe nearby template spectra {{as well as}} the redshift evolution of CFRS and HDF spirals to include – in a chemically consistent way – the redshift evolution of a series of individual elements. Comparison with observed DLA abundances shows that DLAs might well be the progenitors of present-day <b>spiral</b> <b>types</b> Sa through Sd. Our models bridge the gap between high redshift DLA and nearby spiral HII region abundances. The slow redshift evolution of DLA abundances is a natural consequence of the long SF timescales for disks, the scatter at any redshift reflects the range of SF timescales from early to late <b>spiral</b> <b>types.</b> We claim that while at high redshift all <b>spiral</b> progenitor <b>types</b> seem to give rise to DLA absorption, towards low redshifts, the early <b>type</b> <b>spirals</b> seem to drop out of DLA samples due to low gas and/or high metal and dust content.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the plasma {{production}} mechanism, the profiles of the inductive electromotive forces (IEMF) penetrated in the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) are discussed. Magnetic probe measurements were performed in the high dense argon ICP using different <b>types</b> of <b>antenna.</b> The IEMF {{is an important factor}} to heat the electrons in the ICP production and is closely related to the ICP production efficiency. The edge <b>type</b> <b>antenna</b> gave the deep IEMF penetration, which showed a high plasma production efficiency at the same discharge power. The deep IEMF penetration could introduce the energy in the deeper region of the plasma and contributed to the efficient ICP production due to the suppression of the heated electron extinction at the quartz wall. The 100 mm wide antenna showed that the IEMF attenuation coefficient at the antenna center level was higher than that at the antenna bottom-edge level, and it was the same as the IEMF attenuation coefficient of the edge <b>type</b> <b>antenna.</b> This result implied that the antenna bottom-edges were {{an important part of the}} ICP production...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate possible gender differences in the morphology of the gallbladder channel (DC). A total sample consists of 50 anatomical liver taken from autopsy cases of both sexes (32 men and 18 women). Samples of liver were fixed in 4 % formalin for 4 weeks, and then studied microdissected under scrutiny. We were working length measurement channels of the gallbladder (DC) and typing of junction of the cystic (DC) with the common hepatic duct (DHC). We classify anatomical junction variations DC with DHC into three types: angular, parallel and <b>spiral</b> <b>type,</b> and then performed statistical analysis of the data with respect to gender. Results: The angular type compound we found approximately at 2 / 3 or 64 % of the samples (men- 60 % of women- 72 %), the parallel type combination of a total of 22 % of the sample (men- 31 % of women- 6 %) and <b>spiral</b> <b>type</b> of 14 % of the samples (males- 9 %, women 22 %). Parallel and <b>spiral</b> <b>type</b> together make up about 1 / 3 of the cases. The average length of DC is 3. 1 cm and the variation interval of 1. 7 to 6. 2 cm.
