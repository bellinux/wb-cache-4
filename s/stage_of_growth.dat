The first photosynthetic structures, the cotyledons, develop from the hypocotyl, the first plant structure to emerge from the soil. These cotyledons both act as leaves and as a source of nutrients for the immature plant, providing the seedling nutrition for its first 7 to 10 days.|$|E

2500|$|Kudzu spreads by {{vegetative}} reproduction via stolons (runners) that root at the nodes to form new plants and by rhizomes. [...] Kudzu will also spread by seeds, which {{are contained in}} pods and mature in the autumn, although this is rare. One or two viable seeds are produced per cluster of pods. The hard-coated seeds can remain viable for several years, and will successfully germinate only when soil is persistently soggy for five to seven days, with temperatures above 20°C (68°F). [...] Once germinated, saplings must be kept in a well-drained medium that retains high moisture. During this <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth,</b> it is critical for kudzu to receive as much sunlight as possible. Kudzu saplings are sensitive to mechanical disturbance, and are damaged by chemical fertilizers. They do not tolerate long periods of shade, or high water tables.|$|E

2500|$|A bird's {{feathers}} undergo {{wear and}} tear and are replaced periodically during the bird's life through molting. New feathers, known when developing as blood, or pin feathers, depending on the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth,</b> are formed through the same follicles from which the old ones were fledged. The presence of melanin in feathers increases their resistance to abrasion. One study notes that melanin based feathers were observed to degrade more quickly under bacterial action, even compared to unpigmented feathers from the same species, than those unpigmented or with carotenoid pigments. However, another study the same year compared the action of bacteria on pigmentations of two song sparrow species and observed that the darker pigmented feathers were more resistant; the authors cited other research also published in 2004 that stated increased melanin provided greater resistance. [...] They observed that the greater resistance of the darker birds confirmed Gloger's rule.|$|E

The impact of water stress was more pronounced when applied at grain filling. Use of foliar micronutrient increased grain yield in water stress. On the other hand, use of Mn foliar application had the highest positive effect on yield components and grain yield. Free proline and total soluble carbohydrate concentration were increased under water stress at all <b>of</b> the three <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth.</b> The highest concentration of these two components was found on the flowering stage.

60|$|They greeted our {{approach}} {{with the most}} discordant din it had ever been my fortune to hear. A mingling of honk and cackle, it manifested not excitement so much as curiosity. I walked among the boobies, and they never moved except to pick at me with long, sharp bills. Many were sitting on nests, and all around in the sand were nests with eggs, and little boobies just hatched, and others in every <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth,</b> up to big babies of birds like huge balls of pure white wool.

In parts there were ugly snags, and everywhere the turns were so puzzling, that I marvelled how a human being could attempt the passage by night.

60|$|To begin with, such {{a metaphor}} is always as distracting as a mixed metaphor. It is a {{double-edged}} tool that cuts both ways; and consequently opposite ways. We {{use the same}} word 'young' to mean two opposite extremes. We mean something at an early <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth,</b> and also something having the latest fruits of growth. We might call a commonwealth young if it conducted all its daily conversation by wireless telegraphy; meaning that it was progressive. But we might also call it young if it conducted all its industry with chipped flints; meaning that it was primitive. These two meanings of youth are hopelessly mixed up when the word is applied to America. But what is more curious, the two elements really are wildly entangled in America. America {{is in some ways}} what is called in advance of the times, and in some ways what is called behind the times; but it seems a little confusing to convey both notions by the same word.|$|E

60|$|There {{is another}} and equally curious {{branch of the}} present subject; namely, the {{comparison}} not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists believe that {{the bones of the}} skull are homologous with--that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with--the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs, which when mature become extremely different, are at an early <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> exactly alike.|$|E
