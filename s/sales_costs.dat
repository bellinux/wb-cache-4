2500|$|GM based {{the lease}} {{payments}} for the EV1 on an initial vehicle price of [...] Lease payments ranged from around $299 to $574 per month, {{depending on the}} availability of state rebates. Since GM did not offer consumers the option to purchase {{at the end of the}} lease, the car's residual value was never established, making it impossible to determine the actual full purchase price or replacement value. One industry official said that each EV1 cost the company about , including research, development and other associated costs; other estimates placed the vehicle's actual cost as high as $100,000. Bob Lutz, GM Vice Chairman responsible for the Chevrolet Volt, in November 2011 stated the EV1 cost $250,000 each and leased for just $300 per month. GM stated the cost of the EV1 program at slightly less than $500 million before marketing and <b>sales</b> <b>costs,</b> and over $1 billion in total, although a portion of this cost was defrayed by the Clinton Administration's $1.25 billion Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) program. In addition, all manufacturers seeking to produce electric cars for market consumption also benefited from matching government funds committed to the United States Advanced Battery Consortium.|$|E

50|$|The {{break-even point}} {{is one of}} the simplest, yet least-used {{analytical}} tools.

50|$|These {{programs}} are primarily {{used to drive}} sales, reduce <b>sales</b> <b>costs,</b> increase profitability, develop new territory, and enhance margins.

An SIP is very similar to a commission plan; however, an SIP can incorporate sales metrics other than goods sold(or value of goods sold), which is traditionally how a commission plan is derived. Sales metrics used in an SIP are typically in the form of sales quotas (sometimes referred to as point of sale or POS shipments), new business opportunities and/or management by objectives (MBOs) independent action of the sales professional and is usually used in conjunction with a base salary.|$|E
