5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes {{a criticism of}} Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E
5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious pluralism. Morris argues that <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E
5|$|Referring {{to the two}} ontological {{arguments}} {{proposed by}} Anselm in Chapters 2 and 3 of his Proslogion, Malcolm supported Kant's criticism of Anselm's argument in Chapter 2: that existence cannot be a perfection of something. However, he identified {{what he sees as}} the second ontological argument in Chapter 3 which is not susceptible to <b>such</b> <b>criticism.</b>|$|E
50|$|In response, <b>such</b> <b>criticisms</b> {{have been}} derided as ad hominem and biased in themselves. The {{counter-argument}} maintains that <b>such</b> <b>criticisms</b> discount {{the importance of}} books solely because of generic, imprecise and possibly irrelevant characteristics of the books' authors, rather than because {{of the content of}} the books themselves.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the end of}} the World War II, criticisms {{and discussions}} of the Emperor and the {{imperial}} system were severely punished by the old Penal Code as they were considered to be lèse-majesté, and there was also strong pressure from Japanese society against <b>such</b> <b>criticisms.</b> Further, the Peace Preservation Law was enacted in 1941 to punish <b>such</b> <b>criticisms</b> against the imperial system.|$|R

5|$|The tantra {{practices}} are secretive, subject to speculations and criticism. Scholars variously attribute <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> to ignorance, misunderstanding or sectarian bias {{on the part}} of some observers, as well as unscrupulous practices by some Shaktas. These are some of the reasons many Hindus question the relevance and historicity of Tantra to their tradition.|$|E
5|$|Critics chastised Stewart for not {{conducting}} sufficiently hard-hitting {{interviews with}} his political guests, {{some of whom}} he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> by saying {{that they do not}} have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show Crossfire picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{has so far}} come in {{for major}} criticism, with the original title's aerial and ground-based gameplay being seen as repetitive and dull, although some reviewers found it entertaining. Drakengard 2 also came in for <b>such</b> <b>criticism,</b> although minor improvements were cited. In contrast, the gameplay of Drakengard 3 was generally praised or seen as an improvement upon the previous two entries, though the dragon-riding segments came in for criticisms for difficult controls. Opinions were divided on Niers unconventional mix of gameplay styles from multiple game genres, with some praising the variety and others seeing it as poorly executed. The series {{as a whole has}} gained a cult following in Japan.|$|E
50|$|While <b>such</b> <b>criticisms</b> {{indicated}} a direct {{rejection of the}} Platform's proposals, others seem to have arisen from misunderstandings.|$|R

5|$|Cissé {{made his}} return to {{training}} on 20 October 2006, and scored his first goal for Olympique de Marseille on 22 December 2006 when they beat AS Saint-Étienne 2–1. With only four goals in 14 appearances by April, Cissé's performances were drawing <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> that former player Jean-Pierre Papin urged Cissé's critics to be more patient while the striker recovered from his career-threatening injury. Despite the slow start, Cissé managed to score 4 goals in his final 7 league appearances to finish with 8 goals in 21 league appearances, helping Marseille to finish 2nd in the 2006–07 season and guarantee a Champions League place for the 2007–08 season. On 12 May 2007, he scored 2 goals in the French Cup Final against Sochaux, although Marseille still lost the match 5–4 on penalties, after a 2–2 stalemate after extra time following a late equaliser by another Liverpool player on loan Anthony Le Tallec.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing <b>such</b> <b>criticism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had been}} accused of exhibiting a racist {{attitude}} toward Africans in an earlier story, Tintin in the Congo, and potentially hoped to exonerate himself from <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> by depicting Tintin and Haddock freeing African slaves in The Red Sea Sharks. In preparing the latter story he had consulted a colleague who worked for an African-themed magazine, L'Afrique et le Monde ("Africa and the World"); they translated some of the passages that Hergé wished to include in the story into Yoruba. However, in January 1962 an article in the magazine Jeune Afrique criticised Hergé for a racist depiction of Africans in the story, an accusation that would be echoed in other publications. These claims focused on the African characters' simplistic use of pidgin language, which was similar to the speech patterns used in Tintin in the Congo.|$|E

25|$|More recently, biogerontologist Marios Kyriazis has sharply criticised the {{clinical}} applicability of SENS claiming that such therapies, even if {{developed in the}} laboratory, would be practically unusable by the general public. De Grey responded to one <b>such</b> <b>criticism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The DLR {{has been}} successful, as have other recent light rail systems. However, the DLR has been criticised {{for having been}} {{designed}} with insufficient capacity {{to meet the demand}} that quickly arose. The level of demand was underestimated. In 1989 <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> was aimed at GEC, a major contractor for construction.|$|E
50|$|Critics of {{the book}} argue {{that many of the}} claims in the book are easily refuted, and that there are many leaps of logic. Griffin rejects <b>such</b> <b>criticisms</b> and has debated his critics.|$|R

25|$|The formal {{response}} of Christians to <b>such</b> <b>criticisms</b> {{is described as}} Christian apologetics. Philosophers like Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas have been {{some of the most}} prominent defenders of the Christian religion since its foundation.|$|R
25|$|Individuals could privately {{criticize the}} {{transitional}} government, its officials, and private citizens without being subject to official reprisals, {{and during the}} year <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> frequently appeared in the media; however, security forces arrested, detained, and harassed politicians and other high-profile figures for criticizing the president or {{other members of the}} transitional government (see sections 1.d., 3, and 6.a.).|$|E
25|$|Roemer's {{version of}} the cause {{of change in the}} mode of {{production}} as due to being inequitable rather than inefficient is also the source of criticism. One <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> is that his argument relies of the legal ownership of production which is only present in later forms of class society rather than the social relations of production.|$|E
25|$|As {{chair of}} the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Schumer took a lead role in the {{investigation}} of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy. Although he was at one point criticized for being a lead investigator of the affair while also chairing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> was not sustained after the full dimensions of the controversy became apparent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Such</b> <b>criticisms,</b> {{based upon}} {{limitations}} {{of the relationship between}} a model and procedure and data set used to fit it, are usually addressed by verifying the model on an independent data set, as in the PRESS procedure.|$|R
5000|$|Supporters of {{economic}} rationalism have presented {{two kinds of}} responses to <b>criticisms</b> <b>such</b> as those quoted above. Some have denied that <b>such</b> <b>criticisms</b> are accurate, claiming that the term [...] "economic rationalism" [...] merely refers to rational policy formulation based on sound economic analysis, and does not preclude government intervention aimed at correcting market failure, income redistribution and so on.|$|R
25|$|Despite <b>such</b> <b>criticisms,</b> his {{reputation}} as a notable young writer and intellectual continued to develop. He transferred his studies and residence to Roma, where during 1845 he was ordained into the Roman Catholic priesthood, at the age of 30.|$|R
25|$|In recent years, many {{subjects}} in the humanities have attempted to adopt scientific methodologies {{under the category of}} social sciences. Some of the courses offered in these subjects have drawn criticism; for instance, an op-ed expressed concern over the lack of rigor and scientific relevancy in coursework at the University of Minnesota. <b>Such</b> <b>criticism</b> has been accused of stereotyping the social sciences as underwater basket weaving subjects.|$|E
25|$|Piérola's {{division}} of forces in two lines has been criticised by Chilean analyst Francisco Machuca. Whether <b>such</b> <b>criticism</b> is justified is debatable. According to Gonzalo Bulnes the battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores have been amongst {{the biggest in}} South America regarding the number of combatants, 45,000 in Chorrillos and 25,000 in Miraflores. The estimated death toll was 11,000 to 14,000 personnel, with a further 10,144 injured.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{critical}} perspectives scrutinizing the Chinese role in the relationship focused on the balance of the power relationship and human rights. Western countries have been the main source of accusations that China is a neo-colonist in Africa. As a response to <b>such</b> <b>criticism,</b> China issued the Nine Principles to Encourage and Standardise Enterprises' Overseas Investment, a charter and guide of conduct to Chinese companies operating abroad.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{response}} to <b>such</b> <b>criticisms,</b> a modified [...] "thrifty" [...] gene hypothesis is that the famines and seasonal shortages of food that occurred only during the agricultural period may have exerted enough pressure to select for [...] "thrifty" [...] genes.|$|R
