Some tanks, produced in 1931, had sealing zinc <b>shims</b> at the hull bottom between armoured plates for fording water obstacles. After problems with rain entering the engine compartment, a special cover was installed over an air outlet window after March 1932. Some T-26s produced {{at the end}} of 1932–1933 had a riveted and welded hull. The T-26 mod. 1931 had two cylindrical turrets mounted on ball bearings; each turret turned independently through 240°. Both turrets could provide common fire in front and rear arcs of fire (100° each). The disadvantage of such a configuration was that not all of the tank's firepower could be used at once on the same side. Four turret modifications existed, and they were mounted on tanks in different combinations (for instance, a tank with a riveted hull could have riveted and welded turrets).|$|E

40|$|Purpose Applications {{of dynamic}} <b>shimming</b> require high field fidelity, and characterizing the <b>shim</b> field {{dynamics}} is therefore necessary. Modeling {{the system as}} linear and time-invariant, {{the purpose of this}} work was to measure the impulse response function with optimal sensitivity. Theory and Methods Frequency-swept pulses as inputs are analyzed theoretically, showing that the sweep speed is a key factor for the measurement sensitivity. By adjusting the sweep speed it is possible to achieve any prescribed noise profile in the measured system response. Impulse response functions were obtained for the third-order <b>shim</b> system of a 7 Tesla whole-body MR scanner. Measurements of the <b>shim</b> fields were done with a dynamic field camera, yielding also cross-term responses. Results The measured <b>shim</b> impulse response functions revealed system characteristics such as response bandwidth, eddy currents and specific resonances, possibly of mechanical origin. Field predictions based on the <b>shim</b> characterization were shown to agree well with directly measured fields, also in the cross-terms. Conclusion Frequency sweeps provide a flexible tool for <b>shim</b> or gradient system characterization. This may prove useful for applications involving dynamic <b>shimming</b> by yielding accurate estimates of the <b>shim</b> fields and a basis for setting <b>shim</b> pre-emphasis...|$|R

2500|$|One saddle simply cannot fit all animals. [...] Nor will {{a saddle}} fit even the same horse forever without adjustments. As a horse {{advances}} in conditioning, age, and training, the back muscles {{and even the}} underlying skeletal structures change to some degree. [...] Thus, particularly with English saddles, a saddle fitter needs to make periodic adjustments. Western saddles {{are more difficult to}} adjust, though use of <b>shims</b> and padding can compensate for some changes. A lower pressure per square inch of surface area is a bit more forgiving. [...] In some cases, a horse will physically develop to a degree that a different saddle may have to be purchased.|$|E
2500|$|To {{detect the}} very small {{frequency}} shifts due to nuclear magnetic resonance, the applied magnetic field must be constant throughout the sample volume.

In order to detect and compensate for inhomogeneity and drift in the magnetic field, the spectrometer maintains a [...] "lock" [...] on the solvent deuterium frequency with a separate lock unit. In modern NMR spectrometers shimming is adjusted automatically, though {{in some cases the}} operator has to optimize the shim parameters manually to obtain the best possible resolution.|$|E

40|$|A novel active <b>shimming</b> {{method is}} {{proposed}} for the correction of magnetic field nonuniformity of superconducting (SC) magnet for magnetic resonance imaging. Active <b>shimming</b> utilizes several coils to correct specific field harmonic components appear in the inhomogeneous field, and each coil is usually designed independently to the others, and also takes no account {{of the presence of}} the main magnet coil blocks. However, the magnetic coupling among these SC <b>shim</b> coils exists, and also the interaction between those zonal even-order <b>shim</b> coils and the main magnet are particularly significant. This coupling/interaction can lead to the drift of main field and even a possible destruction of <b>shim</b> coils by quench due to tremendous energy transferred from the main magnet. In this paper, we attempt to develop magnetic decoupling technologies for the reduction of magnetic interactions between the <b>shim</b> coil and main magnet. Specifically, a hybrid optimization algorithm, including linear and nonlinear programming, is proposed to design a set of decoupled even-order zonal <b>shim</b> coils. The linear programming determines the globally optimal topology and preliminary position of the <b>shim</b> coils. Then, the nonlinear programming is applied to further optimize the position and the turn number of the <b>shim</b> coils, ensuring the designed coils are capable of correcting the unwanted field deviation. Taking the example of Z 2 <b>shim</b> coil, compared with the conventional Z 2 <b>shim</b> coil, the proposed method significantly reduces the mutual inductance between the Z 2 <b>shim</b> coil and the main magnet. For the same field deviation in the tested case, the mutual inductance has been decreased from 83 to 2. 3 H. We also further analyze the influence of system parameters and main magnet structure on the optimal topology of decoupled Z 2 <b>shim</b> coil. Z 4 and Z 6 <b>shim</b> coils are also designed with excellent decoupling effect. In our future work, a whole set of active <b>shim</b> coils decoupled from each other and also the main magnet and will be designed and tested in the 9. 4 T whole-body MRI system...|$|R

2500|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake <b>shims</b> between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application. [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.|$|E
