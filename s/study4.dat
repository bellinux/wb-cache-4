40|$|Several meta-analyses {{have shown}} that {{platelet}} aggregation inhibitors can make a major contribution to stroke prevention. Platelet aggregation inhibitors {{reduce the risk of}} a nonfatal stroke by 23 % (from 10. 8 % to 8. 3 % over 3 years) in patients after TIA or stroke (1). Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel or the combination acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) plus slow-release dipyridamole are effective as antiplatelet agents in the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Gastrointestinal side effects and bleeding rate increases with ASA doses> 150 mg/d (2). The fixed combination of ASA and dipyridamole was shown to be more effective compared with ASA alone in the ESPS- 2 study(3) and the recently investigator-driven ESPRIT <b>study(4).</b> The combination therapy also had similar bleeding rate compared to aspirin in both studies. In the subgroup of stroke patients Clopidogrel was not more effective than aspirin (5). A study comparing clopidogrel and ASA/dipyridamole is currently under way (PROFESS) and results are supposed to be presented in mid 2008. The combination of ASA and clopidogrel showed an increased bleeding rate in the MATCH (6) and CHARISMA (7) study when compared with the single therapy and therefore is not recommended. In conclusion, the combinmation of aspirin and extended release dipyridamole is more effective for secondary stroke prevention than monotherapy and does not increase the bleeding risk. References: 1.

40|$|Objective　To {{observe the}} effects of peripheraltissueinjury in the {{developmental}} stage of newborn rats on pain-related behaviors in adult rats. Methods　SD rats 1, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after birth were selected in thepresent <b>study(4</b> litters {{at each time point}} and 10 rats per litter). Each litter of rats was randomly divided intoinjury group(receiving subcutaneous injection of 20 μl bee venom) and control group(receiving subcutaneous injection of 20 μl normal saline), with 20 in each group, and then raised for 2 months to adulthood. The baseline pain threshold was observed by measuring spontaneous paw flinching reflex,paw withdrawal thermal latency(PWTL) and paw withdrawal mechanical threshold(PWMT), then 50 μl 0. 4 % bee venom was subcutaneously injected to each rat, and the changesinpa in reaction and pain threshold were determined. Results　The baseline thermal pain threshold in adult rats receiving bee venom or normal saline at different time points after birth was similar,but baseline mechanical pain threshold in adult rats receiving bee venom at 1, 4, 7 and 14 days after birth was decreased significantly compared with the adult rats receiving normal saline at corresponding time points(P 0. 05). Mechanical hyperalgesia was not induced in rats injected with bee venom but induced in adult ratsinjected with normal saline 4 - 21 days after birth. Injection of bee venom 21 and 28 days after birth could obviously enhance the bee venom-induced hyperalgesiain adult rats compared with control group(P< 0. 01). Conclusions　Bee venom stimuli at different time points after birth could affect the baseline PWMT and mechanical pain hypersensitivityin adult rats but not the baseline PWTL and thermal pain hypersensitivity.

40|$|Hepatitis Monthly issue 7 {{contained}} four {{clinical trials}} of pegylated interferon (Peg- IFN) plus ribavirin for Iranian {{patients with chronic}} hepatitis C infection conducted in four various centers(1 - 4). Apart from one trial(2), which enrolled only patients with inherited bleeding disorders, three others enrolled heterogeneous HCV infected populations. However, reported sustained virologic response (SVR) rate was varied from 50 % to 78 % in these studies. This wide SVR range might make difficulties for the readers to gain clear data regarding efficacy of this therapeutic regimen on Iranian patients. Almost analogous inclusion and exclusion criteria {{as well as the}} details of these four studies allow us to intervene and join the cases and reanalyze the datafrom a single pool. However, the slight differences among these studies will obviously diminish the accuracy and make us discuss the results conservatively. For instance, in the study by Merat et al. none of the patients underwent liver biopsy(2) or Zali et al. excluded cirrhotic patients from the <b>study(4).</b> Moreover, the sensitivities of RT-PCR tests applied to define response to treatment were varied from 100 copies/ml to 600 copies/ml in various studies. In spite of these inevitable biases, our intervention is able to provide useful information. To analyze the data, we applied intention to treat analysis (ITT). ITT analysis is generally interpreted as including all patients who received at least one dose of medication(s), regardless of whether they actually satisfied the entry criteria, the treatment actually received, and subsequent withdrawal or deviation from the protocol(5). Therefore, all patients who do not complete the study are considered to have failure to treatment. It is a strategy to avoid the problems created by omitting dropouts and noncompliant patients, which can introduce bias in the trial, and overestimate clinical effectiveness. Although there is a debate about the validity of excluding specific cases within each of these categories from an ITT analysis, clinical effectiveness may be overestimated if an ITT analysis is not done(5). This is the point that was neglected in one study(5), in which despite of claiming to apply ITT analysis, the cases withdrawn after the initial doses were excluded from analysis. A total number of 169 patients were enrolled in these four studies. One hundred and one patients achieved SVR. Thus, an SVR rate of 60. 3 % was found in the study population. There are two well-known, comprehensive trials in this issue enrolling a large study population from multiple sites in Europe, North America, Australia and Asia by Manns et al. (6) and Fried et al. (7). Both studies were on an ITT basis and the study methods were almost similar to those of Iranian studies. These two trials reported an SVR rate of at most 54 % and 56 %, respectively for Peg-IFN plus ribavirin therapy, which are around and even slightly lower than our SVR rate. If we compare the available baseline characteristics of sample populations of studies by Manns et al. and Fried etal. with those in Iranian studies, we will gain interesting findings (Table 1). Table 1 : A number of characteristics of sample populations and SVR in the studies Mannset al. Friedet al. Iranians Mean age (yrs) 43 42. 8 38. 3 Male (%) 68 72 86. 3 Mode oftransmission(%) * Transfusion 22 19 50. 0 Intra-venousdrug abuse 62 42 21. 4 Others/Unknown 16 39 28. 5 Cirrhosis (%) 100 100 6. 4 ** Naïve (%) 54 56 73. 9 SVR (%) 54 56 60. 3 * Three studies (1, 2, 3) provided data (n= 112). ** Two studies (1, 4) provided data (n= 109). Study populations were roughly similar in regard to mean age. The male ratio in Iranian studies was fairly higher. In addition, drug abuse was more frequent in the population studied by Manns et al. and Fried et al., while transfusion was the prominent risk factor in Iranian patients. On the other hand, fewer Iranian patients were cirrhotic although only two Iranian studies presented data in this regard(1, 4). More importantly, Manns et al. and Fried et al. enrolled only naïve patients while only 155 out of 169 cases (73. 9 %) of Iranian patients were naïve. It means that {{more than a quarter of}} Iranian patients had a history of unsuccessful interferon based therapy. Although some other baseline variables such as baseline HCV viral load were not provided in Iranian studies, higher rate of transfusion is a clue suggesting probable higher viral load in Iranianpopulation. Considering the available pretreatment factors of the study populations in Manns et al. and Fried et al studies and Iranian studies, we found the Iranian patients more difficult to treat. However, we found that SVR in Iranian patients was equal to or even slightly higher than SVRs reported by them. Interestingly, considering a couple of elegant points in Iranian studies including: 7 patients received Peg- IFN monotherapy due to thalassemia major, 5 patients received only a 24 -week course of treatment, 6 patients missed the follow up period in spite of clearing HCV RNA at week 48 and necessarily considered nonresponders in analysis, we can suggest that SVR in Iranian patients might be even higher than what was found. Furthermore, if we analyzed the naïve patients separately (123 cases), SVR rate would rise even up to as high as 64. 2 - 66. 6 %. Therefore, the question is: Why was the SVR rate in Iranian patients higher than what was expected?The only issue left overlooked is HCV genotype distribution. Manns et al. and Fried et al. reported 68 % and 65 % of HCV genotype 1 -difficult to treat- in their study populations. In Iranian studies, the data are insufficient in this regard. Merat et al. detected genotype 1 in 60 % of 20 patients evaluated(2). In two most recently reported studies investigating HCV genotype in Iranian patients, the genotype 1 rates of 55 % and 63 % were reported(8, 9). Thus, the rate of difficult to treat genotype appears not to have considerable difference in Iranian population compared with population studied by Manns et al. and Fried et al. If it is the case, can we claim that our genotype 1 patients will respond to treatment better than the similar genotype in other populations? Are Iranian patients with genotype 1 not as difficult to treat as what expected?As a hypothesis, the Iranian patients infected with HCV genotype 1 probably are not analogous to the patients who apparently have the similar genotype in other studies. An evidence to support this suggestion is the genotype 1 spectrum in Iranian patients. Despite similar HCV genotype 1 distribution in Iranian patients with the patients studied by Manns et al. and Fried et al., the rate of HCV genotype 1 subtypes is strikingly different among populations. While 1 a/ 1 b ratio was 31 / 34 in the study by Fried et al. (7) (Manns et al. did not report such data), it was reported 45 / 15 by Merat et al. (2), 47 / 4 by Samimi-Rad et al. (8) and 51 / 12 by Ahmadipour et al. (9). Then, the majority of Iranian patients were infected with genotype 1 a subtype. The suggestion is that genotype 1 a, which is more prevalent in Iranian patients, probably is not as difficult to treat as genotype 1 b. If it is the case, we will observe higher response to treatment in Iranian patients with genotype 1 than other studies. As the second suggestion, each of HCV genotypes 1 a, 1 b etc. may have its own subtypes which differ from each other regarding IFN resistance and difficulty to treat. Then the Iranian patients with HCV genotype 1 may be infected with subtypes different from the patients who apparently have similar genotype in other studies. It is obvious that these suggestions need to be investigated in future researches. Safety is a major concern of new therapeutic agents that could be different in various races and ethnicities. In the study by Fried et al. (7), in which the patients received Pegasys®, the therapy was discontinued in around 10 % of patients due to clinical adverse events or laboratory abnormalities and dose modification of Pegasys® and/or ribavirin was required in 36 - 45 %. However, only in 4 patients of Iranian studies (around 6 %) therapy was discontinued and 45 patients (around 27 %) needed dose modification. These results could suggest an overall better tolerability of this regimen in Iranian patients. On the basis of the study on safety assessment of Pegasys® plus ribavirin therapy, neutropenia was reported in 21 % of patients, anemia in 11 % and thrombocytopenia in less than 10 % of patients(10). Totally, anemia and thrombocytopenia were found in 10 % and 6 % of Iranian patients, respectively, which is near to the last report. However, only 10 % of Iranian patients experienced neutropenia, which is much lower than what was reported in last study. In summary, Iranian patients tolerated the medications well. Moreover, the probability of side effect occurrence is lower than what was expected in some cases. We hope we can achieve the same result with the Iranian pegylated Interferon in our future studies.
