The purchase of the two jets, valued at 3,534.36 million Bhutanese ngultrum (BTN), was the biggest single purchase ever made by Bhutan, and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in the Bhutanese trade deficit over the previous year for the financial year 2004–2005. The Bhutanese government issued BTN 1,767.18 million in government bonds to pay for one aircraft and for only the second time in Bhutan's history intended to seek a commercial loan for the other aircraft. However, in October 2004 it announced it would instead seek a <b>soft</b> <b>loan</b> for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Vietnam {{is characterized by}} challenges and achievements. Among the achievements is {{a substantial increase in}} access to water supply and sanitation between 1990 and 2010, nearly universal metering, and increased investment in wastewater treatment since 2007. Among the challenges are continued widespread water pollution, poor service quality, low access to improved sanitation in rural areas, poor sustainability of rural water systems, insufficient cost recovery for urban sanitation, and the declining availability of foreign grant and <b>soft</b> <b>loan</b> funding as the Vietnamese economy grows and donors shift to loan financing. The government also promotes increased cost recovery through tariff revenues and has created autonomous water utilities at the provincial level, but the policy has had mixed success as tariff levels remain low and some utilities have engaged in activities outside their mandate.|$|E

[...] First Lady Imelda Marcos, then {{governor}} of Metro Manila and minister of human settlements, became its first chairman. [...] Although responsible for {{the operations of the}} LRT-1 and LRT-2, the LRTA primarily confined itself to setting and regulating fares, planning extensions and determining rules and policies, leaving the day-to-day operations to a sister company of Meralco called the Meralco Transit Organization (METRO Inc.). [...] Initial assistance for the project {{came in the form of}} a ₱300million <b>soft</b> <b>loan</b> from the Belgian government, with an additional ₱700million coming from a consortium of companies comprising SA Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi (ACEC) and BN Constructions Ferroviaires et Métalliques (today both part of Bombardier Transportation), Tractionnel Engineering International (TEI) and Transurb Consult (TC). [...] Although expected to pay for itself from revenues within twenty years of the start of operation, it was initially estimated that the system would lose money until at least 1993. For the first year of operation, despite a projected ₱365million in gross revenue, losses of ₱216million were thought likely.|$|E
2500|$|The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD), a {{regional}} Arab funding institution, has financed several {{water and sanitation}} projects in Yemen.

In November 2012, Arab Fund signed an agreement to finance the fourth phase of Sanaa' wastewater networks with a <b>soft</b> <b>loan</b> of about US$54 million. The construction will be completed before the end of 2017. In 2014, the Arab Fund signed an agreement to finance additional works in Sanaa' flood protection, with a <b>soft</b> <b>loan</b> of around US$35 million.

2500|$|Japan {{provided}} a <b>soft</b> <b>loan</b> (25 years maturity, 7 grace years, 2.5% interest) of about US$120m for wastewater collection and treatment in Sidon and water supply in Keserwan District in 1996. In Sidon {{the project was}} to finance a sewer network with a length of 38km, a trunk sewer with a length of 7km, two sewage pumping stations and a preliminary treatment plant with a capacity of 33,600m3/day. [...] Later the design was changed to add the financing of a 2km sea outfall, increase {{the capacity of the}} treatment plant to 45,000 m3/day, increase the number of pumping stations to 13 and to reduce the length of sewers financed. The construction of the wastewater treatment plant was finished in 2006, but it became operational only in 2010 when {{at least some of the}} trunk sewers were finally connected to the plant. In Keserwan District Japan finances the expansion of a water intake at the Al Madiq spring, 50km of transmission mains, 13 pumping stations 22 service reservoirs and 202km of distribution mains. The project will alleviate water scarcity in a number of villages where demand is twice as high as available supply.

2500|$|Banda was {{the only}} African ruler to {{establish}} diplomatic ties with South Africa during apartheid {{as well as the}} Portuguese regime in Mozambique. After the cabinet crisis in 1964, Banda became increasingly isolated in African politics. On the other hand, his antipathy for Roy Welensky and what he denounced as the [...] "stupid federation" [...] was a smokescreen he used to reject the proposed Bangula Hydro-electric dam – proposed to be bigger than the Gezira Dam in Khartoum – that Welensky's Federation had sought and obtained funding for from the British government. Banda went on to blame everything including snails (likely to cause widespread Bilharzias) to abort the project. In turn, the British denied Banda the funding and budgetary support he needed to build his pet dream of a new capital city at Lilongwe, in his home region. Hence he turned to South Africa – itself playing geo-political games in the region – which gave him a <b>soft</b> <b>loan</b> of 300 million rand. The quid pro quo was that Banda had to support South Africa's apartheid policies among fellow African leaders. Hence, on one occasion he paid a state visit to South Africa where he met his South African counterparts at Stellenbosch. Banda once noted that, [...] "It is only contact like this [...] that can reveal to your people that there are civilized people other than white..." [...] Banda's staunch anticommunism also influenced his decision to seek warm relations with South Africa.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{compare the}} {{performance}} {{of public and private}} sector manufacturing firms in Indonesia for 1981 - 95. They analyze whether public sector inefficiency is due primarily to agency-type problems ("ownership") or to the business environment in which public enterprises operate, as measured by soft budget constraints or barriers to competition. They nest the two alternatives in a production function framework. The results, obtained from fixed-effects specifications, provide support for both models. The business environment matters. Only public enterprises that received loans from state banks or those shielded from import competition performed worse than private enterprises. Ownership matters. For a given level of import competition or <b>soft</b> <b>loans,</b> public enterprises perform worse than their counterparts in the private sector. Eliminating <b>soft</b> <b>loans</b> to Indonesia's public enterprises would raise total factor productivity by 6 percentage points; the same result could be achieved by increasing import penetration by 15 percentage points. The authors show that these findings are not due to selection effects for either privatization or the receipt of <b>soft</b> <b>loans.</b> Labor Policies,Banks&Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Environmental Economics&Policies,Economic Theory&Research,Banks&Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Environmental Economics&Policies,Economic Theory&Research,Public Sector Economics&Finance...|$|R
