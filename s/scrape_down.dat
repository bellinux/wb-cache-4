60|$|So great was her solicitude for the {{improvement}} of her son, that she declined the pressing instances of the Countess of Macclesfield to reside under her roof, lest she should be hindered from attending exclusively to that which was now become her main concern. To the many inquiries which the early vivacity of the boy prompted him to put to her, the invariable answer she returned was, read and you will know. This assurance, added to the other means of instruction, from which her fondness, or more probably her discernment, induced her to exclude every species of severity, were so efficacious that in his fourth year he was able to read at sight any book in his own language. Two accidents occurred to hinder this rapid advancement from proceeding. Once he narrowly escaped being consumed by flames from having fallen into the fire, while endeavouring to <b>scrape</b> <b>down</b> some soot from the chimney of a room in which he had been left alone; and was rescued only in consequence of the alarm given to the servants by his shrieks. At another time, his eye was nearly put out by one of the hooks of his dress, as he was struggling under the hands of the domestic who was putting on his clothes. From the effects of this injury his sight never completely recovered.|$|E
5000|$|... (C7) An ulu (Inuit woman's knife) knife is a {{sharpened}} {{segment of}} a circle. This blade type has no point, {{and has a}} handle in the middle. It is good for scraping, and sometimes chopping. The semi-circular version appears {{elsewhere in the world}} and is called a head knife. It is used in leatherworking both to <b>scrape</b> <b>down</b> leather (reducing thickness, i.e. skiving), and to make precise, rolling cuts for shapes other than straight lines. The circular version is a popular tool for slicing pizzas. One corner is placed {{at the edge of the}} pizza and the blade is rolled across in a diameter cut.|$|E
5000|$|The frizzen, {{historically}} {{called the}} steel, is an [...] "L" [...] shaped piece of steel hinged {{at the rear}} used in flintlock firearms. It is positioned over the flash pan so as to enclose a small priming charge of black powder next to the flash hole that is drilled through the barrel into where the main charge is loaded. When the trigger is pulled, the hammer or cock—which includes a shaped piece of flint held into a set of jaws by a scrap of leather or thin piece of lead—snaps forward causing the flint to <b>scrape</b> <b>down</b> {{the face of the}} frizzen (historically called the 'battery'), throwing it back to expose the black powder in the pan. The flint scraping the steel causes a shower of sparks to be thrown into the pan, igniting the black powder and sending flames through the touch hole, which in turn ignites the main charge of black powder in the breech of the barrel, shooting the projectile out the barrel.|$|E

If the weather be cold put boiling water into the churn {{for half an hour}} before you want to use it; when that is poured off strain in the cream through a butter cloth. When the butter is coming, which is easily ascertained by the sound, take off the lid, and with a small, flat board <b>scrape</b> <b>down</b> the sides of the churn, and do the same to the lid: this prevents waste. When the butter is come the butter-milk is to be poured off and spring water put into the churn, and turned for two or three minutes; this is to be then poured away and fresh added, and again the handle turned for a minute or two. Should there be the least milkiness when this is poured from the churn, more must be put in.The butter is then to be placed on a board or marble slab and salted to taste; then with a cream cloth, wrung out in spring water, press all the moisture from it. When dry and firm make it up into rolls with flat boards. The whole process should be completed in three-quarters of an hour. In hot weather pains must be taken to keep the cream from reaching too high a heat. If the dairy be not cool enough, keep the cream-pot in the coldest water you can get; make the butter early in the morning, and place cold water in the churn for a while before it is used.|$|E

40|$|Thirty-four horrible sounds {{have been}} {{examined}} in an Internet-based psychoacoustic experiment. This paper presents {{the results for the}} scraping and disgusting noises used. It is not understood why some humans find certain scraping noises, such as the sound of fingernails being <b>scraped</b> <b>down</b> a blackboard, so terrible. In this experiment, the variation in rating with age, gender and location are examined. The results for one of the scraping sounds is consistent with the hypothesis suggested by others, that the response comes from a vestigial reflex related to the warning cries of monkeys. But this was not true for the actual recording of the fingernails <b>scraping</b> <b>down</b> a blackboard. An alternative hypothesis that the response is related to an audio-haptic interaction was tested and results indicated that this idea warrants further investigation. Other possible causes of the response drawing on work concerning dissonance are tentatively suggested. The disgusting sounds examined included the worst sound found in the experiment, the sound of someone vomiting. However, none of the disgusting sounds tested promoted responses consistent with a „disgust reaction ‟ based purely on survival instincts. Cultural factors might be important in our response to the disgusting sounds, with the influence of manners and etiquette being suggested as a possible factor.

30|$|The {{deposits}} were <b>scraped</b> <b>down</b> and dispersed in methanol {{and then}} sonicated for 1 h. The {{diameter of the}} nanowires suspended {{at the top of}} the solution is small and the diameter of the nanowires sinked at the bottom of the solution is large. So three different levels from top to bottom of the dispersion were collected. Each part of the dispersion was centrifugated for 20 min. The precipitations were redispersed in octane-TOPO solution and sonicated for 10 min, respectively, as illustrated by the literature [30]. The UV-vis absorption spectroscopy of these nanowires with different diameters was measured by a UV-visible Spectrophotometer (UV-vis UV- 2501 PC, Shimadzu). The average diameter and aspect ratio of the nanowires dispersed in different levels were calculated by SEM images.|$|R
50|$|The {{scutching}} knife is <b>scraped</b> <b>down</b> {{with a sharp}} {{strike against}} the fibers while they hang vertically. The edge of the knife is scraped along the fibers to pull away pieces of the stalk. This is repeated until all of the stalk has been removed and the flax is smooth and silky. When scutching was done by hand people could scutch up to 15 lb of flax in one day, though the amount depended {{on the quality of}} the flax. Coarser flax, harder flax and poorly retted flax takes longer to scutch. Retting removes the pectins that bind the fibers to the stalk and each other, so under-retted flax is harder to separate from the stalk, and often gets damaged in the scutching process. Over-retting the flax causes the fibers to deteriorate and break.|$|R

Also, rubber edges generally contour the ground much more effectively than steel because they flex over humps and into dips. One advantage of steel edges is the reduced drag they create. Rubber edges tend {{to act like a}} brake, taking much more power to push than a steel edge when <b>scraping</b> <b>down</b> to bare pavement. Both edges have their advantages and disadvantages, and while some companies have found ways to better contour pavement with a steel edge, their moving components may make them more fragile than continuously welded plows with rubber edges.|$|R

Subsequently, this black resketch as well as the yellow and white highlights were <b>scraped</b> <b>down</b> in the sleeve, a red-lake glaze was hastily brushed over most of the cloak, and a mass of parallel back-and-forth strokes in dull red paint defined the fall of fabric across the top part of the arm of the chair (faintly visible in the false-color reflectance image).|$|R

Although the experimental conditions are very uncontrolled, using the Internet allows access to a vast number of ratings (1. 5 million to date) and to a range of subjects that is virtually impossible to replicate in the laboratory. This paper will explore the methodology, examining the pitfalls and issues with running such an experiment, for instance the problems arising from the lack of calibration and uncontrolled context. Although the media have been most interested in the ‘World’s top ten worst sounds’, absolute judgements are in many ways problematic. However, relative judgements and trends are probably useful, and the experiment works well in examining how responses to sounds vary with contextual variables such as age, location and gender. The website was also used to examine audio-visual interaction, for instance the colour of the website was varied to see how that affected ratings. Some of the interesting and quirky results arising from the experiment are explored...|$|R
