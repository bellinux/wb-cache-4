50|$|Yusuf's Maronite successor, Emir Bashir Shihab II, maneuvered {{against his}} local rivals and the {{powerful}} Acre-based governors of Sidon to centralize his control over Mount Lebanon. This ultimately involved destroying the feudal power of the mostly Druze lords and the cultivation of the Maronite clergy as an alternative power base of the emirate. Bashir allied himself with Muhammad Ali of Egypt during his occupation of Syria, but was deposed in 1840 when the Egyptians were driven out by an Ottoman-European alliance, which had the backing of Maronite forces. His successor, Emir Bashir III, ruled for two years, after which emirate was dissolved and replaced with the Double Qaimaqamate, which <b>split</b> <b>Mount</b> Lebanon into Druze and Christian sectors. The Shihab family's influence declined thereafter. However, members of the presently mixed Muslim-Christian family, namely President Fuad Chehab and Prime Minister Khaled Chehab, reached high political office in the modern republic of Lebanon.|$|E
50|$|The {{notion of}} a remnant in Jerusalem fleeing through a <b>split</b> <b>Mount</b> of Olives derives from the Masoretic reading of Zechariah 14:5. The Septuagint (LXX) states in Zechariah 14:5 that a valley will be blocked up as it was blocked up during the {{earthquake}} during King Uzziah's reign. Jewish historian Flavius Josephus mentions in Antiquities of the Jews that the valley {{in the area of}} the King's Gardens was blocked up by landslide rubble during Uzziah's earthquake. Israeli geologist's Wachs and Levitte identified the remnant of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives directly adjacent to this area. Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, Charles Clermont-Ganneau, a 19th-century linguist and archeologist in Palestine, postulated that the valley directly adjacent to this landslide is Azal, the location mentioned in Zechariah 14:5 to which the remnant in Jerusalem is to supposedly flee. This location accords with the LXX reading of Zechariah 14:5 which states that the valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. If Clermont-Ganneau is correct, the notion of people fleeing east through the Mount of Olives to Azal is impossible because the valley he identified (which is now known as Wady Yasul in Arabic, and Nahal Etzel in Hebrew) lies south of both Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives.|$|E
50|$|The Plein Air had a flat sided {{fuselage}} which tapered to the tail. This was conventional, with {{a straight}} edged fin and rudder with a rounded top. Its tailplane was strut braced to the fin. The tourer had a fixed tail wheel undercarriage with main wheels on <b>split</b> axles <b>mounted</b> on the central fuselage underside; the legs were faired-in V-struts from the lower fuselage. The tail wheel, mounted on a telescopic leg, was also faired.|$|R
50|$|Tennessee State Route 171 follows Mount Juliet Road {{south from}} Interstate 40 to the park's boundary. The two roads then split, with TN-171 {{continuing}} west along Hobson Pike to the park's Couchville section, and Mount Juliet Road (now South Mount Juliet Road) continuing {{south to the}} park's Bryant Grove section. Granny Wright Road, which intersects TN-171 just north of its <b>split</b> with <b>Mount</b> Juliet Road, accesses the Volunteer Trailhead and the park's Bakers Grove section.|$|R
50|$|The T-2 had fixed, {{conventional}} {{landing gear}} with a track of about 2 m. The wheels were on cranked, steel <b>split</b> axles <b>mounted</b> on the fuselage central underside and enclosed in wooden streamlined fairings. The outer axle ends moved in slots {{at the ends of}} wooden V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons, restrained by rubber chord shock-absorbers. The articulated tailskid was wooden and steel shod, with another rubber shock-absorber joined to the fuselage.|$|R

The canyon's main {{thoroughfare}} is U.S. Route 189. Attractions in Provo Canyon include Vivian Park and Bridal Veil Falls. The Heber Valley Historic Railroad operates passenger trains through the canyon. The Provo River has carved out the canyon over time along with the forces of erosion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{empennage}} was conventional, {{with the}} tailplane mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage. In plan the tailplane was semi-elliptical and the elevators almost semi-circular. The fin and unbalanced rudder also had curved edges and together were rather pointed; the rudder extended to the keel and operated in an elevator cut-out.The undercarriage was of the tailskid type, with a 2.07 m track. [...] The wheels were on bent <b>split</b> axles <b>mounted</b> on the centreline of the fuselage underside, their ends rubber sprung from vertical V-struts from the wing centre section.|$|R
50|$|Its {{landing gear}} was fixed and conventional, with mainwheels on <b>split,</b> cranked axles <b>mounted</b> on a central {{inverted}} strut-pyramid {{from the lower}} fuselage longerons. There were rearward drag struts to the longerons as well as rubber cord shock absorbing struts. The undercarriage track was 1.30 m. The PM X had a short, castering tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The {{undercarriage}} {{was fixed}} with the mainwheels under aircraft fairings and on <b>split</b> axles centrally <b>mounted</b> on a transverse V-strut {{from the central}} lower fuselage. The track was 2.70 m. Short, faired legs with rubber shock absorbers and drag struts were attached to the outer lower fuselage. The steerable tailskid also had a rubber damper.|$|R
5000|$|For {{preparing}} {{data input}} diskettes, {{as a successor}} to card punches, there was a special workstation called a [...] "dual display" [...] (3742) which employed a system of mirrors to <b>split</b> a horizontally <b>mounted</b> screen into two 12x80 displays. Two users sat {{on either side of}} it with two keyboards and two diskette drives.|$|R
2500|$|The {{empennage}} of the Bumblebee was, {{like the}} fuselage, steel framed. [...] Its straight edged, braced tailplane and <b>split</b> elevators were <b>mounted</b> {{on top of}} the fuselage; [...] the fin had a curved leading edge, the rudder moving in an elevator cut-out. The undercarriage was of the fixed, conventional type, with mainwheels on a single axle, each side attached to the fuselage by a single streamlined strut.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} Kevlar and carbon fibre. Its 11.4 m span wing employs a Jd 16 (40) 162 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a Jd 17 (40) 157 at mid-span and a Jd 15 (35) 136 at the wing tip. The wing has an area of 16.2 m2 and <b>mounts</b> <b>split</b> flaps that can be extended 50Â°. The standard engines fitted are a pair of [...] Lycoming O-320-D1A four-stroke powerplants.|$|R
500|$|The freeway {{continues}} north-westerly for , <b>splitting</b> <b>Mount</b> Street in half, {{and passing}} under Malcolm Street. After this, it turns north-easterly for , and lines up [...] {{with the city}} blocks between George and Elder streets, a pair of one way frontage roads. The freeway also marks the boundary between Perth and West Perth. Partial access is provided to or from all the roads that the freeway crosses over (or under {{in the case of}} Hay Street), with the exception of Roe Street. North of Roe Street, the freeway turns north-west towards Glendalough over the course of [...] In this section the freeway marks the boundary between the City of Perth and City of Vincent LGAs. There is a full Y-Interchange here with Graham Farmer Freeway, which bypasses the Perth city centre via a tunnel, and provides access to Perth Airport. Combined with this interchange is a partial Y-Interchange with Charles Street. The southbound entrance ramp merges with, and northbound exit ramp diverges from, the Graham Farmer Freeway ramps. There is a traffic light controlled intersection with Newcastle Street at the northern end of these ramps. Charles Street is the start of State Route 60, an alternative route to Perth's northern suburbs and areas north of the Perth Metropolitan Region. Located in the vicinity of these interchanges are the Sutherland Street northbound entrance ramp, from West Perth, and a southbound exit ramp to both James Street, Northbridge, and Wellington Street, Perth. The Loftus Street overpass, near the northwestern end of the Graham Farmer Freeway ramps, is the edge of the City of Perth LGA; beyond this point the freeway is the boundary between West Leederville in the Town of Cambridge and Leederville in the City of Vincent.|$|R
50|$|It {{was noted}} {{at the time}} that the wings were very thin and so {{required}} elaborate struttage which also involved the fixed landing gear. The central part of the latter was a wooden airfoil section, 3 m span plane which contributed an extra 13% lifting area. This had metal carriers at its tips, each supported by a pair of almost parallel struts to the lower fuselage. <b>Split</b> axles, <b>mounted</b> centrally on a transverse V-strut from the fuselage, were connected to the carriers via rubber shock absorbers and mounted the wheels. The main wing struts converged slightly from the carriers to the wing longerons at about 80% span. From near the midpoint of these struts a further pair of inverted Vs braced the inner wing to the upper fuselage.|$|R
50|$|A {{wishbone}} ketch rigged vessel is {{a vessel}} that is rigged as a ketch where a permanent <b>splitting</b> gaff is <b>mounted</b> between two masts. Contrary to the gaff rig (where the gaff is hoisted {{together with the}} sail) the gaff stays in the mast. The gaff is typically fixed on the first mast (the one closer to the front) and fixed via a line to the aftmost mast. These lines allow the sail to be trimmed to suit the wind.|$|R
25|$|Two squadrons of Deccan Horse {{attacked}} and captured the nearest {{point on the}} hills overlooking the pass, while on their left a squadron of the 34th Poona Horse supported by the Essex Battery RHA charged into the German and or Ottoman force, <b>mounted</b> <b>splitting</b> it in two and scattering the column. Here they captured 40 officers and 150 men. The 14th Brigade eventually bivouacked on the El Jebel el Aswad ridge {{with a total of}} 594 prisoners having suffered 5 killed and 4 wounded.|$|R
50|$|The Brigade, {{unlike the}} Squadron, {{maintains}} a standing army {{with a system}} of compulsory service, as well as requiring nobles to contribute household troops in time of war. Brigade forces use rifle-muskets, which are primitive compared to the Armory breech-loaders used by the Civil Government Army. All Brigadero's carry a basket-hilt broadsword in conjunction with cap and ball revolvers. The Brigade do not field infantry, but only cavalry and a few brass or bronze cast siege cannon. Cavalry units are <b>split</b> between <b>mounted</b> dragoons and lancers, who also carry two-meter long lances. Brigadero soldiers wear front-and-back breastplates, which are resistant to the hollow-point lead bullets fired by Civil Government rifles; this leads the Civil Government army to switch to brass-tipped bullets to puncture such armor. Residents of The Brigade speak the dialects of Spanjol and Namerique, remnants of Spanish and French/English respectively. This state is modeled on the Ostrogoths of Belisarius's time.|$|R
5000|$|According to one Christian {{interpretation}} of Micah 2:12-13, Bozrah, (or a place the Bible cryptically {{refers to as}} Bozrah), will also be {{the scene of a}} magnificent [...] "break-out" [...] of God's covenant people. According to this interpretation the deliverance will come at an Edomite controlled place of exile and incarceration in the End times. This epic event referred to in Micah 2:12-13 has been referred to by Dr G Finley as [...] "the Bozrah deliverance". Bozrah is in the Hebrew, but most translators render it as [...] "fold" [...] - sheep in the fold. This [...] "break-out" [...] could be tied to Zechariah 14:1-5, when Yahweh fights against the nations, stands on the Mount of Olives (east of Jerusalem), and <b>splits</b> the <b>Mount</b> in two as a valley, so that the remnant of Israel trapped in Jerusalem can escape those who would kill them. If so, Micah 2:12-13 would not relate to the locale of Bozrah.|$|R
5000|$|Based on the Series 10A, this variant offered many {{modifications}} {{in respect to}} other series. It introduced the leading edge extension (a fillet added {{to the front of}} an aircraft wings in order to provide usable airflow at high angles of attack). The wing <b>mounted</b> <b>split</b> flaps and the fuselage was extended 1.40 m, with an increase in passenger capacity to 105. The engines used were the new Pratt & Whitney JT8D turbofan engines with [...] of unitary thrust. The 10B first flew on August 31, 1964 and was produced as a run of 22 aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|As first built, the {{aircraft}} was an unequal-span two-seater two-bay biplane, with ailerons fitted {{to the top}} wing only. The square section fuselage was mounted {{in the middle of}} the gap between the upper and lower wings, and the tail surfaces consisted of a rectangular rudder mounted on the sternpost of the fuselage, with a rectangular horizontal stabiliser and <b>split</b> elevator <b>mounted</b> in front of it on top of the fuselage. [...] The centre section of the lower wing was left uncovered, as was the fuselage aft of the cockpit: the cockpit section of the fuselage was covered with plywood, with aluminium panels at the front enclosing the fuel tanks and extending forwards to form the cowling for the front-mounted [...] Gnome Lambda engine. The undercarriage consisted of a pair of wheels below the wing leading edge, supplemented by skids extending forward to protect the propeller in case of a nose-over, and a single sprung tailskid mounted under the rear of the fuselage. [...] The fuselage was subsequently rigged lower down, and the aft section of the fuselage covered with fabric.|$|R
