5|$|The first <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander</b> {{delegation}} to the Olympics arrived some six years after the nation's independence for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, and was composed of three male athletes competing in two sports. The island nation continued to send delegations to the Olympics throughout its era of civil disorder; delegations from the Solomon Islands appeared at all seven Summer Olympic games prior to (and including) the Beijing games of 2008. The first women represented the Solomon Islands at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. The largest delegations from the Solomon Islands included four athletes and appeared in 1988 and 1996. Up to and including the Beijing games, {{there had not been}} a <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander</b> who had won a medal at the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|During the snatch {{phase of}} the event, Hale was given three {{attempts}} to lift as much weight as she could in snatches. She successfully lifted 74kilograms on her first attempt and 78 kilograms on her second, but failed to lift 82kilograms on her third and final try. The second and {{last part of the}} event included lifting weights using the clean and jerk method. Hale successfully lifted 95kilograms in this manner on her first attempt, but failed to lift 100kilograms on her second and third tries. Her combined score was 173kilograms. This placed the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander</b> at twelfth place of the twelve athletes in the event, directly behind the Philippines' eleventh-place finalist Hidilyn Diaz (192kilograms), who in turn ranked behind Poland's tenth-place finalist Marieta Gotfryd (200kilograms). The gold medalist in the event was China's Chen Yanqing, who set an Olympic record with 244kilograms.|$|E

25|$|From the 1870s to 1903 Malaitan men (and some women) {{comprised}} {{the largest number}} of <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander</b> participants in the indentured labour trade to Queensland, Australia and to Fiji. The 1870s were a time of illegal recruiting practices known as blackbirding. Malaitans are known to have volunteered as indentured labourers with some making their second trip to work on plantations, although the labour system remained exploitative. In 1901 the Commonwealth of Australia enacted the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 which facilitated the deportation of Pacific Islanders that was the precursor to the White Australia policy. However many islanders remained and formed the South Sea Islander community of Australia. Many labourers that returned to Malaita had learnt to read and had become Christian. The skills of literacy and protest letters as to being deported from Australia was a precedent for the later Maasina Ruru movement.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{proposes that}} {{contemporary}} ethnic subjectivities {{are shaped by}} modernist discourses. Ethnographic material {{about a group of}} Okinawan fishermen who worked with <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islanders</b> from 1971 to 2000 is used to explore the effect on national identities of being perceived as modern, or primitive. Okinawa is an island group to the south of Japan that became part of the Japanese Empire in the 1870 s. Since then Okinawa has been defined as primitive against modern Japan. Modernist discourse was one of the range of influences on relations between Okinawan fishermen and <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islanders.</b> Symbolically violent identifications of Okinawans as more modern than <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islanders</b> stymied efforts at grassroots cosmopolitanism. Insofar as perceptions of relative levels of modernness of ethnic groups act to rank them, modernism is therefore one of the factors at stake in competition between nationalisms and friction between ethnic groups...|$|R

6000|$|... 'But in Brown's crew {{there was}} a <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander,</b> kidnapped in his youth and devoted to Brown, who was the best man of the whole gang. That fellow swam off to the coaster--five hundred yards or so--with {{the end of a}} warp made up of all the running gear unrove for the purpose. The water was smooth, and the bay dark, [...] "like the inside of a cow," [...] as Brown {{described}} it. The <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander</b> clambered over the bulwarks {{with the end of the}} rope in his teeth. The crew of the coaster--all Tagals--were ashore having a jollification in the native village. The two shipkeepers left on board woke up suddenly and saw the devil. It had glittering eyes and leaped quick as lightning about the deck. They fell on their knees, paralysed with fear, crossing themselves and mumbling prayers. With a long knife he found in the caboose the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander,</b> without interrupting their orisons, stabbed first one, then the other; with the same knife he set to sawing patiently at the coir cable till suddenly it parted under the blade with a splash. Then in the silence of the bay he let out a cautious shout, and Brown's gang, who meantime had been peering and straining their hopeful ears in the darkness, began to pull gently at their end of the warp. In less than five minutes the two schooners came together with a slight shock and a creak of spars.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islanders</b> are Christian, {{with the}} Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, South Seas Evangelical, and Seventh-day Adventist faiths predominating. About 5% of the {{population}} maintain traditional beliefs.|$|R

They were the two women who did the cooking for the labourers, and their offence had {{consisted}} {{of one of them}} taking a bath in the big cauldron in which the potatoes were boiled. The blacks were not outraged from the standpoint of cleanliness; they often took baths in the cauldrons themselves. The trouble lay in that the bather had been a low, degraded, wretched female; for to the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander</b> all females are low, degraded, and wretched.|$|E

But it is possible to disengage and examine apart the two chief elements in the earliest as in the latest ideas of Godhead. Among the lowest and most backward, as among the most advanced races, there coexist the MYTHICAL and the RELIGIOUS elements in belief. The rational factor (or what approves itself to us as the rational factor) is visible in religion; the irrational is prominent in myth. The Australian, the Bushman, the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander,</b> in hours of danger and necessity 'yearns after the gods,' and has present in his heart the idea of a father and friend. This is the religious element. The same man, when he comes to indulge his fancy for fiction, will degrade this spiritual friend and father {{to the level of the}} beasts, and will make him the hero of comic or repulsive adventures. This is the mythical or irrational element. Religion, in its moral aspect, always traces back to the belief in a power that is benign and works for righteousness. Myth, even in Homer or the Rig-Veda, perpetually falls back on the old stock of absurd and immoral divine adventures.(1) ...|$|E

40|$|Independent Solomon Islands {{inherited}} {{lands that}} the colonial state had acquired and dedicated for forest use. <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islanders</b> became increasingly {{wary of the}} government's intentions regarding control of these lands and, by the late 1960 s, as political consciousness increased, resistance grew to government purchase and reservation through legislation. Pressure by <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islanders</b> caused the colonial government to limit its attempts to control the forest resource for the public good, a process that accelerated after independence in 1978. Since then, {{in the face of}} an expanding Asian market for timber, the claims of resource owners and a revenue-seeking central government have seen frantic logging of customary land by mainly Asian logging companies, with little tangible return to <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islanders.</b> Provincial governments and rural communities are already demanding control of public lands, a demand that may be resisted by the central government as timber on customary land is worked out and plantation forests mature...|$|R

60|$|Again, {{the most}} ludicrous or infamous tales may be current about the adventures and misadventures of the {{grasshopper}} or the hawk. He may be, as mythically conceived, {{only one out}} of a crowd of similar magnified non-natural men or lower animals. But neither his companions nor his legend are likely to distract the thoughts of the Bushman who cries to Cagn for food, or of the Murri who tells his boy that Pund-jel watches him from the heavens, or of the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander</b> who appeals to Qat as he crosses the line of reefs and foam. Thus it may be maintained that whenever man turns to a guardian not of this world, not present to the senses, man is for the moment a theist, and often a monotheist. But when we look from aspiration to doctrine, from the solitary ejaculation to ritual, from religion to myth, it would probably be vain to suppose that an uncontaminated belief in one God only, the maker and creator of all things, has generally prevailed, either in America or elsewhere. Such a belief, rejecting all minor deities, consciously stated in terms and declared in ritual, is the result of long ages and efforts of the highest thought, or, if once and again the intuition of Deity has flashed on some lonely shepherd or sage like an inspiration, his creed has usually been at war with the popular opinions of men, and has, except in Islam, won its disciples from the learned and refined. America seems no exception to so general a rule.|$|E

'Furthermore, to {{draw the}} enemy's fire and locate such parties as might have been hiding in the bushes along the creek, Brown ordered the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander</b> {{to go down to}} the boat and bring an oar, as you send a spaniel after a stick into the water. This failed, and the fellow came back without a single shot having been fired at him from anywhere. [...] "There's nobody," [...] opined some of the men. It is [...] "onnatural," [...] remarked the Yankee. Kassim had gone, by that time, very much impressed, pleased too, and also uneasy. Pursuing his tortuous policy, he had {{dispatched}} a message to Dain Waris warning him to look out for the white men's ship, which, he had had information, was about to come up the river. He minimised its strength and exhorted him to oppose its passage. This double-dealing answered his purpose, which was to keep the Bugis forces divided and to weaken them by fighting. On the other hand, he had in the course of that day sent word to the assembled Bugis chiefs in town, assuring them that he was trying to induce the invaders to retire; his messages to the fort asked earnestly for powder for the Rajah's men. It was a long time since Tunku Allang had had ammunition for the score or so of old muskets rusting in their arm-racks in the audience-hall. The open intercourse between the hill and the palace unsettled all the minds. It was already time for men to take sides, it began to be said. There would soon be much bloodshed, and thereafter great trouble for many people. The social fabric of orderly, peaceful life, when every man was sure of to-morrow, the edifice raised by Jim's hands, seemed on that evening ready to collapse into a ruin reeking with blood. The poorer folk were already taking to the bush or flying up the river. A good many of the upper class judged it necessary to go and pay their court to the Rajah. The Rajah's youths jostled them rudely. Old Tunku Allang, almost out of his mind with fear and indecision, either kept a sullen silence or abused them violently for daring to come with empty hands: they departed very much frightened; only old Doramin kept his countrymen together and pursued his tactics inflexibly. Enthroned in a big chair behind the improvised stockade, he issued his orders in a deep veiled rumble, unmoved, like a deaf man, in the flying rumours.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then one of {{the whites}} remembered that some tobacco had been left in the boat, and, {{encouraged}} by the impunity of the <b>Solomon</b> <b>Islander,</b> said {{he would go to}} fetch it. At this all the others shook off their despondency. Brown applied to, said, [...] "Go, and be d--d to you," [...] scornfully. He didn't think there was any danger in going to the creek in the dark. The man threw a leg over the tree-trunk and disappeared. A moment later he was heard clambering into the boat and then clambering out. [...] "I've got it," [...] he cried. A flash and a report at the very foot of the hill followed. [...] "I am hit," [...] yelled the man. [...] "Look out, look out--I am hit," [...] and instantly all the rifles went off. The hill squirted fire and noise into the night like a little volcano, and when Brown and the Yankee with curses and cuffs stopped the panic-stricken firing, a profound, weary groan floated up from the creek, succeeded by a plaint whose heartrending sadness was like some poison turning the blood cold in the veins. Then a strong voice pronounced several distinct incomprehensible words somewhere beyond the creek. [...] "Let no one fire," [...] shouted Brown. [...] "What does it mean?" [...] "Do you hear on the hill? Do you hear? Do you hear?" [...] repeated the voice three times. Cornelius translated, and then prompted the answer. [...] "Speak," [...] cried Brown, [...] "we hear." [...] Then the voice, declaiming in the sonorous inflated tone of a herald, and shifting continually {{on the edge of the}} vague waste-land, proclaimed that between the men of the Bugis nation living in Patusan and the white men on the hill and those with them, there would be no faith, no compassion, no speech, no peace. A bush rustled; a haphazard volley rang out. [...] "Dam' foolishness," [...] muttered the Yankee, vexedly grounding the butt. Cornelius translated. The wounded man below the hill, after crying out twice, [...] "Take me up! take me up!" [...] went on complaining in moans. While he had kept on the blackened earth of the slope, and afterwards crouching in the boat, he had been safe enough. It seems that in his joy at finding the tobacco he forgot himself and jumped out on her off-side, as it were. The white boat, lying high and dry, showed him up; the creek was no more than seven yards wide in that place, and there happened to be a man crouching in the bush on the other bank.|$|E
