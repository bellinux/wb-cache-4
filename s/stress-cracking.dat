LLDPE is a {{substantially}} linear polymer with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene). LLDPE has higher tensile strength than LDPE, and it exhibits higher impact and puncture resistance than LDPE. Lower thickness (gauge) films can be blown, compared with LDPE, with better environmental <b>stress-cracking</b> resistance, but is not as easy to process. LLDPE is used in packaging, particularly film for bags and sheets. Lower thickness may be used compared to LDPE. It is used for cable coverings, toys, lids, buckets, containers, and pipe. While other applications are available, LLDPE is used predominantly in film applications due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. Product examples range from agricultural films, Saran wrap, and bubble wrap, to multilayer and composite films. In 2013, the world LLDPE market reached a volume of US$40 billion.|$|E
50|$|When drying {{corn kernels}} it is {{important}} to keep in mind that cracks and fractures in the corn can lead to many problems in both the storage and processing. The major problem that occurs from high temperature drying and then rapid cooling of the grain is <b>stress-cracking.</b> <b>Stress-cracking</b> is when fractures become present in the corn endosperm. Stress-cracked kernels often absorb water too quickly, are more likely to become broken, and are increasingly susceptible to insect and mold damage during dry storage. In order to reduce the amount of grain that is lost due to <b>stress-cracking,</b> medium temperature and slow cooling, or natural air and low temperature drying methods should be employed.|$|E

The low strength of polymers compared to theoretically predicted values are mainly due to the many microscopic imperfections found in the material.

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) is continuously increasing; however its potentials are limited {{due to the}} lack of universally accepted and reliable design guidelines.

5000|$|The United States Maritime Commission {{were looking}} for options to update WWII Liberty ships, and {{heavy-duty}} gas turbines were one of those selected. In 1956 the John Sergeant was lengthened and equipped with a General Electric [...] HD gas turbine with exhaust-gas regeneration, reduction gearing and a variable-pitch propeller. It operated for 9,700 hours using residual fuel(Bunker C) for 7,000 hours. Fuel efficiency was {{on a par with}} steam propulsion at [...] per hour, and power output was higher than expected at [...] due to the ambient temperature of the North Sea route being lower than the design temperature of the gas turbine. This gave the ship a speed capability of 18 knots, up from 11 knots with the original power plant, and well in excess of the 15 knot targeted. The ship made its first transatlantic crossing with an average speed of 16.8 knots, in spite of some rough weather along the way. Suitable Bunker C fuel was only available at limited ports because the quality of the fuel was of a critical nature. The fuel oil also had to be treated on board to reduce contaminants and this was a labor-intensive process that was not suitable for automation at the time. Ultimately, the variable-pitch propeller, which was of a new and untested design, ended the trial, as three consecutive annual inspections revealed <b>stress-cracking.</b> This did not reflect poorly on the marine-propulsion gas-turbine concept though, and the trial was a success overall. The success of this trial opened the way for more development by GE on the use of HD gas turbines for marine use with heavy fuels. [...] The John Sergeant was scrapped in 1972 at Portsmouth PA. Boeing launched its first passenger-carrying waterjet-propelled hydrofoil Boeing 929, in April 1974. Those ships were powered by two Allison 501-KF gas turbines.|$|E

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the tensile behavior of strain hardening cementitious composites (SHCC) is of significant importance to the material design. In a previous work the tensile <b>stress-crack</b> opening response {{of different types of}} SHCC was characterized using notched specimens tested in direct tension, where a single crack was obtained and mechanically characterized by performing Single Crack Tension Test (SCTT). In this study the tensile behavior of SHCC materials is characterized under eccentric tensile load using the Compact Tension Test (CTT). The long edge notch placed in the rectangular plate specimens and the eccentrically applied tensile load create the local conditions necessary to the initiation of a single crack {{at the tip of the}} notch. Further propagation and opening of the crack in Mode I allow the assessment of the tensile load-displacement relationship.

The inelastic and elastic strain condition and time to the onset of crazing were also observed. A normalization of the time to onset of crazing using stress state, solubility difference and diffusion coefficients was shown to collapse the kinetic observations. ^ A comprehensive study of the degradation mechanisms of PBO AS fiber exposed in a controlled manner to challenging chemical environments, moisture and UV-Visible spectrum light was undertaken. Fibers were characterized using a broad range of mechanical and physical tests including tensile testing, Elemental Analysis, scanning electron microscopy, small angle X-ray diffraction, wide angle X-ray diffraction and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy. Degradation by moisture is found to be primarily due to a loosening of the fiber 2 ̆ 7 s fibrillar structure. Degradation by UV-Visible spectrum light is found to be chemical in nature involving hydrolytic disruption of the oxazole ring and possible subsequent conversion to an amide bond. ^ Approaches to alleviation of PBO AS fiber degradation were studied including super-critical carbon dioxide extraction of residual acid, the use of UV-Vis blocking coatings, compaction of the fiber microstructure and PBO AS/Siloxane composites prepared in super-critical carbon dioxide. ^ Finally, the effect of constraint on fracture at the interface between a polymer and adherend having orders of magnitude larger stiffness was studied using a model epoxy/metallic adherend system. Fracture energy was measured using an Elastic Wedge Opened Double Cantilevered Beam test and the process zone imaged using photoelastic methods. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} Strain Hardening Cementitious Composites (SHCC) {{is driven by}} the need to achieve certain performance parameters in tension.
