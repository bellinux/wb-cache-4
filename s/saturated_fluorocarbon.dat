The nanospheres are well dispersible {{in water and}} are capable of immediate uptake of SFCs. The nanosphere shells are gas-permeable and feature reactive functional groups for easy modification of the exterior. These features make the SFC-filled nanospheres promising vehicles for respiratory oxygen storage and transport. Uptake of molecular oxygen into nanosphere-stabilized SFC dispersions is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Isolating chemically-reactive sites into {{nanosized}} compartments is {{an important}} mode of control used by Nature to perform chemical transformations with extremely high yields and selectivity. Biological systems are fundamentally organized as bounded and isolated nano- and micro-sized environments featuring distinct localized properties, such as steric crowding, polarity, hydrophobicity, potential for molecular recognition, or pH. Through this compartmentalization, reaction substrates are sequestered away from interfering factors and competing substrates, or are physically prevented from forming alternative products or favoring specific pathways. Inspired by Nature, chemists have explored the rational design and application of various nanocompartments. This work explores three types of nanoconfinement systems capable of catalysis and specific transport: surfactant micelles, block-copolymer micelles, and hollow inorganic nanoparticles. The surfactant micelles are designed {{as part of a}} system of self-replicating micelles and are used to show how the chirality of the confinement system effects reaction kinetics. Simple click chemistry between a hydrophilic chiral head and a hydrophobic tail is used to produce an amphiphile under biphasic conditions. Once the product achieves critical micelle concentration, stable micelles can form. These micelles subsequently compartmentalize and pre-concentrate hydrophobic substrates, increasing the reaction rate and resulting in the self-propagation of the micellar structures and their chiralities. The next system explores block-copolymer micelles that are made up of a hydrophobic <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorocarbon</b> block and a hydrophilic block. The amphiphilic copolymers can form aggregates in water and, because of properties unique to the hydrophobic block, this system also increases oxygen solubility in water. Different fluorocarbon monomers are discussed and {{it was found that the}} structure of the fluorinated monomer, temperature, and pH effect aggregation behavior and the concentration of dissolved oxygen. Additionally, varying the pH of the system could be used to trigger oxygen release. Similar to the block-copolymer micelles, the hollow inorganic nanoparticles were designed to transport oxygen. Here, hollow silica nanoparticles were designed with a fluorinated interior surface and a hydrophilic exterior. This design allows for highly dispersible nanoparticles in water and facilitates the uptake of <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorocarbon</b> liquids into their cores. Once the <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorocarbon</b> is incorporated, the system can les to increases in oxygen solubility...|$|E
40|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was {{subjected}} to 3 keV electron bombardment and then heated in vacuum to 300 C. The behavior of the material {{as a function of}} radiation dose and temperature was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the surface and mass spectroscopy of the species evolved. A quantitative comparison of the radiation dose rate with that in other reported studies showed that, for a given total dose, the damage observed by XPS is greater for higher dose rates. Lightly damaged material heated to 300 C evolved <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorocarbon</b> species, whereas unsaturated fluorocarbon species evolved from heavily damaged material. After heating the heavily damaged material, those features in the XPS that were associated with damage diminished, giving the appearance that the radiation damage annealed. The apparent annealing of the radiation damage was found to be due to the covering of the network by saturated fragments that easily diffused through the decomposed material to the surface region upon heating...|$|E
40|$|We present {{experimental}} {{speed of}} sound data for the <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorocarbons</b> used most frequently in particle detector cooling systems. Data were collected over the moderate range of pressure (≤ 0. 4 MPa) and temperature 250 – 340 K. A commercial sound/density analyzer operating on the vibrating tube principle was employed for the measurements in liquid state. A dedicated sonar analyser – described in detail – was recently redesigned and developed for the {{speed of sound}} measurements in gas phase.

The mechanistic aspects of this remarkable effect remain to be explored experimentally. Here, the synthesis of a library of amphiphilic fluorous block-copolymers incorporating different fluorinated monomers is described, and the capacity of these copolymers for oxygen transport in water is systematically investigated. The structure of the fluorous monomer employed {{was found to have}} a profound effect on both the oxygen-carrying capacity and the gas release kinetics of the polymer emulsions. Furthermore, the release of O 2 from the polymer dispersions could be triggered by changing the pH of the solution.

5000|$|Perfluoroalkanes {{are very}} stable {{because of the}} {{strength}} of the carbon-fluorine bond, one of the strongest in organic chemistry.Its strength {{is a result of the}} electronegativity of fluorine imparting partial ionic character through partial charges on the carbon and fluorine atoms, which shorten and strengthen the bond through favorable covalent interactions. Additionally, multiple carbon-fluorine bonds increase the strength and stability of other nearby carbon-fluorine bonds on the same geminal carbon, as the carbon has a higher positive partial charge. Furthermore, multiple carbon-fluorine bonds also strengthen the [...] "skeletal" [...] carbon-carbon bonds from the inductive effect. Therefore, <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorocarbons</b> are more chemically and thermally stable than their corresponding hydrocarbon counterparts, and indeed any other organic compound. They are susceptible to attack by very strong reductants, e.g. Birch reduction and very specialized organometallic complexes.|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films are}} {{prepared}} by plasma polymerization using inductively coupled continuous-wave (CW) and variable duty cycle pulsed rf plasmas. The effects of hydrogen addition (0 − 97. 5 %) on thin films deposited from CW <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorocarbon</b> (CF_ 4 and C_ 2 F_ 6) plasmas are examined. Variable duty cycle, pulsed C_ 2 F_ 6 rf plasmas are employed for {{comparison to the}} CW results. Film properties are determined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Deposition rates and contact angles are also measured for all films. Analysis using these techniques indicates a strong dependence of the bulk and surface structure on the hydrogen content of the feed in the CW systems. Significantly different film chemistry and deposition rates are observed in the pulsed systems. For the pulsed systems, film composition is dependent on duty cycle and relative pulse on and off times. Using an optimum duty cycle of 3 % results in a less cross-linked fluorocarbon polymer, with primarily CF_ 2 species in the bulk film and CF_ 3 surface termination...|$|E
40|$|The {{excellent}} {{dielectric properties}} of saturated fluorocarbons have allowed {{their use in}} direct immersion liquid cooling of electronics, including supercomputers and as heat transfer media in vapour phase soldering and burn-in testing of electronics. Their high density, UV transparency, non-flammability, non-toxicity and radiation tolerance have led to their use as liquid and gas radiator media for RICH detectors in numerous particle physics experiments.

40|$|The {{excellent}} {{dielectric properties}} of saturated (CnF(2 n+ 2)) fluorocarbons have allowed {{their use in}} direct immersion liquid cooling of electronics, for example in the Cray series supercomputers. They have also found extensive use as heat transfer media in vapour phase soldering. Their high density and optical transparency led to the suggestion by Seguinot and Ypsilantis for their use as liquid and gas radiator media for RICH detectors: such fluids have now been used in numerous particle physics and astroparticle physics experiments, {{some of which are}} highlighted. Systems to circulate and purify fluorocarbon Cerenkov radiator fluids rely on thermodynamic cycles similar to those of modern CFC-free refrigerants. Such new refrigerants - designed to disintegrate under UV in the atmosphere - are radiation-intolerant and cannot be used for direct cooling of particle detectors in demanding radiation environments such as at LHC. However pure <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorocarbon</b> molecules are extremely radiation resistant as well as being non-flammable and non-toxic. Their use as evaporative refrigerants was pioneered for the ATLAS pixel detector, leading to their choice for the cooling of the entire silicon tracker. Additionally they are used to evaporative coolants in ALICE and TOTEM and as liquid coolants in ATLAS and CMS. Ultrasonic techniques for vapour phase analysis of fluorocarbon Cerenkov radiators - developed at SLAC during the 1980 s as an inexpensive and simple alternative to UV refractometry - have found use in the petro-chemical industry, in the MOCVD (metal organic chemical vapour deposition) manufacture of semiconductors and have been successfully demonstrated with gas mixtures used in clinical anaesthesia. Such techniques are again under development for the ATLAS tracker evaporative cooling system.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} {{the study of}} the synthesis of higher fluorocarbons from tetrafluoromethane (CF 4) with a plasma process based on the generation of a tip-tip electrical discharge at very high pressure. A series of experiments were performed using a He/CF 4 mixture with a ratio 60 / 40 % at a pressure of 2 MPa to investigate the effects of two modes of treatment: a continuous mode and an intermittent mode including a 30 s relaxation time between two successive discharges. The study shows the production of low quantities of <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorocarbons</b> (C 2 F 6 and C 3 F 8) at the experimental conditions employed. It also shows the intermittent mode of treatment to be more efficient in the synthesis of the saturated C 2 and C 3 fluorocarbon molecules in comparison to the continuous mode. The continuous treatment mode leads to unfavorable kinetics of synthesis for a given discharge duration while the intermittent treatment mode leads to an increase of higher fluorocarbon production with the number of discharges...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed plasmas were {{investigated}} {{as a means}} of controlling the composition of the surfaces generated via plasma polymerisation. A variety of precursors were studied under a range of plasma conditions using both continuous wave and pulsed plasmas. Surface and bulk analytical techniques were used to characterise the deposited plasma polymers whilst deposition rate measurements aided in understanding the effects of altering the various plasma parameters. Continuous wave plasma polymerisation of <b>saturated</b> cyclic <b>fluorocarbons</b> yielded plasma polymers with high fluorine/carbon ratios. Plasma instability at low powers limits the extent to which continuous wave power can be used to achieve good selectivity in the polymerisation process. Pulsed plasma polymerisation of perfluoroallylbenzene was studied in detail to investigate the influence of pulsing parameters on the surface composition. Highly aromatic surfaces were obtained through retention of the perfluorophenyl group from the precursor. Deposition rate experiments confirmed polymerisation was taking place in the off-portion of the duty cycle for precursors with a functional group susceptible to radical initiated reactions. A cyclic siloxane precursor with vinyl substituents was used to generate surface consisting of siloxane rings in an organic matrix. The monomer structure was retained through the reaction of the vinyl groups in the off-portion of the duty cycle. For low duty cycle pulsed plasma polymers the Si: 0 ratio of the plasma polymers was identical to that of the monomer, indicating successflil retention of monomer structure using pulsed plasmas. Preliminary investigations into the pulsed plasma polymerisation of styrene oxide yielded a range of polymer compositions with varying oxygen contents. The properties of the surfaces varied with oxygen content. The results indicate that pulsed plasmas can give significant enhancements ove...|$|R
40|$|Liposome {{systems are}} well {{reported}} for their activity as vaccine adjuvants; however novel lipid-based microbubbles {{have also been}} reported to enhance the targeting of antigens into dendritic cells (DCs) in cancer immunotherapy (Suzuki et al 2009). This research initially focused on the formulation of gas-filled lipid coated microbubbles and their potential activation of macrophages using in vitro models. Further studies in the thesis concentrated on aqueous-filled liposomes as vaccine delivery systems. Initial work involved formulating and characterising four different methods of producing lipid-coated microbubbles (sometimes referred to as gas-filled liposomes), by homogenisation, sonication, a gas-releasing chemical reaction and agitation/pressurisation in terms of stability and physico-chemical characteristics. Two of the preparations were tested as pressure probes in MRI studies. The first preparation composed of a standard phospholipid (DSPC) filled with air or nitrogen (N 2), whilst in the second method the microbubbles were composed of a fluorinated phospholipid (F-GPC) filled with a <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>saturated</b> gas. The studies showed that whilst maintaining high sensitivity, a novel contrast agent which allows stable MRI measurements of fluid pressure over time, could be produced using lipid-coated microbubbles. The F-GPC microbubbles were found to withstand pressures up to 2. 6 bar with minimal damage {{as opposed to the}} DSPC microbubbles, which were damaged at above 1. 3 bar. However, it was also found that DSPC-filled with N 2 microbubbles were also extremely robust to pressure and their performance was similar to that of F-GPC based microbubbles. Following on from the MRI studies, the DSPC-air and N 2 filled lipid-based microbubbles were assessed for their potential activation of macrophages using in vitro models and compared to equivalent aqueous-filled liposomes. The microbubble formulations did not stimulate macrophage uptake, so studies thereafter focused on aqueous-filled liposomes. Further studies concentrated on formulating and characterising, both physico-chemically and immunologically, cationic liposomes based on the potent adjuvant dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA) and immunomodulatory trehalose dibehenate (TDB) with the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG). One of the proposed hypotheses for the mechanism behind the immunostimulatory effect obtained with DDA:TDB is the ‘depot effect’ in which the liposomal carrier helps to retain the antigen at the injection site thereby increasing the time of vaccine exposure to the immune cells. The depot effect has been suggested to be primarily due to their cationic nature. Results reported within this thesis demonstrate that higher levels of PEG i. e. 25 % were able to significantly inhibit the formation of a liposome depot at the injection site and also severely limit the retention of antigen at the site. This therefore resulted in a faster drainage of the liposomes from the site of injection. The versatility of cationic liposomes based on DDA:TDB in combination with different immunostimulatory ligands including, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C), TLR 3 ligand), and CpG (TLR 9 ligand) either entrapped within the vesicles or adsorbed onto the liposome surface was investigated for immunogenic capacity as vaccine adjuvants. Small unilamellar (SUV) DDA:TDB vesicles (20 - 100 nm native size) with protein antigen adsorbed to the vesicle surface were the most potent in inducing both T cell (7 -fold increase) and antibody (up to 2 log increase) antigen specific responses. The addition of TLR agonists poly(I:C) and CpG to SUV liposomes had small or no effect on their adjuvanticity. Finally, threitol ceramide (ThrCer), a new mmunostimulatory agent, was incorporated into the bilayers of liposomes composed of DDA or DSPC to investigate the uptake of ThrCer, by dendritic cells (DCs), and presentation on CD 1 d molecules to invariant natural killer T cells. These systems were prepared both as multilamellar vesicles (MLV) and Small unilamellar (SUV). It was demonstrated that the IFN-g secretion was higher for DDA SUV liposome formulation (p< 0. 05), suggesting that ThrCer encapsulation in this liposome formulation resulted in a higher uptake by DCs.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{measured}} the flow {{boiling heat transfer}} coefficient (HTC) of <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorocarbon</b> blends in a horizontal copper-nickel tube with a diameter of 4 mm. Direct (Joule) heating of the tube wall was used to obtain heat fluxes from 5 to 13. 7 kW m− 2. Two different injection capillaries were used, permitting measurements at mass fluxes varying between 94 and 164 kg m− 2 s− 1. The evaporation pressure was approximately 0. 2 MPa for the mass fluxes close to 164 kg m− 2 s− 1 and 0. 15 MPa for the lower mass fluxes. The same tube dimensions and material {{are used in the}} on-detector cooling channels of the silicon micro-strip charged particle tracker (“SCT”) of the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The range of heat flux and mass flow studied encompasses the operating conditions of the tracker. When operating in the high radiation environment near to the proton beam collisions radiation tolerant coolants are essential. Saturated fluorocarbons (CnF(2 n+ 2)) are radiation resistant and allow thermodynamic “tailoring” by blending saturated molecules of different orders. Measurements were made with pure C 3 F 8 (R 218) and zeotropic blends containing 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 % (molar) C 2 F 6 (R 116). This work is a continuation of a previous study which showed that the operating temperature of the ATLAS SCT could be reduced by around 10 °C with the admixture of 25 % (molar) C 2 F 6, with no changes needed to the existing on-detector and circulatory pipework. The data analysis revealed multiple flow boiling regimes of the two-phase flow that varied as a function of coolant flow rate, heat flux, vapour quality and mixture composition. As expected, the HTC in pure C 3 F 8 was higher than in blends with increasing C 2 F 6 content. Nevertheless, the study confirmed that the ATLAS SCT could be operated at full power dissipation with cooling tube temperatures up to 10 °C colder than in pure C 3 F 8 with C 3 F 8 /C 2 F 6 blends having relatively modest values of HTCs in the range 1500 – 4000 W m− 2 K− 1...|$|E
