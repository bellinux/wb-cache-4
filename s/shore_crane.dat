40|$|A ship {{berthing}} plan assigns surface vessels a berth {{prior to}} their port entrance, or reassigns ships once in port {{to allow them to}} accomplish in a timely manner maintenance, training, and certification events which build readiness for future operational commitments. Each ship requires different services when in port, such as <b>shore</b> power, <b>crane</b> services, ordnance, and fuel. Unfortunately, not all services are offered at all piers. At present, ship berthing plans are manually prepared by a port operations scheduler and often result in unnecessary berth shifts, which puts ships out of action for several hours. An extensive user-friendly computerized optimization model is developed and tested to assist the schedulers in the creation of berthing plan which minimizes port loading conflicts, thus promoting fleet readiness through berthing stability. Norfolk Naval Station is used. Keywords: Port loading; Berthing plans; Port berthing; Military thesis; Ship berthing plans; Ship berthing; Berth scheduling; Ship scheduling; Supply replenishment.

40|$|Container traffic {{has grown}} {{exponentially}} since 1980 {{and has become}} a reliable and efficient means of transportation of goods. In addition, world wide containerization and the availability of cheap and frequent container transport to all corners of the world have had a profound influence on industrial production, transport and the environment. All these aspects result in increasing the pressure on container terminals to provide good service to shipping companies. The Royal Haskoning Maritime Division (hereafter, RHMD) deals internationally with development of different types of terminals such as container, liquid and dry bulk. Due to involvement of numerous stockholders in a port planning project, different design concepts may be considered to satisfy interests of different stockholder; therefore, various scenarios should be studied quantitatively. As an international maritime consultant, it is of crucial importance to own a simple and cheap tool to estimate the dimension of a container terminal. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop a tool for engineers to prepare concepts of terminal layout, and estimate the required areas of those concepts, for sake of comparison, for design of a new container terminal. Container terminal design is divided into “waterside” and “landside” areas. Waterside consists of a quay for serving vessels. Landside consists of a storage yard for stacking containers and a hinterland area for serving truck and trains. The developed package, in two consecutive steps, first, accepts the waterside, landside and cost estimation information, such as terminal throughput, downtime, stack occupancy, and second, requires the possible equipment concepts, such as ship to <b>shore</b> <b>cranes</b> and reach stackers etc. Based on the above input data, the performance of the terminal concepts is quantitatively evaluated. Eventually, the dimensions of the container terminal yard are presented. The container terminal design tool is verified against two formerly performed projects (in India and Guatemala) that have been successfully designed at RHMD. The validation showed good performance of the tool, with justified differences compared to actual designed values. As a case study, the package is also applied on design of a container terminal for a port in Angola. In this case study, four different scenarios and their impacts on layout dimensions are considered and analyzed. Hydraulic EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Esta dissertaÃÃo tem como objetivo apresentar metodologia para avaliaÃÃo de capacidade de terminais de contÃineres, baseada em simulaÃÃo e na anÃlise de indicadores de desempenho. Partiu-se do princÃpio de que o limite de capacidade para movimentaÃÃo de contÃineres seria obtido quando os navios atingissem tempo mÃdio de espera igual a 6 horas. A metodologia foi aplicada ao Porto de Fortaleza, para o qual foi desenvolvido modelo computacional no {{software}} ARENA para representar suas operaÃÃes. O modelo considerou o atendimento aos navios, enquanto a capacidade de estocagem do porto foi avaliada a partir de mÃtodo determinÃstico. NÃo foi considerada a parte de acesso terrestre ao porto na avaliaÃÃo. ApÃs a verificaÃÃo e validaÃÃo do modelo determinou-se a capacidade de movimentaÃÃo de contÃineres do porto para a situaÃÃo operacional de 2006. Depois foram avaliados cenÃrios que variaram entre destinar berÃo exclusivo para navios de contÃineres, melhorar a eficiÃncia das operaÃÃes de embarque e desembarque de contÃineres, aumentar a quantidade de berÃos de atracaÃÃo e a combinaÃÃo destas mudanÃas. Como resultados o modelo mostrou que se aumenta mais a capacidade do Porto de Fortaleza com a melhoria da produtividade das operaÃÃes do que com o aumento da quantidade de berÃos de atracaÃÃo. A destinaÃÃo de berÃo exclusivo para embarcaÃÃes com contÃineres tambÃm gerou aumento significativo da capacidade. O crescimento da consignaÃÃo dos navios reduziu a capacidade do porto devido ao crescimento dos tempos de operaÃÃo. Tanto o aumento da eficiÃncia das operaÃÃes quanto a disponibilizaÃÃo de mais berÃos para movimentaÃÃo de navios de contÃineres, intensificaram a utilizaÃÃo das infra-estruturas. A maior capacidade de movimentaÃÃo de contÃineres dentre os cenÃrios propostos foi atingida com a colocaÃÃo de dois berÃos exclusivos equipados com dois portÃineres cada, totalizando 624. 300 unidades por ano para tempo mÃdio de espera dos navios de contÃineres de 6 horas. Contudo, a capacidade ficou limitada a 397. 550 unidades por ano, devido a restriÃÃes da Ãrea de estocagem. Por fim a metodologia mostrou-se eficiente e permitiu a avaliaÃÃo de alternativas para a melhoria da capacidade. This dissertation has as objective presents {{methodology for}} evaluation of capacity of terminals of containers, based on simulation and {{in the analysis of}} performance indicators. It depart from the principle that the capacity limit for movement of containers would be reached when the ships reach average wait time same to 6 hours. The methodology was applied in Port of Fortaleza, for which was developed computational model in the software ARENA to represent it operations. The model considered the service to the ships, while the capacity of stockpiling of the port was evaluated from deterministic model. The part of terrestrial access to the port was not considered in the evaluation. After the verification and validation of the model was determined the capacity of movement of containers of the port for the operational situation of 2006. Then were appraised sceneries that varied among destining exclusive mooring for ships of containers, the improve of the efficiency of the operations of embarkment and disembarkation of containers, the increase of the amount of mooring and the combination of these changes. As results the model showed that the improvement of the productivity of the operations increases more the capacity of Port of Fortaleza than the increase of the amount of mooring. The destination of exclusive mooring for embarkations and disembarkation of containers also generated significant increase of the capacity. The growth of the consignment of the ships reduced the capacity of the port due to the growth of the times of operation. As much an increase of the efficiency of the operations as the make available of more cradles intensified the use of the infrastructures. The largest capacity of movement of containers among the proposed sceneries was reached with the placement of two exclusive cradles equipped with two ship to <b>shore</b> <b>cranes</b> each, totaling 624. 300 units a year for average wait time of the ships of containers of 6 hours. However the capacity was limited to 397. 550 units a year due to restrictions of the stockpiling area. Finally the methodology was shown efficient and it allowed the evaluation of alternatives for the improvement of the capacity...|$|R
