5|$|Anfield {{comprises}} 54,074 seats {{split between}} four stands: the Anfield Road end, the Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop, and the Main Stand. The Anfield Road end and Kenny Dalglish Stand are two-tiered, while the Kop is a single-tiered and the Main <b>Stand</b> <b>a</b> three-tiered. Entry {{to the stadium}} is gained by radio-frequency identification (RFID) smart cards rather than the traditional manned turnstile. This system, used in all 80turnstiles around Anfield, was introduced in 2005.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of its cancellation, Thunderbirds had become widely popular in the UK and was being {{distributed}} extensively overseas. Grade, however, believed that without the financial boost of an American network sale, a full second series would fail to recover its production costs. He therefore asked Anderson to devise a new concept that he hoped would <b>stand</b> <b>a</b> greater chance of winning over the profitable US market. This became Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.|$|E

Tajiri was accompanied {{to the ring}} by The Sinister Minister and Mikey Whipwreck, and Guido was accompanied by his fellow F.B.I. members. One {{of the highlights of}} the match occurred when Super Crazy deliver a moonsault off the balcony onto {{all the members of the}} F.B.I. Guido was the first eliminated when Whipwreck delivered a Whipper Snapper while the referee was distracted. Tajiri picked up the three count to eliminate Guido. Super Crazy won the match after performing a moonsault off the top rope onto Tajiri, getting the three-count in the process.|$|E

5|$|Pottery finds showed better finish {{compared}} to the earlier Period I. The pots were of polished black ware, mostly handmade, {{in the form of}} a dish with <b>stand,</b> <b>a</b> high-necked jar, and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned red ware pot which contained 950 beads made from carnelian and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought to belong to the later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular red ware pot made on a turntable; the painting on the pot was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is of interest is a polished black ware in globular shape jar with a long neck and flaring mouth.|$|E
5|$|The Main Stand covers {{approximately}} {{two thirds of}} the length of the pitch, though the attached enclosure is longer, covering the whole distance. The Main Stand, which seats 4,277 fans, also contains the dressing rooms, club offices and television gantry, {{as well as a number}} of supporting pillars, a car park and the Nick Owen and Eric Morecambe suites. To the Main Stand's right, in the corner above the end of the enclosure and next to the Kenilworth Stand, is the David Preece <b>Stand,</b> <b>a</b> family area which seats 711 spectators. The David Preece Stand acquired its present name in 2008, a year after the former player's death.|$|E

5|$|The Swedish commanders {{had decided}} they {{must try to}} make a <b>stand.</b> <b>A</b> few {{kilometers}} west of Nyborg the Swedish forces of about 5,500 men stood in battle formation {{in the way of the}} advancing forces. The Swedes had a good position, with a small lake on the left flank and a forest on the right, providing good cover for a retreat to Nyborg should it be necessary. Opposing them were 9,000 men, with Eberstein in command that day. They divided into two lines, each commanded by the respective commanders. Thrice Eberstein attacked; only to be rebuffed by intensive Swedish fire and cavalry attacks. Eberstein himself was almost captured, only narrowly escaping.|$|E
5|$|The club spent £1,400 {{appointing}} {{designers to}} oversee the excavation and levelling of the land, and moved a one-year-old stand from Carlisle Road to the highest {{part of the new}} ground. The original ground comprised the relocated <b>stand,</b> <b>a</b> 2,000-capacity stepped enclosure with the players' changing rooms beneath the stand, the playing area, a cinder athletics track and fencing to limit the total capacity to 18,000. The playing field was made of ballast, ashes, soil and sods. The ground was officially opened on 27 September 1886 for a game against Wakefield Trinity which was watched by a capacity crowd, but construction work meant most of Manningham's early games were away fixtures.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of Fort Lahtzanit was Lieutenant Muli Malhov, {{who had served}} on the canal before.

Two days before the outbreak of the war, Malhov expressed concern to his superior officer of the observations being made on the canal line, and that the forts would not <b>stand</b> <b>a</b> chance if they were attacked.|$|E

5|$|Fellow Spanish side Rayo Vallecano {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the quarter-finals. Alavés won the first leg at home 3–0. Rayo took a 2–0 lead in the second leg at their ground the Estadio Teresa Rivero, but a late Cruyff goal ensured that Alavés would progress to the semi-finals. Their {{opposition in the}} semi-finals were German team Kaiserslautern, the first leg in Spain saw four penalties awarded. Three were awarded to Alavés and one to Kaiserslautern, all were scored and a further two goals for Alavés ensured the match finished 5–1 to Alavés. The second leg at Kaiserslautern was essentially meaningless as the German team needed to score four goals to <b>stand</b> <b>a</b> chance of reaching the final. It was Alavés who scored four goals, Kaiserslautern scored a consolation goal, but Alavés won the match 4–1 to progress to the final in their first season in European courtesy of a 9–2 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 2007, Burnley {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a £20 million redevelopment of Turf Moor. The plans also included {{the creation of a}} youth academy at the club's training facility at Gawthorpe Hall in nearby Padiham. The plans were detailed in six phases. In the first phase it was planned to move the changing rooms to the corner between the James Hargreaves Stand and the Jimmy McIlroy Stand. The second phase included the demolition of the Cricket Field <b>Stand,</b> <b>a</b> new stand to be built at that end of the ground that would incorporate a hotel, a restaurant and a newly constructed cricket pavilion, and would be able to accommodate 2,500 fans. The redevelopments also included the construction of a multi-storey car park adjacent to the stadium. Other planned improvements include a new club superstore and other retail outlets, and new business offices {{on the site of the}} current club shop. Revealed in the fifth phase was a transformation of the Bob Lord Stand, which will eventually house a multi-screen cinema. The development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was later revealed by Burnley chief executive Paul Fletcher, taking the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor to 28,000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|Since the redevelopments to Celtic Park and Hampden Park were {{completed}} in the late 1990s, Ibrox has had the smallest capacity {{of the three major}} stadiums in Glasgow. Rangers have since explored options to increase capacity. After opening the Bar 72 area in 2006, chief executive Martin Bain said that the scheme could be replicated in the Copland <b>Stand.</b> <b>A</b> report in the Daily Record in April 2007 claimed that Rangers were planning to increase capacity to 57,000, principally by removing the JumboTron screens and lowering the pitch to accommodate more seating. These plans were said to be dependent for finance upon improved performance by the team. In January 2008, Rangers announced that they were investigating three options to further develop Ibrox. One of the proposals would have resulted in a capacity of 70,000, by replacing three of the stands with a bowl-type structure. These plans were shelved by October 2008, however, due to the late-2000s financial crisis.|$|E

5|$|The Little Busters {{will also}} {{participate}} in missions to accomplish some goal, and a mission will either be completed or failed {{depending on the}} choices of the player. These missions are connected with the battle sequences and batting practice in that they serve to give the characters experience, obtain accessories to use during fights, and improve their statistics. However, these missions do not affect the main plot in any way—the player even has the choice to turn off most of the minigames so that the player may focus on the main plot, including the battle sequences and batting practice. The {{first time that the}} game is played, Rin's statistics are weak compared to other characters. However, when the player completes several heroine's routes, Rin's and Riki's statistics will start out higher than before when the player starts a new game, allowing Rin and Riki to <b>stand</b> <b>a</b> better chance against opponents with higher statistics. The statistics of the Little Busters members are shown in a ranking system from highest to lowest in overall statistics.|$|E
5|$|The {{additional}} turbo-propulseur {{patent application}} 13.502, dated 3 December 1910, was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. With {{the help of}} Despujols, a boat maker, and the motor manufacturer Gregoire, Coandă supervised {{the building of a}} motor sled, powered by a 30hp (22kW) Gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur. The sledge was blessed by Russian Orthodox priests at the Despujols plant near Paris on 2 December 1910. Starting the next day, it was exhibited for two weeks at the 12th Automobile Salon of France, alongside Gregoire-powered automobiles on the Gregoire <b>stand.</b> <b>A</b> number of automobile and general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the sledge. A version of Coandă's turbo-propulseur design was shown {{for the second time in}} late 1910 at the Grand Palais of Paris. One of the periodicals reported an expected speed of , but no account exists of the sledge being tested.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} a cold open in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization. Wes starts at the Outskirt <b>Stand,</b> <b>a</b> {{dilapidated}} train engine {{in the middle of}} the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie. Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the oasis-esque Phenac City in time to see two men dragging a sack. After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui, a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade, who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems to do nothing about it. Later, upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger. Wes then confronts one of the grunts, which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon.|$|E
