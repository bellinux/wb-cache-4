40|$|Objective: Evidence {{regarding}} {{the benefits of}} strong primary care has influenced health policy and practice. This study focuses on changes in the breadth of services provided by general practitioners (GPs) in Europe between 1993 and 2012 and offers possible explanations for these changes. Design: Data on the breadth of <b>service</b> <b>profiles</b> were used from two cross-sectional surveys in 28 countries: the 1993 European GP Task Profile study (6321 GPs) and the 2012 QUALICOPC study (6044 GPs). GPs involvement in four areas of clinical activity (first contact care, treatment of diseases, medical procedures, and prevention) was established using ecometric analyses. The changes were measured by the relative increase in the breadth of <b>service</b> <b>profiles.</b> Associations between changes and national-level conditions were examined though regression analyses. Data on the national conditions were used from various other public databases including the World Databank and the PHAMEU (Primary Health care Activity Monitor) database. Setting: A total of 28 European countries. Subjects: GPs. Main outcome measure: Changes in the breadth of GP <b>service</b> <b>profiles.</b> Results: A general trend of increased involvement of European GPs in treatment of diseases and decreased involvement in preventive activities was observed. Conditions {{at the national level}} were associated with changes in the involvement of GPs in first contact care, treatment of diseases and, to a limited extent, prevention. Especially in countries with stronger growth of health care expenditures between 1993 and 2012 the <b>service</b> <b>profiles</b> have expanded. In countries where family values are more dominant the breadth in <b>service</b> <b>profiles</b> decreased. A stronger professional status of GPs was positively associated with the change in first contact care. Conclusions: GPs in former communist countries and Turkey have increased their involvement in the provision of services. Developments in Western Europe were less evident. The developments in the <b>service</b> <b>profiles</b> could only to a very limited extent be explained by national conditions. A main driver of reform seems to be the changes in health care expenditure, which may indicate a notion of urgency because there may be a pressure to curb the rising expenditures. Key pointsBroad GP <b>service</b> <b>profiles</b> are an indicator of strong primary care in a country. It is expected that developments in the breadth of GP <b>service</b> <b>profiles</b> are influenced by various national conditions related to the urgency to reform, politics, and means. Between 1993 and 2012 the involvement of GPs in European countries in treatment of diseases increased and their involvement preventive activities decreased. The national conditions were found to be associated with changes in GPs involvement as first contact of care, treatment of diseases, and, to a limited extent, prevention. More specifically, in countries with a stronger growth in health care expenditures, <b>service</b> <b>profiles</b> of European GPs have expanded more in the past decades...|$|R

40|$|Most Web {{and other}} on-line service {{providers}} (”Inter- net Services”) only support legacy ID (or email) and password (ID/PW) credential authentication. However, {{there are numerous}} vulnerabilities concerning ID/PW credentials. Scholars and the industry have proposed several improved security solutions, such as MFA, however most of the Internet Services have refused to adopt these solutions. Mobile phones are much more sensitive to these vulnerabilities (so this paper focuses on mobile phones). Many users take advantage of password managers, {{to keep track of}} all their Internet <b>Service</b> <b>profiles.</b> However, the Internet <b>Service</b> <b>profiles</b> found in password managers, are normally kept on the PC or mobile phone’s disk, in an encrypted form. Our first contribution is a design guideline, whereby the Internet <b>Service</b> <b>profiles</b> never need to touch the client’s disk. Most users would benefit, if they had the ability to use MFA, to login to a legacy Internet Service, which only supports ID/PW credential authentication. Our second contribution is a design guideline, whereby users can choose, for each legacy ID/PW Internet Service, which specific MFA they wish to use. We have also presenting conceptual design guidelines, showing that both of our contributions are minor changes to existing password managers, which can be implemented easily with low overhead.

40|$|In an {{age where}} medical {{collaboration}} {{is the key to}} effective healthcare delivery and continuity of care, the location of experts and the management of their time are affecting the wide deployment of eHealth services. In this setting, the use of instant messaging and presence technologies provides a possible solution. A collaboration platform based on instant messaging and presence technology has been employed to implement flexible and adaptable eHealth services. The platform is characterized by the use of medical device components that currently support real-time and / or store-andforward access to spirometry examinations, medical imaging, vital signs, ECG, and auscultation data. Other important features of the platform are eHealth <b>service</b> <b>profiles</b> that entail electronic document templates conforming to HL 7 ’s clinical document architecture (CDA), the electronic signing of clinical objects using smart cards, and the use of Object Management Group’s (OMG) person identification service (PIDS) to interoperate with clinical information systems. So far, eHealth <b>services</b> <b>profiles</b> have been designed for cardiology and respiratory problems. The storage of clinical data in actively shared episode folders and the flexible messaging services that provide users with feedback, feedthrough, awareness, and notification irrespective of their location, have been immediately embraced by the healthcare community. In the immediate future, eHealth <b>service</b> <b>profiles</b> are expected to be further refined based on user feedback and usage data to support service evolution and thus, lead to even more effective service provision in healthcare. 1...|$|R

However, traditional workflow definition languages, such as extended XPDL and service-oriented BPEL 4 WS, have become insufficient to specify business process semantics, especially the descriptions of inputs, outputs, preconditions and effects. In this paper, we propose a novel solution based on OWL-S, a semantic Web ontology language that leverages service discovery, invocation and negotiation more effectively. The enhanced SwinDeW-S architecture is adapted with advanced ontology-based <b>service</b> <b>profiles,</b> and it takes advantage of a well-developed profile generation tool, which translates the BPEL 4 WS process models to the OWL-S profiles. As a result, in a new prototype equipped with both BPEL 4 WS and OWL-S, communications and coordination among service flow peers have becom...|$|R
