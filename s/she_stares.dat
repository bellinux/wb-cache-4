5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E
5|$|While rain {{starts to}} fall, and {{people start to}} clear the streets, Carey remains walking on the pathway. The girl now reaches her destination, and is welcomed into the home of her lover. They soon board a bus, and travel to a new home where they will live together. As {{they are about to}} enter the bus, the girl's mother is seen {{screaming}} in tears for her daughter to return to her. She hesitates, and then continues with her lover onto the transport. The scene once again focuses on Carey, who is standing {{in the midst of a}} torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in a long black gown, is shown singing at the altar of a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> at an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album from the beginning of the video.|$|E
25|$|The ghost floats, footless {{and with}} arms bent {{up at the}} elbows as is {{customary}} for ghost images of the period, in flames above a grassy field. Her head is framed by pine boughs. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> off to the right, her gaze following her outstretched right arm. Covering {{the palm of her}} right hand is a blue cloth on top of which rests a rolled up kakemono or makimono scroll. In her left hand she grasps a red cloth—possibly a furoshiki—which is tied up as a round, flat parcel. Peaking out over her right shoulder is the brown feathered fletching of a single arrow.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> at him quickly; then shrugged her {{shoulders}} again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> {{at him a}} second, then laughed, {{a thought}} unpleasantly.|$|R

25|$|When {{all have}} left, the Marschallin, {{reminded}} {{of her own}} early marriage by Ochs's young bride, sadly ponders her fleeting youth and the fickleness of men ("Da geht er hin..."). By this time Octavian returns (in men's clothes) ("Ach, du bist wieder da"), she has realized {{that one day he}} will leave her ("Die Zeit, die ist ein sonderbar Ding"). She muses on the passage of time (a clock is heard chiming thirteen times), and turns Octavian away. After he has left, she suddenly realizes that she has forgotten to kiss him goodbye, and sends some footmen after him; however, it is too late, he is gone. The Marschallin summons her page to take the silver rose to Octavian to deliver to Sophie. After Mohammed departs, <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> pensively into her hand mirror (or similar) as the curtain falls.|$|E
25|$|As {{the month}} {{comes to an}} end, with the sun due to rise, the vampires start to burn down the town to destroy {{evidence}} of their presence, and prevent any survivors from telling the world what happened. Realizing Stella is trapped and that he cannot beat the vampires in his current state, Eben turns himself into a vampire by injecting himself with Billy's infected blood. He confronts Marlow, and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched through his head, causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms, while <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> at the sky, {{coming to grips with}} what has happened.|$|E
500|$|Set in {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, the narrator {{identifies}} the novel's protagonist as Sarah Woodruff, the Woman of the title, also known as [...] "Tragedy" [...] and as [...] "The French Lieutenant's Whore". She lives in the coastal town of Lyme Regis as a disgraced woman, supposedly abandoned by a French ship's officer named Varguennes who had returned to France and married. She spends some of her limited free time on The Cobb, a stone jetty where <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> out to sea.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> at him, doubting her senses, her pupils {{wide with}} terror.|$|R
60|$|We both stared wildly {{at her and}} <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> tranquilly at us both.|$|R

500|$|As part of {{photographer}} Annie Leibovitz's Disney Dream Portrait Series {{that she}} has been commissioning for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts since 2007, The Walt Disney Company hired American country singer-songwriter Taylor Swift to be featured as the model for Rapunzel. In {{a detailed description of the}} piece, Us Weekly wrote, [...] "The stunning image — captioned 'Where a world of adventure awaits' — shows the 23-year-old Grammy winner perched on the window ledge of a moss-covered stone tower. A pink petticoat peeks out from under her purple gown as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> wistfully into the distance, her long golden tresses flowing regally in the wind." [...] Swift told On The Red Carpet that she was honored.|$|E
500|$|She {{then walks}} past several people, dances with several {{men and women}} in white and black suits and dresses, as the second chorus begins. Beyoncé and the dancers perform a dance routine together, and soon she meets a man, who dances with her. A {{particular}} scene shows all the dancers crouch down to the floor, and follow Beyoncé as she walks, before she blows them back. [...] The bridge starts, and the video moves to Beyoncé in a red room, where she and her dancers dance in short skirts, fishnets and black sparkling dresses. The group is later dance in the red and white rooms together. Leading into the final chorus, Beyoncé dances back in the room with the dancers, while Rowland, Williams and her sister sit on a black couch. As the video ends, Beyoncé {{stands in front of the}} mirror she was at the start and fades to black as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> at the viewer through it.|$|E
2500|$|Utamaro {{depicts the}} courtesan Hanaōgi of the Ōgiya (...) as she composes a letter, writing brush held {{to her cheek}} as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> at the paper deep in thought. [...] The Ōgiya was a large, {{long-established}} shop in Yoshiwara, and Hanaōgi built her reputation in the 1780s for her beauty and her skills in singing, playing the koto, the tea ceremony, the Chinese classics, and incense.|$|E
60|$|A moment <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> at him bewildered. He {{was very}} disconcerting. Then she recovered.|$|R
60|$|Rosemary {{was silent}} for a moment from sheer dumbfounderment. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> at Una blankly.|$|R

2500|$|The {{woman in}} Fukaku Shinobu Koi ( [...] , [...] "deeply hidden love") has {{blackened}} her teeth with ohaguro, which normally signifies a married woman, but she lacks the shaved eyebrows {{that would also}} signify her being married; she is perhaps yet young and recently married. [...] Her ornate kanzashi hairpin has a flower design on it. [...] She looks down and holds a kiseru tobacco pipe in her right hand. [...] <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> off, her shoulders raised, eyes narrowed, and tiny lips pursed, as if in deep, emotional mid-sigh.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Scherzinger {{sitting in the}} back of a London hackney carriage. As the rain pours outside and raindrops cover the windows, she sings the first verse while {{changing}} her smart clothes for more casual ones. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> longingly out of the carriage's window, watching the rain outside. During the chorus, there are two main scenes. In the first she is seen wrapped in blanket while in the second she walks across the room of an old house, in need of renovation. The lighting is cold and dim, and most of the furniture is covered in plastic wrap. Scherzinger stares resentfully at her surroundings while crossing the room. In the second verse, Scherzinger stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom of the house where she has a moment of realisation. After turning the taps on for a while, the sink overflows as she scornfully looks in the mirror, relating to the lyrics of the song. She is then scene walking towards the camera, through a hallway of the house. It is a confident independent walk towards the audience with lights flashing rhythmically behind her. The bridge sees Scherzinger sitting in one the house's empty rooms, in an old armchair and intersects some of the earlier carriage and bathroom scenes. As she sings the lyric [...] "The screen fades to black", the blanket seen earlier on falls in front of the camera, revealing a close up shot of Scherzinger's face. Her hair flows in the wind and she finally gets up from the armchair to stand in front of the room's open windows. In the final scene, she stands confidently in front of the window as wind and light flood the room. She sings the final verse of the song, looking directly at the camera and smiling for the first time in the video.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} a consecutive, quick {{close-up}} of each group member. Natalie Appleton, first, is seen with tied-back hair and black sunglasses turning around. Shaznay Lewis, second, is seen with loose hair removing her sunglasses. Nicole Appleton, third, is seen wearing a tilted black hat and a veil over her face. Melanie Blatt, last, is wearing a European-styled black cap with her hair curled to volume and is depicted throughout the video reading The Thief's Journal by Jean Genet. A scene is then focused around the atmosphere outside a bank as the girls begin to arrive, {{the name of the}} fictional bank is [...] "La Banca dei Fortunati" [...] (in Italian it means [...] "The Bank of the luckies"). The name of the fictional bank director is [...] "Benito Berlusconi" [...] The music video is set in black and white, with occasional streaks of yellow or red visible for dramatic emphasis. The scene then shifts to an ATM where money is seen ejecting. Shaznay and Nicole then walk into the bank in supermodel style with whips. Natalie comes through another entrance with her glasses on her head. With security all around, Natalie acts innocent by pretending to be doing her make-up while she waits for Nicole and Shaznay to act out the robbery. [...] Upon Nicole and Shaznay about to act out the robbery is a scene where blood is leaking in a white background. Shaznay and Nicole are then seen sitting down at a table making a deal with the bank managers. At this stage Natalie goes back outside and puts her [...] glasses back on. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> at one of the security guards as blood starts dripping underneath her sunglasses from her eyes {{to the extent that the}} ground beneath her rapidly enlarges in a circle of blood before the screen flashes out in red. In another seen, Nicole removes her hat and now has loose hair, and begins crawling to escape the bank while Melanie is waiting outside reading. Natalie and Shaznay are now in the bank area where they make use of a whip to frighten the civilians. The civilians then put their hands in the air and begin moving together in an almost robotic dance routine. The group then makes their escape via a motorcycle and side car. Melanie had never driven a motorcycle before and W.I.Z. had to draft in an extra hiding behind a cap to take her place.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> at {{him with}} an ashen face and gulped twice before she could speak.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> at {{the paper}} in her hand. Then she looked away into the fire.|$|R

60|$|This was {{a mystery}} beyond Nance's penetration, and <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> in wonder as she made the porridge.|$|R
6000|$|... [JOHN comes in. JENNY, {{after taking}} his hand, [...] sinks {{down on a}} chair, paying no {{attention}} [...] to the following conversation; <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> in [...] front of her, quite distraught. BASIL tries [...] {{with all his might}} to appear calm and [...] natural.|$|E

60|$|LORD BROCKLEHURST. She was {{a pretty}} little thing. (<b>She</b> <b>stares,</b> but he marches to his doom.) Ah, not {{beautiful}} like you. I assure you it was the merest flirtation; {{there were a few}} letters, but we have got them back. It was all owing to the boat being so late at Calais. You see she had such large, helpless eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> at the Baxters {{like one}} in a dream, and then gave a sudden cry of alarm.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> started, <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> at {{him with}} {{distended}} eyes, and her small mouth was open like a ring.|$|R
60|$|Again <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> at him blankly, {{and with}} that vague {{expression}} of puzzlement which irritated whilst it half-frightened him.|$|R
