5|$|As {{with other}} <b>swallows,</b> both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other <b>swallows</b> and swifts. They feed low over {{a variety of}} open {{habitats}} or woodland. Prey items recorded for the Mascarene martin include scarab, click and other beetles, Hemiptera and flying ants, and Brazza's martins will take termites. In eastern Africa, areas deforested by logging or conversion to agriculture are used for hunting by Brazza's martins.|$|E
5|$|The river martins are in {{some ways}} {{intermediate}} between typical <b>swallows</b> and other passerines: they have stout bills, large feet and relatively strong legs, which is unusual in aerial feeders. They also have a large syrinx (vocal organ) and a different bronchial structure. The extent of their differences from other <b>swallows</b> and the wide geographical separation of these two martins suggest that they are relict populations {{of a group of}} species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolutionary history, and they may be the most primitive of the <b>swallows.</b> Like other early hirundine lineages, they nest in burrows, rather than adopted nest holes or mud nests.|$|E
5|$|This <b>swallow,</b> {{along with}} the violet-green <b>swallow</b> and Bahama <b>swallow,</b> {{comprise}} a clade. It is also considered {{to be of the}} subgenus Tachycineta, the nominate subgenus, in addition to the violet-green <b>swallow,</b> Bahama <b>swallow,</b> and tree <b>swallow.</b>|$|R
50|$|The West African <b>swallow</b> was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Hirundo. Some authorities consider {{it to be a}} subspecies of the red-rumped <b>swallow.</b> Alternate names for the West African <b>swallow</b> include the lowland <b>swallow,</b> Senegal red-rumped <b>swallow</b> and West African striated <b>swallow.</b>|$|R
50|$|This <b>swallow</b> {{is similar}} to the Chilean <b>swallow</b> but can be {{differentiated}} by the Chilean <b>swallow's</b> lack of a supraloral white streak. The Chilean <b>swallow</b> also seems to keep its glossy blue upperparts when not breeding. The white-rumped <b>swallow</b> is, in addition, larger than the Chilean <b>swallow.</b>|$|R
5|$|Both species {{typically}} {{breed in}} small groups: the Mascarene martin builds a shallow cup nest of twigs and coarse plant material {{with a soft}} inner lining, whereas Brazza's martin makes a small heap of soft material such as feathers or dry grass {{at the end of}} a typically 50-cm (20-in) tunnel in a riverbank. The normal clutch is three eggs for Brazza's martin, two for Mascarene martins on Madagascar and Mauritius, and two or three for those on Réunion. As with other <b>swallows,</b> both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other <b>swallows</b> and swifts.|$|E
5|$|The Delichon martins have simple flight {{calls of}} one to three notes. In the two more {{widespread}} species these have a distinctive buzzing quality. The male's song is a short simple ripple, perhaps less musical than that given by other <b>swallows.</b>|$|E
5|$|The river martins form a {{distinctive}} subfamily Pseudochelidoninae within the swallow and martin bird family Hirundinidae. The two species are the African river martin Pseudochelidon eurystomina, {{found in the}} Congo and Gabon, and the white-eyed river martin Pseudochelidon sirintarae, known only from one site in Thailand. These are medium-sized, largely black <b>swallows</b> that have a light buoyant flight and feed on insects caught in the air. They {{appear to be more}} terrestrial than other <b>swallows,</b> frequently walking rather than perching, and the white-eyed may be crepuscular. The African species excavates nest holes in sandy ridges in rivers, while the breeding locations and habits of the Asian bird are unknown.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} {{pharyngeal}} <b>swallowing</b> function is impaired in globus patients with <b>swallowing</b> difficulty by dynamic <b>swallowing</b> study. Methods: Dynamic <b>swallowing</b> studies {{were performed on}} 80 normal adult volunteers and 33 globus patients with <b>swallowing</b> difficulty. Objective parameters such as maximum displacement of the hyoid bone, pharyngeal transit time, pharyngeal constriction ratio, and maximum opening of the esophageal entrance were measured, which were {{closely associated with the}} pharyngeal <b>swallowing</b> function in the <b>swallowing</b> process. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} globus patients and normal adults in hyoid bone displacement, pharyngeal transit time, pharyngeal constriction ratio, or maximum opening of the esophageal entrance (p >  0. 05). Conclusion: The results of the dynamic <b>swallowing</b> study indicated that the pharyngeal <b>swallowing</b> function of globus patients was not impaired.

50|$|The {{species was}} {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the Chilean <b>swallow,</b> most {{likely due to}} the similarity in morphology and calls. It is occasionally placed in the genus Iridoprocne with the tree <b>swallow,</b> mangrove <b>swallow,</b> white-winged <b>swallow,</b> and Chilean <b>swallow.</b> A study of the mitochondrial DNA of Tachycineta supports the split, although studies do show that the white-rumped <b>swallow</b> forms a superspecies, leucorrhoa, with the Chilean <b>swallow.</b> This species is monotypic, with no known subspecies.|$|R

5|$|About 170 {{species of}} birds visit the park each year, {{including}} swifts and <b>swallows.</b> Most species migrate to warmer regions in winter, although jays, ravens, nuthatches, eagles, and owls stay. In winter, the mule deer, cougars, and coyotes migrate to lower elevations. Ground squirrels and marmots pass the winter in hibernation.|$|E
5|$|As a demonstration, Desbouvrie {{brought an}} untamed swallow from the Roubaix area to Paris and {{released}} it. The bird {{returned to its}} home 258 kilometers away in 90 minutes. Desbouvrie promised that trained <b>swallows</b> would provide even better speeds. The governor of Lille oversaw testing near Roubaix and a military engineer named Captain Degouy was ordered to oversee a duplication of the Roubaix experiments.|$|E
5|$|As a group, {{the house}} martins cannot easily be {{confused}} with any other <b>swallows.</b> Four species of the genus Tachycineta have white rumps and underparts, but they have bright metallic green or blue-green upperparts, longer tails, and are restricted to Central and South America. The variable plumages of the South Asian species and a confused taxonomic history has left their distribution ranges in doubt.|$|E
40|$|A timed test of <b>swallowing</b> {{capacity}} {{has been}} designed for use in patients with neurogenic dysphagia. <b>Swallowing</b> speed (ml/s) has been demonstrated to have high intra- and inter- rater and test- retest reliability, and to be essentially independent of flavour or temperature. "Guideline" normal values were established in individuals without a <b>swallowing</b> disorder: <b>swallowing</b> speed was less in females than males and declined in both groups with age. The validity of a <b>swallowing</b> speed less than 10 ml/s as an index of abnormal <b>swallowing</b> was tested by comparison with the complaint of abnormal <b>swallowing</b> {{in a group of}} 81 neurological patients. <b>Swallowing</b> speed had a sensitivity of 96 % and specificity of 69 %: some apparent false positive responses were found in patients with disordered <b>swallowing,</b> mainly due to multiple sclerosis. Using a standard questionnaire and examination a similar pattern of symptoms and signs were statistically associated with both the clinical complaint of abnormal <b>swallowing</b> and <b>swallowing</b> speed. It is concluded that <b>swallowing</b> speed is a reliable and valid index for assessing disordered <b>swallowing</b> in neurological patients and may be of value in monitoring response to therapy...|$|R
5000|$|All nine Tachycineta {{species have}} glossy {{blue or green}} backs and white underparts, but the five species with white rumps [...] - [...] the {{mangrove}} <b>swallow,</b> Tumbes <b>swallow,</b> white-winged <b>swallow,</b> white-rumped <b>swallow</b> and Chilean <b>swallow</b> [...] - [...] are particularly closely related, the first three and the last two forming two superspecies. The Tumbes <b>swallow</b> of coastal Peru was formerly {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the mangrove <b>swallow,</b> but its calls, behaviour, and cytochrome b data indicate that it should be considered as a separate species. It is also differentiated from the mangrove <b>swallow</b> by its lack of a supraloral white line and by its slight difference in size.|$|R

5|$|Birds are {{the primary}} natural enemies of the Sirex woodwasp. The adults are {{frequently}} hunted by <b>swallows</b> (Hirundidae) and swifts (Apodidae), both of which prefer males. The black woodpecker (Dryocopius martius) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) consume some larvae, but do not specialize on the Sirex woodwasp.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from most other <b>swallows</b> in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts. Although the lesser striped swallow has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Swallowing</b> {{changes are}} common in Parkinson′s disease (PD). Early {{identification}} is essential to avoid complications of aspiration. Objectives: To evaluate the <b>swallowing</b> ability of the PD patients and to correlate it with the indicators of disease progression. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 PD patients (70 males and 30 females) aged between 50 years and 70 years with varying stage, duration, and severity were enrolled in a cross-sectional study carried out between January and May 2012. A simple bedside water <b>swallowing</b> test was performed using standard 150 ml of water. <b>Swallowing</b> process was assessed under three categories-swallowing speeds (ml/s), <b>swallowing</b> volume (ml/swallow) and <b>swallowing</b> duration (s/swallow). Equal number of age and sex matched controls were also evaluated. Results: All of them completed the task of <b>swallowing.</b> A mean <b>swallowing</b> speed (27. 48 ml/s), <b>swallowing</b> volume (28. 5 ml/s), and <b>swallowing</b> duration (1. 05 s/swallow) was established by the control group. The PD patients showed decreased <b>swallowing</b> speed (7. 15 ml/s in males and 6. 61 ml/s in females), decreased <b>swallowing</b> volume (14. 59 ml/swallow and 14 ml/swallow in females), and increased <b>swallowing</b> duration (2. 37 s/swallow and 2. 42 s/swallow) which are statistically significant. There was a significant positive correlation between the severity, duration, and staging of the disease with the <b>swallowing</b> performance and a poor correlation between the subjective reports of dysphagia and the objective performance on water <b>swallow</b> test. Conclusion: The water <b>swallowing</b> test is a simple bedside test to identify the <b>swallowing</b> changes early in PD. It is recommended to do the test in all PD Patients to detect dysphagia early and to intervene appropriately...|$|R

5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank <b>swallows,</b> northern rough-winged <b>swallows</b> and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.|$|E
5|$|Pratincoles have short legs, {{very long}} pointed wings and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders {{is that they}} {{typically}} hunt their insect prey on the wing like <b>swallows,</b> although they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.|$|E
5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch <b>swallows</b> and martins in flight, and pale crag martins may be hunted by species such as the {{peregrine}} falcon, Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby. Pale crag martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts, which sometimes forcibly take over martins' nests.|$|E
50|$|Presbyphagia {{refers to}} {{characteristic}} {{changes in the}} <b>swallowing</b> mechanism of otherwise healthy older adults. Although age-related changes place older adults at risk <b>swallowing</b> disorders, an older adult’s <b>swallow</b> is not necessarily an impaired <b>swallow.</b> Clinicians are becoming {{more aware of the}} need to distinguish among <b>swallowing</b> disorders, presbyphagia (an old yet healthy <b>swallow)</b> and other related diagnoses in order to avoid over diagnosing and over treating presbyphagia. Older adults are more vulnerable and with the increased threat of acute illnesses, medications and any number of age-related conditions, they can cross the line from having a healthy older <b>swallow</b> to being dysphagic.|$|R

5|$|Some {{species have}} other modes of feeding. Grimpoteuthis has a reduced or {{non-existent}} radula and <b>swallows</b> prey whole.

5|$|The Delichon species {{typically}} feed {{higher in}} the air, and take smaller prey than other <b>swallows.</b> It is believed that this reduces inter-specific food competition, particularly with the barn swallow which shares much of the breeding and wintering range of the martins. The insects eaten are mostly small flies, aphids and Hymenoptera such as winged ants. A wide range of other insects are caught, including Lepidoptera, beetles and lacewings. The Asian house martin appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground. These martins are gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts, or other hirundines such as the barn or striated <b>swallows.</b> In the case of at least the common house martin, the start of egg laying appears {{to be linked to}} the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids, which provide a stable and abundant food supply.|$|E

40|$|Cervical {{auscultation}} presents as a noninvasive screening {{assessment of}} <b>swallowing.</b> Until now {{the focus of}} acoustic research in <b>swallowing</b> has been the characterization of <b>swallowing</b> sounds,. However, {{it may be that}} the technique is also suitable for the detection of respiratory sounds post <b>swallow.</b> A healthy relationship between <b>swallowing</b> and respiration is widely accepted as pivotal to safe <b>swallowing.</b> Previous investigators have shown that the expiratory phase of respiration commonly occurs prior to and after <b>swallowing.</b> That the larynx is valved shut during <b>swallowing</b> is also accepted. Previous research indicates that the larynx releases valved air immediately post <b>swallow</b> in healthy individuals. The current investigation sought to explore acoustic evidence of a release of subglottic air post <b>swallow</b> in nondysphagic individuals using a noninvasive medium. Fifty-nine healthy individuals spanning the ages of 18 to 60 + years <b>swallowed</b> 5 and 10 milliliters (ml) of thin and thick liquid boluses. Objective acoustic analysis was used to verify presence of the sound and to characterize its morphological features. The sound, dubbed the glottal release sound, was found to consistently occur in close proximity following the <b>swallowing</b> sound. The results indicated that the sound has distinct morphological features and that these change depending on the volume and viscosity of the bolus <b>swallowed.</b> Further research will be required to translate this information to a clinical tool...|$|R
