40|$|With rapid social {{development}} and large-scale construction of infrastructure in China, construction projects have {{become one of}} the driving forces for the national economy, whose energy consumption, environmental emissions, and social impacts are significant. To completely understand the role of construction projects in Chinese society, this study developed input-output life-cycle assessment models based on 2002, 2005, and 2007 economic benchmarks. Inventory indicators included 10 types of energy, 7 kinds of environmental emissions, and 7 kinds of social impacts. Results show that embodied energy of construction projects in China accounts for 25 - 30 % of total energy consumption; embodied SO 2 emissions are being controlled, and the intensities of embodied NOx and CO 2 have been reduced. However, given that the construction sector related employment is 17 % of the total employment in China, the accidents and fatalities related to the construction sector are significant and represent approximately 50 % of the national total. The embodied human and capital investments in science and technology (ST) increased from 2002 to 2007. The embodied full time equivalent (FTE) of each ST person also increased while the personal <b>ST</b> <b>funding</b> and intramural expenditures decreased. This might result from the time lag between RD activities and large-scale implementation. Input-output life cycle assessment Embodied impacts Construction projects...|$|E
40|$|The lack of {{statistical}} {{evidence to show}} that 21 st Century Community Learning Center (21 <b>st</b> CCLC) <b>funded</b> after-school programs had a relationship with improved school achievement based on state-based standardized tests in North Carolina presented a problem for leaders. However, given the abundance of school achievement data and the presence of forty-two 21 <b>st</b> CCLC <b>funded</b> after-school programs, North Carolina was fertile ground for a quantitative study {{of the relationship between the}} 21 <b>st</b> CCLC <b>funded</b> after-school programs and school achievement. ^ The primary sample population in this research was 30 elementary public schools in North Carolina that hosted 21 <b>st</b> CCLC <b>funded</b> after-school programs. For the purpose of comparing the relationship between 21 <b>st</b> CCLC <b>funded</b> after-school programs and school achievement, there was a secondary sample of 30 comparable elementary public schools in North Carolina that did not have after-school programs. ^ Once a relationship between schools with and without 21 <b>st</b> CCLC <b>funded</b> after-school programs was determined, the study only focused on the schools with 21 <b>st</b> CCLC <b>funded</b> after-school programs. An after-school survey developed by the RAND Corporation was administered to district-level directors of the 21 <b>st</b> CCLC <b>funded</b> after-school programs as well as the site director/supervisor at the school-level. The survey results were coded to help determine the levels of quality (Inadequate, Minimal, Good, Excellent) of three areas of practice in each of the 21 <b>st</b> CCLC <b>funded</b> after-school programs: (a) after-school program staffing, (b) after-school program management, and (c) after-school program community involvement. These areas and their relationship to school achievement were analyzed using multiple regression analysis and analysis of covariance. All of the hypotheses in this study were retained. ...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the advent}} of MCMC engines Bayesian {{hierarchical}} models are becoming increasingly common for modelling ecological data. However, the great enthusiasm for model fitting has not yet encompassed the selection of competing models, despite its fundamental role in the inferential process. This contribution is intended as a starting guide for practical implementation of Bayesian model and variable selection into a general purpose software in BUGS language. We explain two well-known procedures, the product space method and the Gibbs variable selection, clarifying theoretical aspects and practical guidelines through applied examples on the comparison of non-nested models and on the selection of variables in a generalized linear model problem. Despite the relatively wide range of available techniques and the difficulties related to the maximization of sampling efficiency, for their conceptual simplicity and ease of implementation the proposed methods represent useful tools for ecologists and conservation biologists that want to close the loop of a Bayesian analysis.
