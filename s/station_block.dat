Modified plans were drawn in 1913-14, and included the main station building (with booking lobby, booking office, waiting shed, ladies' toilets, passage, refreshment room, kitchen, pantry, scullery and kitchen yard); a signal cabin; and a utilities block (with men's toilet, porter's room, store room, and lamp room).

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of <b>blocked</b> <b>stations</b> that appears in some spatial configurations of multi-hop wireless networks based on the 802. 11 DCF (Distributed Coordination Function). The problem leads to starvation {{of at least one}} station caused by the presence of neighbor stations within its carrier sensing range that do not hear each other. We propose Forced Transmissions, a simple and efficient solution to this problem. It consists of detecting that a <b>station</b> is <b>blocked</b> by others <b>stations</b> and forcing a transmission. This results in a collision that increases the contention windows of <b>blocking</b> <b>stations</b> and leaves some channel time to the <b>blocked</b> <b>station</b> for transmitting. The <b>blocked</b> <b>station</b> forces transmission only with some proba-bility adjusted in function of the time spent waiting for the channel. Our simulations show that the proposed method increases the minimal throughput of the <b>blocked</b> <b>stations</b> at the expense of a slight degradation of the total throughput, which is unavoidable in any DCF based solution. 1...|$|R

50|$|With the {{building}} of the block brown coal power station with optimized equipment technology (BoA) a new chapter at the power station began; between 1997 and 2002 it was the most modern brown coal power <b>station</b> <b>block</b> of the world with a gross achievement of 1,012 megawatts (950 MW net) developed with a far higher efficiency (43%) than the other plants (as low as 31%). RWE invested €1,200 million into the project. Beside the new power <b>station</b> <b>block,</b> whose building has a height of 172 metres (one of the tallest industrial buildings in the world), the second-largest cooling tower in the world (200 metres), which serves also as the chimney of this unit, had already been built.

In the presence of Wolfgang Clement, the then North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister, and Gerhard Schroeder, the then Federal Chancellor, the new power station went on to the grid.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1880s the Byfield {{district}} was surveyed into farm portions and opened for agricultural selection. Pastoral leases {{gave way to}} agriculture, encouraged by longer tenure and high yields from relatively small areas. An 1887 survey plan of the farm portions surrounding the Byfield Head <b>Station</b> <b>block</b> (portion 171, surveyed in 1870) shows the old route linking Byfield with stations {{to the north and}} west, circumventing the homestead block along its eastern and northern boundaries. In 1887 this route was surveyed officially as the main road to Raspberry Creek and Peninsula stations, and heading south to Maryvale, crossing Byfield Creek in the approximate location of the stone-pitched ford, although the ford itself is not indicated on the map. The section of this road which follows the eastern boundary of the Byfield homestead block is now known as Richters Road. A second track, marked as 'old postman's track', was also indicated on the 1887 survey plan. This track traversed the Byfield homestead block diagonally from northwest to southeast, meeting Byfield Creek at the approximate location of the stone-pitched ford and the road south to Maryvale, and joining the road to Raspberry Creek north of the Byfield Head <b>Station</b> <b>block.</b>|$|E
