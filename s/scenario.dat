5|$|Many of Key's {{staff have}} left the brand over time, or have been {{employed}} as outsourced contributors. Naoki Hisaya had worked {{as one of the}} main <b>scenario</b> writers for Kanon, but once the project was complete, he left the brand. Another member of the staff that made Kanon was OdiakeS, an outsourced composer who has since helped Key with two music albums, one each released for Air and Clannad, but has done nothing with Key since 2004. Three staff members only worked with Key on Air: Takashi Ishikawa as one of the <b>scenario</b> writers, Kazuki Fujii as a <b>scenario</b> assistant, and Din as a background artist. Air and Clannad had Tōya Okano and Kai who contributed as <b>scenario</b> writers. Kai later headed the planning of Kud Wafter, as well as contributing on the <b>scenario</b> of Angel Beats, Harmonia and Summer Pockets. One of the original computer graphics artists, Miracle Mikipon, left after Clannad. Two other outsourced graphic artists, Minimo Tayama and Torino, have often contributed on Key's games. <b>Scenario</b> writer Yūichi Suzumoto worked with Key between Air and Planetarian. Eeji Komatsu worked as the art director for Planetarian, and another artist, Fumio, worked as the art director for Tomoyo After.|$|E
5|$|While intensifying as a {{tropical}} storm, the National Hurricane Center faced {{difficulties in the}} future track of Jeanne, based on two major divergences between computer hurricane models. One <b>scenario</b> involved the storm accelerating east-northeastward {{to the south of}} a trough, following the path of Hurricane Karl to its east. The other <b>scenario</b> involved Jeanne turning southeastward and looping westward due to a building ridge. By early on September 20, the official forecast followed the first <b>scenario,</b> though later that day, officials changed the forecast to indicate the turn to the south.|$|E

5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main <b>scenario</b> writer Jun Maeda on various game <b>scenario</b> writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main <b>scenario</b> writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Little Busters! Ecstasy in 2008, Key decided to produce a {{spin-off}} of that game which focused on the heroine Kudryavka Noumi. The project's planning was headed by Kai, who returned to Key after he last contributed to the <b>scenario</b> of Clannad released in 2004. Chika Shirokiri returned after his work on Little Busters!, in which he wrote the <b>scenario</b> for Kudryavka. The artists Na-Ga and Itaru Hinoue were the art directors and character designers, both of whom previously worked on Little Busters! for Key. Jun'ichi Shimizu composed the game's music and was supervised by Jun Maeda.|$|E

Ikumi added her own ideas and changes, creating the manuscript's first draft, which {{was taken to the}} publishers for final review and approval.

5|$|For {{work on the}} <b>scenario,</b> Jun Maeda contributed {{along with}} {{composing}} some of the game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on , and two new <b>scenario</b> writers to Key—Yūto Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote the scenarios for Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote the <b>scenario</b> for Mio; Tonokawa wrote the scenarios for Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote the scenarios for Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of Push!!, {{it was reported that}} the story of Little Busters! is twice as long as Air's, but only half as long as Clannad's. However, this {{does not take into account}} the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale.|$|E

We present here, a four activities process to derive system specification from <b>scenarios.</b> This process includes a new approach for <b>scenarios</b> integration based on StateCharts which provides some interesting features like hierarchy and concurrence.

30|$|The initial {{number of}} {{generated}} <b>scenarios</b> for demand, day-ahead market price, intraday market price and real time market price is 50 (1200), 50 (1200), 50 (1200) and 50 (1200) {{for one hour}} (one day), respectively. Moreover, the initial number of <b>scenarios</b> simulated to characterize the wind speed between the closures of day-ahead market and intraday market is 25 (600). In addition, 50 (1200) <b>scenarios</b> are generated for wind speed realization after intraday market. The large number of original total <b>scenarios</b> yields an optimization problem which is intractable. To achieve tractability, the size of <b>scenarios</b> is reduced through Kantorovich distance approach. Consequently, the number of <b>scenarios</b> is reduced to 5, 10, 10, 10 <b>scenarios</b> for demand, day-ahead market price, intraday market price and real time market price, respectively. In addition, the number of <b>scenarios</b> for wind speed is reduced to 3 and 5 {{for the first and}} second time durations, respectively. As a result, total number of reduced <b>scenarios</b> equals to 75000 <b>scenarios</b> which is tractable.|$|R

In all versions, the game also contains a bad ending in which the player is unable to pursue the other scenarios. This ending serves as the basis of the Another Days <b>scenario</b> in To Heart 2 Another Days, which allows the player to pursue an additional seven heroines.|$|E
