500|$|A {{makeshift}} {{control room}} with tape machines, a mixing console, and other outboard equipment {{was set up}} in Danesmoate's dining room, with the adjacent drawing room used for recording and performing. The large doors separating the rooms were replaced with a glass screen, and to maintain a relaxed [...] "non-studio" [...] atmosphere for the sessions, the control room was dubbed the [...] "lyric room" [...] and the recording space was called the [...] "band room". Lanois' strategy was to encourage the band members to have their parts worked out in advance and to capture as much of the essence of a live band take as possible, without having the possibility of subsequent overdubbing to fall back on. This was a change for U2, who previously recorded each instrument separately and then layered them into the mix. To support his approach of having all the band members recording in a room together, Lanois eschewed having them wear headphones in favour of using monitor speakers due to their power; Mullen and bassist Adam Clayton used two each. To aid in <b>sound</b> <b>isolation,</b> gobos were built in the drawing room, although the production staff still faced issues with audio spill from the monitor speakers. Lanois said that due to the setup, [...] "you have to make a commitment to what you put down and either use it or throw it all away." [...] This recording setup was duplicated at subsequent locations during the album sessions.|$|E
2500|$|Ron Freiheit, {{director}} of acoustic research at Wenger Corporation in Owatonna, Minnesota, {{began to work}} with LARES system concepts and components {{as a way to}} enhance the acoustic products and services that Wenger offered. Barbar, Griesinger and Russ Berger of [...] (RBDG) were involved in the research and development of products that were integrated into prefabricated sound isolating rooms built by Wenger. By 1998, Wenger was advertising their V-Room product on LARES Associates website. V-Room was a product that allowed the electronic enhancement of music rehearsal spaces, giving the option of having the room's reverberation characteristics model a variety of performance spaces. On September 16, 2005, Freiheit filed a patent on an [...] "Active acoustics performance shell" [...] which used a LARES central digital processor [...] "as manufactured by Lares Associates, Inc., Columbia, Md". Wenger filed a contract suit against LARES Associates on April 26, 2006, in Minneapolis.

The STC results of decoupling in wall and ceiling assemblies varies significantly depending on the framing type, air cavity volume, and decoupling material type. Great care must be taken in each type of decoupled partition construction, as any fastener that becomes mechanically (rigidly) coupled to the framing can short-circuit the decoupling and result in drastically lower <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> results.|$|E

40|$|The {{correlation}} between wall pressure fluctuations and longitudinal velocity fluctuations {{have been investigated}} in turbulent pipe flow. The experiments were performed in two different flow facilities. Special care was taken for good <b>sound</b> <b>isolations</b> {{in order to achieve}} low levels of acoustic background noise. The flow medium in both cases was air. The Reynolds numbers ranged from 21000 to 210000, whereby Re is calculated with the pipe diameter and the center line velocity. The investigations fully confirm the {{correlation between}} events of 'high' wall pressure and acceleration processes in the near wall flow. These processes can be described as impingement of 'high speed' flow material on 'low speed' material. Investigations of the mean velocity profile show that the logarithmic 'law of the wall' represents the measurements only in a comparatively thin layer close to the pipe wall. Towards the middle of the pipe the measured flow velocities exceed the velocities calculated according to the law of the wall (up to 19 %). Here the profiles are better represented by curves similar to the 'law of the wake' as found for flat plate boundary layers. With increasing Reynolds numbers this effect becomes stronger.

50|$|The overall sound {{blocking}} {{capacity of}} a partition with Acoustiblok added cannot be calculated by simply adding 26 to the STC rating of a partition as found in reference sources, due to mechanical and acoustical variations in different partition wall and floor/ceiling designs, {{as well as the}} fact that STC is a logarithmic calculation and therefore cannot simply be summed. The most reliable comparative indicator of Acoustiblok's performance in practical application is laboratory measurement of the acoustical performance of test partitions. Field-measured <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> can vary considerably from lab measurements in any <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> protocol.

50|$|Sound damping {{tapes and}} other {{materials}} {{have been used to}} reduce both vibration and sound transmission through materials since the early 1930s. Although the applications of sound damping was largely limited to defense and industrial applications such as naval vessels and aircraft in the past, recent research has proven the effectiveness of damping in interior <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> in buildings. Constrained-layer damping gypsum wallboard panels increase <b>sound</b> <b>isolation</b> in building partitions by drastically reducing the vibration of panels and, incidentally, the radiation of sound through panels. The shear loading of a highly visco-elastic interlayer sandwiched between two more rigid constraining layers causes decreased displacement due to vibration, reducing the amount of sound energy radiated through a panel between enclosures. Damped gypsum wallboard panels are effective in reducing sound transmission over a broad range of frequencies and especially useful for achieving high levels of speech privacy between partitions.|$|E
