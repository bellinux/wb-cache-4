While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an inertial navigation <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low.|$|E

5|$|Amman is the 4th most visited Arab {{city and}} the ninth highest {{recipient}} of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city.

The recent construction of a public transportation <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.|$|E

A section of track between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington was electrified with a four-rail <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> jointly owned test train operated a shuttle service between February and November 1900. Having proven the practicality of electric traction, the two companies set up a joint committee to select a supplier of equipment for the electrification of their networks.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{proximity}} of the Roman road, entrenchments and relics it seems that the earliest settlement at Northallerton was some form of Roman military station.

Local volunteers and elected trustees provide limited services to the settlement, but it relies on the government of Jefferson County, Montana, for law enforcement and other services.

5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his axiom system for set theory.

Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the axiom of choice, but his proof was criticized {{for a variety of}} reasons. His response to the criticism included his axiom <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.|$|E

The KC-767 Advanced Tanker is derived from studies for a longer-range cargo version of the 767-200ER, and features a fly-by-wire refueling boom, a remote vision refueling <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> 767-400ER-based flight deck with LCD screens and head-up displays.

5|$|Sierra's Betrayal at Krondor (1993) {{was based}} upon author Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia setting. It {{featured}} turn-based, semi-tactical combat, a skill-based experience <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> magic system {{similar to that of}} Dungeon Master, but suffered due to outdated, polygonal graphics. Feist was heavily consulted during development, and later created his own novelization based upon the game. The sequel Betrayal in Antara (1997) re-used the first game's engine but—as Sierra had lost its license for Krondor—was set in a different universe. Return to Krondor (1998) used a new game engine, but returned to Feist's setting.|$|E
