25|$|The Ghab basin {{was formed}} in the Pliocene and is {{interpreted}} to be a pull-apart basin formed due to the overlap at the left-stepping offset between the Missyaf fault and the Hacıpaşa fault.

Based on the interpretation of seismic reflection data and a <b>single</b> <b>well</b> penetration (Ghab-1) the fill of the basin {{is thought to be}} entirely Pliocene to recent in age.

25|$|To {{prepare for}} an assay, the {{researcher}} fills each {{well of the}} plate with some biological entity that they wish to conduct the experiment upon, such as a protein, cells, or an animal embryo. After some incubation time has passed to allow the biological matter to absorb, bind to, or otherwise react (or fail to react) with the compounds in the wells, measurements are taken across all the plate's wells, either manually or by a machine. Manual measurements are often necessary when the researcher is using microscopy to (for example) seek changes or defects in embryonic development caused by the wells' compounds, looking for effects that a computer could not easily determine by itself. Otherwise, a specialized automated analysis machine can run a number of experiments on the wells (such as shining polarized light on them and measuring reflectivity, which can be an indication of protein binding). In this case, the machine outputs the result of each experiment as a grid of numeric values, with each number mapping to the value obtained from a <b>single</b> <b>well.</b> A high-capacity analysis machine can measure dozens of plates {{in the space of}} a few minutes like this, generating thousands of experimental datapoints very quickly.|$|E

The song was nominated for an Academy Award in 1999. The song helped open Aerosmith up to a new generation and remains a slow-dance staple. 1998 also saw the release of the double-live album, A Little South of Sanity, which was assembled from performances on the Get a Grip and Nine Lives tours.

In order to confirm the carrier transition coming from the <b>single</b> quantum <b>well,</b> the <b>single</b> quantum <b>well</b> layer was etched by reactive ion etching method. The structural property of the samples was characterized by high resolution X-ray diffraction measurements. In micro-photoluminescence measurements, it is clearly shown that the donor bound exciton transition of the <b>single</b> quantum <b>well</b> sample was redshifted compared to the etched one due to strain. Moreover, a lot of peaks were observed below the GaN band gap energy due to carrier localization in the InGaN/GaN <b>single</b> quantum <b>well,</b> including carrier localization center and quantum confined states.

40|$|Structural {{properties}} of SiGe/Si <b>single</b> <b>wells</b> are studied by double-crystal X-ray diffraction. Four SiGe/Si <b>single</b> <b>wells</b> have been grown on Si (0 0 1) at 750 degrees C by disilane and solid-Ge {{molecular beam epitaxy}} with varied disilane cracking temperature. Using dynamic theory, together with kinematic theory and the specific growth procedure adopted, structural parameters in the multilayer structure are determined precisely. The results are compared with those obtained from PL and XTEM as well as AES measurements. It is found that disilane adsorption is dependent on cracking temperature as well as Ge incorporation.

6000|$|Uncas {{answered}} the whoop, and leaping on an enemy, with a <b>single,</b> <b>well</b> directed blow of his tomahawk, cleft {{him to the}} brain. Heyward tore the weapon of Magua from the sapling, and rushed eagerly towards the fray. As the combatants were now equal in number, each singled an opponent from the adverse band. The rush and blows passed with the fury of a whirlwind, and the swiftness of lightning. Hawkeye soon got another enemy within reach of his arm, and with one sweep of his formidable weapon he beat down the slight and inartificial defences of his antagonist, crushing him to the earth with the blow. Heyward ventured to hurl the tomahawk he had seized, too ardent to await the moment of closing. It struck the Indian he had selected on the forehead, and checked for an instant his onward rush. Encouraged by this slight advantage, the impetuous young man continued his onset, and sprang upon his enemy with naked hands. A single instant was enough to assure him of the rashness of the measure, for he immediately found himself fully engaged, with all his activity and courage, in endeavoring to ward the desperate thrusts made with the knife of the Huron. Unable longer to foil an enemy so alert and vigilant, he threw his arms about him, and succeeded in pinning the limbs of the other to his side, with an iron grasp, but one that was far too exhausting to himself to continue long. In this extremity he heard a voice near him, shouting-- ...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a two-dimensional (2 D) optical lattice loaded with repulsive, contact-interacting fermions shows {{a rich and}} systematic magnetic phase diagram. Trapping a few (N ? 12) fermions {{in each of the}} single-site minima of the optical lattice, we find that the shell structure in these quantum wells determines the magnetism. In a shallow lattice, the tunnelling between the <b>single</b> <b>wells</b> is strong, and the lattice is non-magnetic (NM). For deeper lattices, however, the shell filling of the <b>single</b> <b>wells</b> with fermionic atoms determines the magnetism. As a consequence of Hund's first rule, the interaction energy is lowered by maximizing the number of atoms of the same species. This leads to a systematic sequence of NM, ferromagnetic (F) and antiferromagnetic (AF) phases...|$|R
