5|$|Adan met Ya'iri at Adan's former command post. Adan briefly {{explained}} the situation and, {{in a short}} discussion, Ya'iri laid out his plan. He was tasked with clearing Akavish and Tirtur. At 11:30 PM, the paratroopers began moving, with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance. Ya'iri, acting with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence, or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, rather than wait for one to arrive, it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E
40|$|The {{needs of}} {{companies}} are evolving and {{becoming more and more}} demanding each year, which result in more complex stakeholder relations. The complexity of the projects increases as well. For instance, stakeholders do not always have the same <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgencies</b> and their expectations from the same project might differ. Such variety in demand urges project managers to opt for a new; more broaden management approach that includes more human type of issues as well as hard skills. One area this situation is observed in contemporary projects is software development projects with complex stakeholder environment, where the project managers have responsibility to deliver high quality end delivery {{at the same time to}} meet the demands of stakeholders with different <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgencies.</b> This study aims for answering the research question “How can software projects having unclear requirement definitions and stakeholders with different <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgencies</b> can be managed successfully?” The research is proposing a structured set of methodologies with a guideline to professionals and the researchers to manage software development projects having unclear requirement definition and stakeholders with different <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgencies.</b> Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and ManagementMulti Actor SystemsTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R

5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer Roland Huntford, the {{references}} to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's The Voyage of the Discovery, published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott. He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of £17,000 (updated value £) for the entire expedition. He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a £7,000 loan guarantee (updated value £). With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) on 12 February 1907. One reason for Shackleton's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> was {{the knowledge that the}} Polish explorer Henryk Arctowski was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS on the same day as Shackleton's.

In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus a Polish astronomer from Toruń, published his epochal work De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), and thereby became the first proponent of a predictive mathematical model confirming the heliocentric theory, which became the accepted basic model {{for the practice of}} modern astronomy.

The desire to reform appeared across the Muslim world, among the Ottomans and among the more remote Iranians and Mughals, as well as the Arabs. If {{for no other reason than}} the performance of European armies and fleets, these modern ways were necessary to master. Devout Muslims realized that a proper place must be located in their tradition for this wealth of the new.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Liga Mayor, {{there was}} no {{national}} football league in Mexico, and football competitions were held within relatively small geographical regions.

40|$|This study {{looks at}} how an {{information}} and communication technologies (ICT) -rich environment impacts team conflict and conflict management strat-egies. A case study researchmethod was used. Three teams, part of a graduate class in instructional design, participated in the study. Data were collected through observations of team meetings, interviews with individual members, plus analysis of electronic documents exchanged among team members. Findings indicate that all teams experienced conflict at some level and that conflict management strategies evolved over time. ICT played a dual role in the conflict management of teams. These technologies seemed to facilitate conflict management by offering a formal means of communication, by making com-munication more effective with minimal waste or unnecessary effort, and by creating opportunities for more thoughtful reactions, with chances for reflec-tion on the content. However, ICT also aggravated conflict, specifically when strategies for use were imposed, when teammembers became blunt and forth-right, and when misinterpretations occurred because <b>of</b> differing <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in replying to emails...|$|R
25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency.</b> Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and {{want to know about the}} risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E
25|$|Training {{methods are}} {{as varied as}} the pigeons themselves. Some fanciers believe their system is the secret to their success and guard these hard learned lessons closely. Most fanciers will explain their basic {{strategy}} but some may be reluctant to share the details of their success. One of the most popular systems is widowhood. This system uses the birds desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> on race day. The use of widowhood is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the nestbox is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their mate or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning {{is one of the key}} elements in a lot of racing programs.|$|E
25|$|This act {{begins by}} reestablishing {{the aura of}} romantic mystery which began Act 1. This is evoked {{by the use of}} high violins and wind chords together, similar to that of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The first {{movement}} is characterised by the constant change of tempo, while the second picks up influences from other musical styles in particular that of rhythmic impulse and swooning which characterised Ravel's work. The next movement features solid writing for a chorus of brass instruments, after which high violins are heard over a very low accompaniment. This section also features many solos for various instruments, followed by a pas de trois above a gently undulating accompaniment where lyrical melody lines are heard, with the oboe able to penetrate the whole texture in expressive fashion. The following variation is typical of 19th century ballet music and begins with the violins before spreading {{to the rest of the}} orchestra. Brass, prominent timpani and incisive pizzicato chords in the strings culminate in a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in the music which prepares for the musical tension in the final act.|$|E
