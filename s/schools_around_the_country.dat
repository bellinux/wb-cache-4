500|$|Two {{years of}} {{kindergarten}} were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade {{with other students}} their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which examined how progressive <b>schools</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> put new educational ideas into action. They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured in school life, noting that they have, for example, a rare bird that {{is as much a}} personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become much more interested in wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still do all the work of caring for him. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: [...] "The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up but trying to get the rest of the town interested in the problem." [...] The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, [...] "The emphasis is put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing." ...|$|E
