500|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Ricky Ponting from international Twenty20 cricket, there were some calls for White to be promoted to captain the side, led by his Victoria coach Greg Shipperd. [...] Despite these calls, White backed the favourite, incumbent vice-captain Michael Clarke for the role. White was eventually named as Clarke's vice-captain, although worries about Clarke's injury-prone back and his struggles with form in Twenty20 resulted in continued calls for White to take over, though White again backed Clarke, claiming [...] "Michael's {{going to do a}} great job and I'll just look forward to working with him. I'm still really young in the [...] job as well and very inexperienced at this level, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can learn a lot off him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now we {{are safe}} awhile," [...] {{she said with}} a sigh, [...] "or, at least, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> But <b>I</b> will lead you to where there is more light." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Caramba, my friend," [...] he said, {{addressing}} Dirk, whose {{back was}} turned towards the figure, [...] "have you any ghosts in this gloomy old room of yours? Because, if <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{have just seen}} one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{returned}} Beth, as if considering her reply; [...] "a {{change is}} always interesting, and I have never travelled except to visit Aunt Jane at Elmhurst. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{am pleased to}} go to Europe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very true," [...] {{agreed the}} Wizard. [...] "But it {{is a long}} time since I have had any sleep, and I'm tired. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall lie down upon one of these hard glass benches and take a nap." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>So</b> far, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am succeeding. I let the madam {{into the}} secret day before yesterday, {{and locked the}} doors and read to her the opening chapters. She said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More than that, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> There {{is really}} no limit to the tombs--at least, I {{have never been able}} to find any. This is a very {{difficult}} place, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> will use our ball of string." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So innocent, so truly virtuous!' {{continued}} Ferdinand. 'It {{seemed to}} me I never knew what virtue was till <b>I</b> knew her. <b>So</b> frank, <b>so</b> generous! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> see her now, with that dear smile of hers that never more may welcome me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon! I {{simply said}} {{my name was}} Hoffman. You did not ask me point blank if I was the baron; had you done <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should have confessed all, for {{it was very hard}} to {{restrain}} myself this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suspect no one; I only weigh what is probable. However, it is {{too late}} for us to move to-night either south or westwards, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> will sleep over the {{business}} and see what I can find out from my Zulus." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear," [...] he said, [...] "it is {{not your}} fault. You had no part in it, and, even had it been <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could not have helped loving you. As it is, {{there is nothing in}} this world could make me hate you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will be very}} well," [...] said Dora, [...] "but I {{am afraid}} she may take cold, {{although}} the night air is <b>so</b> soft. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> saw a lap robe {{on a table in}} the hall; I will spread that over her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rolfe! It is beautiful, what Rolfe said. You <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> am for the cause, I {{hate the}} capitalist. We will win, {{and get more}} money, until {{we have all the}} money. We will be rich. And you, why do you strike?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I know it, my honest friend; the sweeter {{the more}} dangerous. Arsenic is sweeter than sugar.

6000|$|... 'Don't deny it, 'Tilda,' said Miss Squeers, impressively, 'because you have, and it's {{no use to}} go {{attempting}} to say you haven't. You mightn't have known it in your sleep, 'Tilda, but I haven't closed my eyes for a single wink, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>THINK</b> <b>I</b> am to be believed.' ...|$|E

[...] "Also in your place, had that been <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should have left the matter there. But then..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, you've got me, Ans. It {{seems to}} me I've heard the women folks home talk about shimmies, but they were always kind o' private about it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can help you out. That little thing goes underneath, sure enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|I sat, yielding. [...] "I {{am not so}} sure of God's participation," [...] I said. [...] "But I know I am very tired, and glad to be with you. I can't {{tell you}} how glad. <b>So</b> glad---- <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should weep if I tried to say it...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since you are <b>so</b> good, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{will make}} bold. Carpe diem, {{as we used}} to say at school, which means that one day is as good as another, and, if so why not any time in the day? Look here, Miss Mackenzie--about that money, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For my part," [...] {{continued}} Mister Woodchuck, [...] "I'm very soft-hearted, and wouldn't even step on an ant if I {{could help}} it. Also I {{am sure you}} have a kind disposition. But you are a human, and I am a woodchuck; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> will take you to old Stoneyheart and let him decide your fate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to be President of the whole United States," [...] he said. [...] "I don't care for {{sections}} or sectional lines. I was born in the North, but my mother was from the South, and I have spent much of my time in the West, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can fairly represent the whole country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, and yes," [...] I answered. [...] "When you {{are near}} me I have {{feelings}} {{similar to those}} produced by dank warehouses, gloomy crypts, and deep mines. And as sailors feel the loom of the land on dark nights, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> feel the loom of your body. But it is all very vague and intangible." ...|$|E
5000|$|In March 2015, Blomkamp said he [...] "wrote Chappie as a trilogy. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> haven't {{written the}} other two, but I wrote {{treatments}} {{for the other}} two, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> kind of <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know {{what happens with the}} next two, but… but I don't know if I want to say what happens." [...] Regarding whether he would want to make them, he answered, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>I</b> mean, I love the movie, like I feel really proud of the movie. I don't know what audiences will say, I don't know if it will be economically feasible to make more, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> would like to make more." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked in}} 2007 how well Reality Bites had aged, Janeane Garofalo replied, [...] "I {{think it means}} a lot more to people younger than me. I was not the target audience. I was 29 playing a 21-year-old, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} why younger people like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick {{does not}} love me like you," [...] she said; [...] "not madly, I mean. He has had me <b>so</b> long, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{have become a}} habit to him. And often and often, before I knew you, I used to puzzle whether he cared more for the ranch or more for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You see,” resumed Laura, “I {{really have}} some grounds for supposing that my next {{incarnation}} {{will be in}} a lower organism. I shall be an animal of some kind. On the other hand, I haven’t been a bad sort in my way, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> may count on being a nice animal, something elegant and lively, with a love of fun. An otter, perhaps.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} {{you are aware of}} it, Mr. Prendergast, but I am engaged to be married. And I have been given to understand--that is, I thought that this might take place very soon. My mother seems to think that your coming here may--may defer it. If <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have a right to expect that {{something}} shall be told to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Until we get them," [...] Dr. Beddersley said, [...] "I don't {{know that}} we can do anything. But if you can once give me two {{distinct}} photographs of the real man, no matter how much disguised, I could tell you whether they were taken from one person; and, if <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could point out certain details in common which might aid us to go upon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, madam," [...] I replied, [...] "my {{materials}} are <b>so</b> ample that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can satisfy your curiosity, unless it descend to very minute circumstances indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I sit <b>so</b> comfortably here <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had rather not. But {{you must}} go because you like such wonders, and I shall rest till you come back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, dear nurse, I've {{had enough}} of sleep. Indeed, I begin to feel <b>so</b> strong that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall very {{soon be able to}} undergo that--" ...|$|R
