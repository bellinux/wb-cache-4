This {{new round of}} rural transformation—China’s agrarian transition— raises the agrarian question in the Chinese context. This study investigates how capitalist forms and relations of production transform agricultural production and the peasantry class in rural China. The authors identify six forms of nonpeasant agricultural production, compare the labor regimes and direct producers’ <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>statuses</b> across these forms, and evaluate the role of China’s land-rights institution in shaping these forms. The empirical investigation presents three main findings: (1) Peasant differentiation : capitalist forms of agricultural production differentiate peasants {{into a variety of}} new class positions. (2) Market-based stratification: producers in capitalist agriculture are primarily stratified by their positions in labor and land markets; their <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>statuses</b> are linked with their varying degrees of proletarianization.

5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status.</b> Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners.

In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women.

5|$|The farmer, or {{specifically}} the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and {{officials in the}} social hierarchy. Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as tenants, wage laborers, and in rare cases slaves. Artisans and craftsmen had a legal and <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and {{more powerful than the}} vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could come and go from their master's home as they pleased. Medical physicians, pig breeders, and butchers had a fairly high social status, while occultist diviners, runners, and messengers had low status.|$|E
5|$|Toothache {{may occur}} at any age, in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status,</b> and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation). In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.|$|E

Family Background and Race over the Life Course For decades, geneticists and social scientists have relied on sibling correlations as indicative of the effect of genes and environment on behavioral traits and socioeconomic outcomes. The current paper advances this line of inquiry by exploring sibling similarity across a variety of socioeconomic outcomes, across stages in the life course, and across racial groups. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we find substantial differences in sibling correlations across socioeconomic outcomes. Family background matters more for <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>statuses</b> that are temporally closer to the family of origin—educational and occupational attainments—and family background matters less for <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>statuses</b> that individuals move into and out of over the life course. Sibling correlations in earnings and income converge over the life course, and sibling correlations in educational and occupational attainments and wealth remain stable across the life course.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} factors, {{particularly}} family factors, which influence reading among Form 4 ESL students in SMK Green Road, in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia. Most ESL teachers face various challenges in teaching reading as many students find {{it to be}} arduous and tedious; hence contributing {{to the lack of}} reading ability, interest and practice. Parental <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>statuses</b> (independent variables: occupation, income and academic achievement) and home reading environments (dependent variables: reading backgrounds and habits; attitude and motivation; exposure and support) were put forward as the affecting social factors. To identify these factors, questionnaires were distributed to 120 respondents. Although not fully generalisable, this study presents some interesting and helpful information. The findings revealed that in general, most students were from average home reading environments while their parents had low to average <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>statuses.</b> Though the students acknowledged the importance of reading in their daily lives, their average reading habits, attitude, motivation, exposure and support within the home domain had suggested otherwise. They mainly read for instrumental purposes while reading for pleasure seemed not to be given priority. On average, the correlation results suggested positive relationships between all variables, which were parallel to the hypotheses and other researchers’ observations. Nonetheless, parents’ occupation had negative significance values. Likewise, the regression data revealed that parental incomes were shown to be the strongest predictor towards constructive home reading environments, followed by parental academic qualifications. Notably, parental occupations also had the lowest ability to provide better home reading environments, hence refuting the hypotheses and findings in other studies. These outcomes may occur due to the low to average socioeconomic backgrounds {{of the majority of the}} students. As an implication, it is vital for students to improve their reading perceptions, abilities and practices to achieve personal, societal and national progress. On a final note, parents’ early and continuous efforts to be involved in their children’s literacy events in an out-of-school context are believed to be more powerful than <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>statuses...</b>|$|R

In the UK, prior to the institution of the NHS reforms in the early 2000s, it was shown that income was an important determinant of access to healthcare resources. Maintenance of good health through the utilization of proper healthcare resources can be quite costly and therefore unaffordable to certain populations.|$|E

In addition, employment can influence the decision to breastfeed.

In addition, women with public insurance or with no health insurance are more likely to never have breastfed their children, as are women who receive WIC.|$|E
