50|$|Testing showed {{several major}} {{problems}} with the Seamew. The aircraft was nose heavy in flight, and water spray during take-off damaged the 10 ft diameter propellers. The second prototype was fitted with reduced (8 ft) diameter, four-bladed propellers {{in an attempt to}} reduce the <b>spray</b> <b>damage</b> problem, but these gave a poor rate of climb. Another problem was corrosion of stainless steel fittings. These required replacing at considerable expense and as the type was unsatisfactory, the two prototypes were instead scrapped in 1930.|$|E
5000|$|The Harrow {{had to have}} a clear space {{below the}} {{fuselage}} to allow torpedo dropping. The main legs were attached to the front spar at the ends of the centre section, and pairs of bracing struts ran from the stub axles to the lower fuselage longerons. Snap link hooks were fitted to the inner ends of the axles to engage with the longitudinal arrester wires of the time. The specification required that the land undercarriage could be replaced rapidly with floats. These were long, single stepped and fitted with water rudders, built by Short Brothers.The first flight of the Harrow was made by Hubert Broad on 24 April 1926.

This study also noted that it was evident that the water did not wash all of the deposited material away from the wall or ceiling surface because “the patterns had a color which was lighter than the surrounding area but not as light as a clean burn or protected area” (Shanley et al. 1997).|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis in controlling spider mites on tomato crops depends on the climate which affects the balance between predator and prey. The effect of controlling glasshouse climatic conditions {{on the development of}} spider mite damage on tomato foliage was, therefore, examined. Climate was controlled by using a humidifying system and whitewash <b>spray.</b> <b>Damage</b> caused by spider mites was reduced, but the prey-predator system was more sensitive to unexpected changes in climate. After the whitewash was removed by thundery showers, more damage was caused by spider mites, there was a higher density of glandular trichomes on leaflets and a higher percentage of predators was stuck to leaflet trichomes than in the glasshouse control. This was attributed to increases in temperature and light intensity...|$|E

Irrespective of species, the film-forming polymers Nu-Film-P and Spay Gard did not provide any significant degree of protection against salt <b>spray</b> <b>damage</b> irrespective of concentration (1 % or 2 %) applied as measured by leaf chlorophyll concentrations, photosynthetic efficiency, visual leaf necrosis, foliar sodium and chloride content, and growth (height, leaf area). The film-forming polymer Newman Crop Spray 11 E™ provided only 1 -week protection against salt spray injury. The film-forming polymer Bond provided a significant (P < 0. 05) degree of protection against salt spray injury 3 months after application as manifest by higher leaf chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, height and leaf area, and lower visual leaf necrosis and foliar Na and Cl content compared with nontreated controls. In conclusion, results indicate that application of a suitable film-forming polymer can provide a significant degree of protection of up to 3 months against salt spray injury in evergreen oak and laurel. Results also indicate that when applied at 1 % or 2 % solutions, no problems associated with phytotoxicity and rapid degradation on the leaf surface exist...|$|E

Two large area field control trials were then carried out using the protein bait mixed with fipronil insecticide and applied weekly as a low volume spot spray to the foliage. The first trial was conducted in north Vietnam in over 35 ha of peach (Prunus persica L.) that was severely infested by Bactrocera pyrifoliae and B. dorsalis. The second trial was conducted in the Mekong Delta on over 50 ha of Barbados cherry (Malpighia glabra) that was severely damaged by B. correcta and B. dorsalis. In the peach crop the protein bait spot <b>sprays</b> reduced the <b>damage</b> to less than 5 per cent in one season compared with 100 per cent fruit damage in the control (untreated) area.
