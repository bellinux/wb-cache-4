50|$|Following Cobain's death, Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl {{formed a}} band {{to support his}} self-titled album, the first effort from the band which would become known as Foo Fighters. Smear joined the group from its {{inception}} in late October 1994, but because the band's first album was a collection of demos recorded solely by Grohl, <b>Smear</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> on a Foo Fighters album until 1997's The Colour and the Shape. Later that year, Smear quit the band: he announced his departure during a live performance atop Radio City Music Hall (introducing his replacement Franz Stahl), right before that year's MTV Video Music Awards.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Dave Grohl. It features a man running into a burning building to rescue a woman's baby, another woman's dog, and finally a picture frame of the first woman. The eyes of both the baby and the dog are blocked out to show they represent people in need everywhere. The camera follows the man throughout the video, with his face never being shown. It is presented in a continuous [...] "long take" [...] format, although actual transitional cuts are disguised by smoke. During shots inside the building, the band is seen performing the song, seemingly unconcerned about the chaos around them. It is the only Foo Fighters video to feature guitarist Franz Stahl, who replaced Pat <b>Smear</b> (Stahl <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> in the video for the next and last single from the album, 1998's [...] "Walking After You", as it featured only Grohl).|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after that, Crash {{contacted}} Smear about a Germs [...] "reunion" [...] show, {{claiming it}} was necessary to [...] "put punk into perspective" [...] for the punks on the scene. However, Smear has said Crash told him privately he wanted to earn money for heroin with which to commit suicide. Since Crash had described this scenario many times in the past, <b>Smear</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take him seriously.|$|R
