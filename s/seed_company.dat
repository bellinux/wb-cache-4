500|$|Lettuce is {{very easy}} to grow, and as such has been a {{significant}} source of sales for many seed companies. Tracing the history of many varieties is complicated by the practice of many companies, particularly in the US, of changing a variety's name from year to year. This was done for several reasons, the most prominent being to boost sales by promoting a [...] "new" [...] variety or to prevent customers from knowing that the variety had been developed by a competing <b>seed</b> <b>company.</b> Documentation from the late 19th century shows between 65 and 140 distinct varieties of lettuce, depending on the amount of variation allowed between types– a distinct difference from the 1,100 named lettuce varieties on the market at the time. Names also often changed significantly from country to country. Although most lettuce grown today is used as a vegetable, a minor amount is used in the production of tobacco-free cigarettes; however, domestic lettuce's wild relatives produce a leaf that visually more closely resembles tobacco.|$|E

40|$|In 2010, a hot {{debate on}} bean seed {{quality in the}} {{framework}} of a European Research project led a French-speaking association of artisan <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> to challenge EU "quarantine" measures on the bacterial agents of Common Bacterial Blight (CBB), a seedborne disease of common bean. The artisan <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> (artisans semenciers) forming the association Croqueurs de Carottes are small enterprises producing and marketing seed of open-pollinated vegetable varieties from the public domain, based on networks of organic seed growing farmers. In doing so, the artisan <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> contribute to the dynamic conservation of crop diversity and to making this diversity accessible to home and market gardeners. For the Croqueurs as member of the French Réseau Semences Paysannes (peasant seed network), this commercial activity also forms part of a wider movement of seed re-appropriation. The research presented here departs from the hypothesis that the dispute on the CBB "quarantine" measures reveals a more general discrepancy: The rationale behind the plant health management practices of the seed artisans differs from the rationale behind the quarantine measures which they face in the form of phytosanitary inspections. In the aim of specifying the plant health management practices of the artisan <b>seed</b> <b>companies,</b> these practices and the rationale behind it will be unfolded as an actor-network. In terms of actor network theory (ANT), the contestation of quarantine measures on common bean by the Croqueurs in France reveals the actor-network behind their bean health management. Disturbed by the quarantine measures, the network becomes apparent in a process of reassemblage. The network behind this particular plant health management will be unfolded by taking controversial elements of the implementation of quarantine measures as a starting point, such as the official protocol for the detection of bacterial pathogens on seeds and the competences of inspectors in charge of phytosanitary seed inspections. The description of the plant health management by artisanal <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> will be based on the practices of the Croqueurs in France and Belgium, but also on the practices of two artisanal <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> in Germany. By contrast, discrepancies with the dominant plant health management rationale will appear. Whereas the "quarantine" measures aim at eradicating CBB in the EU by admitting only CBB-free bean seed on the seed market, the artisan <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> rather seek to live with plant diseases and integrate plant pathogens in their production systems. For the latter, managing crop and seed health also goes through managing sound environments. In the framework of evolving EU plant regulations and a reorganisation of phytosanitary seed inspections in France, the debates on plant health management in artisanal <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> persist. Although much has been written and publically debated by non-profit organizations, small-scale <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> and researchers concerning EU seed legislations, but the role of phytosanitary regulations in the dynamic conservation of crop biodiversity has received little attention.

2500|$|Crops such as maize {{reproduce}} sexually each year. This randomizes which genes get propagated to {{the next}} generation, meaning that desirable traits can be lost. To maintain a high-quality crop, some farmers purchase seeds every year.

[...] Related plants like sorghum and gamma grass are able to perform apomixis, a form of asexual reproduction that keeps the plant's DNA intact.

[...] The first option was to not plant glyphosate-resistant sugar beets until the EIS was completed. [...] The second option was to allow growers to plant glyphosate-resistant sugar beets if they obtained a USDA-APHIS permit and followed specific mandates. [...] Under the third and final option, glyphosate-resistant sugar beets would be partially deregulated, but monitored by Monsanto and KWS SSAT AG. [...] USDA-APHIS preferred the second option.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a critical {{account of the}} cereal seed systems in Malawi both in a historical and contemporary context with particular reference to the three input support programmes implemented since the late 1990 s to date. The main argument {{of this paper is}} that the centrality of the question of food security in the country’s electoral politics in a post liberalisation context has created a seed industry dominated by multinational <b>seed</b> <b>companies,</b> offering farmers a narrow range of products mainly hybrid maize, and in which alternative cereal seed systems such as millet and sorghum are at the verge of extinction. The commercial interests of the multinational <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> are propped by donors who are obsessed with promoting a vibrant private sector input supply system as an engine of a sustainable green revolution through input support programmes. This has invariably privileged the genetic material supplied by the multinational <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> {{at the expense of the}} national breeding programme whose main client are the local <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> controlling only 10 percent of the seed market. The government’s fixation on food security has also contributed to privileging the genetic material from multinational <b>seed</b> <b>companies</b> since they are deemed to be high yielding even though at the expense of the seed supply variety to the farmer. The interests of <b>seed</b> <b>companies,</b> donors and government have, even though for different reasons, coincided to create a seed industry that has a very narrow product portfolio, distributes benefits to a very small proportion of the population through various forms of commercial ventures and schemes of political patronage buoyed by excessive weaknesses in the regulatory framework for the seed industry. This paper therefore demonstrates that policy processes are predominantly characterised by the clash of competing and conflicting interests and viewpoints rather than impartial, disinterested or objective search for correct solutions for policy issues. However, the voices and views of the dominant coalitions almost always shape the major policy directions. The major recommendations for revitalising the seed industry include: 1. improving the efficiency and implementation of regulatory frameworks; 2. enhancing public sector breeding and dissemination of improved varieties; and 3. creating an enabling environment to stimulate local seed enterprises that can deliver products with the needs of the smallholder farmer in mind.
