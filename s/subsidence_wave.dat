40|$|Deep {{extraction}} of minerals is accompanied by deformations of the strata overlying extracted coal seams. Deformations of overlying layers run {{up to the surface}} where a subsidence trough gradually forms. The movement of individual surface points is curvilinear, spatial and, in relation to the time pattern, not uniform. In some cases, during the formation of a subsidence trough, temporary uplifts of the surface occur. This paper gives a particular area in which uplifts of the surface occurred when the rigid overlying strata was disturbed. The character of deformations of the overlying rocks is evaluated {{on the basis of a}} comparison of the results of the measurement of subsidence of the surface using geodetic methods with the development of mined-out areas and with their extracted thickness. For specifying the time of failure of the overlying strata, also information obtained from a system of continuous monitoring of seismic events is used. The spatial extent of the subsidence trough is identified by satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques applied to TerraSAR-X images. The <b>subsidence</b> <b>wave</b> was possible to detect using a short temporal difference of 11 days between satellite radar images. This shows the potential of short-temporal high resolution InSAR for monitoring of progress of subsidence troughs. A good knowledge of extents and shape of subsidence trough formation in time allows to verify values of parameters used for prediction purposes. Application of the short temporal InSAR appears very effective for spatio-temporal studies of the current subsidence trough development and helps understanding the physical process as well as identifying deviations from the behaviour expected by models.

Therefore, one has to estimate rates in order to conclude for the dominant process. We take advantage of the contrasting tectonic settings of two islands in the Azores, Pico (on the active diffuse Nubia-Eurasia plate boundary) and Santa Maria (on the oldest and inactive eastern end of the Azores Plateau), in order to estimate two main rates and their effects on shaping insular shelves: <b>subsidence</b> and <b>wave</b> erosion rates. We conclude that, for subsidence rates ≥ 1 mm/yr and lava flow dips ≤ 5 º, as in Pico Island, the subsidence rate can dominate. Despite the likely dominant effect of island subsidence, Quartau et al. (2015) recognized its existence in Pico but did not estimate its magnitude or use the subsidence rate to discuss the wave erosion rates reported in the paper. Therefore, the wave erosion rates reported in Quartau et al. (2015) may be greatly overestimated by incorporating indiscriminately two rates, island <b>subsidence</b> and <b>wave</b> erosion. The effects of subsidence on shaping insular shelves as discussed here can potentially be applied to other subsiding islands mostly made of shield volcanoes, like the Big Island in Hawaii.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{statistical}} methods ("parameterizations'') used to represent cloud processes for climate prediction distort the simulated diurnal rainfall cycle. In this study, the "superparameterization'' technique (embedding explicit models of convection) is investigated as a method of improving diurnal rainfall in order to study the mechanisms supporting it and to reduce uncertainties in climate prediction. Analysis of the effect of superparameterization on the simulated global diurnal rainfall cycle uncovers several unappreciated benefits of the technique: Diurnal rainfall becomes less well fit by a 24 -hour sinusoid, more horizontally inhomogeneous within continents and oceans, and conforms better to transitions straddling coastlines. While these effects are robust to arbitrary configuration choices in the application of superparameterization, a favorable shift in the peak timing of continental rainfall is not. Regional deficiencies are documented associated with the Andean topography, and the Asian monsoon. Like conventional parameterizations that account for dilution, superparameterization favorably reduces the amplitude of the tropical land latent heating diurnal cycle. This removes an unrealistic deep barotropic <b>subsidence</b> <b>wave</b> that otherwise exerts undue remote control by land on the simulated diurnal cycle over the tropical ocean. The level of remote control of marine surface divergence is otherwise found to be undersimulated such that the tropical surface divergence signature of land-sea remote control does not validate well against scatterometer observations. Over the Gulf Stream, the pattern of warm season diurnal rainfall variability is captured in several simulations. Analysis suggests a giant sea breeze circulation fueled by convectively amplified cross-coastal radiative imbalances, may help explain the observed change in local rainfall timing with distance offshore. In the Central US warm season, the superparameterization approach is shown to capture packets of eastward traveling organized convection that underly a regional nocturnal convection maximum. The simulated rate and range of eastward travel validates against ground based radar data despite the fact that small scale storm propagation mechanisms (gust fronts and density currents) are artificially restricted to have only local effects under superparameterization. This is interpreted as evidence in support of an alternative "slow manifold'' view that these systems are primarily propagated by large-scale dynamic...|$|E

Its link with the linearized solution of St Venant's equations for wave celerity, which {{does not appear to have}} been reported in the hydrological literature, is established. The rating exponent m is shown to be equivalent to the dimensionless relative celerity and is found to be the ratio of two specific heats, viz. cp and cv which are the specific heats at constant pressure and volume, respectively. The use of the parameter m as a complex variable helps describe shallow wave characteristics, the damping capacity of a wave, and the mechanism of occurrence of the hysteretic phenomenon.

Salt dissolution and the resulting unpredictable upward migration of the dissolution voids can be observed both in proximity to well bores (dissolution mining, brine disposal, and oil wells; seismic shot holes, etc.) and in areas known to experience natural dissolution with no apparent anthropogenic influences. One potential outcome of the upward migration of these long-inactive dissolution voids in the city of Hutchinson is significant structural damage to facilities, infrastructure, or traffic areas. Monitoring the condition of a void’s roof is key to determining and managing this risk. Drilling is expensive for this investigative application {{in part because of the}} number of potential targets. At a depth of approximately 120 m, most surface geophysical methods have neither the sensitivity nor resolution necessary to detect these voids, much less interrogate the roof. From the shear modulus (stress/strain relationship), rock failure can be loosely predicted from the stress/strain curve. Because shear velocity is proportional to the shear modulus, increases in rock stress translate to increases in shear velocity. Therefore, the likelihood of failure of a void’s roof increases as the measured shear-wave velocity increases in the roof rock.

Similar AGW are also {{seen in the}} TEC keogram in Fig. 8 (b). Radial propagation of AGW from the epicenter or the ionospheric epicenter has been discussed by many researchers (e.g., Calais and Minster, 1995; Artru et al., 2004; Otsuka et al., 2006; Shinagawa et al., 2007; Tsugawa et al., 2011; Liu and Sun, 2011; Rolland et al., 2011 a; Matsumura et al., 2011). Though the radially-propagating acoustic waves of 0.7 – 1.3 km/s are discernible in the TEC keograms in Figs. 8 (b) and 9, such propagation could not been observed with the radar. One {{reason may be that}} these acoustic waves were not accompanied by rapid upward and downward motions of the F region plasma to induce high Doppler shifts and also by deep plasma density fluctuation to induce focusing and defocusing of the radar waves. Another reason may be due to <b>subsidence</b> of acoustic <b>waves</b> before arriving at the radar FOV. In addition to these reasons, we note the difference in the observation technique (see Section 2); that is, GPS-TEC is sensitive to the electron density distribution mainly at the 250 – 350 km altitudes, while the HF radar probes plasma disturbances at around the 250 km altitude, and therefore, if the current acoustic waves propagated above the 250 km altitude, the radar could not clearly detect them. It is impossible to pursue the above-described inconsistency between the radar and TEC results more, mainly because the radar FOV and the GEONET coverage do not overlap each other. Such discussions are also helpful to understand why the 1.8 – 6.7 km/s wave propagation observed with the radar have no clear counterparts in the TEC keogram (Fig. 9; Section 4.1).|$|R
40|$|Thesis entitled: Modelling Stable Atmospheric Boundary Layers over Snow H. A. M. Sterk Wageningen, 29 th of April, 2015 Summary The {{emphasis}} of this thesis {{is on the}} understanding and forecasting of the Stable Boundary Layer (SBL) over snow-covered surfaces. SBLs typically form at night and in polar regions (especially in winter), when radiative cooling at the surface causes a cooler surface than the overlying atmosphere and a stable stratification develops. This means that potential temperature increases with height and buoyancy effects suppress turbulence. Turbulence is then dominated by mechanical origin. If sufficient wind shear can be maintained, turbulence remains active, otherwise it will cease. A proper representation of SBLs in numerical weather prediction models is critical, since many parties rely on these forecasts. For example, weather prediction is needed for wind energy resources, agricultural purposes, air-quality studies, and aviation and road traffic. Knowledge on SBLs is also essential for climate modelling. In the Arctic regions, climate change is most pronounced due to stronger changes in near-surface temperature compared to other latitudes. Though this `Arctic amplification&# 39; is not yet fully understood, possible responsible processes are the ice-albedo feedback, alterations in cloud cover and water vapour, different atmospheric and oceanic circulations, and the weak vertical mixing in the lower atmosphere. However, many interactions exist between these processes. With positive feedbacks, changes are even further enhanced. This could have worldwide consequences, i. e. due to affected atmospheric circulations and sea level rise with Greenland&# 39;s melting ice-sheets. Scientists try to explain the observed climate changes, {{as well as provide}} outlooks for future changes in climate and weather. However, the understanding is hampered by the fact that many model output variables (e. g. regarding the 2 m temperature) vary substantially between models on the one hand, and from observations on the other hand. Modelling the SBL remains difficult, because the physical processes at hand are represented in a simplified way, and the understanding of the processes may be incomplete. Furthermore, since processes can play a role at a very small scale, the resolutions in models may be too poor to represent the SBL correctly. Additionally, there are many different archetypes of the SBL. Turbulence can be continuous, practically absent, or intermittent, and vary in strength which affects the efficiency of the exchange of quantities horizontally and vertically. Processes that are considered critical for the SBL evolution are e. g. turbulent mixing, radiative effects, the coupling between the atmosphere and the underlying surface, the presence of clouds or fog, <b>subsidence,</b> advection, gravity <b>waves,</b> and drainage and katabatic flows. In this thesis, {{the focus is on the}} first three processes, as these are most dominant for the evolution of the SBL (e. g. Bosveld  et al., 2014 b). In Chapter 3 an idealized clear-sky case over sea-ice was studied based on the GABLS 1 benchmark study (e. g. Cuxart et al., 2006), but extended by including radiative effects and thermal coupling with the surface. Hence the following research questions were posed:   Question 1 : What is the variety in model outcome regarding potential temperature and wind speed profiles that can be simulated with one model by using different parametrization schemes? Question 2 : Which of the three governing processes is most critical in determining the SBL state in various wind regimes? Question 3 : Can we identify compensation mechanisms between schemes, and thus identify where possible compensating model errors may be concealed?   From the analysis with different parametrization schemes performed with the WRF single-column model (SCM, Question 1), it followed that quite different types of SBLs were found. Some schemes forecasted a somewhat better mixed potential temperature profile where stratification increased with height, while another scheme produced profiles with the strongest stratification close to the surface and stratification decreased with height. After only 9 h of simulation time, a difference in temperature of almost 2 K was found near the surface. Regarding the wind speed profile, some variation was found in the simulated low-level jet speed and height. Mainly the difference in atmospheric boundary-layer (BL) schemes which parametrize the turbulent mixing are responsible for these model output variations. A variation in long wave parametrization schemes hardly affected the model results. Question 2 addresses the problem whether other processes than turbulent mixing may be responsible for a similar spread in model results. A sensitivity analysis was performed where for one set of reference parametrization schemes the intensity of the processes was adjusted. The relative sensitivity of the three processes for different wind regimes was analysed using `process diagrams&# 39;. In a process diagram, two physically related variables are plotted against each other, which in this case represent either a time average or a difference over time of the variable. A line connects the reference state with the state for which the process intensity is modified. By comparing the length and orientation of the lines, the relative significance of the individual processes for the different wind speeds can be studied. Overlapping line directions identify possible compensating errors. Geostrophic wind speeds of 3, 8 and 20 m s- 1 were selected representing low, medium and high wind speeds, capturing the range of wind speeds frequently occurring in the Arctic north of 75 oN according to the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset. Overall, a shift in relative importance was detected for the various wind regimes. With high geostrophic wind speeds, the model output is most sensitive to turbulent mixing. On the contrary, with low geostrophic wind speeds the model is most sensitive to the radiation and especially the snow-surface coupling. The impact of turbulent mixing is then minor, unless when mixing in both boundary layer and surface layer is adjusted. This stresses that proper linking between these two layers is essential. Also with one set of parametrization schemes different SBL types were simulated. Potential temperature profiles were better mixed (increasing stratification with height) for high geostrophic wind speeds, and this tended to develop to profiles with the strongest stratification near the surface (decreasing stratification with height) for low geostrophic wind speeds. However, a variety in types was also found when keeping the same wind regime, but by varying the mixing strength. With enhanced mixing, the profile became better mixed, also when the reference profile showed the strongest stratification near the surface. With decreased mixing, profiles with a stronger stratification were found, again shaped with the strongest stratification near the surface. Thus a different mixing formulation has a strong impact on the vertical profiles, even when it may not necessarily strongly affect the surface variables. Therefore, it is recommended that when a model is evaluated and optimized, the vertical structure is also regarded in this process, since near-surface variables may be well represented, strong deviations aloft are still possible. Furthermore, the process diagrams showed overlap in sensitivity to some processes. Therefore errors within the parametrizations of these processes could compensate each other and thus remain hidden (Question 3), making the model formulation possibly physically less realistic. This study did not reveal an unambiguous indication for the compensating processes regarding the various sets of variables, though overlap for single variables is seen. This study also revealed a non-linear behaviour regarding the 2 m temperature, which is also found in observations (e. g. Lüpkes et al., 2008) and in a model study by McNider et al. (2012). Here the 2 m temperature decreased with enhanced mixing strength and increased with a lower mixing intensity. This counter-intuitive behaviour is explained by that mixing only occurs in a shallow layer close to the surface. Cold air that is mixed up by the enhanced mixing, is insufficiently compensated by the downward mixed relatively warm air. This behaviour was found mostly for low wind speeds or with decreased mixing at the medium wind regime, when the potential temperature profile showed the strongest stratification near the surface. The study proceeds with a model evaluation against observations in low wind speed regimes. Three stably stratified cloud-free study cases with near-surface wind speeds below 5 m s- 1 were selected with each a different surface: Cabauw in the Netherlands with snow over grass, Sodankylä in northern Finland with snow in a needle-leaf forest, and Halley in Antarctica with snow on an ice shelf. Chapter 4 presents the evaluation of the WRF- 3 D and SCM for these cases. In this study, the WRF- 3 D model was used to determine the forcings, as often not all the required observations at high resolution in time and space are available. Hence the following questions were formulated:   Question 4 : What is the performance of WRF in stable conditions with low wind speeds for three contrasting snow-covered sites? Question 5 : How should we prescribe the single-column model forcings, using WRF- 3 D?   The standard WRF- 3 D simulation had an incorrect representation of the snow-cover and vegetation fraction, which deteriorates the conductive heat flux, the surface temperatures and the SBL evolution. Indeed, Chapter 3 highlighted the critical role of the land-surface coupling representation. Adjusting the settings with site specific information, improved model simulations compared with the observations. In general, the performance of WRF- 3 D was quite good for the selected cases,|$|R
