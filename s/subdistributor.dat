5000|$|Described by Mile High Comics' Chuck Rozanski as [...] "brilliant," [...] Steve Geppi {{had been}} a <b>subdistributor</b> for Hal Shuster in the late 1970s. In what Rozanski {{describes}} as an [...] "incredibly risky and gutsy move," [...] Geppi took over New Media/Irjax's [...] "office and warehouse space" [...] and, recalled Rozanski, had to [...] "sort out the good customers from the bad overnight" [...] negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster's distribution business as Diamond Comic Distribution. Almost overnight, noted Rozanski, [...] "he {{went from being a}} retailer in Baltimore to having warehouses all over the place." [...] Geppi himself, according to Mike Friedrich [...] "was someone whose work you could trust, who had a good reputation for honesty in the field a collector, retailer and distributor." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} never given wide release. A 1982 opening in Denver, Colorado {{generated}} a poor response. The film was shelved and {{made its way}} to cable. Night Flight, the weekend counter-culture programming block on USA Network (which at the time was part-owned by Paramount) began regularly airing the film in 1984, where it found an audience. Off the positive reception of the airings, <b>subdistributor</b> Films Inc. licensed the film from Paramount, and it eventually {{made its way to}} the Art-House circuit. The film's theatrical run included engagements at Film Forum in New York City on Wednesday, March 6, 1985, in Chicago in April 1985, in Atlanta and Los Angeles in July 1985, and at the Theater of the Living Arts in Philadelphia from Friday, August 23 - Saturday, August 24, 1985.|$|E
40|$|In general, {{distribution}} system in PT Enseval RDC Surabaya is less effective. It cause {{the distribution of}} goods are not on time and shipping costs to <b>subdistributor</b> to be high. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the existing {{distribution system}}, redesigned the distribution system and provide recommendations for improvement. The method used in this study is statistical process control that consists of check sheet, pareto diagrams, and fishbone analysis to find the root cause of the problems. The results showed that the most dominant problem (66. 67 %) is the delay in shipment of goods because the expedition waited the goods to be consolidation into one full container. Based fishbone analysis, the dominant contributing factor is the lack of system integration between the directorate and there is no synchronization of shipment schedule between RDC Surabaya and RDC Jakarta so that 70. 69 % of the shipment was sent partial/ LCL. While the second dominant factor (16. 67 %) is the monitoring of shipments to subdistributors less effective so that the goods had reached the customers does not immediately known by PT Enseval. That makes PT Enseval late to make a invoice for billing to the <b>subdistributor.</b> Some recommendations proposed improvement are PT Enseval RDC Surabaya should makes reference to the <b>subdistributor</b> shipment schedule, synchronizes the shipment schedule between RDC Surabaya and RDC Jakarta, makes monitoring system of shipment and vendor evaluation. The evaluation results show that the improvement of delivery partial (LCL) from 70. 69 % to 0. 00 %, on time of shipment increase from 88. 96 % to 100 %, the shipping cost decrease 24. 54 % with the shipping cost to goods value ratio decrease from 3. 13 % to 1. 85 %...|$|E

40|$|Multiparty {{multilevel}} DRM architecture (MPML-DRM-A) involves multiple parties such as owner, {{multiple levels}} of distributors and consumers. The owner issues redistribution licenses to its distributors, {{who in turn}} generate and issue variations of these redistribution licenses to their <b>subdistributors.</b> Also the distributors generate and issue usage licenses to the consumers to consume the contents. But, these variations of the redistribution licenses and usage licenses generated and issued by each distributor must be validated by a validation authority against the redistribution licenses that it has received. In MPML-DRM-A, there may exist multiple, different types of redistribution licenses for a content. Validation using multiple redistribution licenses may become difficult in real time. Further, storage of multiple redistribution licenses for validation presents a challenge of reducing storage space requirements. Hence, {{in this paper we}} propose a bit-vector transform based license organizing structure, and present a method to do the validation of issued licenses in the bit-vector transform domain efficiently. Experimental results show that our license organization structure helps to achieve low validation time and storage space complexity...|$|R
