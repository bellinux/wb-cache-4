5|$|The convoy was {{protected}} by two frigates, the Vestale and the Brun. The French finally {{came out on the}} evening of the fifteenth day, and were engaged by Southampton, despite the French possessing considerably more firepower. After a sustained engagement Southampton forced Vestale to strike her colours while the Brun escaped with the convoy, leaving Vestale to her fate. But as Southampton prepared to lower her boats to take possession of the French ship, her fore-mast, which had been damaged during the engagement, went by the board. Taking advantage of this, Vestale raised her colours and escaped from the scene. Victory over the Vestale <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> promotions for Southamptons officers, including Lydiard, but her escape deprived them of this. Lydiard now had to secure another triumph to ensure his promotion.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to the New Voice slate {{was led by}} the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and Communication Workers of America (CWA). AFT {{president}} Albert Shanker {{argued that}} the dissidents <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> their concerns before the executive council, where, after discussion and deliberation, a decision about Kirkland's fate could have been made. Shanker also argued that exposing the labor movement's internal disputes to labor's enemies seriously risked weakening the labor movement. Finally, Shanker argued that the New Voice slate's attempt to mobilize state and local labor bodies in favor of one candidate risked politicizing the AFL-CIO and destabilizing it in the long run.|$|E
500|$|Observing his consort's plight, Robinson did not hesitate, {{steaming}} to {{the stricken}} vessel and rescuing her crew before escaping downstream to Mudros. It was {{estimated that the}} Turks fired at least 500 heavy calibre rounds of ammunition at the two boats {{in just a few}} minutes. A German officer present noted that [...] "I have never on {{the course of the war}} seen an attack carried out with such pluck and fearlessness". It has also been commented that this action <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> Robinson a second Victoria Cross, but he was promoted to Commander by special decree instead.|$|E

It's their mother's bringin' up—she marded 'em till they were soft, an' would never {{let me have a}} say in it. I <b>should</b> <b>'a</b> <b>brought</b> 'em up different, you know I should." ...|$|R

500|$|Some {{historians have}} thought that the gap could have been closed earlier; Wilmot wrote that despite having British {{divisions}} in reserve, Montgomery did not reinforce Guy Simonds and that the Canadian drive on Trun and Chambois was not [...] "vigorous and venturesome" [...] as the situation demanded. Hastings wrote that Montgomery, having witnessed {{what he called a}} poor Canadian performance during Totalize, <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> up veteran British divisions to take the lead. D'Este and Blumenson wrote that Montgomery and Harry Crerar might have done more to impart momentum to the British and Canadians. Patton's post-battle claim that the Americans could have prevented the German escape, had Bradley not ordered him to stop at Argentan, was [...] "absurd over-simplification".|$|E
500|$|As {{characters}} {{from the previous}} chapters of the game gather around to congratulate him, Conker realizes that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> Berri back to life when he was negotiating with programmers. He calls them out {{to bring her back}} to life, only to realize that they have left already. Conker then gives a closing monologue, in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more, stating that [...] "the grass is always greener, and you don't really know what it is you have until it's gone." [...] The credits roll, and afterwards Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in {{at the start of the}} game, drowning his sorrows in Scotch whisky. He drunkenly exits the bar as it begins to storm outside, and leaves in the direction opposite the one he took previously.|$|E
2500|$|Free Spirit was {{released}} in 1995, in Europe by EastWest and in the U.S. by Atlantic Records. The album was re-released in 1996, {{with the addition of}} the song [...] "Limelight", which was used as the official song of the German Olympic Team. AllMusic stated that [...] "several songs on this album rate about average, but there are several shining moments which <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> this set, from such an engaging singer, much more attention than the minimal it received." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1782, {{after the}} governess of the Enfants de France, the princesse de Guéméné, went {{bankrupt}} and resigned, Marie Antoinette appointed her favourite, the duchesse de Polignac, to the position. This decision met with disapproval {{from the court}} as the duchess {{was considered to be}} of too modest a birth to occupy such an exalted position. On the other hand, both the king and the queen trusted Mme de Polignac completely, gave her a thirteen-room apartment in Versailles and paid her well. The entire Polignac family benefited greatly from royal favour in titles and positions, but its sudden wealth and lavish life style outraged most aristocratic families, who resented the Polignacs' dominance at court, and also fueled the increasing popular disapproval of Marie Antoinette, mostly in Paris. Mercy wrote to the Empress. [...] "It is almost unexampled that in so short a time, the royal favour <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> such overwhelming advantages to a family".|$|E
2500|$|Initially, when Yang Yi {{was serving}} as a Master of Writing (尚書), Jiang Wan ranked lower than him, but {{both of them were}} later {{appointed}} as Chief Clerks under Zhuge Liang. Yang Yi viewed himself highly and saw himself as superior to Jiang Wan because he had been serving in Shu longer than Jiang. He openly expressed his dissatisfaction by grumbling and complaining. The others ignored him due to his poor choice of words in conveying his frustration, except for Fei Yi, who comforted him. Yang Yi once told Fei Yi, [...] "When the Chancellor (Zhuge Liang) died, I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> along my men and defected to Wei if I knew I'd end up in this situation today! I deeply regret but there's nothing I can do now." [...] Fei Yi secretly reported Yang Yi's speech to the Shu imperial court. In 235, Yang Yi was stripped off his appointment, demoted to the status of a commoner, and exiled to Hanjia Commandery (漢嘉郡; around present-day Lushan County, Sichuan). While he was in Hanjia, Yang Yi wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court and used emotionally charged language to express his anger and lash out at the court. The court deemed Yang Yi's memorial defamatory so it ordered his arrest. Yang Yi committed suicide. His family returned to Chengdu after his death.|$|E
2500|$|Off field events often overshadowed the cricket. The tour {{took place}} while the major territories {{in the region}} had growing {{movements}} for independence from Britain, which clashed with the British governments plans to establish a West Indies Federation. The resulting friction affected the tour. Before setting off, the cricketers were briefed about the political situation in the West Indies and Hutton believed that the team was {{being used as a}} political instrument to support colonial rule. In cricketing terms, the series was being viewed by some journalists as deciding the world champions of cricket, which Wisden's correspondent viewed as increasing the tension before the tour began, as did [...] "the constant emphasis upon victory which the M.C.C. players found to be stressed by English residents in the West Indies." [...] The tourists believed that standards among the umpires were low, particularly when pressure from the home crowds, including the threat of violence, made them reluctant to give decisions against the West Indian players. Hutton protested about the appointment of two particular umpires, but the West Indies board insisted that each match had to be umpired by men from the island on which it was held. In several matches, the crowds made noisy protests against events on the field, usually related to umpiring decisions, but also against the West Indian captain Jeff Stollmeyer. During the first Test, the family of an umpire were attacked after he gave out John Holt six runs short of a hundred. The climax came in the third Test where, following the umpire's ruling of Cliff McWatt as run out, bottles and other missiles were thrown onto the outfield. Hutton managed to keep his side and the umpires on the field, possibly defusing a dangerous situation. There were other diplomatic incidents involving England players. In Barbados, some of the team were alleged to have shown a lack of courtesy to a group of women, but were publicly backed by Hutton and Palmer. In Jamaica, Hutton was accused of insulting the Chief Minister, whom Hutton had not stopped to speak to while coming into the pavilion during a break in his innings. Hutton said that he had not recognised the minister, nor been aware of his attendance at the match, and apologised for any offence caused. Also, some of the reactions of players to events on the field further inflamed feelings, as did the behaviour of some individuals, Trueman in particular. Some critics held Hutton responsible for the perceived lack of sportsmanship by the M.C.C. players, as they felt he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> Trueman and other younger tourists under closer control. However, the editor of Wisden later wrote: [...] " [...] was involved in the most thankless task any cricket captain has undertaken when he went to West Indies. Instead of finding a friendly cricket atmosphere he and his players were subjected to the impact of deep political and racial feelingan experience all of them wish to forget. A few members of the team did not hide their innermost feelings, with the result that Hutton came under severe criticism, although his behaviour was blameless." ...|$|E

50|$|In the Royal Navy of {{the early}} nineteenth century, {{promotion}} from captain to admiral was based solely on seniority. The distinguished officer Edward Berry was promoted to captain in 1797 and did not become a rear-admiral until 1821. Hornblower was made a captain in 1805; thus, seniority <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> promotion to Hornblower until the mid-1830s or later.|$|R
