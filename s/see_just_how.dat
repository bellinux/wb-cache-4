25|$|Confronted {{with the}} {{challenge}} of showing 3-dimensional gameplay on 2-dimensional advertisements, the company partnered with Blockbuster and NBC in a coordinated effort. A $5 million campaign promoted NBC's fall lineup alongside the Virtual Boy. American viewers were encouraged via television advertisements on NBC to rent the console for US$10 at a local Blockbuster. This made it affordable for a large number of gamers to try the system, and produced 750,000 rentals. Upon returning the unit, renters received a coupon for $10 off the purchase of a Virtual Boy from any store. 3,000 Blockbuster locations were included in the promotion, which consisted of a sweepstakes with prizes including trips to see the taping of NBC shows. The popular rental system proved harmful to the Virtual Boy's long-term success, allowing gamers to <b>see</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> un-immersive the console was. By mid-1996, Blockbuster was selling its Virtual Boy units at $50 each. Taken as a whole, the marketing campaign was commonly thought of as a failure.|$|E
500|$|Some {{cast members}} portray {{alternate}} versions of their characters, including John Noble, Lance Reddick, and Jasika Nicole. Noble described his doppelgänger—nicknamed [...] "Walternate" [...] by Walter—as [...] " [...] {{the same man}} and the same actor." [...] He continued, [...] "I think of [...] as a soldier. He's like a general in the army. He's very upright, he's very strong." [...] Reddick called alt-Broyles [...] "a great patriot and a great mind," [...] but [...] "a bit of a maverick, so I guess we'll <b>see</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> that loyalty and relationship plays out." [...] Nicole based [...] "alterna-Astrid"s characteristics on her sister, who has Asperger syndrome, partly by avoiding eye contact with the other characters when relaying information to them and by focusing solely on the data in front of her.|$|E

Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English Shonen Jump, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that [...] "he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format," [...] notes that [...] "interesting things [...] going on deep in the narrative structure," [...] and recommends [...] "sticking through to the later volumes to <b>see</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets". Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that [...] "One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama." [...] He praised Oda's artwork as [...] "imaginative and creative" [...] and comments that [...] "Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels [...] ". He also notes that [...] "Oda's panel work [...] features {{a lot of interesting}} perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast," [...] though he complains that the panels can sometimes get [...] "a little chaotic".|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an understanding of}} childhood welfare from a radical perspective, showing how power within the special education system affects the discourse of ‘choice’ for parents. The analysis unmasks the disciplinary power operating within the special education system and explores {{the manner in which}} such power affects choice for parents. In turn, the analysis suggests that although disciplinary power offers little sites for resistance, the actions of some parents in the exercise of choice are seen as a growing challenge to that power. It remains to be <b>seen</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> resistant the system will become {{in the face of such}} opposition...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Michael Liedtke and George Avalos, {{in a review}} of the sixth season in The Charlotte Observer, called the episode [...] "just plain bad". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club roundly criticized the episode and awarded it a [...] "D–", calling it [...] "a famously bad episode of The X-Files." [...] He noted that [...] "the worst thing about 'Agua Mala' is that it comes so very, very close to working that it’s frustrating to <b>see</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> little it actually does" [...] due to its bizarre structure and convoluted antagonist. VanDerWerff criticized Darren McGavin's appearance in the episode, calling it a [...] "glorified cameo", and noted that his character function as the [...] "kind of old man who stands on his porch and yells about the good old days to the neighborhood kids." [...] He did however, call the shot of the [...] "writhing tentacle in the overhead lamp" [...] the [...] "one good thing" [...] in the episode. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, writing that the episode's [...] "laughs aren't clever, and the scares are silly".|$|E

2500|$|During the war years, Chamberlain {{was one of}} the [...] "annexationists" [...] {{who wanted}} the war to end with Germany annexing most of Europe, Africa and Asia to give the Reich the [...] "world power status" [...] he {{believed}} it deserved. As such, Chamberlain worked closely with the Pan-German League, the Conservatives and the völkishe groups to mobilise public support for the maximum war aims he sought. Chamberlain was {{a founding member of the}} Independent Commission for a German Peace, and in July 1915 he signed the Address of the Intellectuals, a petition signed by 1,347 teachers, writers, professors, and theologians asking the government to win the war in order to annex as much territory as possible. Much of this propaganda including Chamberlain's essays in support of the maximum war aims had a very strong anti-Semitic character as Chamberlain claimed that it was the entire German Jewish community who were supposedly seeking a compromise peace to end the war, and were preventing the full mobilization of Germany's power that would allow the Reich to win the war. In a letter to his friend Prince Maximilian of Baden, Chamberlain wrote: I learned today from a man who is especially well-placed to observe these things-even when they go on secretly-that the Jews are completely intoxicated by their success in Germany-first from the millions they have gained through the war, then because of the praise showered on them in all official quarters, and thirdly from the protection they and their machinations enjoy from the censor. Thus, already they are beginning to lose their heads and reach a degree of insolence which may allow us to hope for a flood-tide of reaction. May God grant it!. In October–November 1916, the so-called Judenzählung ("Jew count") was held by the German Army to examine the popular anti-Semitic claim that German Jews were [...] "shirking" [...] their duty to the Fatherland by avoiding war service. The [...] "Jew count" [...] revealed that in fact German Jews were disproportionately over-represented in the front-line units as most German Jews were anxious to prove their German patriotism and love of the Fatherland by volunteering for front-line duty. Many young German Jewish men wished to rebut the anti-Semitic canard that they were not real Germans by fighting for the Fatherland, and thus showing that they loved Germany as much as their Gentile neighbors, hence the disproportionate number of German Jews on the front-line compared to their share of the German population. As the results of the [...] "Jew count" [...] did not please the two men in charge of High Command, namely Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff, the latter a [...] "fanatical anti-Semite" [...] who had been expecting the [...] "Jew Count" [...] to reveal that German Jews were disproportionally underrepresented on the front-line, the High Command issued a facetious statement saying that for the safety of the German Jewish community the [...] "Jew count" [...] could not be made public as it would endanger the lives of German Jews. The implication that if people could <b>see</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> far German Jews were allegedly [...] "shirking" [...] their duty to the Fatherland, then pogroms would break out in Germany led to a major upsurge in anti-Semitism, which Chamberlain was quick to exploit.|$|E

40|$|Mammalian {{development}} involves significant {{interactions between}} offspring and mother. But is this interaction a carefully coordinated effort by two {{individuals with a}} common goal [...] offspring survival? Or is it an evolutionary battleground (a central idea {{in our understanding of}} reproduction). The conflict between parents and offspring extends to an offspring's genes, where paternally inherited genes favor demanding more from the mother, while maternally inherited genes favor restraint. This "intragenomic conflict" (among genes within a genome) is the dominant evolutionary explanation for "genomic imprinting. " But a new study in PLOS Biology provides support for a different perspective: that imprinting might facilitate coordination between mother and offspring. According to this "coadaptation theory," paternally inherited genes might be inactivated because maternally inherited genes are adapted to function harmoniously with the mother. As discussed in this article, the growth effects associated with the imprinted gene Grb 10 are consistent with this idea, but it remains to be <b>seen</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> general the pattern is...|$|R
