5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{opinion from}} someone who does the job: The tar, or [...] "slush" [...] {{is a mixture of}} <b>Stockholm</b> <b>tar,</b> boiled linseed oil, and Japan drier. Many [...] "recipes" [...] for slush exist, but the intent is always to allow a penetrating coat of preservative pine tar that then cures to a harder finish that will not so easily rub off on sails and crew. The term [...] "slush" [...] is also used to describe the grease applied to the masts to lubricate the parrels so that the yards can raise and lower freely.|$|E
5000|$|Pine tar {{has long}} been used in Scandinavian nations as a {{preservative}} for wood which may be exposed to harsh conditions, including outdoor furniture and ship decking and rigging. The high-grade pine tar used in this application is often called <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Tar</b> since, for many years, a single company held a royal monopoly on its export out of Stockholm, Sweden. [...] It {{is also known as}} [...] "Archangel Tar". [...] Tar and pitch for maritime use was in such demand that it became an important export for the American colonies (later United States), such as North Carolina, which had extensive pine forests. North Carolinians later became known as [...] "Tar Heels." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{ship was}} {{replicated}} as accurately as possible, with carefully chosen English oak timbers, hand-forged nails, hand-sewn linen canvas sails, hemp cordage, and the <b>Stockholm</b> <b>tar</b> {{of the type}} used on 17th-century ships. Mayflower II has the brown hull and the dark-red strapwork ornamentation of 17th-century merchant ships, based on analysis of the traditional colors and designs of English merchant ships illustrated in Dutch and English paintings. Carved into the stern of Mayflower II is a blossom of a hawthorne or English mayflower. In England, the skills of elderly traditional workmen were employed to build a vessel that reflected Baker's detailed research which could sail the Atlantic as securely as the original ship.|$|E
5000|$|A good {{description}} of the process is described in the book Star of India, The Log of an Iron Ship - Page 116, Footnote 3To protect wire rigging from moisture and resultant rusting, it first is [...] "wormed" [...] by laying small line in the spiral grooves between the strands, to make a smoother surface. It then is [...] "parceled" [...] by wrapping {{in the same direction}} with long strips of cotton duck (burlap if you're poor) and finally it is [...] "served" [...] by wrapping it in the opposite direction with hambroline, a three-stranded tarred hemp cord, a little smaller in diameter then a lead pencil. Finally it is well treated with <b>Stockholm</b> <b>tar.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The line is then [...] "parcelled" [...] by {{wrapping}} it in {{a spiral}} fashion with long overlapping strips of thin canvas. This is wound from bottom to top, {{the edge of}} the progressing strip slightly overlapping the previous wrap to create a shingled effect, to prevent water from entering. Often the strips of canvas are either saturated with <b>Stockholm</b> <b>tar</b> as they are applied, or painted with tar after the parcelling is complete, immediately prior to the process of serving. The tar helps fill any remaining gaps in the cuntlines as well as creating a waterproof seal over the line within. As with worming, parcelling is applied {{in the same direction as}} the twist of the line being covered. The rule is [...] "worm and parcel with the lay; turn and serve the other way".|$|E
40|$|Tail biting is a {{most serious}} welfare problem in pigs raised for slaughter. In {{instances}} of an outbreak of tail biting, scientists have recommended that farmers take measures such as removal of affected animals, provision of enrichment materials and application of repellents to the pigs' tails. However, no scientific study has ever confirmed the efficacy {{of any of these}} suggestions in counteracting an ongoing outbreak. Here, the efficacy of two repellent ointments, Dippel's oil and <b>Stockholm</b> <b>tar,</b> were examined in a tail-chew test. For this, a novel piece of nylon rope was used as a tail model to measure biting behaviour semi-automatically in 24 single-sex groups of growing pigs (total 264 pigs). Repeated measures analysis showed no effect of time, gender or unit (12 pens per unit), but a highly significant effect of treatment, in that both <b>Stockholm</b> <b>tar</b> and Dippel's oil significantly reduced rope manipulation compared to controls. These results suggest that <b>Stockholm</b> <b>tar</b> and Dippel's oil may be effective in reducing tail biting. The approach taken may be valuable in further testing of strategies to reduce tail biting and improving pig welfar...|$|E
