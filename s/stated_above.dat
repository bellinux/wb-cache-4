5|$|As <b>stated</b> <b>above,</b> the hydrolytic {{proteins}} Rrp6 and Rrp44 {{are associated}} with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different proteins, Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein. Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well, the existence of this activity has recently been questioned and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.|$|E

5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is known}} from three certain species, P. walkeri, P. tubicen, and P. cyrtocristatus. All {{of them can}} be {{distinguished}} from each other, and have many differences. The first named species, therefore the type, is P. walkeri. One certain specimen, from the Dinosaur Park Formation is referred to it, but many more are almost certainly referable. Like <b>stated</b> <b>above,</b> it is different from the other two species, with it having a simpler internal structure than P. tubicen, a straighter crest and different internal structuring than P. cyrtocristatus.|$|E
5|$|As <b>stated</b> <b>above,</b> the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The {{exact nature of}} these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} {{detailed}} ac calorimetry measurements under high pressure and magnetic field of CeRhIn 5. Under hydrostatic pressure the antiferromagnetic order vanishes near p_c*= 2 GPa {{due to a}} first order transition. Superconductivity is found for pressures above 1. 5 GPa inside the magnetic ordered phase. However, the superconductivity differ from the pure homogeneous superconducting ground <b>state</b> <b>above</b> 2 GPa. The application of an external magnetic field H || ab induces a transition inside the superconducting <b>state</b> <b>above</b> pc* which is strongly related to the re-entrance of the antiferromagnetism with field.
