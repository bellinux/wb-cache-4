The MSE of the system with uniform sensing and deterministic energy source {{can serve as a}} lower bound for systems with <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> However, due to asymptotic equivalence between the stochastic and deterministic energy sources as presented in Theorem 1, we will show in the next subsection that the proposed best-effort sensing policy can asymptotically achieve the same performance as the uniform sensing policy as N→∞.|$|E

Theorem 1 provides the theoretical foundation on the asymptotic equivalence between stochastic and deterministic energy sources, and Theorem 2 demonstrates that such equivalence can be achieved in practical systems.|$|E
40|$|The {{essence of}} both {{classical}} and quantum engines is to extract useful energy (work) from <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> e. g. thermal baths. In Maxwell's demon engines, work extraction is assisted by a feedback control based on measurements {{performed by a}} demon, whose memory is erased at some nonzero energy cost.

We show that in the Zeno regime of frequent measurements, memory erasure costs eventually vanish. Our findings provide a new paradigm to analyze quantum heat engines and work extraction in the quantum world. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures (SI 2 pages...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{approaches}} {{the management of}} operating regimes of high-power variable-speed variable-pitch wind energy conversion systems. Given that the control objectives ultimately depend on the wind speed regime, it i proposed that the power maximization objective specific to the partial-load operation to be achieved by means of rotor speed control, whereas the power limitation associated to the full-load regime to be reached by pitch servo-control. Because of specific complex dynamics resulted as interaction of a <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> and a large mechanical structure, smooth commutation between the two operating regimes must be ensured, for reasons of reliability and continuity of service. Moreover, the two control channels interact one with the other meanwhile being submitted to strongly variable and stiff power demand and stochastic disturbance. Matlab/Simulink simulation results are presented to support a preliminary validation of the proposed control strategy...|$|R
30|$|The {{converse}} {{portion of}} Theorem 1 states that P ≥E_s/T_s is the necessary and sufficient {{condition for the}} asymptotic equivalence between the <b>stochastic</b> and deterministic <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> because the percentage of silent symbols is non-diminishing if the condition P ≥E_s/T_s is not satisfied.|$|R
30|$|The {{remainder}} {{of this paper is}} organized as follows. The problem formulation is given in Section 2. Section 3 demonstrates the asymptotic equivalence between <b>stochastic</b> and deterministic <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> by showing that the percentage of silent sensing instants goes to zero as time goes to infinity. The theoretical results are then applied in Section 4 to guide the development of a practical energy harvesting sensing system that can asymptotically achieve the same MSE performance as a conventional sensing system. Numerical and simulation results are given in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes the paper.|$|R
30|$|The {{results in}} Theorem 1 state {{that there is}} an {{asymptotic}} equivalence between stochastic energy source and deterministic energy source as time goes to infinity, if and only if the average harvested energy in one sample period is no less than the energy required for one sensing operation. This means that the performance of the best-effort sensing policy with <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> has the potential to match that of the uniform sensing policy with deterministic energy sources as time becomes large enough and P ≥E_s/T_s. The results hold for a quite general category of energy harvesting processes. It is straightforward to verify that commonly adopted energy harvesting models, such as Poisson energy, Bernoulli energy source, and Gaussian energy source, all fall into this category.|$|E
30|$|The {{asymptotic}} equivalence between stochastic and deterministic {{energy sources}} {{has been demonstrated}} through both theoretical analysis and practical examples. To account for the stochastic nature of energy harvested from the ambient environment, a best-effort sensing policy has been proposed for energy harvesting sensing systems. It {{has been shown that}} the difference between the best-effort sensing scheme and the ideal uniform sensing scheme diminishes as time goes to infinity, if and only if the average energy collection rate is no less than the average energy consumption rate, regardless of the actual distribution of the stochastic energy source. The asymptotic equivalence has been used for the development of an optimum energy harvesting sensing system. It has been shown through both theoretical analysis and simulation results that systems with the best-effort sensing scheme and <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> can achieve almost the same MSE performance as systems with uniform sensing and deterministic energy sources when the number of samples is greater than 400.|$|E
30|$|By {{analyzing}} the stochastic {{properties of the}} energy sources, we will show {{that the percentage of}} silent candidate sensing instants goes to zero as time goes to infinity, if and only if the average energy collection rate is no less than the average energy consumption rate. This means that the difference between the best-effort sensing policy and the uniform sensing policy diminishes as time evolves. The theoretical results indicate that the sensing behavior of systems with <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> has the potential to approach that of systems with deterministic energy sources. Guided by the theoretical results, we then develop optimum sensing and detection schemes for a practical energy harvesting sensing system used to monitor a time-varying event. It will be shown through both theoretical analysis and simulations that the MSE performance of the energy harvesting sensing system asymptotically approaches that of a conventional sensing system with uniform sensing as time goes to infinity. Simulation results show that the performance of the two systems converges with as few as 400 candidate sensing instants. Therefore, we demonstrate from both theoretical and practical aspects that there is an asymptotic equivalence between stochastic and deterministic energy sources.|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{renewable}} energy systems (HRES) are a trendy alternative {{to enhance the}} {{renewable energy}} deployment worldwide. They effectively take advantage of scalability and flexibility of these <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> since combining two or more allows counteracting the weaknesses of a <b>stochastic</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> with the strengths of another or with the predictability of a non-renewable <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> This work presents an optimization methodology for minimum life cycle cost of a HRES based on solar photovoltaic, wind and biomass power.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the minimum energy capacity ratings that an energy-storage (ES) system should accomplish {{in order to}} achieve a defined constant power production in a photovoltaic (PV) power plant. ES is a key issue for the further integration of intermittent and <b>stochastic</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> which are not currently dispatchable due to their dependence on real-time weather conditions, as is the case of PV technology. This paper proposes and describes an energy management strategy (EMS) for operating PV power plants with ES in the future. The goal of this EMS is to endow these power plants with a constant production that can be controlled and hence traded on electricity markets. This paper presents simulated results on the percentage of time throughout the year during which a large-scale PV+ES plant operates properly with different ES ratings and according to different configurations of this EMS. Finally, a test bench was developed, and experimental results validating this EMS were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Integration of non-dispatchable {{renewable}} <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> such as {{wind and}} solar into the grid is challenging due to the <b>stochastic</b> nature of <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> Hence, electrical hubs (EH) and virtual power plants that combine non-dispatchable <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> <b>energy</b> storage and dispatchable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> such as internal combustion generators and micro gas turbines are getting popular. However, designing such energy systems considering the electricity demand of a neighborhood, curtailments for grid interactions and real time pricing (RTP) of the main utility grid (MUG) is a difficult exercise. Seasonal and hourly variation of electricity demand, potential for each non-dispatchable <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> and RTP of MUG needs to be considered when designing the energy system. Representation of dispatch strategy {{plays a major role}} in this process where simultaneous optimization of system design and dispatch strategy is required. This study presents a bi-level dispatch strategy based on reinforced learning for simultaneous optimization of system design and operation strategy of an EH. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was combined with a finite state controller to obtain the operating state of the system. Pareto optimization is conducted considering, lifecycle cost and system autonomy to obtain optimum system design using evolutionary algorithm...|$|R
30|$|Naturally, {{we would}} ask the question: can an energy {{harvesting}} sensing system with <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> perform {{as well as a}} conventional sensing system powered by deterministic energy sources? We seek {{the answer to this question}} from two aspects: from the theoretical aspect in terms of the stochastic properties of the available energy at a given time, and from the practical aspect in terms of the MSE performance of a sensing system. For a conventional sensing system with deterministic energy sources, uniform sampling is usually employed by the sensors and it is optimum over the duration in which the signal is wide sense stationary (WSS) [9, 10]. However, due to the randomness in the energy arrival process, uniform sampling might be infeasible in energy harvesting systems given that there might not be sufficient energy to perform sensing operations at certain time periods. We thus propose a simple best-effort sensing policy that attempts to achieve uniform sampling with its best efforts [11 - 13]. The best-effort policy defines a set of equally spaced candidate sensing instants. At a given candidate sensing instant, the sensor will perform sensing only if there is sufficient energy to do so, and it will remain silent otherwise.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel power flow optimization strategy in Micro Grids (MGs) {{connected to the}} main grid. When the MG includes <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> such as photovoltaic and micro eolic-generators, it is very useful to rely on Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) to buffer energy. In fact, an ESS can be employed to perform several functionalities, related to different user requirements, such as power stability, peak shaving, optimal energy trading, etc. The Energy Management System {{is based on a}} Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) optimized by a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm in order to maximize both the total profit in energy trading with the main grid and the State of Health (SOH) of the ESS. The FLC manages the neat aggregate energy deficit and surplus inside the MG, analyzing in real time the state of the MG (aggregated energy demand and production, State of Charge of the ESS, energy sale and purchase prices). The FLC is tested on a MG composed by a photovoltaic solar generator, a domestic user and a Li-ion battery. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is in charge to find the set of solutions on the Pareto front. The results are compared with the same FLC optimized by a mono-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) minimizing in a first case only the total profit and in the second case a convex linear combination of the total profit and a measure of the battery stress...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the performance modeling {{and evaluation of}} network systems powered with renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> such as solar and wind <b>energy.</b> Such <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> largely depend on environmental conditions, which are hard to predict accurately. As such, it may only make sense to require the network systems to support a soft quality of service (QoS) guarantee, i. e., to guarantee a service requirement with a certain high probability. In this paper, we intend to build a solid mathematical foundation to help better understand the <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> constraint and the inherent correlation between QoS and the uncertain energy supply. We utilize a calculus approach to model the cumulative amount of charged energy and the cumulative amount of consumed energy. We derive {{upper and lower bounds}} on the remaining energy level based on a <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> charging rate and a <b>stochastic</b> <b>energy</b> discharging rate. By building the bridge between energy consumption and task execution (i. e., service), we study the QoS guarantee under the constraint of uncertain <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> We further show how performance bounds can be improved if some strong assumptions can be made.

30|$|In this paper, we seek {{answer to}} the question: can a {{wireless}} sensing system with energy harvesting power supplies perform {{as well as the}} one with conventional power supplies? Conventional sensing systems with deterministic <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> usually employ uniform sampling. However, due to the stochastic nature of the energy harvested from the ambient environment, uniform sampling is usually infeasible for energy harvesting sensing systems. We thus propose a simple best-effort sensing scheme, which defines a set of equally spaced candidate sensing instants.

It is analytically shown that the percentage of silent candidate sensing instants goes to zero as time increases, if and only if the average energy harvesting rate is no less than the average energy consumption rate. Therefore, the difference between the best-effort sensing policy and the uniform sensing policy diminishes as time evolves. The theoretical results are then used to guide the design of a practical sensing system that monitors a time-varying event. Both analysis and simulations show that the energy harvesting system with the best-effort sensing scheme can asymptotically achieve the same mean squared error (MSE) performance as the one with uniform sensing and deterministic <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> Therefore, we provide a positive {{answer to the}} question by establishing the asymptotic equivalence between <b>stochastic</b> and deterministic <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> from both theoretical and practical aspects.|$|R
