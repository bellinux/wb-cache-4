50|$|Hard {{landscaping}} involves {{projects that}} cover {{the entirety of the}} yard and that are necessary before <b>soft</b> <b>landscaping</b> features come into play. Hard landscaping is very much altering the foundation of the yard, the “bricks and mortar”, and so only once this is completed can you begin to focus on the more beautiful features of the yard, hard-soft landscaping such as the floral arrangements, trees and shrubs and perfecting your color schemes. One key feature of hard landscaping is to do with the absorption of water - something that is of great importance given the climate. Hard landscaping ensures that worrying about water after heavy rain or snowfall isn’t an issue. The right water absorption and irrigation system installed through hard landscaping, coupled with hard materials that safely move water away from the property can ensure that soil movement is never a problem and that your yard stays a drier, enjoyable living space rather than a wet and muddy bog. There are <b>soft</b> <b>landscaping</b> options that can help to achieve this, but the bulk of this is definitely achieved through hard landscaping.|$|E

5000|$|Joubert Park todayWhen {{thinking}} of the word 'park' {{in the context of}} Johannesburg CBD, Joubert Park instantly jumps to mind due to its richness in narrative and changes and adaptation over time-an important factor to address considering the political regeneration of Johannesburg. Its history is prevalent in the classic elements still actively functioning today, such as the symmetrical layout with arcades resting on the grid of the central axis's that cross at the centre of the park where the fountain (that was once a less prominent pond) is located. [...] The rectangular footprint is masked with a grid that is a continuation of the figure ground of the city along the West and East edges (this promotes infiltration along the broad arcades bordered by trees). Hard and <b>soft</b> <b>landscaping</b> designates activity such as active and passive space. All of the abovementioned elements are reminiscent of an idyllic landscape of a template superimposed on park-scapes worldwide.Joubert Park today is an account of Johannesburg as a city in transition. The park is fed by a network of (in-)formal activities, such as the establishment of the chess club, community facilities (aftercare; clinic), a broad field of trade and services all weaved together by the people. The users of the park have designated areas of activity, which is respected by one and all within the park.|$|E
50|$|Constructed in the château-style {{common to}} railway hotels {{built by the}} Canadian Pacific, Place Viger housed the railway station in its lower levels and a luxurious hotel on the upper floors. Place Viger enjoyed an enviable setting {{adjacent}} to the gardens of Viger Square, allowing both railway travellers and hotel guests to stroll along the garden paths. The shifting of Montreal's commercial core to the north-west, and {{the onset of the}} economic depression of the 1930s, proved disastrous for Place Viger. The hotel closed in 1935. In 1951, the railway station was also closed, and the building was sold to the City of Montreal. The interiors were gutted and transformed into nondescript office space, and the building was renamed Édifice Jacques-Viger. The Viger Square gardens were destroyed in the 1970s to allow for the construction of the Autoroute Ville-Marie highway. After the highway was completed, although a new Viger Square was created on the concrete deck covering the highway, it was poorly designed, desolate and underused, despite sculptural works by artists including Charles Daudelin. For decades, the old Place Viger station sat isolated and neglected, a striking historic building surrounded by parking lots and concrete.In 2003, the Commission scolaire de Montréal, the City of Montreal and the Quebec provincial government announced that Place Viger would house a new École des métiers du tourisme (a school of tourism).

For sustainable development to be achieved there {{is the need for}} a balance between environmental, economic and social development. Therefore, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) encompass all three. In Ghana, most infrastructural projects such as roads and buildings are done with economic and social focused leaving out the environmental concerns. Even though there is Environmental Management Systems (EMS) in place such as the Environmental Protection Act (EPA), the country’s environment with regards to greenery has setbacks.

40|$|Heat {{islands are}} a {{significant}} problem in urban spaces worldwide. The phenomenon occurs when air and surface temperatures in urban areas significantly exceed those experienced in nearby rural areas. There are two main causes of heat islands. The first {{is the use of}} highly absorptive construction materials in buildings and infrastructure, which soak up heat and radiate it back into the immediate surroundings. These materials, including but not limited to concrete, steel, asphalt and stone, are usually impermeable and so do not embody moisture that could dissipate some of the absorbed heat. The second cause relates to urban form, where the canyon-like configurations of buildings and streets channel and trap heat from the sun. In both cases, an absence of greenery and other <b>soft</b> <b>landscaping</b> can compound the problem by lowering capacity for cooling through shading and evotranspiration. Incidences of heat islands increase as urban areas swell in size and cover more land area, making the phenomenon an unwelcome side effect of global trends towards increased urbanisation. Heat islands create serious problems, including increased energy demand for cooling, declining air quality and heat stress for people and animals. In very severe cases, heat islands can compound the effects of high urban temperatures, leading to increased human mortality [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis for the Master of Architecture degree {{focuses on}} urban renewal, in {{particular}} on revitalization of run down inner city neighborhoods. My chosen site {{is the area}} outside the main station in Dresden currently a wide open field with a monument of Lenin. It forms an important entry to the city center, to which it connects via the Prager StraBe, once a proud and glamorous shopping street, now a uninviting, wind-swepted pedestrian zone. This area was heavily destroyed (95 °x) through Allied bombing on February 13, 1945. The reconstruction after the war disregarded the context more or less completely and was executed in a modernist town planning style which disregards {{of the history of}} the place and human scale. The analytical part deals with the existing structures, spaces and services. A catalogue of problems was established in order to be able to discuss objectives and propose strategies for possible solutions. As a result, I developed the program for the scheme. The creative project attempts to solve these problems: the urban form, the reduced density, the traffic situation, the pedestrian zone etc. and demonstrate a reasonable design solution for the area. It consists of a hotel, a convention center, a administration center, various mixed use buildings with retail at ground floor, office units above and residential penthouses.

40|$|The Archaeology Unit of Southampton City Council {{carried out}} an {{evaluation}} excavation at Erskine Court in May 2014. The work {{was commissioned by}} Drew Smith Ltd. The evaluation aims were to determine the extent, condition, nature, character, quality, and date of any archaeological remains encountered, as dictated by current best practice, {{in order for a}} decision to be made as to the need for further archaeological work. Natural deposits were the gravels of River Terrace 6, over London Clay. The earliest evidence of human activity was a pit that contained flint flakes and large quantities of burnt flint. It was probably prehistoric. Buried soil was present across the whole site. Its date is uncertain but it probably represent hundreds of years of natural processes and occasional agricultural use. It was cut by a ditch that ran parallel with Rownhams Lane (north-west to south-east), just beyond the south-west boundary of the site. The age of this lane and the ditch are uncertain but the lane first appears on maps of the early 19 th century and the ditch contained 19 th century china at its base. Another ditch was on a similar alignment but was a separate ditch. Fragments of coal and brick indicate that it was also backfilled in the 19 th century or later. Modern deposits included rubble and topsoil and were associated with the construction of Erskine Court.

As an instinctive and inspired narrator, he reported ecstatically on all the mysterious wonders of the Alps.

Letting the reader into the atmosphere of the Giudicarie Alps he noted:The low elevation of the valleys, their sunny exposure, and the gentle slope of their hillsides, give the scenery an air of richness rarely found at the base of great snow-mountains. The frequent and gay-looking villages, the woods of chestnuts, the knots of walnut-trees, the great fields of yellow-podded maize, the luxuriant vines and orchards, have the charm which the spontaneous bounty and colour of southern nature always exercise on the native of the more reserved and sober North.
