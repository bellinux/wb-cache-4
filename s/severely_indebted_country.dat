Manzano and Rigobon (2001) have suggested a link between debt prob-lems and slow growth in resource-rich countries, but have not identified the specific channels through which this link operates.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between openness and inflation has been generally posed {{as a negative}} relationship. Since Romer (1993) first proposed his study, under the guise {{that the absence of}} precommitment to monetary expansion can lead to higher inflation, many other studies and regressions have been done, attributing the effects to different causes or under special circumstances.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s Croatia has managed a rather {{successful}} transition process with solid growth, low inflation and exchange rate stability. Better integration into international financial markets, capital account liberalisation and banking sector reform have facilitated access to foreign financing {{and opened the}} country to strong and persistent capital inflows. A significant increase in Croatia's external debt {{over the last few}} years, and a recent widening of the current account deficit, have attracted the attention of policymakers and external observers alike. This Country Focus argues that a rise in external indebtedness has made Croatia more vulnerable to potential shocks, but also finds that sizeable foreign assets of the banking system and evidence about the existence of unrecorded foreign exchange holdings by the private non-banking sector mitigate external risks. Current account deficits have been driven by strong investment growth rather than a decline in domestic savings, thus providing some reassurance on sustainability issues. The Country Focus concludes that, in the specific setting of Croatia, further fiscal consolidation remains a key instrument to address external vulnerabilities and allow for a much needed further expansion of private-sector activities. In this context, deeper structural reforms could trigger a stronger supply response, raise potential output and improve competitiveness on a broader front. A significant rise in gross external debt …. Croatia's foreign indebtedness has risen significantly over the last few years, in both absolute and relative terms. Over the period 2001 - 2006 its gross external debt increased by more than € 16 billion, from 60 % to around 85 % of GDP. The strongest increases were in 2003 and 2004, when the debt ratio rose by almost 20 percentage points of GDP. According to the World Bank classification, Croatia turned from a moderately to a <b>severely</b> <b>indebted</b> middle-income <b>country</b> in 2004. The recent growth and level of Croatia's gross external debt appear relatively high compared with most Central and Eastern European countries. Regional comparison shows tha...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of models I {{developed}} to simulate mathematical relationships between external debt and fiscal and balance of payments variables my thesis evaluates whether debt cancellation will overcome the debt overhang and crowding out effects of external debt and allow <b>Severely</b> <b>Indebted</b> Low Income <b>Country</b> (SILIC) economies to meet their current and future debt service in full, without further debt relief, without further rescheduling or accumulation of arrears and without unduly compromising economic growth. I find that recipients of debt cancellation have not lowered their total indebtedness [as a condition for solving their debt overhang problem] nor have they leveraged exchange market stability, increased fiscal spending or higher import capacity [as a condition for solving their ‘debt crowding out’ problem]. Recipients of debt cancellation have also failed to improve debt service capacity, resulting in failure to meet current debt service obligations and continued accumulation of arrears. The principal explanation for this result is that debt cancellation is "pseudo" or "accounting" money {{and it has a}} crowding-out effect on new lending from bilateral sources. Since losses in new external disbursements undermine the capacity of countries to meet demands of their development programs and their current and future debt service in full [without further debt relief] debt cancellation forces countries to borrow more from non bilateral sources and therefore accumulate further debts. In the context of an endogenous growth style model where capital accumulation is the sole force driving growth these results underscore the desirability of implementing optimal rescheduling policy because implied guarantees of new external resources minimise the risk of debt repudiation, lowers uncertainty, and also allows the cycle of international borrowing to ensure that debts do not crowd out new investment. By reducing uncertainty, optimal rescheduling policy also contributes to lowering debt overhang and remains an essential part the gradual exit strategy from external indebtedness. international economics, external debt, debt relief, poor country debt, HIPC, Paris Club...|$|R
