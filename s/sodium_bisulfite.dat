5|$|Iodine is {{the least}} {{abundant}} of the stable halogens, comprising only 0.46parts per million of Earth's crustal rocks (compare: fluorine 544ppm, chlorine 126ppm, bromine 2.5ppm). Among the eighty-four elements which occur in significant quantities (elements 1–42, 44–60, 62–83, and 90–92), it ranks sixty-first in abundance. Iodide minerals are rare, and most deposits that are concentrated enough for economical extraction are iodate minerals instead. Examples include lautarite, Ca(IO3)2, and dietzeite, 7Ca(IO3)2·8CaCrO4. These are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the caliche, found in Chile, whose main product is sodium nitrate. In total, they can contain at least 0.02% and at most 1% iodine by weight. Sodium iodate is extracted from the caliche and reduced to iodide by <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulfite.</b> This solution is then reacted with freshly extracted iodate, resulting in comproportionation to iodine, which may be filtered off.|$|E

Hexavalent chromium compound is present at high {{concentration in the}} shovels and cranes factory, it {{is used in the}} electrodeposition container; after its reduction by <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulfites</b> it changes into trivalent chromium. The present work deals with the investigation and optimization of chromium (III) ions removal from aqueous solutions by complexation enhanced ultrafiltration using experimental and calculation approach; diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) has been used as chelating agent for Chromium (III) complexation; in the first part the study of experimental optimum conditions of complexation reaction is carried out; the second one the calculation of optimum pH, initial concentration of chelating agent and the influence of chromium hydroxides forms on complexation reaction using MATLAB language has been determined. Its shown that the Complexation reaction is favoured at pH equal to 5. 1, at excess EDTA concentration ([EDTA] 0 = 0. 095 M for [Cr(III) ] 0 = 0. 003 M), at ordinary temperature (T= 20 °C), and 600 tr/min for agitation, trivalent chromium concentration at solution increases with ionic strengths, it also increases with high CaCO 3 values. The calculated pH, initial concentration of ligand and presence of chromium hydroxides forms shows a little variation with experimental ones...|$|R

DNA is first treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulfite,</b> which converts unmethylated cytosine bases to uracil, which is recognized by PCR primers as thymine. Two PCRs are then carried out on the modified DNA, using primer sets identical except at any CpG islands within the primer sequences. At these points, one primer set recognizes DNA with cytosines to amplify methylated DNA, and one set recognizes DNA with uracil or thymine to amplify unmethylated DNA. MSP using qPCR can also be performed to obtain quantitative rather than qualitative information about methylation.|$|E

40|$|Insulin-like {{growth factor}} binding-protein- 7 (IGFBP 7) was {{obtained}} from our previous colonic adenocarcinoma (CRC) and normal mucosa suppression subtraction hybridization (SSH) cDNA libraries. By RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we found that IGFBP 7 was overexpressed in CRC tissue compared to normal tissue. However, our in vitro experiments performed in 10 CRC cell lines showed that IGFBP 7 expressed only in SW 480 and Caco 2 cell lines, which implied an underlying reversible regulatory mechanism. Using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and <b>bisulfite</b> <b>sodium</b> PCR (BSP), we found that its expression was associated with DNA hypomethylation of exon 1. This was further supported by the in vitro study which showed restored IGFBP 7 expression after demethylation agent 5 -aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine treatment. Correlation analysis between IGFBP 7 expression and prognosis indicated that overexpression of IGFBP 7 in CRC tissue correlated with favourable survival. Investigation of the functional role of IGFBP 7 through transfection studies showed that IGFBP 7 protein could inhibit growth rate, decrease colony formation activity, and induce apoptosis in RKO and SW 620 cells, suggesting it a potential tumor suppressor protein in colorectal carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our study clearly demonstrated that IGFBP 7 plays a potential tumor suppressor role against colorectal carcinogenesis and its expression is associated with DNA hypomethylation of exon 1...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{composite}} is {{also known}} as wood engineering. This field is available due to its ability to overcome the current limitation faced by applying natural lumber wood. The many advantage that wood-composite have over natural lumber makes it more desirable in long-term usage. In the production of wood-composite, the agent use to bind wood together is urea formaldehyde. The issue faced when urea formaldehyde is used, that it will produce free formaldehyde which is rather cancerous to human beings. Hence, steps have to be taken to reduce the emission of urea formaldehyde. The step proposed in this research is utilizing formaldehyde scavengers. But if scavengers are applied directly during the production of wood composite, it will affect the credibility of the product and also react will the urea formaldehyde. Thus, a study on developing a typical wax or polymer coating for these scavengers could solve the problem. Once, the coating is developed, it is incorporated to the preparation of the medium density fibreboard and after that, tests are conducted to characterize its properties. To study the feasibility of success of this research, the parameter studied is mechanical properties of the wood and the formaldehyde emission of the finished product. The focus of mechanical properties is the internal bonding, modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture to determine effect of scavengers to the wood panel. In formaldehyde emission, perforator and desiccator methods are applied to determine the concentration of formaldehyde liberated. From the proposed scavengers used, sodium metabisulfite and ammonium <b>bisulfite,</b> <b>sodium</b> metabisulfite shows great effectivity in reducing the formaldehyde liberation followed by ammonium bisulfite. However, ammonium bisulfite affected the mechanical properties of the board greatly, where else, sodium metabisulfite did not affect adversely. With this study, it could provide the wood- composite industry an alternative to open new market with this method of producing wood-composite products...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cytosine {{methylation}} {{in plant}} genomes {{is important for}} the regulation of gene transcription and transposon activity. Genome-wide methylomes are studied upon mutation of the DNA methyltransferases, adaptation to environmental stresses or during development. However, from basic biology to breeding programs, {{there is a need to}} monitor multiple samples to determine transgenerational methylation inheritance or differential cytosine methylation. Methylome data obtained by <b>sodium</b> hydrogen sulfite (<b>bisulfite)</b> -conversion and next-generation sequencing (NGS) provide genome- wide information on cytosine methylation. However, a profiling method that detects cytosine methylation state dispersed over the genome would allow high-throughput analysis of multiple plant samples with distinct epigenetic signatures. We use specific restriction endonucleases to enrich for cytosine coverage in a bisulfite and NGS-based profiling method, which was compared to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of the same plant material. Methods: We established an effective methylome profiling method in plants, termed plant-reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (plant-RRBS), using optimized double restriction endonuclease digestion, fragment end repair, adapter ligation, followed by bisulfite conversion, PCR amplification and NGS. We report a performant laboratory protocol and a straightforward bioinformatics data analysis pipeline for plant-RRBS, applicable for any reference-sequenced plant species. Results: As a proof of concept, methylome profiling was performed using an Oryza sativa ssp. indica pure breeding line and a derived epigenetically altered line (epiline). Plant-RRBS detects methylation levels at tens of millions of cytosine positions deduced from bisulfite conversion in multiple samples. To evaluate the method, the coverage of cytosine positions, the intra-line similarity and the differential cytosine methylation levels between the pure breeding line and the epiline were determined. Plant-RRBS reproducibly covers commonly up to one fourth of the cytosine positions in the rice genome when using MspI-DpnII within a group of five biological replicates of a line. The method predominantly detects cytosine methylation in putative promoter regions and not-annotated regions in rice. Conclusions: Plant-RRBS offers high-throughput and broad, genome- dispersed methylation detection by effective read number generation obtained from reproducibly covered genome fractions using optimized endonuclease combinations, facilitating comparative analyses of multi-sample studies for cytosine methylation and transgenerational stability in experimental material and plant breeding populations...|$|R
