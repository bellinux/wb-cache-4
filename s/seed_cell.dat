MethodsPCDNA 3. 1 –EGF eukaryotic expression vector was transferred into HaCaT cell, and G 418 was utilized to select the HaCaT–EGF cell line. Using an inverted microscope, PCR, ELISA method to detect the changes of the cell morphology, {{the expression of the}} EGF gene and protein, and the mRNA expression levels of apoptosis related molecule Caspase– 3, the cell cycle related protein cyclin D 1. ResultsThe mRNA expression levels of the obtained HaCaT–EGF cell were more than 100 times higher than the level of ordinary HaCaT cell. The colony of the HaCaT–EGF cells was more focused and tight compared to the empty vector transfected HaCaT cells and normal HaCaT cells. The expression levels of apoptotic factor Caspase– 3 and cyclin D 1 in HaCaT–EGF cell were significantly higher than those in the empty vector HaCaT– pcDNA 3. 1 cell, and the differences were statistically significant (P 0. 05).

40|$|Whereas the {{relationship}} between criticality of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and dynamics of GRNs at a single cell level has been vigorously studied, {{the relationship}} between the criticality of GRNs and system properties at a higher level has remained unexplored. Here we aim at revealing a potential role of criticality of GRNs at a multicellular level which are hard to uncover through the single-cell-level studies, especially from an evolutionary viewpoint. Our model simulated the growth of a cell population from a single <b>seed</b> <b>cell.</b> All the cells were assumed to have identical GRNs. We induced genetic perturbations to the GRN of the <b>seed</b> <b>cell</b> by adding, deleting, or switching a regulatory link between a pair of genes. From numerical simulations, we found that the criticality of GRNs facilitated the formation of nontrivial morphologies when the GRNs were critical {{in the presence of the}} evolutionary perturbations. Moreover, the criticality of GRNs produced topologically homogenous cell clusters by adjusting the spatial arrangements of cells, which led to the formation of nontrivial morphogenetic patterns. Our findings corresponded to an epigenetic viewpoint that heterogeneous and complex features emerge from homogeneous and less complex components through the interactions among them. Thus, our results imply that highly structured tissues or organs in morphogenesis of multicellular organisms might stem from the criticality of GRNs. Comment: 34 pages, 17 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E

In this study, HAMSCs were used to promote proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs) in a Transwell coculture system. Proliferation levels were investigated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining of 5 -ethynyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (EdU). Osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization were evaluated in chromogenic alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity substrate assays, Alizarin red S staining, and RT-PCR analysis of early HBMSCs osteogenic marker expression.

Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were seeded onto cubic scaffolds prepared from demineralized bone matrix (DBM) by three methods - static, hydrodynamic, or fibrin hydrogel-assisted seeding. The resulting cell-scaffold constructs were cultured in vitro by static flask culture or hydrodynamic culture. The initial cell density and the subsequent in vitro proliferation and alkaline phosphate activities of the constructs were analyzed. The constructs were also subcutaneously implanted in nude mice to examine their in vivo osteogenic activities. Hydrogel-assisted seeding gave the highest seeding efficiency, followed by hydrodynamic and conventional static seeding. During in vitro culture, hydrodynamic culture produced higher plateau cell densities, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities, and extracellular matrix production than static culture. After subcutaneous implantation in nude mice, the implants prepared by the combination of hydrogel-assisted seeding and hydrodynamic culture produced higher wet weight and bone mineral density than implants prepared by other methods. The results suggest that the hydrogel-assisted seeding can substantially increase the initial <b>seed</b> <b>cell</b> density in scaffolds.

Recent expression profiling of melanoma cell lines identified two transcription signatures, respectively, corresponding with proliferative and invasive cellular phenotypes.

Here, DNA microarray-characterized cell lines were subjected to in vitro characterization before s. c. injection into immunocompromised mice. Tumor growth rates were measured and postexcision samples were assessed by immunohistochemistry to identify invasive and proliferative signature cells. In vitro tests showed that proliferative signature melanoma cells are faster growing but less motile than invasive signature cells. In vivo proliferative signature cells initiated tumor growth in 14 +/- 3 days postinjection. By comparison, invasive signature cells required a significantly longer (P < 0. 001) period of 59 +/- 11 days. Immunohistochemistry showed that regardless of the <b>seed</b> <b>cell</b> signature, tumors showed evidence for both proliferative and invasive cell types. Furthermore, proliferative signature cell types were detected most frequently in the peripheral margin of growing tumors.

Copyright World Scientific Publishing Company at : [URL] [Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]The understanding of the evolutionary transitions is a major area of research in artificial life and in biology. We follow an artificial life approach to investigate these phenomena, using a system inspired by Anabaena cyanobacteria (which exhibit rudimentary multicellular differentiation and cooperation) in order to look for evidence of emerging differentiation and multicellular cooperation in colonies of individual cells. We first evolve single free-living cells {{with the help of a}} Genetic Algorithm (GA). These cells are controlled with genetic regulatory networks. The single cells are evolved to each perform both of two tasks: an abstraction of house-keeping metabolism and a reproductive cycle. Once such a cell was evolved with the GA, the cell is used to seed the growth of a multicellular filamentous colony, whose constituent cells continue to reproduce and evolve. Two types of colonies generated from the <b>seed</b> <b>cell</b> are studied: one with intercellular communication ability and one without. We introduce and apply new measures for assessing the impact of multicellular interaction on individual reproduction and on life span. The conclusion of these studies shows that the colony with the ability to communicate shows, with the help of our new measures, behaviors that hint at the emergence of early cooperation...|$|E
40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of establishing the human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) bank as to provide an alternative source for the <b>seed</b> <b>cells</b> of tissue engineering. Methods　The cell surface antigens of the purified, expanded hADSCs and the ones following cryopreservation were detected by flow cytometry, cultured in an induced culture medium to induce the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. The specific marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in osteogenic special medium was also detected by immunohistochemistry. Results　The phenotype and expansion possibility of hADSCs after cryopreservation were remained. It could expand for 10 generations. The doubling time was 48 hours. The 2 nd, 6 th and 10 th generation of hADSCs kept stronger ability of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Conclusion　The bank of hADSCs has been incipiently established and can provide eligible <b>seed</b> <b>cells</b> for tissue engineering. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2016. 12. 0...|$|R
40|$|Restenosis at {{the site}} of {{implantation}} of a cardiovascular stent remains a significant problem in the interventional treatment of cardiovascular disease. Studies confirm that endothelial impairment {{is one of the most}} important factors leading to restenosis and treatment failure. Accelerating the re-endothelialization of vascular stents and rapidly restoring the integrity of the endothelium is currently the best strategy for preventing restenosis. There has been great progress in understanding endothelial development and repair, particularly the role of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in restoring the endothelial integrity at injured vascular sites. EPCs hold great promise for treating cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, modifying the adherence properties of EPCs and other types of <b>seed</b> <b>cells</b> on stents can accelerate cell proliferation and endothelialization. In this review, we summarize the progress in utilizing <b>seed</b> <b>cells</b> from various sources for in vitro endothelialization and native endothelialization, as well as their application in vascular grafts...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Stem cell {{transplantation}} {{has been reported}} to rescue ovarian function in a preclinical mouse model of chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian failure (POF); however, maintaining the survival and self-renewal of transplanted <b>seed</b> <b>cells</b> in ovarian tissues over the long-term remains a troublesome issue. In this study we aimed to determine whether the CD 44 +/CD 105 + human amniotic fluid cell (HuAFCs) subpopulation represent potential <b>seed</b> <b>cells</b> for stem {{cell transplantation}} treatments in POF. Materials and methods: The CD 44 +/CD 105 + subpopulation were isolated from HuAFCs, cultured in vitro, and injected into a cyclophosphamide-induced mouse model of POF. Results: Under continuous subculture in vitro, CD 44 +/CD 105 + cells proliferated rapidly and expressed high levels of the proliferative markers Ki 67 and survivin, as well as high levels of a number of mesenchymal stem cell biomarkers. Moreover, when red fluorescence protein (RFP) -transduced CD 44 +/CD 105 + HuAFCs were transplanted into the ovaries of POF mice, the cells could be detected by fluorescence microscopy up to three weeks after injection. Furthermore, the BrdUrd incorporation assay and immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that CD 44 +/CD 105 + HuAFCs underwent normal cycles of cell proliferation and self-renewal in the ovarian tissues of POF mice over the long-term. Conclusions: The mesenchymal stem cell properties and long-term in vivo survival of CD 44 +/CD 105 + HuAFCs make them ideal <b>seed</b> <b>cells</b> for stem cell transplantation to treat POF. </p...|$|R
