500|$|All sloth lemurs have {{relatively}} robust skulls {{compared to the}} indriids, yet despite shared cranial features with the larger sloth lemurs, its skull still resembles that of an indri. The cranial traits shared with the other sloth lemurs include relatively <b>small</b> <b>orbits,</b> robust zygomatic arches, and a mostly rectangular hard palate. The <b>small</b> <b>orbits</b> taken into consideration with the relative size of the optic canal suggest that Babakotia had low visual acuity, which is typical for lemurs.

50|$|This {{family is}} {{represented}} by two species in the genus Leptosteus. Leptosteids differ from brachydeirids by having comparatively <b>smaller</b> <b>orbits</b> and more elongated trunk shields.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Two bodies {{orbiting}} {{a common}} center of mass, {{indicated by the}} red plus. The larger body has a higher mass, and therefore a <b>smaller</b> <b>orbit</b> and a lower orbital velocity than its lower-mass companion.|$|R

50|$|Smilesaurus {{was a large}} gorgonopsian, with a skull {{length of}} up to 31 centimeters. It can be {{distinguished}} by other rubidgeines by its lack of cranial pachyostosis and rugosoties, and by its relatively <b>small</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Innermost stable {{circular}} orbit (often called the ISCO) is the <b>smallest</b> <b>orbit</b> {{in which a}} test particle can stably orbit a massive object in general relativity. [...] The location of the ISCO, the ISCO-radius (...) , depends on the angular momentum (spin) of the central object.|$|R
50|$|The named clade Neochoristodera {{includes}} Champsosaurus, Tchoiria, Simoedosaurus, Ikechosaurus {{and possibly}} Pachystropheus. This group of large-bodied reptiles {{is characterized by}} elongate snouts and relatively <b>small</b> <b>orbits.</b> Although it reflects our early understanding of the Choristodera as a whole, it in fact represents a highly derived condition.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the largest}} species in this genus: the skull length of the holotype is around 20 cm.

5|$|In 2003 it was {{hypothesized}} that these clumps could be caused by a roughly Neptune-mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65AU over 56millionyears, an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega. The migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second, higher-mass planet in a <b>smaller</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beta Pictoris b: On June 10, for {{the first}} time astronomers have been able to {{directly}} follow the motion of an exoplanet as it moves {{to the other side of}} its host star. The planet has the <b>smallest</b> <b>orbit</b> so far of all directly imaged exoplanets, lying as close to its host star as Saturn is to the Sun.|$|R
50|$|The Necklace Nebula is the {{exploded}} {{aftermath of}} a giant star that came too close to its Sun-like binary companion. The two stars that produced the Necklace Nebula are in a relatively <b>small</b> <b>orbit</b> about each other. They have a period of 1.2 days and a separation {{on the order of}} 5 times the radius of the Sun.|$|R
5000|$|Gymnotrachelus hydei {{is a large}} selenosteid arthrodire placoderm {{known from}} the Late Famennian Cleveland Shales of Ohio. [...] It was {{originally}} reconstructed as physically resembling Selenosteus, with slightly <b>smaller</b> <b>orbits</b> (i.e., having a broad, box-like head).

50|$|A {{horseshoe}} orbit {{is a type}} of co-orbital {{motion of}} a <b>small</b> <b>orbiting</b> body relative to a larger orbiting body (such as Earth). The orbital period of the smaller body is very nearly the same as for the larger body, and its path appears to have a horseshoe shape as viewed from the larger object in a rotating reference frame.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a planet}} orbits a star, the star also moves {{in its own}} <b>small</b> <b>orbit</b> around the system's center of mass. Variations in the star's radial velocity—that is, {{the speed with which}} it moves towards or away from Earth—can be {{detected}} from displacements in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. Extremely small radial-velocity variations can be observed, of 1 m/s or even somewhat less.|$|R
2500|$|One {{potential}} {{advantage of}} the astrometric method {{is that it is}} most sensitive to planets with large orbits. [...] This makes it complementary to other methods that are most sensitive to planets with <b>small</b> <b>orbits.</b> [...] However, very long observation times will be required— years, and possibly decades, as planets far enough from their star to allow detection via astrometry also {{take a long time to}} complete an orbit.|$|R
50|$|The sixth {{appearance}} is the barbourofelids. These carnivores are very {{closely related to}} actual cats, and as such, they are hard to tell apart. The best known barbourofelid is Barbourofelis, which differs from most machairodonts by having a much heavier and more stout mandible, <b>smaller</b> <b>orbits,</b> massive and almost knobby flanges, and canines that are farther back. The average machairodont had well-developed incisors, but barbourofelids were more extreme.|$|R
5000|$|Distinct from Paraplacodus, {{the skull}} of Cyamodus had a shorter rostrum, a <b>smaller</b> <b>orbit</b> and a larger upper {{temporal}} fenestra that was rimmed by ossifications. The teeth were flat discs, only one tooth appeared on each premaxilla and only two teeth appeared on each maxilla, with the largest teeth on the pterygoid. The quadratojugal joined the squamosal and sealed up the lateral temporal fenestra from the ancestral species (Paraplacodus).|$|R

50|$|There are exoplanets {{that are}} much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, {{and there are also}} exoplanets {{that are much}} further from their star. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 astronomical units (AU), takes 88 days for an <b>orbit,</b> but the <b>smallest</b> known <b>orbits</b> of exoplanets have orbital periods of only a few hours, e.g. Kepler-70b. The Kepler-11 system has five of its planets in <b>smaller</b> <b>orbits</b> than Mercury's. Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit it, but there are exoplanets that are {{thousands}} of AU from their star and take {{tens of thousands of years}} to orbit, e.g. GU Piscium b.|$|R

50|$|Since current {{theories}} {{of star formation}} indicate that stars like these could not form in such close proximity to each other, a favored explanation is {{that there may have}} been a single gaseous disk that forced them into such <b>small</b> <b>orbits</b> within the first 100,000 years of their evolution. The two pairs are currently moving farther apart due to tidal interaction, indicating that they were once even more closely associated than today.|$|R
