The philosophy of early Sartre clarifies on metaphysical ground why humans have to realize themselves in society through <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> and that these roles are not fundamentally different from theatre roles. This article also points out an affinity which Sartre’s philosophy has with the view of social and cultural anthropology on <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> and their influence on this view. It points out the danger which arises from uncritical fulfillment of <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> and shows that Sartre’s early philosophy can lead to free and critical distance from realization of <b>social</b> <b>roles,</b> which prevents individuals from dogmatic fulfillment...|$|R

5|$|Castles {{have played}} an {{important}} military, economic and <b>social</b> <b>role</b> in Great Britain and Ireland since their introduction following the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Although {{a small number of}} castles had been built in England in the 1050s, the Normans began to build motte and bailey and ringworks castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories in England and the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone– with characteristic square keeps– that played both military and political roles. Royal castles were used to control key towns and the economically important forests, while baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates. David I invited Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1170s, under Henry II, castles were established there too.|$|E
5|$|Gumball is a 1983 {{video game}} by Robert Cook and Broderbund {{in which the}} player {{controls}} the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by their color. The player meets the quota of each level to earn their character—a factory worker—a promotion, resulting in a raise in difficulty with more color choices and defective gumballs to exclude. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the game's machine-sorting concept, and Cook, the designer, added the gumball conceit and built the core gameplay within a week. He later returned to add sound, decorative features, and a secret image that was only found three decades after the game's release. Gumball debuted at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show and released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. Reviewers separately noted {{the difficulty of the}} game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the <b>social</b> <b>role</b> of simulating mundane work.

Method: A literature review was carried out aiming to describe which <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> influence the quality of life and which variables have been investigated. Results: We selected 17 studies, mostly from European countries, conducted after 2000. Almost all studies were of the cross-sectional type and assessed outpatient samples. In general, most studies reported a better quality of life associated with a greater number of <b>social</b> <b>roles.</b> The <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> appeared linked to the areas of quality of life and none of the studies used a specific instrument for <b>social</b> <b>roles.</b> Conclusions: The review reveals the necessity for more studies regarding quality of life and <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> in schizophrenia...|$|R

5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her <b>social</b> <b>role</b> and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements.

5|$|The limited {{evidence}} on auxiliary centuriones and decuriones {{is that such}} officers could be directly commissioned as well as promoted from the ranks. Many appear {{to have come from}} provincial aristocracies. Those rising from the ranks could be promotions from the legions {{as well as from the}} regiment's own ranks. In the Julio-Claudian period auxiliary centuriones and decuriones were a roughly equal split between citizens and peregrini, though later citizens became predominant due to the spread of citizenship among military families. Because centuriones and decuriones often rose from the ranks, they have often been compared to warrant officers such as sergeants-major in modern armies. However, centurions' <b>social</b> <b>role</b> was much wider than a modern warrant-officer. In addition to their military duties, centurions performed a wide range of administrative tasks, which was necessary in the absence of an adequate bureaucracy to support provincial governors. They were also relatively wealthy, due to their high salaries (see table above). However, most of the surviving evidence concerns legionary centurions and it is uncertain whether their auxiliary counterparts shared their high status and non-military role.|$|E
5|$|Although {{subject to}} all {{national}} laws and government, the Antakarana are also {{united in their}} recognition of the authority of a king (Ampanjaka) who is the living descendent {{of a line of}} Antankarana royalty going back nearly four centuries. The authority of this king is reaffirmed every five years at the village of Ambatoharaña in a ritual mast-raising ceremony called the tsangantsainy. Although some accounts date the ritual back to the origins of Antankarana kingship, the specific features of the ceremony as practiced today are rooted in historical events of the 19th century. The ceremony includes a pilgrimage to Nosy Mitsio to commemorate the flight of Antankarana refugees to the island in the 1830s to escape the advancing armies of the Kingdom of Imerina and to visit the tombs of ancestors who died there; until recently, it has sometimes also included raising both French and Antankarana banners to honor the 1841 treaty signed with the French. The king is selected by a council of elder {{members of the royal family}} in the ruling line. He is responsible for reciting joro (ancestral invocations) at ceremonies where the ancestors' blessings are requested. Another important <b>social</b> <b>role</b> is that of the Ndriambavibe. The Antankarana community selects a single noble woman to hold this position, which has similar authority and importance to that of the king. She is not his wife; rather, she has a separate leadership role to fulfill. The Antankarana are recognized among Malagasy as one of the few remaining ethnic groups in Madagascar that continues to reassert the ancestral authority of their king through continued practice of traditional kingship rituals.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether social integration, defined as number of <b>social</b> <b>roles,</b> is associated with better pulmonary function in the elderly and which roles are associated with greatest benefit. It also examined pathways that connect social integration to better lung health. Methods: High functioning men (n = 518) and women (n = 629) ages 70 - 79 were recruited {{as part of the}} MacArthur Study of Successful Aging, and data were collected on <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> as well as pulmonary function as assessed by peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Multiple regressions predicting PEFR from the number of <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> controlled for age, sex, race, education, weight, and he ight. Physiological, behavioral, social, and psychological factors were tested as mediators of the association between the number of <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> and PEFR. Results: More <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> were associated with better PEFR. Analysis of specific roles indicated that marriage was the strongest positive correlate of PEFR. However, greater numbers of roles were also associated with better PEFR independent of marriage. Being a relative or friend were each also individually associated with better PEFR. Even so, greater numbers of <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> were associated with better PEFR independent of relative and friend. The data were consistent with greater happiness, not smoking, and more physical activity acting as pathways linking the number of roles to PEFR. Conclusions: Number of <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> is an important correlate of healthy lung function in the elderly. This association may be driven by healthier behaviors and greater feelings of well-being. © 2014 American Psychological Association...|$|R

(Lpo - 94) Democratic education is what the pragmatist John Dewey strongly encourages in his book Democracy and Education, {{which is why he}} stands for the theoretical framework of the concept of democracy in the school context. This study aims to examine whether and if so, the <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> in a classroom can affect students' opportunities for learning. The main research questions asked were: How can the <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> affect students' opportunities for learning in a classroom? How do students perceive that the <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> in the classroom affect their opportunities for learning? This has been investigated by two complementary perspectives.   Partly thru a student perspective to raise the students 'own experiences, and partly from an outside perspective to show how I, as an observer can see that <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> affect students' opportunities for learning. The study encompasses three observation opportunities in a grade three, and six interviews with students from this class. The results of the study showed that <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> have significant impact on individuals' opportunities for learning in the classroom. The study reaches the conclusion that the <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> are not something that is possible to, or even desirable to ignore. However, {{it is important to be}} aware that different <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> in a classroom have different conditions. An education that is guided by democratic values will ensure that all pupils in the widest extent possible are given the same opportunities to learn and develop. ...|$|R

5|$|The rise of Veerashaivaism was revolutionary and {{challenged}} the prevailing Hindu caste system which retained royal support. The <b>social</b> <b>role</b> of women largely depended on their economic status {{and level of}} education in this relatively liberal period. Freedom was more available to women in the royal and affluent urban families. Records describe the participation {{of women in the}} fine arts, such as Chalukya queen Chandala Devi's and Kalachuris of Kalyani queen Sovala Devi's skill in dance and music. The compositions of thirty Vachana women poets included the work of the 12th-century Virashaiva mystic Akka Mahadevi whose devotion to the bhakti movement is well known. Contemporary records indicate some royal women were involved in administrative and martial affairs such as princess Akkadevi, (sister of King Jayasimha II) who fought and defeated rebellious feudals. Inscriptions emphasise public acceptance of widowhood indicating that Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow used to immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre) though present was on a voluntary basis. Ritual deaths to achieve salvation were seen among the Jains who preferred to fast to death (Sallekhana), while people of some other communities chose to jump on spikes (Shoolabrahma) or walking into fire on an eclipse.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we study which {{characteristics}} of combining work and family put people at risk for mental illness. Two alternative perspectives {{on the impact of}} multiple <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> on mental health are tested: the role accumulation perspective and the role strain perspective. Both perspectives are studied with data from a cross-sectional national survey held among a large, representative sample of Dutch people (N = 1008). Multivariate analyses provided support for both perspectives. Having more <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> was related to better mental health. We also found a positive mental health effect of having a full-time job in combination with having children. However, having a partner who contributes less to household duties or having a job with low decision latitude or lower skill discretion was related to mental illness. So, certain aspects of <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> may also threaten people's mental health. Overall, our findings do not support the idea that combining work and family is necessarily a burden and harmful for people's mental health. Whether multiple <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> are a blessing or burden for people's mental health seems to depend on the characteristics of the <b>social</b> <b>roles.</b> © 2007 Elsevier Inc.
