40|$|Aim To do {{in vitro}} test {{to assess the}} {{efficacy}} of hydrophobic dressing Cutimed® Sorbact® to bind multiresistant bacteria that caused wound infection, the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Method This was a cross sectional study that was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, on January 2009. In-vitro testing of <b>sterile</b> hydrophobic <b>dressing</b> to bind microorganisms was conducted by counting MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were bound to 1 square centimetre of single layer <b>sterile</b> hydrophobic <b>dressing</b> (Cutimed® Sorbact®). Every test was done in triplicate at 0. 5, 1, 5, 10, 30 minutes, 1,  2, 3, and 4 hours. To compare the hydrophobic dressing capability to bind microorganisms, in vitro testing of sterile conventional dressing to bind microorganisms on 0. 5 minutes and 2 hours was done. Result The binding capacity of <b>sterile</b> hydrophobic <b>dressing</b> began at 0. 5 minutes and teached a maximum at 2  hours. Compared with conventional <b>dressing,</b> <b>sterile</b> hydrophobic <b>dressing</b> had more binding capability to MRSA and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

An initial curvilinear incision was made across the antecubital fossa and extended downward on the right volar forearm. A fasciotomy was then completed, including release of the bicipital aponeurosis. Finally, careful palpation for any other tight bands was performed. Attention was then turned to the dorsal forearm. A longitudinal incision was made over the mid-dorsal forearm, and a fascial release was performed proximally and distally. The mobile wad was released as well. Copious irrigation was then performed. Tourniquet time totaled 17  min. Simple nylon closure of the incisions was performed, followed by a <b>sterile</b> compressive <b>dressing.</b> There were no noted complications before, during, or after surgery.

This research introduces a novel burn wound dressing that contains silver nanoparticles (SNPs) to treat infection in a 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropane sulfonic acid sodium salt (AMPS-Na(+)) hydrogel. Silver nitrate was dissolved in AMPS-Na(+) solution and then exposed to gamma irradiation to form SNP-infused hydrogels.

All the hydrogels were found to be nontoxic to normal human dermal fibroblast cells. The silver-loaded hydrogels had good inhibitory action against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Results from a pilot study on a porcine burn model showed that the 5 -mM silver hydrogel was efficient at preventing bacterial colonization of wounds, and the results were comparable to the commercially available silver dressings (Acticoat(TM), PolyMem Silver(®)).

40|$|Review of {{clinical}} and operative records of 86 {{patients at the}} Minneapolis VA Medical Center and Mount Sinai Hospital undergoing peritoneovenous (PV) shunt for intractable ascites revealed a subgroup of patients (n = 9) who developed leaking ascites prior to shunting. The etiology of leaking ascites was as follows: 1) ruptured umbilical hernia (UH) (four patients), 2) repeated paracentesis (three patients), and 3) postoperative incisional ascitic fluid leak (two patients). Initial therapy included local <b>sterile</b> compression <b>dressing,</b> intravenous antibiotics, and management of fluid and electrolytes. All nine patients underwent subsequent closure of the fascial defect and PV shunt to prevent reaccumulation of ascites (simultaneous procedures were performed in five patients). No patient developed postoperative septic complications, organ failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, or encephalopathy. There were no early deaths; however, three late deaths (18 months, 2, and 4 years) were due to variceal bleeding and/or liver failure. Ascites was well controlled in seven patients with PV shunt alone, the other two ultimately responding to medical therapy. We conclude that peritoneal fluid leaks can be treated successfully by repairing the fascial defect and placing a PV shunt. In the absence of infected ascites and clinical peritonitis, PV shunt may be performed simultaneously with closure of UH, thus preventing the reaccumulation of ascites during the immediate postoperative period...|$|R

The total numbers of por-tals were 380. No patient was lost to follow-up. There was significant difference between the three groups with regards to post operative swelling and redness: 29 % patients in the suture group had swelling as compared to around 11 % in the two other groups (p = 0. 02); 37 % patients in the suture group and 23 % patients in the steristrips group developed redness while only 9 % patients in the simple dressing group had redness at 4 weeks (p = 0. 004). Patients in the suture group experienced more pain as measured by visual analogue scale; however there was no statisti-cally significant difference (p = 0. 37) in the number of patients who had pain.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{study the}} {{mechanism}} through which vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) induces {{an increase in}} blood flow and reduces oedema on skin wounds. MethodsThirty-two Japanese large-ear white rabbits were used. A round full-thickness skin defect (retaining the perichondrium), 2 cm in diameter, was created on each dorsal ear. The wound on the left ear {{was assigned to the}} experimental group, and the wound on the right ear to the control group. In the experimental group, the <b>sterile</b> foam <b>dressing</b> was trimmed to the appropriate size and geometry for the given wound and placed into the wound defect. The surface of the wound containing the foam dressing was covered with an adhesive drape to create an airtight seal. Afterwards, negative pressures of − 5, − 10, − 15 and − 20 kPa were exerted on the same wound, each lasting for 20 minutes, at intervals of 10 minutes. In the control group, the wound was treated with petrolatum gauze only. At different time points, the microcirculation microscope and image pattern analysis were used to observe the variation in wound microcirculation through a detective window. ResultsIt was found that VAC promoted capillary blood flow velocity, increased capillary calibre and blood volume, stimulated endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis, narrowed endothelial spaces, and restored the integrity of the capillary basement membrane. ConclusionBy increasing capillary calibre and blood volume and by stimulating angiogenesis, VAC could improve blood circulation in wounds.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{majority}} of wound infections after median sternotomy in obese patients are {{triggered by the}} breakdown of skin sutures and subsequent seepage of skin flora. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate negative pressure wound dressing treatment for the prevention of infection. We hypothesized that negative pressure wound dressing treatment for 6 to 7 days applied immediately after skin closure reduces the numbers of wound infections. MethodsIn a prospective study, 150 consecutive obese patients (body mass index ≥  30) with cardiac surgery performed via median sternotomy were analyzed. In the negative pressure wound dressing treatment group (n =  75), a foam dressing (Prevena, KCI, Wiesbaden, Germany) was placed immediately after skin suturing, and negative pressure of − 125 mm Hg was applied for 6 to 7 days. In the control group (n =  75), conventional wound dressings were used. The primary end point was wound infection within 90 days. Mann–Whitney U test and Fisher exact test were used. Freedom from infection was estimated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. ResultsThree of 75 patients (4 %) with continuous negative pressure wound dressing treatment had wound infections compared with 12 of 75 patients (16 %) with conventional <b>sterile</b> wound <b>dressing</b> (P = . 0266; odds ratio, 4. 57; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 23 - 16. 94). Wound infections with Gram-positive skin flora were found in only 1 patient in the negative pressure wound dressing treatment group compared with 10 patients in the control group (P = . 0090; odds ratio, 11. 39; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 42 - 91. 36). ConclusionsNegative pressure wound dressing treatment over clean, closed incisions for the first 6 to 7 postoperative days significantly reduces the incidence of wound infection after median sternotomy in a high-risk group of obese patients...|$|R
