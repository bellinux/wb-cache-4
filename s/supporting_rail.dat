40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study and prepare basic time for piling works by synthetic equations. The time data of 7 work elements of piling works were collected from 10 different construction sites in Phuket Province of Thailand. The synthetic equations were derived with multiple regressions analysis method using statistic software package. These work elements consisted of pile driving work, moving piling rig left or right on <b>supporting</b> <b>rails,</b> moving <b>supporting</b> <b>rails</b> left or right, moving piling rig and <b>supporting</b> <b>rails</b> back or forth, joining of two-piece pile by welding, joining of two-piece pile by steel coupling, and pile driving with pushing post. These synthetic equations were used to determine the basic time, standard time, and productivity values for various types and sizes of square precast concrete pile. The researchers found that these productivity values were reliable compared to general practice, and could be applied in construction planning and scheduling in Phuket province or other area with similar geological conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a solution method for a multiple traveling salesman problem with time window constraints (m-TSPTW). The method {{was developed for}} local truckload pickup and delivery problems such as those <b>supporting</b> <b>rail</b> or maritime intermodal operations but is suitable for application in other problems in which the number of tasks assigned to each server at any time is relatively small. We present a model and describe an iterative solution technique in which explicit time constraints are replaced by binary flow variables. At each iteration {{two versions of the}} problem, one over-constrained and the other under-constrained are solved. The solution to the over-constrained problem provides a feasible solution, while the optimality gap provided by the two solutions informs the decision of whether to continue searching or to implement the best solution found so far. A specific time window partitioning scheme is used to ensure that the cost of solutions found are monotonically non-increasing. The method developed is suitable for real-time or quasi real-time implementation. ...|$|E

30|$|Discrete <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> {{model and}} {{continuous}} <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model are two classical {{models for the}} traditional mechanical analysis of railway track [1, 2]. In the discrete <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model, the stiffness of fastener supporting track is a spring constant, while in the continuous <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model, it is denoted by track modulus, which is calculated with the spring constant divided by the spacing between centers of discrete supports. The stiffness measurement method based on the Winkler elastic foundation model uses track modulus to characterize the overall track stiffness.|$|R
40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus is an {{important}} factor in safety of railway track. This parameter is defined as support force imposing on rail length unit per rail unit displacement in vertical direction. <b>Rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus is important because it affects track performance and maintenance requirements. Both low and large modulus is undesirable. Low modulus of the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> has been shown to cause differential settlement that then increases maintenance needs. On the other hand, higher value of <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> causes axle load to be distributed on fewer sleepers and therefore received dynamic loads for any sleeper and rail-sleeper fastening will be increased. Sandy desert areas are critical regions about the contamination of ballast. In these areas, flowing sand grains influence between ballast aggregates and increase the stiffness of ballast layer and the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus. In this paper, the results of a field investigation about the effect of ballast contamination on the values of the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus in sandy desert areas are presented...|$|R
