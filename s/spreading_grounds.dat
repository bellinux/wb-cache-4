5|$|Below Prado Dam, the Santa Ana River crosses into Orange County, {{and cuts}} between the Santa Ana Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow Santa Ana Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into <b>spreading</b> <b>grounds</b> for groundwater recharge of the north Orange County aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering Santa Ana. After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of Santa Ana and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of Santa Ana River County Beach.|$|E

The method has been verified using centrifuge data, where soil liquefaction has been observed in laterally <b>spreading</b> <b>ground.</b> It is demonstrated that the new method gives good estimate of pile behaviour, despite its relative simplicity...|$|R

40|$|The El Rio <b>Spreading</b> <b>Grounds,</b> {{an area of}} {{artificial}} recharge, lies within a regional groundwater depression. It consists of ten small ponds surrounded by eight production wells. A deliberate tracer experiment using sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) was conducted to determine ground water flow. The tracer was continuously injected into one pond for one week prior to a ~ 50 day period of no recharge. Tracer breakthrough curves from the production wells indicate that the plume remained near (within 500 m) the injection site during the 18 month experiment. Its movement was influenced {{by a number of}} factors. First, variable groundwater production in the production wells cause frequent changes in the water level, and thus, rates and direction of the plume flow respond to local groundwater cones of depression. Second, additional recharge events, which were free of tracer, create groundwater mounds that block the transport of the tracer to specific production wells. The nearly instantaneous arrival of the tracer at El Rio # 6, suggests that water recharge rapidly through the local high permeable beds...|$|E

Noble gas concentrations in the groundwater were greater than in surface water due to excess air formation showing that trapped air exists below the pond. Breakthrough curves of SF 6 and 3 He at two nearby production wells were very similar and suggest that nonequilibrium gas transfer was occurring between the percolating water and the trapped air. At one well screened between 50 and 90 m below ground, both tracers were detected after 5 days and reached a maximum at ∼ 24 days. Despite the potential dilution caused by mixing within the production well, the maximum concentration was ∼ 25 % of the mean pond concentration. More than 50 % of the SF 6 recharged was recovered by the production wells during the 18 month long experiment. Our results demonstrate that at artificial recharge sites with high infiltration rates and moderately deep water tables, transport times between recharge locations and wells determined with gas tracer experiments are reliable. © 2005 American Chemical Society...|$|E

40|$|Access {{to water}} from San Antonio Creek was {{critical}} in Claremont’s growth {{from a small}} stop on the Santa Fe Railroad to an agricultural powerhouse and an elite college town. While Claremont has sought to distinguish itself from surrounding communities {{since its founding in}} 1882, the innovative Pomona Valley Protective Association (PVPA) aligned Claremont with the City of Pomona and its other neighbors in a scheme to conserve the Creek’s resources {{at the turn of the}} century. Organized around the discovery of local confined aquifers and the development of a strategy to recharge them with water from the San Antonio Creek, the Association was a contradictory moment of cooperation in an otherwise highly contentious zero-sum game of water rights politics. As conflicts wore on, the PVPA quietly orchestrated the purchase of large tracts of land in the San Antonio Creekbed, where the construction of diversion dams and <b>spreading</b> <b>grounds</b> served dual purposes of water conservation and flood control. As dam building in the Creekbed continued, large tracts of the previously undevelopable Wash were transferred to the aggregate mining institutions that gouged the area’s many gravel pits. This thesis uses the story of the PVPA and the contemporary example of the Claremont University Consortium Gravel Pit to explore the context of development in the San Antonio Creek Wash. Understanding the political and social contexts of the gravel quarry problem reveals possibilities for a more integrative, conscious, and sustainable approach to improving the former gravel quarries that currently occupy the Wash landscape...|$|E

Second, additional recharge events, which were free of tracer, create groundwater mounds that block the transport of the tracer to specific production wells. Noble gas concentrations in the groundwater were much higher than in the pond due to the dissolution of trapped air. However, significant retardation (absolute and relative) of the gas tracers was not detected. Breakthrough curves of SF 6 and 3 He at two nearby production wells (within ~ 10 m of the pond) were very similar and suggest that nonequilibrium gas transfer was occurring between the percolating water and trapped air.
