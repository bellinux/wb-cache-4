50|$|The school {{building}} is a simple structure of timber with a corrugated iron hipped roof truncated where a skillion-roofed verandah has been added on its western side. The building sits on low timber stumps and a small set of stairs {{on the eastern side}} gains entrance to the classroom. The walls are timber tongue-and-groove vertical joints and the schoolroom has <b>sliding</b> 6 <b>pane</b> <b>windows</b> on three walls. The room has a coved timber ceiling with a central lattice vent and a large timber support beam across the width of the room. The room contains some of its original desks and chairs dating from 1946 as well as other original pieces such as framed embroidery by former students.|$|R

First serial trolley cars differed from later releases. Until 1974, had an angular wheel arches, and not circular. The first batch of trolleybuses raised outdated engine DC-207G, which in 1973 was replaced by the DC-210 110 kW. Suspension on the first ZiU-682B was pneumatic, with torque rods as guiding elements, later became pnevmoressornoy. Rear funded playground had a reduced level of the floor, which reduced the number of steps one at the back door and to facilitate loading wheelchairs and prams and large items. However, this [...] "advantage" [...] was leveled by a high handrail on the steps of separating the rear and middle doors. Transition from high floor in the cabin to lower smoothly carried out in the aisle between the rear wheel arches, which caused inconvenience to passengers at peak hours (especially in winter), standing on an icy downhill [...] "hill." [...] In 1991, developers have replaced high-speed separator handrail attached to the door, but by this time all storage sites were at three stages from sidewalk level. For natural ventilation the roof of the cabin was equipped with four ceiling hatches, each equipped with a <b>sliding</b> side <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b> Currently, the only instance of ZIU-9B is preserved and operated in the linear regime in the city of Zaporozhye and has the side number 562.|$|R

The data arrived are large in amount limitless and high rate with time impractical to stock, excavating and testimony at identical measure of time to retrieve intelligence. <b>Sliding</b> <b>window</b> model utilized for frequent pattern mining data stream mining emphasis on recent data and minimum space consumed.
