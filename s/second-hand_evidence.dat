60|$|It is a {{singular}} fact, {{that in all}} our accounts of cannibal tribes we have seldom received the testimony of an eye-witness to the revolting practice. The horrible conclusion has almost always been derived from the <b>second-hand</b> <b>evidence</b> of Europeans, or else from the admissions of the savages themselves, after they have in some degree become civilized. The Polynesians {{are aware of the}} detestation in which Europeans hold this custom, and therefore invariably deny its existence, and, with the craft peculiar to savages, endeavour to conceal every trace of it.|$|E
50|$|For many years, {{this was}} the only account of the authors' identities, but al-Tawhīdī's {{comments}} were <b>second-hand</b> <b>evidence</b> and so unsatisfactory; further, the account is incomplete, as Abu Hayyan mentions that there were others besides these 4.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAd hoc {{networks}} operate over open {{environments and}} are hence {{vulnerable to a}} large body of threats. To tackle this issue, we propose a distributed, signature-based anomaly detector that evaluates the trustworthiness of others so as to secure such a distributed detection. Contrary to existing detectors that passively observe packets, our detector analyses logs so as to identify patterns of misuse and proactively collaborate with others to gather additional evidences. As a result, no change is requested in the implementation of the node. The main challenge stems from difficulty involved in stating the occurrence of an attack based on <b>second-hands</b> <b>evidences</b> that may come from colluding attacker (s). To tackle this issue, we propose an entropy-based trust system that evaluates the trustworthiness of the nodes that provide the evidences. We further introduce a novel indicator which measures the level of confidence in the detection. Preliminary evaluations of the trust system along with the confidence measure have been conducted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cognitive {{radio is}} a {{promising}} solution for spectrum scarcities in the future. Secondary users (SUs) adopt cooperative sensing {{to learn the}} primary user’s (PU’s) occupancy activity. This paper develops a trust-based data aggregation scheme to cope with malicious SU attack in cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks. The proposed scheme combines the first-hand and <b>second-hand</b> sensing <b>evidence</b> to guarantee the overall performance and adopts a static game model to discourage malicious SUs from reporting fake detection parameters. Both theoretical and simulation {{results show that the}} proposed scheme outperforms the traditional majority aggregation scheme despite a high percentage of malicious node population and can effectively distinguish malicious nodes from normal nodes by their reputation scores. Index Terms—Cognitive radio networks, cooperative spectrum sensing, trust, reputation, security, mechanism design. I...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTrust has {{attracted}} extensive attention in social science {{and computer science}} {{as a solution to}} enhance the security of the system. This paper proposes a trust evaluation model based on D-S evidence theory and sliding windows for cloud computing. The timeliness of the interaction evidence as the first-hand evidence is reflected by introducing sliding windows. The direct trust of entities is computed based on the interaction evidence by D-S evidence theory. The conflict of the recommendation trust as the <b>second-hand</b> <b>evidence</b> is eliminated with a help of an improved fusion approach as far as possible. Finally, the combination of the recommendation trust exposes the credibility of entities. Experimental results show that the proposed model is effective and extensible...|$|E
