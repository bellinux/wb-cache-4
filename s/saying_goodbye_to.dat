However, she is concerned to find that others apparently cannot see the ghosts. She then begins to suspect that Miles and Flora, having been groomed by and involved {{in the activities of}} Quint and Jessel, may be deliberately seeking to bring the pair back. She resolves to leave Bly, but, when <b>saying</b> <b>goodbye</b> <b>to</b> Miles, learns that he, too, sees the figures. Minutes after leaving, she asks to be taken back. Later, Ann panics, believing Miles and Flora to have left the house. She finds them by the lake, but they are playing roughly; when Miles pushes Flora's head under the water, Ann sees the pair as Quint and Jessel.

Inayat Khan had found <b>saying</b> <b>goodbye</b> <b>to</b> her widowed mother the most painful thing she had ever had to do, she said. As Vera had advised her, she had told her mother only half the truth: she had said she was going abroad, but to Africa, and she had found maintaining the deception cruel.|$|E

25|$|Dongalor and his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) try {{to extract}} tears from the kidnapped women by torturing them, {{whipping}} them and peeling onions {{in front of}} them, to no avail. Dongalor also tries staging a tragic play with a boy <b>saying</b> <b>goodbye</b> <b>to</b> his dog because his father cannot afford the pet due {{to the death of}} his mother, but the Pagan women are unmoved, although Dongalor cries like a baby. Meanwhile, Longshaft tells Kröd and his three friends to go to the Hessemeel Mountains, through the Forest of Certain Death, and light a pyre {{at the top of a}} tower to warn the other freedom fighters about the pending danger. The foursome go through the forest, where they find a strong man has been savagely killed. They are approached by three beautiful wenches, who insist a group of banshees just tried to kill them. When they seek romance from the group, the homosexual Bruce is the only one who is skeptical, until the wenches bring a gay man from the forest for him.

25|$|Nilsen {{confirmed}} that on four occasions, he had removed the accumulated bodies from beneath his floorboards and dissected the remains, and on {{three of these}} occasions, he had then disposed of the accumulated remains upon an assembled bonfire. On more than one occasion, he had removed the internal organs from the victims' bodies and placed them in bags, which he then typically dumped behind a fence to be eaten by wildlife. All {{the bodies of the}} victims killed at Melrose Avenue would be dismembered after several weeks or months of internment beneath the floorboards and Nilsen recalled that the putrefaction of these victims' bodies would make this task exceedingly vile; he recalled having to fortify his nerves with whisky and his having to grab handfuls of salt with which to brush aside maggots from the remains. Often, he would vomit as he dissected the bodies, before wrapping the dismembered limbs inside plastic bags and carrying the remains to the bonfires. Nonetheless, immediately prior to his dissecting the victims' bodies, Nilsen would engage in masturbation as he knelt or sat alongside the corpse. This, he stated, was his symbolic gesture of <b>saying</b> <b>goodbye</b> <b>to</b> his victims.|$|E

500|$|In earlier {{drafts of}} the episode, {{the idea of}} Phoebe keeping one of the babies was more extreme.

Heidi Beck, a professional nurse was retained; she acquired a stop watch for every minute the baby was under the light.
