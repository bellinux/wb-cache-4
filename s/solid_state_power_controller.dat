40|$|Electrical {{power demand}} in {{aircraft}} has grown significantly {{over the last}} century, and this trend continues with the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) and All Electric Aircraft (AEA) concepts. Higher voltages such as 270 VDC are required to deliver additional power to loads and to optimise aircraft mass. Increased voltages inflict more stress on the Electrical Wiring Interconnect System (EWIS) and increase the impact of series arc faults caused by wiring defects. <b>Solid</b> <b>State</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Controllers</b> (SSPCs) are used to provide fast protection in high voltage distribution systems. The aim of this work is the characterisation, modelling, simulation and detection of series arc faults in 28 VDC and 270 VDC electrical power distribution systems featuring SSPCs. The majority of passive detection schemes in the literature were designed based on empirical data rather than well characterised electric arc parameters, and thus nuisance trips are unavoidable.

5000|$|Hybrid bass {{amplifier}} heads typically pair a tube preamplifier with a solid-state power amplifier. This {{provides the}} {{player with the}} best elements of both amplifier technology. The tube preamp gives the player the ability to obtain tube amplifier tone, which tube enthusiasts state is [...] "warmer" [...] than a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> (transistor) preamp. As well, tube users state that tube preamps have a more pleasing-sounding, natural tone when the preamp's volume is pushed up so high that the bass signal becomes overdriven; in contrast, a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> preamp that is pushed {{to the point of}} signal [...] "clipping" [...] can be harsh-sounding. Some hybrid amp heads have a bypass switch, so that the tube preamp can be bypassed, if the tube breaks or develops a technical problem. The tube preamplified signal in a hybrid amplifier head is then sent to a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> amplifier.
