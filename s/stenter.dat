50|$|Cloth is {{prepared}} by washing and bleaching. For a coloured ground {{it is then}} dyed. The cloth has always to be brushed, to free it from loose nap, flocks and dust that it picks up whilst stored. Frequently, too, {{it has to be}} sheared by being passed over rapidly revolving knives arranged spirally round an axle, which rapidly and effectually cuts off all filaments and knots, leaving the cloth perfectly smooth and clean and in a condition fit to receive impressions of the most delicate engraving. Some fabrics require very careful stretching and straightening on a <b>stenter</b> before they are wound around hollow wooden or iron centers into rolls of convenient size for mounting on the printing machines.|$|E
50|$|Cutting was {{one part}} of the process. The yarn was sized and the cloth was woven—there would be a high number of weft threads to warp. The ridges were {{manually}} cut, and the cloth sent to be finished. It was scoured to remove the size, and brushed to raise the nap. This was then singed over a gas flame, then bleached and or dyed. It was brushed again. It was now <b>stentered</b> to pull it out to the standard width. The cloth was woven at 31 or 32 inches and during processing has shrunk to 27 inches. <b>Stentering</b> would stabilise the width to 28 inches. The back of the cloth would now be filled to give it stiffness. This could be with a glue based mixture that could be formed from boiled bones. Each manufacturer had their own techniques. The cloth was now ready to be taken to the warehouse to be sold.|$|R

40|$|Printed {{electronics}} {{represent an}} alternative {{solution for the}} manufacturing of low-temperature and large area flexible electronics. The use of inkjet printing is showing major advantages {{when compared to other}} established printing technologies such as gravure, screen or offset printing, allowing the reduction of manufacturing costs due to its efficient material usage and the direct-writing approach without requirement of any masks. However, several technological restrictions for printed electronics can hinder its application potential, e. g. the device stability under atmospheric or even more stringent conditions. Here, we study the influence of specific mechanical, chemical, and temperature treatments usually appearing in manufacturing processes for textiles on the electrical performance of all-inkjet-printed organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). Therefore, OTFTs where manufactured with silver electrodes, a UV curable dielectric, and 6, 13 -bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentance (TIPS-pentacene) as the active semiconductor layer. All the layers were deposited using inkjet printing. After electrical characterization of the printed OTFTs, a simple encapsulation method was applied followed by the degradation study allowing a comparison of the electrical performance of treated and not treated OTFTs. Industrial calendering, dyeing, washing and <b>stentering</b> were selected as typical textile processes and treatment methods for the printed OTFTs. It is shown that the all-inkjet-printed OTFTs fabricated in this work are functional after their submission to the textiles processes but with degradation in the electrical performance, exhibiting higher degradation in the OTFTs with shorter channel lengths (L = 10 μm) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main object}} of this thesis was {{the study of}} {{structural}} variations in polyester fibres when heat set, through the determination of its fine structural parameters. The materials employed were fabric samples in grey state and scoured which were further on heat set in an industrial <b>stenter</b> under twelve different industrial conditions of temperature, time and overfeed. Three types of techniques were employed: Exclusion Chromatography, Density Gradient Column, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Critical Dissolution Time, Contraction Force, Thermomechanical Analysis and Iodine Sorption...|$|E

40|$|Shirley Dyeing and Finishing Services of HydE UK, {{which is}} part of the British Textile Technology Group (BTTG), {{demonstrated}} that suction slot dewatering equipment installed in a textiles finishing plant can save energy and increase productivity. The commercial work carried out at Shirley Towers is typical of the many fabric drying operations which use stenters throughout the country. In common with many textile finishing sites, the drying operation is a production bottleneck. The Shirley Towers management decided that the most cost-effective way to overcome this problem and increase production capacity was to improve mechanical dewatering, before <b>stenter</b> drying, by retrofitting a suction slot. The extra productivity resulting from this gave a payback period of three months. ...|$|E
40|$|Lace # 1 {{illustrates}} {{the result of}} my design research investigation into a CAD/CAM industrial woven jacquard textile design method. It explores the ability to completely control warp and weft threads movement away from the usual 90 -degree positions, whilst being woven, using an industrial production method and not requiring post weaving manual manipulation. The resultant design creates a ‘lace’ effect without relying on a specialist lace loom and can be woven on a standard industrial jacquard loom. This design and subsequent developments have been developed not to replicate existing fabric methods but are an innovative design method in its own right. This was a design technical construction project, therefore the final end use and meaning of the design is constituted not by the designer, but by the consumer further down the supply chain. Lace # 1 is a development on from own previous research question investigating ‘on-loom’ finishing effects within the industrial woven jacquard process. The resultant prototypes require only scouring and <b>stentering</b> with no additional finishing processes such as pleating or embroidery. The outcomes of my research have a dual focus: creative and innovative fabrics; and {{a new approach to}} the standard industrial production method. The research includes investigation of CAD/CAM, yarn and woven structure innovation to achieve these ’on loom’ effects. Both my research and professional practice require a keen awareness of new developments in yarn, fabric and structural processes...|$|R
40|$|In nylon {{finishing}} a final step is a thermal treatment to fix auxiliary chemicals to fibers, to remove volatile compounds and monomers and to relax the textile structure. For this purpose <b>stenters</b> with natural gas burners are applied. The hot exhaust air contains monomers, solvents, lubricants and specific textile auxiliary chemicals {{that have to}} be removed with large amounts of fresh or process water by exhaust air washers. To reduce water costs, process-integrated water treatment and recycling processes are demanded. Annular photoreactors with low and middle-pressure mercury arc lamps and a solar non concentrating tubular receiver reactor have been applied to examine the treatment of exhaust air washer liquor and its components in the laboratory and up to semi-technical scale. The application of sole UV radiation, the combination of UV radiation with oxidants, semiconductor photocatalysts and the light enhanced Fenton reaction were compared. The photo Fenton conditions were optimized in respect of throughput and hydrogen peroxide consumption. The degradation pathway of epsilon-caprolactam (the main constituent of the air washer liquor) was analyzed by ion chromatography and HPLC-MS. The overall degradation was controlled by total organic carbon analysis. Intermediates like epsilon-amino capronic acid, N-hydroxy-epsilon-caprolactam, epsilon-nitroso capronic acid have been confirmed as initial intermediates also like acetate, oxalate and formiate as intermediates before complete mineralization. In comparison to photolytic hydrogen peroxide oxidation, light enhanced Fenton turned out to be much faster and to consume lower amounts of hydrogen peroxide. It could be demonstrated that the iron catalyst can be recycled with minor activity losses with middle-pressure mercury arc lamps. Photochemically enhanced Fenton reaction has proved to be most effective with respect to the consumption of time, energy and chemicals for the application in exhaust air treatment of nylon finishing. ...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{fabric is}} {{heat-treated}} using a <b>stenter</b> machine {{in order to}} dry and fix its shape. It is important to shape before the heat treatment because {{it is difficult to}} revert back once the fabric is formed. To produce the product of right shape, camera type weft straightener has been applied recently to capture and process fabric images quickly. It is more powerful in determining the final textile quality rather than photo-sensor. Positioning in front of a <b>stenter</b> machine, weft straightener helps to spread fabric evenly and control the angle between warp and weft constantly as right angle by handling skew and bow rollers. To process this tricky procedure, the structural analysis should be carried out in advance, based on which, its control technology can be drawn. A structural analysis is to figure out the specific contact/slippage characteristics between fabric and roller. We already examined the applicability of camera type weft straightener to plain weave fabric and found its possibility and the specific working condition of machine and rollers. In this research, we aimed to explore another applicability of camera type weft straightener. Namely, we tried to figure out camera type weft straightener can be used for fabrics. To find out the optimum condition, we increased the number of rollers. The analysis is done by ANSYS software using Finite Element Analysis method. The control function is demonstrated by experiment. In conclusion, the structural analysis of weft straightener is done to identify a specific characteristic between roller and fabrics. The control of skew and bow roller is done to decrease the error of the angle between warp and weft. Finally, it is proved that camera type straightener can also be used for the special fabrics...|$|E
40|$|The {{finishing}} {{process is a}} major energy-consuming procedure in the textile industry because it uses {{a large amount of}} thermal energy in the form of steam and heat. This study conducts energetic and exergetic analyses on the {{finishing process}} in cotton textile production based on actual operational data. Energy and exergy efficiencies are determined to assess their performance and formulate strategies for improvements. The lowest energy and exergy efficiencies are obtained in singeing. The largest irreversibility is associated with the hot oil boiler, followed by washing in mercerising and washing II in desizing. The greatest energy losses are linked to washing in mercerising and <b>stenter.</b> As such, immediate efforts to improve the process should be focused on these procedures. Most of the thermal energy consumed in the process ends up as waste heat. Technologies of reusing waste heat for water heating should, therefore, be developed...|$|E
40|$|Quality is the watchword of {{any type}} of business. A product without quality leads to lack of {{customer}} satisfaction and ultimately to loss. This is true in case of textile industries also. In textile industries, quality maintenance {{is one of the}} major problems for fabric manufacturers. Currently in indigenous small scale textile industries manual or semi- automatic processes are being carried out. The fabric obtained from such processes lacks consistency in quality, moreover these industries have semi- skilled or unskilled labors, therefore stringent supervision is required. Normal automation solutions for such industries will be unaffordable. Therefore it is required to provide economical, reliable and robust automation solution to such industries. This paper addresses the need of factory automation within the scope of machine control for small scale textile industries. The project presents the design of LabVIEW based SCADA system for centralized control. It makes use of PLC as a field controller to operate the prototype design of <b>Stenter</b> Machine, widely used in textile industries. LabVIEW, which is a commonly accepted graphical user interface environment, also provides HMI front end. The PLC controller and the LabVIEW based SCADA are communicating through the RS- 232 link. The control system is flexible and modular. Due to the intuitive programming of LabVIEW, this system is cost efficient and reliable solution for automation of small scale textile industries...|$|E
