5|$|In the First World War, {{horses were}} used in combat for cavalry charges, and they {{remained}} the best means for moving scouts, messengers, supply wagons, ambulances, and artillery quickly on the battlefield; the horse could refuel itself to some extent by grazing, and could cope with terrain which was beyond machines of the time. However, this war had a devastating effect on the British horse population. As thousands of animals were drafted for the war effort, some breeds were so reduced in number {{that they were in}} danger of disappearing. Many breeds were <b>saved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dedicated efforts of a few breeders who formed breed societies, tracking down remaining animals and registering them.|$|E
5|$|In those years, Gaddafi's support {{had been}} mostly moral, {{with only a}} limited supply of weapons.

Armed with these weapons, the FAP attacked in June the Chadian Armed Forces' (FAT) strongholds of Bardaï and Zouar in Tibesti and of Ounianga Kébir in Borkou. Oueddei took full control of the Tibesti with this attack after Bardaï, besieged since 22 June, surrendered on 4 July, while Zouar was evacuated. The FAT lost 300 men, and piles of military supplies fell {{into the hands of}} the rebels.

Today, the breed is still held in high regard throughout the Middle East and were hunting dogs for nobles and rulers around the region. They are considered clean by the Bedouins, and are allowed to be in women's quarters, while other dogs must be kept outside.|$|E

5|$|The French Spaniel (Epagneul Français) is a {{breed of}} dog of the Spaniel-like setter. It was {{developed}} in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century.

One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white coat with brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia. The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service, the first step to full recognition.|$|E
