Although {{the aim of}} the present study was to examine Shedler and Block’s (1990) provocative claims that adolescent substance experimentation is associated with the healthiest psychological functioning while adolescent abstention and frequent use are both associated with poorer psychological functioning, this study extended their findings and helped fill in existing gaps in the extant literature. Utilizing a large community sample of male and female twins assessed at ages 11, 14, 18, and 21, this study was the first to incorporate all substances—tobacco, alcohol, and drugs—into an a priori <b>substance</b> <b>classification</b> scheme across time (i. e., created abstainer, experimenter, regular user and problem user classifications at ages 11, 14, and 18). Dimensional models of childhood and adolescent personality were used to examine the relations between both antecedent and concurrent personality characteristics and adolescent substance use profiles. Emerging adult outcomes at age 21 were assessed across multiple developmental domains. The role of developmental timing in the relations between substance use profiles and emerging adult outcomes was also investigated. The results for personality suggest that age 18 experimenters tend to have the most adaptive matrix of personality characteristics and problem users the least. Both abstainers and regular users at age 18 had personality characteristics of concern. The results for emerging adult outcomes suggest that substance use profiles have long-term developmental significance. Patterns emerged for each profile that highlighted the importance of examining outcomes across developmental domains while taking into account the role of timing. Despite garnering a substantive amount of support for Shelder and Block’s findings, any substance use was associated with poor emerging adult educational outcomes...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for real time {{classification}} of volatile chemical substance traces is presented. The method {{is based on}} electrochemical signals of an array of semiconductor gas sensors. In these sensor signals characteristic patterns of different substances are hidden. There are non-linear correlative relationships between the measured sensor signals and the chemical substances which are treated using two methods derived from statistical learning theory (Support Vector Machine - SVM, Maximum Likelihood Estimation - MLE) {{for the detection of}} the substance characteristics in the sensor signals. A key criterion for the presented pattern recognition is a newly developed type of features, which is specially adapted to the low frequency signals of semiconductor sensors. The presented features are based on the evaluation of the range of the transient response in the sensor signals in the frequency domain. To derive the new features, both real measurement data and synthetic generated signals were used. In the experiments the focus was set on the creation of reproducible sensor signals to get characteristic signal patterns. Synthetic signals were derived from a Gaussian Plume Model. With the new features, training data sets were calculated using the classification methods SVM and MLE. With these training data sets new sensor measurements may be assigned to the substances which are to be sought. The advantage of the presented method is that no feature reduction is needed and no loss of information occurs in the learning process. The classification results based on the new features have been compared with the classification based on a conventional method for feature extraction. It was proved that the recognition rate of the substances used with the new feature type is higher. The <b>substance</b> <b>classification</b> is primarily limited by the sensitivity of the semiconductor sensors, because sufficiently large sensor signals must have been provided to obtain appropriate substance patterns. At the present stage of development the method presented is suitable for the classification of substance groups, such as nitro aromatics or alcohols, but not for specific substances...|$|E

40|$|Vibrational {{spectroscopy}} {{provides a}} great deal of information regarding the chemical properties of a substance; however spectral features associated with different chemical substances are not always obvious. Through the aid of advanced computer algorithms, pattern recognition techniques and chemometric models, complex and subtle relationships between a material and its spectrum can be identified and utilized to draw useful conclusions. The ability of computers to make inferences from spectral information was demonstrated in several applications. ^ Spectral imaging provides a substantial amount of data, with each pixel of an image representing a spectrum. For images of chemical mixtures, spectra of pure components can be discovered through the use of chemometric tools. Using such methods, spectral images can be exploited to obtain chemical maps, indicating the spatial locations of certain chemical substances. Artificial differences in the form of noise and background interference make it difficult to accurately compare the contents of each pixel. Background removal and noise reduction techniques minimized these undesirable effects, increasing the clarity of the image and each individual spectrum. This was shown using several images of biological samples, including certain types of bacteria. ^ Bacillus anthracis, a specific type of bacteria, has been a recent concern as a result of Anthrax and the threat of bioterrorism. Not surprisingly, bacteria samples of other species of Bacillus have similar chemical properties as is evident in their infrared spectra. Spectroscopy allows for the analysis of the total cellular composition of bacterial samples. The power to distinguish between relatively less harmful genera and species of bacteria suggests the potential to detect Anthracis and other hazardous biological <b>substances.</b> <b>Classification</b> on the genus and species level was demonstrated using statistical models and artificial neural networks. ^ Artificial neural networks (ANN) are models that mimic neurons in the brain. They have the capability to realize complex, nonlinear relationships. A major disadvantage to ANNs is that the reasoning behind their results is not intuitive, giving it a 2 ̆ 2 black box 2 ̆ 2 quality. ANNs were employed to act as expert systems in the interpretation of both infrared and Raman spectra. Spectral features correspond to the presence of different bonds in a chemical 2 ̆ 7 s structure. Further analysis of the ANNs resulted in an explanation to what was learned, creating factors that illustrated the characteristic spectral trends associated with different functional groups. Bayes theorem was applied to calculate a probability for each decision. ...|$|R

An increasing number of clinical complications due to adhesions have been detected such as small bowel obstructions, female infertility, and pain. Postoperative adhesions also form in pleura and pericardium after thoracic surgery. Complications include risk of bleeding, organ perforation and prolonged surgery, both in the thorax and abdomen, during reoperations. Previous reports have shown increased healthcare expenditures due to complications of abdominal adhesions. Several prophylactic anti-adhesion devices exist on the market, but none of them are sufficient in every aspect, such as being able to be used during abdominal infections, bleeding and in case of an intestinal anastomosis. The use of two differently charged polypeptides covering the peritoneal wounds during surgery has, in previous studies, shown promising anti-adhesion effects. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the polypeptides in any way affected different important healing aspects of the peritoneum and if the polypeptides may be administered as a spray in an animal study (I). Furthermore, the aim was to elucidate if the administered polypeptides affected important aspects of the healing process during an extended time dynamic pattern (II). It was also investigated whether the polypeptides reduced adhesions after adhesiolysis in the abdomen (III) and pleura (IV), and if there was an impact on peritoneal/pleural healing. In order to investigate the impact of polypeptides, an in vitro cell model was set up (V). A significant decrease in adhesions was seen both in the abdomen and pleura using the polypeptides. A significant decrease in adhesion reformation was seen after adhesiolysis and polypeptide administration. Despite some variation, no significant impact on key parameters of peritoneal and pleural resolving processes were seen after administration of the polypeptides. It was feasible to administer the polypeptides with a spray atomizer. Cell proliferation was decreased when higher concentrations of the polypeptides were administered, indicating a dose response relationship relying on the configuration and amount of charges of the polypeptides. In conclusion, the use of the two differently charged polypeptides to prevent abdominal and pleural adhesions was feasible, reducing adhesions after primary surgery and relaparotomy, without affecting key parameters of the resolving process investigated.

40|$|International audienceThe new European {{regulation}} of chemicals REACH aiming {{to reinforce the}} control of risks from chemicals in Europe entered into force in 2007. It may require the reassessment of hazardous properties for up to 140000 substances. However, the complete experimental characterization of (eco) toxicological and physico-chemical properties is time-consuming, costly and sometimes not feasible at the R&D stage. Therefore, the development of validated alternative methods for assessing hazardous properties of chemicals is promoted in REACH. Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR), already used extensively in biological and toxicological applications to reduce unnecessary animal testing, are now also developed to predict physico-chemical properties. The present work focuses on the development and validation of QSPR models to predict the impact sensitivity of potentially explosive molecules (nitroaromatics, nitroaliphatics and nitramines, [...] .). To set up appropriate relationships between different molecular descriptors of these compounds and their impact sensitivity, an original approach associating the QSPR method to quantum chemical calculations was developed. More than 300 molecular descriptors (constitutional, topological, geometrical, quantum chemical) were calculated using CodessaPro software from calculated molecular structures, optimized with the Density Functional Theory (DFT) in GaussianO 3 package. These descriptors were integrated into statistical multilinear regressions to link them quantitatively to the experimental impact sensitivity property. Projection and classification methods (PCA, PLS, decision trees) were also used, notably {{for the development of}} qualitative models. When enough experimental data became available, models were developed on a training dataset and were validated according to the OECD principles for the use ofQSPRs in a regulatory context. Once validated, models are expected to be integrated into a global tool to estimate explosibility hazards of <b>substances</b> (for <b>classification</b> purposes) and the need for further experimental testin...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{evaluation}} of the explosibility of chemical substances essentially relies {{on the use of}} experimental tests according to international regulatory schemes (UN Manual of Tests and Criteria of the Recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods, regulation (EC) N° 440 / 2008). The recent evolution of the European regulatory framework related to chemicals (REACH, CLP) implies a quantity of works incompatible with a complete systematic experimental characterization of hazardous properties (for reason of time and cost). For example, more than 140 000 existing substances could be under concern in the registration process of REACH. Moreover, the explosive intrinsic property of a substance ranks at the top of physico-chemical hazards that may be feared from the use of a given chemical. So, the development of methods allowing the identification of this hazardous property on the basis of chemical structures is of great interest not only for existing substances but also at the R&D stage in the development of new products. For these reasons, INERIS has been developing for several years predictive models (alternative or complementary to experimental approaches) for the {{evaluation of}} the explosive properties of hazardous substances and in particular for nitro compounds. The development of these predictive models lies on an original method combining the statistical tools used in quantitative structure property relationship method (QSPR), i. e. multilinear regressions, with quantum chemical calculations. Moreover, a strong validation process ensures the reliability of models in terms of fitting, robustness, predictive power and definition of the domain of applicability, according to the requirements of OECD for use in regulatory framework. Recent QSPR models developed for explosive properties (e. g. heat of decomposition and impact sensitivity) of nitro compounds (e. g. nitroaliphatics, nitroaromatics, nitramines) taking into account their decompositon process are presented. Once validated, models are expected to be used into a global process to estimate explosibility hazards of <b>substances</b> (for <b>classification</b> purposes) and the need for further experimental testing. They can also be used as tools for early identification of potential hazards in the development of new chemical compositions or in substitution studies...|$|R
40|$|Acute oral {{toxicity}} {{is currently}} being assessed by a suite of refinement test methods based on the traditional LD 50 lethality test and is, besides skin sensitisation, the only remaining animal test required under REACH Annex VII. In view of assessing the use of alternatives for this health endpoint, EURL ECVAM conducted {{a study on the}} 3 T 3 Neutral Red Uptake cytotoxicity test method addressing the method's capacity to support specifically the identification <b>substances</b> not requiring <b>classification</b> as acute toxicants. Following independent scientific peer review of this study by EURL ECVAM's scientific advisory committee (ESAC) and having considered input from regulators, stakeholders, international partners and the general public, EURL ECVAM concludes that the 3 T 3 NRU test method may prove a valuable component of a WoE or ITS approach for supporting hazard identification and safety assessment in agreement with the EU CLP Regulation and international regulatory schemes implementing the upper threshold of UN GHS Category 4 as the cut-off for non-classification of substances. In particular, data from the 3 T 3 NRU assay may constitute an information source within a WoE approach under the provisions of the REACH regulation (Annex XI, 1. 2) potentially supporting conclusions on absence of acute oral toxicity of industrial chemicals.
