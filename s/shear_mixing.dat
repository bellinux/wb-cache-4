The mechanism for this is that under cutting, shear bands are formed within which the nano-precipitates of REM are <b>shear</b> <b>mixed.</b> This lowers the melting point such that the mechanism of deformation changes from dislocation mechanism to localised amorphisation and shear softening. The material then fractures along the thin, amorphous shear-band. Outside the shear band, the REM remains as precipitates.

5000|$|The {{successful}} {{mixing of}} powder {{is more difficult}} than mixing liquid, as perfect homogeneity is difficult to achieve. A further problem is the inherent cohesiveness and resistance to movement between the individual particles. The process is further complicated in many systems {{by the presence of}} substantial segregation influencing the powder mix. This arises from the difference in size, shape, and density of the component particles. The powder/granules blending are involved at stage of pre granulation and/or post granulation stage of tablet manufacturing. Each process of mixing has an optimum mixing time, and longer mixing may result in an undesired product. The optimum mixingtime and mixing speed must be evaluated. Blending prior to compression is normally achieved in a simple tumble blender. The blender may be a fixed blender into which the powders are charged, blended and discharged. It is now common to use a bin blender. In special cases of mixing a lubricant, over mixing should be particularly monitored. The various blenders used include [...] "V" [...] blender, Oblicone blender, Container blender, Tumbling blender, Agitated powder blender.But nowadays to optimize the manufacturing process particularly in wet granulation the variousimproved equipment which combines several processing steps (mixing, granulation and/or drying) are used.

The dominant processes governing ocean mixing during an active phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation are identified. Air–sea fluxes and upper-ocean currents and hydrography, measured aboard the R/V Revelle during boreal fall 2011 in the Indian Ocean at 0 °, 80. 5 °E, are integrated by means of a large-eddy simulation (LES) to infer mixing mechanisms and quantify the resulting vertical property fluxes. In the simulation, wind accelerates the <b>mixed</b> layer, and <b>shear</b> <b>mixes</b> the momentum downward, causing the mixed layer base to descend. Turbulent kinetic energy gains due to shear production and Langmuir circulations are opposed by stirring gravity and frictional losses. The strongest stirring of buoyancy follows precipitation events and penetrates to the base of the mixed layer. The focus here is on the initial 24 h of an unusually strong wind burst that began on 24 November 2011. The model shows that Langmuir turbulence influences only the uppermost few meters of the ocean. Below the wave-energized region, shear instability responds to the integrated momentum flux into the mixed layer, lagging the initial onset of the storm. <b>Shear</b> below the <b>mixed</b> layer persists after the storm has weakened and decelerates the surface jet slowly (compared with the acceleration at the peak of the storm). Slow loss of momentum from the mixed layer extends the effect of the surface wind burst by energizing the fluid at the base of the mixed layer, thereby prolonging heat uptake due to the storm. Ocean turbulence and air–sea fluxes contribute to the cooling of the mixed layer approximately in the ratio 1 : 3, consistent with observations...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{comminution}} techniques {{used during the}} powder preparation stage of zinc oxide varistor powder was studied. The continual requirement for downsizing in electronic components combined with improved performance, demand {{greater understanding of the}} parameters influencing the required characteristics. Improvements in energy absorption capability of low voltage zinc oxide varistors are highly desirable from both a commercial and end product performance perspective. Enhanced energy absorption capability can be used to upgrade the rating of an existing varistor form factor capable of suppressing larger transients (Product capability enhancement) or alternatively reducing the part dimensions (Cost improvements). Current commercial applications for zinc oxide varistors demand energy performance improvements especially in automotive and telecommunications applications, where dimensions and costs as well as high reliability are imperative to compete in the world marketplace. The physics of energy absorption indicates that in order to improve this, improvements must be made in thermal properties, material processing and testing. Materials parameters of interest include, uniform density, chemical homogeneity and grain size. A high degree of chemical homogeneity in the oxide powder mix prior to pressing and densification is required, in particular, particle size distributions of the oxide dopants and zinc oxide -oxide dopant mixture with maximum values < ljum are highly desirable. Varistors manufactured by the conventional ceramic process use comminution to achieve particle size reduction of oxide dopants, prior to their addition to the zinc oxide slip. This work compares the effects of using eight combinations of milling-mixing techniques on the particle size distribution of oxide dopants and the full formula slip, and examines the microstructural properties of the densified parts using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and compares the energy absorption capabilities of the devices produced by each technique. The four comminution techniques studied were, Ball, Vibratory, Turbula, and Attrition milling. <b>Shear</b> <b>mixing</b> was used as in the conventional manufacturing process to mix the oxide dopants and zinc oxide. The work has shown that attrition milling is the most efficient comminution technique, reducing particle size distribution averages to well below ljum in less than two hours, compared to the other techniques which, regardless of milling time could not achieve the sub micron size distribution averages. In all samples where comminution versus <b>shear</b> <b>mixing</b> was used to mix-mill the oxide dopants and zinc oxide together, the energy capability was always considerably improved over the samples where <b>shear</b> <b>mixing</b> alone was used.

Earlier Batch 0 formulation testing used a Tank 50 sample collected in September 2005 and is described elsewhere [2]. The current testing was performed using a sample of Tank 50 waste collected in May 2006. This work was performed according to the Technical Task and Quality Assurance Plan (TT/QAP), WSRC-RP- 2006 - 00594 [3]. The salt solution collected from Tank 50 in May 2006 contained approximately 3 weight percent more solids than the sample collected in September 2005. The insoluble solids took longer to settle in the new sample which was interpreted as indicating finer particles in the current sample. The saltstone formulation developed for the September 2005 Tank 50 Batch 0 sample was confirmed for the May 2006 sample with one minor exception.

The constitutive description of the ductile material {{is defined by the}} Gurson model with constant and uniform porosity, both for isotropic hardening and for perfectly plastic behavior as a limit case. Solutions are obtained by numerically integrating the field equations within elastic and plastic asymptotic sectors and by imposing full stress and velocity continuity. If the hardening coefficient is lower than a critical value two distinct kinds of solution can be found in variable-separable form, corresponding to predominantly tensile or <b>shear</b> <b>mixed</b> mode. The elastic-perfectly plastic solution is constructed by means of an appropriate assembly of generalized centered fan and non-singular plastic sectors and an elastic unloading sector. The results show that the porosity mainly influences the stress fields of the tensile mode rather than the shear mode, due to the higher hydrostatic stress level. In particular, for high porosities the maximum of the hoop stress deviates from the interface line ahead of the crack-tip, causing possible kinking of the crack trajectory. The performed analysis of the debonding process of this kind of interface is essential for the determination of the overall strength, toughness and reliability of many advanced composite materials and structural components...|$|R

Kinetic gas theory provides an estimate of the dimensionless mixing coefficient which is within an order of magnitude of laboratory values. Knowing the minimum value of D, the distribution of index lithologies measured across till contacts in the geologic record can be used to estimate the maximum shear strain that has occurred across till contacts.
