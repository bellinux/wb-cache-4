Objectives: This study aims {{to review the}} aetiology of <b>Sjogren?s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> highlight aspects {{that contribute to the}} pathophysiology of the disease and explore treatment options that target different mediators of pathogenesis. The MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched systematically with the terms ?Sjogren?s syndrome?; ?clinical?; ?treatment?; ?management?. Eligible studies had to meet a predefined inclusion criteria. 912 identified studies were evaluated against the inclusion criteria. 25 eligible studies were included for review. <b>Sjogren?s</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a multifactorial condition with genetic, environmental and hormonal factors playing a role in establishing the condition. B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is an important mediator in the induction and perpetuation of this condition. Elevated BAFF levels, found in patients with SS, promote growth of B-cells and subsequent production of autoantibody; anti-SSA/Ro. BAFF inhibitors are important potential therapeutic drugs that may be effective in patients with <b>Sjogren?s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Other potential targets include CD 20 and CD 22 that cause B-cell depletion. The pathophysiology of this exocrinopathy has not fully been elucidated. Potential therapeutic interventions include BAFF inhibitors and anti-CD 20 and anti-CD 22 therapy. However, no clinical trials have been conducted on subjects with <b>Sjogren?s</b> <b>syndrome</b> to support existing research...|$|R

25|$|<b>Sjögren</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SjS, SS) is a {{long-term}} autoimmune disease in which the moisture-producing glands of the body are affected. This results primarily {{in the development of}} a dry mouth and dry eyes.

Those affected are at an increased risk (5%) of lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|HLA {{types are}} inherited, {{and some of}} them are {{connected}} with autoimmune disorders and other diseases. People with certain HLA antigens are more likely to develop certain autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis, celiac disease, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), myasthenia gravis, inclusion body myositis, <b>Sjögren</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and narcolepsy. HLA typing has led to some improvement and acceleration in the diagnosis of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes; however, for DQ2 typing to be useful, it requires either high-resolution B1*typing (resolving *02:01 from *02:02), DQA1*typing, or DR serotyping. Current serotyping can resolve, in one step, DQ8. HLA typing in autoimmunity is being increasingly used as a tool in diagnosis. In celiac disease, it is the only effective means of discriminating between first-degree relatives that are at risk from those that are not at risk, prior to the appearance of sometimes-irreversible symptoms such as allergies and secondary autoimmune disease.|$|E

Study design: Thirty-seven patients with <b>Sjögren?s</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SS), [14 patients with primary SS (SS- 1) and 23 patients with secondary SS (SS- 2) ], along with 37 healthy controls were examined in regard to number of teeth, pro-bing pocket depth (PPD), approximal plaque index (API), bleeding on probing (BOP), presence of prosthetic appliances and smoking habits. Salivary flow rate (SFR), Candida carriage in saliva, presence of Candida albicans colonization on buccal, angular, palatal and sulcular areas, on dentures and on the tongue?s dorsal surface were determined. Statistical analyses were performed using the 2 -tailed Fisher exact and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: No statistically significant difference was found between SS- 1 and SS- 2 groups based on the parameters analysed. Statistically significant differences were observed between patients with SS and healthy subjects in terms of SFR, oral signs and symptoms, API, BOP, C. albicans colonization on tongue and buccal area, and Candida carriage in saliva. In the gingival crevicular fluid positive C. albicans colonization was found in only one subject of SS subgroup. Conclusions: SS patients carry a higher risk of having periodontitis and are more predisposed to develop candidiasis. C. albicans is scarcely detected in gingival crevicular fluid despite high scores on C. albicans colonization in different areas of the oral cavity in SS patients...|$|R

BAFF is a ligand for three TNF receptor superfamily members : B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), and BAFF receptor (BAFF-R). Among them, BAFF-R plays the central role in the BAFF system, whereas TACI plays the inhibitory role. BAFF/BAFF receptors appear to span nearly all stages of B-lineage differentiation, ranging from the development, selection, and homeostasis of naive primary B cells to the maintenance of long-lived bone marrow plasma cells. Furthermore, excessive BAFF rescues self-reactive B cells from anergy, which may {{play a crucial role in}} the induction and development of autoimmunity. Mice overexpressing BAFF exhibit increased B cell numbers in spleen and lymph node and autoimmune phenotype similar to patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and <b>Sjögrens</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Furthermore, inhibition of BAFF by TACI-Ig and BAFFR-Ig has been successful in treating murine models of SLE and rheumatoid arthritis. In humans, previous reports have shown elevated serum BAFF levels in SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, <b>Sjögrens</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and systemic sclerosis patients. Thus, the dysregulation of BAFF/BAFF receptor system may contribute to induction and development of autoimmune diseases and become one of important therapeutic targets. ...|$|R

The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has promoted and supported an international collaborative study group (EULAR-SS Task Force) aimed at developing consensual recommendations to provide a homogeneous approach to the patient with primary SjS presenting with systemic involvement. This review summarizes the key factors that should be taken into account in the diagnostic approach in a patient with suspected SjS according to the main clinical patterns of presentation, and is especially focused on organ-specific systemic disease presentations, including a consensus set of recommendations in order to reach an early diagnosis.

Results Significant differences (p 2 SDs above {{the mean of the}} HV) and HV on any of the peptides tested. Conclusions Binding of serum from patients with SS to M 3 R-derived peptides does not differ from binding to a control peptide in an ELISA and no significant binding to M 3 R-derived peptides was found in the serum from individual patients compared with HV.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{determine}} {{associations between}} symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth and objective evidence of lacrimal and salivary gland dysfunction {{in a population}} based sample. To determine associations between these elements {{and the presence of}} autoantibodies.  METHODS—A cross sectional population based survey. Subjects were interviewed and examined (Schirmer- 1 test and unstimulated salivary flow) for the presence of dry eyes and mouth. Antibodies (anti-Ro [SS-A], anti-La [SS-B], rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody) were measured.  RESULTS— 341 subjects were examined. Twenty four per cent had dry eye symptoms, 29 % dry mouth symptoms, and 14 % both. There was only a weak association between the presence of oral or ocular symptoms and their respective test results. Associations were strongest between dry mouth symptoms and positive test results, and in subjects under 55  years of age. There was no association between the presence of autoantibodies and either symptoms or signs of dry eyes or dry mouth.  CONCLUSION—Only weak associations were found between self reported symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth and objective measures said to define <b>Sjögrens</b> <b>syndrome</b> in the general population.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{frequency of}} autoantibodies and B cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma (B-NHL) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection suggests dysregulated humoral immunity. Soluble CD 23 (sCD 23) {{is involved in}} B cell activation and proliferation and the serum levels are raised in autoimmune diseases and B cell lymphoproliferative disease. We compared the serum levels of sCD 23 in patients with HCV infection with those in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) and in healthy controls. Serum levels of interleukin (IL) 8, IL 10, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and interferon-gamma were assessed simultaneously to check for generalized nonspecific immune stimulation. In contrast to the essentially normal serum levels of these latter cytokines, the levels of sCD 23 were raised in the patients with HCV compared to those with AC and the normal controls (medians 34. 0, 10. 1, and 11. 1 arbitrary units, respectively; HCV vs AC P 0. 8).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{a role for}} mutation in the aetiogenesis of autoimmune disease by examining levels of repairing enzyme for the promutagenic DNA base lesion, O 6 -methylguanine, in lymphocyte extracts from patients with autoimmune diseases. We included primary <b>Sjögrens</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PSS) patients because of the additional relevance of their being at increased risk (> 40 -fold) of developing lymphoma. METHODS [...] Lymphocytes were prepared from patients with PSS (n = 22) (12 with parotid gland enlargement, an indicator of extensive lymphoproliferation), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 11), osteoarthritis (n = 12), and healthy individuals (n = 11). MGMT amounts were determined in lymphocyte extracts by direct enzyme assay and expressed in relation to total extract DNA, protein, or cell number. RESULTS [...] We found no defect in the repairing methyltransferase enzyme between any of the groups, except in PSS patients at increased risk of developing lymphoma (those with enlarged parotid glands) : p < 0. 0001 and p = 0. 0056, compared with healthy controls and PSS patients without parotid gland swelling, respectively. CONCLUSIONS [...] Our findings implicate persistence of O 6 -methylguanine-DNA in the aetiology of lymphoma associated with PSS, and raise the possibility that an alternative repair process for O 6 -methylguanine-DNA, nucleotide excision repair, might be defective in autoimmune disease...|$|R
