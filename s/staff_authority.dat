In 1970, the Office of Air Force History published a then [...] "top secret", but now declassified, 106-page report, titled The Air Force in Southeast Asia: Toward a Bombing Halt, 1968. Journalist Richard Ehrlich writes that according to the report, [...] "in late January, General Westmoreland had warned that if the situation near the DMZ and at Khe Sanh worsened drastically, nuclear or chemical weapons might have to be used." [...] The report continues to state that [...] "this prompted Air Force chief of staff, General John McConnell, to press, although unsuccessfully, for JCS (Joint Chiefs of <b>Staff)</b> <b>authority</b> to request Pacific Command to prepare a plan for using low-yield nuclear weapons to prevent a catastrophic loss of the U.S. Marine base." ...|$|E

5|$|Following the crisis, the Colonel Director of Retainers {{retained}} his privileged {{possession of}} the <b>Staff</b> of <b>Authority</b> and was granted the same investigative and censorial powers as the Chancellor and Imperial Counselor over officialdom. He routinely inspected the conduct of officials in the capital region and seven nearby commanderies. His investigative powers matched those of a provincial Inspector, although his <b>Staff</b> of <b>Authority</b> made him {{more powerful than the}} latter. The Colonel Director of Retainers was a personal servant of the emperor, answering only to him, allowing the emperor to greatly enhance his control over the bureaucracy. However, the <b>Staff</b> of <b>Authority</b> was removed from the Colonel in 45 BC, limiting his powers to inspection, investigation, and impeachment and he was distinguished from a provincial Inspector only by a higher salary-rank. The office of Colonel Director of Retainers was abolished in 9 BC, and reinstated once more as the Director of Retainers in 7 BC. He was now a subordinate of the new Excellency of Works and supervised convicts in public works projects, like his early Western Han counterpart. In Eastern Han, the Colonel Director of Retainers was reappointed without the <b>Staff</b> of <b>Authority,</b> with powers to inspect the capital region, but his salary-rank was reduced from 2000–dan to Equivalent to 2000–dan.|$|R

5000|$|In February 1932, Takahashi was {{appointed}} vice chief of Naval General Staff {{through the efforts}} of Kato Kanji while Prince Fushimi chaired the Staff from January 1932 to March 1941. Asada wrote that Takahashi [...] "virtually controlled the navalhigh command in this capacity", Ian Gow argued that Prince Fushimi was an independent and capable leader in his own right.Immediately upon promotion, Takahashi revived the plans to expand the <b>Staff</b> <b>authority</b> and reduce that of the Naval Ministry that he developed for Kato Kanji in 1922. In September 1933, the Fleet Faction prevailed and Fushimi gained clear supremacy over Navy Minister Mineo Ōsumi. In 1933-1934, the militarists silenced the opposition leaders and forced them to retire during the Osumi purge, thus gaining unchecked control of the Navy. After World War II, Takahashi recalled that [...] "one of his aims the 1932 struggle for power was to be prepared with a war with the United States"; he feared that the Shanghai Incident of 1932 could escalate into a major Japanese-American war.In November 1934, Takahashi {{was appointed}} commander of the Combined Fleet and held this command for two years. Contrary to the battleship mentality of the old-school admirals, he spoke in favor of increasing aircraft carrier arm of the Fleet; his opinion was rejected by both General Staff and the Navy Ministry and ultimately cost him his career; he was cut off from any further information on the Navy's future.|$|E

40|$|According to the functionalist perspective, the {{survival}} of an organization {{is a matter of}} functions performed. A dialectical framework allows us to {{deal with the fact that}} durability is not necessarily connected with functionality. Organizations may be built on retrogressive accomodations which amount to dysfunctional dialectics. The prison represents an example in that it has developed as a polarity of commonweal and service organization, and is divided against itself. The coercive structure results in compliance patterns of an alienative nature. The basic dialectical units are roles which divide prisoners by emphasizing power relationships. <b>Staff</b> <b>authority</b> is weakened by a process of dialectical retrogressions. The prisoner subculture represents a dialectical defense against threats to individual self-images. The staff system will tend toward an organizational retrothesis made up of conflicting role realms of custody and treatment. Logical metacontrol possibilities include permanent external control, organizational revolution or abolition of the organization...|$|E
