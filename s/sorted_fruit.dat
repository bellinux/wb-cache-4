40|$|This paper reviews {{practical}} policy {{lessons from}} trade in a dietary supplement (or nutraceutical) processed from Terminalia ferdinandiana (Combretaceae), which contains extremely {{high levels of}} natural ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Most production is from wild harvest by Aboriginal people, who get USD 14 per kilogram (kg) for picked, <b>sorted</b> <b>fruit.</b> However, the main Australian company involved is struggling to get the 12 tons/year it requires, and could market much more. Although Aboriginal people ideally should benefit economically from harvest of T. ferdinandiana, there are major challenges to this objective, including Australia’s high labor costs compared to Asia, Africa, and Latin America where T. ferdinandiana can be grown. In addition, although Australia is a signatory to and plays {{a leading role in}} the international Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), this has meant little in practice so far. “Cultural branding” and certification of organic, wild harvested T. ferdinandiana fruit collected by Aboriginal people working in partnership with commercial companies offers a possibility for Aboriginal people to continue to benefit from wild harvest or enrichment plantings. However, even the establishment of commercial horticultural production within Australia faces several challenges. For Australia to maintain and develop the international market, future development of this bush food must include: (a) implementation of existing international and national policies on protection of genetic resources; (b) formation of a producer association to increase production efficiencies; (c) functioning partnerships between Aboriginal producers and commercial partners that guarantee and expand reliable supply and develop cultural branding and certification as marketing tools; and (d) scientific research into improving T. ferdinandiana fruit yields and production methods, based on improved resource management and efficient processing methods...|$|E

40|$|Two commercially {{available}} non-destructive firmness sensors, {{one based on}} acoustic impulse response (AFS) and one on low-mass impact (SIQ-FT), were compared for the quality assessment of apples and tomatoes during a storage experiment. The aim was to quantify the repeatability of the sensors, the correlation between them, their ability to sense firmness decay during the storage experiment {{and their ability to}} <b>sort</b> <b>fruit</b> of a given batch. Our study shows that for apples, both sensors have a good repeatability and overall, the correlation between the measurements of both devices was rather high (r = 0. 88), but when considering the practical case of a given batch at a given time, inherently possessing smaller variability, the correlation was low. It was further shown that for AFS the uncertainty (measurement error by the device augmented by eventual model error) is lower than the natural heterogeneity of the considered batch during the whole experimental period denoting that the device is capable of <b>sorting</b> <b>fruit</b> for firmness. In case of SIQ-FT, the uncertainty was larger than the batch heterogeneity. For tomatoes, the repeatability was worse than for apples, but still acceptable during the whole experimental period for SIQ-FT. During softening, AFS showed low repeatability. The correlation between both techniques was also lower (r = 0. 70 overall). For both instruments, uncertainty was larger than the true batch heterogeneity, and increased during the experimental period indicating that tomato sorting is difficult, and should be performed as soon as possible after harvest.

The aim is to maximise the number of boxes packed. The decision must be made after all information is known, but before the fruit passes the first outlet - a few seconds total. Further, information about fruit already packed in a given box is incomplete (we don’t know exactly which fruit {{ended up in a}} box). The bagging problem requires bags to be filled to a minimum weight - no tolerance for underweights, and no constraints on the number of fruit per bag.

However, {{there is a lack of}} objective information that will allow consumers to choose fruit of a desired quality. Good correlations, well established in the literature, exist between soluble solid content and consumer acceptance of several fruit. Commercial application of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to <b>fruit</b> <b>sorting</b> by soluble solids was first initiated in Japan in 1990, and this technology has been applied to pack-house <b>fruit</b> <b>sorting</b> lines for sweetness of citrus, apples, pears and peaches, since the mid 1990 s in Japan, and more recently in other countries. At present, NIR technology applied to nondestructive measurement of fruit quality is in development.

In contrast to the other semantic categories we tested, fruit and vegetable scores were only predicted by left FG 1 volume.

40|$|Indexación: Web of ScienceIntroduction. 'Hass' is {{the main}} avocado {{cultivar}} commercialized worldwide. The extended flowering period, very low percentage of fruit set and inability to ripen on the tree renders the fruit heterogeneous and unpredictable during postharvest management. The "triggered" and "ready-to-eat" growing markets for 'Hass' avocados {{are affected by the}} variable postharvest ripening or ripening heterogeneity which creates severe logistical problems for marketers and inconsistent quality delivery to consumers. Synthesis. The dry matter content, the current avocado harvest index that correlates very well with oil content, has been extensively used to harvest 'Hass' avocados to comply with the minimum standards to guarantee consumer satisfaction. However, previous work and empirical experience demonstrate that dry matter does not correlate on a fruit-to-fruit basis with time to reach edible ripeness. Thus, avocados of very different ages are harvested from individual trees, resulting in heterogeneous postharvest ripening of fruit within a specific batch. Several preharvest factors related to environmental and growing conditions and crop management as well as postharvest technology strategies influence the observed variability of postharvest ripening. Conclusion. Modern approaches based on studying the composition of individual fruits displaying contrasting postharvest ripening behavior, combined with non-destructive phenotyping techniques, seem to offer practical solutions for the fresh supply chain of avocados to <b>sort</b> <b>fruit</b> based on their ripening capacity.
