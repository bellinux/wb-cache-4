More than 600 people, mostly Mexican Americans, crowded into Guadalupe Hall to see and hear Chavez.... Chavez devoted most of his speech to the union’s fight with the growers, making his case for the boycott. But he also talked about Colegio, confessing that, if <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him five years earlier that Mexican Americans would have established their own college in Oregon, he ‘would have thought they were crazy.’ ‘Who knows?’ he added. ‘Maybe tomorrow there will be mariachi music in the White House.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Patrol {{trackers}} Sulieman, Windy Joe and Frank {{had agreed}} to testify against the police and were being kept in Wyndham to present their evidence however, {{they were unable to}} give evidence after they disappeared. Inspector Douglas testified that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> them that they would be hanged and so they had escaped overnight and went into hiding. Constable St Jack, who the trackers were to testify against, was tasked with finding and returning them to testify. Sulieman was found at Keep River [...] from Wyndham but was not returned before the Commission concluded. Sulieman claimed that on the day Commissioner Wood arrived the trackers had been shown a picture of a black hanging from a tree and told that they would be hanged if they testified.|$|E

I {{cannot be}} sure, but I {{think it was}} Mr. Myers, President of the London Psychical Research Society--we heard of his death yesterday. He was a spiritualist. I am afraid {{he was a very}} easily {{convinced}} man. We visited two mediums whom he and Andrew Lang considered quite wonderful, but they were quite transparent frauds.|$|R
50|$|Roger {{has barely}} left the store {{when a new}} {{customer}} arrives. It is Count Lacy. <b>Someone</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> him where fate has sent his betrothed and he has followed her. Irma serves him and he immediately falls for her. This girl seems to suit him {{so much better than}} Dolly. He invites her to elope with him to Monte Carlo and she does not resist; they leave the shop in high spirits.|$|R
60|$|He was {{dissatisfied}} with the price paid for Boola-Boola. <b>Someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him it would realise four times as much, and when Harold would have explained that this was unreasonable, he was cut short with the declaration that the offer ought {{not to have been}} accepted without reference to the other party concerned.|$|E

This she obtained, and for a year {{supported}} herself and her boy by needlework.|$|E
6000|$|... "Friends," [...] I answered, [...] "if you {{had asked}} me my opinion before, I should have voted for trying the mountains, beyond which, perhaps, we might find some Boers. I do not like this story of the Zulu impi. I think that <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> them of our coming, {{and that it is}} us they mean to attack and not the Tongas, with whom they are at peace.

60|$|<b>Someone</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> them--I think I {{first started}} {{the idea in}} my pamphlet--that the thing is to sleep {{on a pile of}} hemlock branches. I think I told them to listen to the wind sowing (you know the word I mean), sowing and crooning in the giant pines. So there they are upside-down, doubled up on a couch of green spikes that would have killed St. Sebastian. They stare up at the sky with blood-shot, restless eyes, waiting for the crooning to begin. And there isn't a sow in sight.|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{turned to}} the Kaffirs, {{especially}} to those from whom I had bought the cattle. They had heard that some Boers reached {{the banks of the}} Crocodile moons ago--how many they could not tell. But that country, they said, was under the rule of a chief who was hostile to them, and killed any of their people who ventured thither. Therefore they knew nothing for certain. Still, one of them stated that a woman whom he had bought as a slave, and who had passed through the district in question a few weeks before, told him that <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her that these Boers were all dead of sickness. She added that she had seen their wagon caps from a distance, so, if they were dead, [...] "their wagons were still alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|Only {{a little}} way from the fallen tree we came {{suddenly}} upon a large clearing, which we guessed at once must be that [...] "Garden of the god" [...] where twice a year the unfortunate Kalubis were doomed to scatter the [...] "sacred seed." [...] It was a large garden, several acres of it, lying on a shelf, as it were, of the mountain and watered by a stream. Maize grew in it, also other sorts of corn, while all round was a thick belt of plantain trees. Of course these crops had formed the food of the god who, whenever it was hungry, came to this place and helped itself, as we could see by many signs. The garden was well kept and comparatively free from weeds. At first we wondered how this could be, till I remembered that the Kalubi, or <b>someone,</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> {{me that it was}} tended by the servants of the Mother of the Flower, who were generally albinos or mutes.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was sitting}} there, {{the morning after}} the [...] "at-home" [...] at the Baroness von Maisen's, reading Turgenev's [...] "Torrents of Spring," [...] when she saw Count Rosek sauntering down the path with a glass of the waters in his hand. Instant memory of the smile with which he had {{introduced}} Fiorsen made her take cover beneath her sunshade. She could see his patent-leathered feet, and well-turned, peg-top-trousered legs go by with the gait of a man whose waist is corseted. The certainty that he wore those prerogatives of womanhood increased her dislike. How dare men be so effeminate? Yet <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her that he was a good rider, a good fencer, and very strong. She drew a breath of relief when he was past, and, for fear he might turn and come back, closed her little book and slipped away. But her figure and her springing step were more unmistakable than she knew.|$|E
60|$|The {{fault of}} the {{military}} man is that he studies too much, reads too much history, is over reflective. If, instead, he would look about him more he would notice that things are changing. <b>Someone</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> the British military man that Waterloo was won upon the playing fields of Eton. So he goes to Eton and plays. One of these days he will {{be called upon to}} fight another Waterloo: and afterwards--when it is too late--they will explain to him that it was won not upon the play field but in the class room.|$|R

6000|$|She {{was decidedly}} pretty, short but well-shaped, {{with a small}} English slightly-upturned nose; small mouth with ripe red lips, which were never still except when she held them pressed with her sharp white teeth {{to make them look}} redder and riper than ever. Her brown fluffy hair was worn short like a boy's, and she looked not unlike a {{handsome}} high-spirited boy, with brown eyes, mirthful and daring. She was extremely vivacious in disposition, and active--too active, in fact, for she got through her housemaid's work so quickly that it left her many hours of each day in which to listen to the promptings of the demon of mischief. It was only because she did her work so rapidly and so well that her mistress kept her on--"put up with her," [...] as she expressed it--in spite of her faults of temper and tongue. But Rosie's heart was not in her work. She was romantic and ambitious, and her shallow little brain was filled with a thousand dreams of wonderful things to be. She was a constant and ravenous reader of Bow Bells, the London Journal, and one or two penny weeklies besides; and not satisfied with the half-hundred columns of microscopical letterpress they afforded her, she laid her busy hands on all the light literature left about by her mistress, and thought herself hardly treated because Miss Starbrow was a great reader of French novels. It was exceedingly tantalising to know that those yellow-covered books were so well suited to her taste, {{and not be able to}} read them. For <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her what nice books they were--someone with a big red moustache, who was as fond of pretty red lips as a greedy school-boy is of ripe cherries.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{a possible}} relationship between intentional memory and possible phonologic cues {{in the human}} voice. Specifically, if <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> us something in the past, does hearing that same voice {{at the time of}} recall affect our ability to remember what was said? Also, if voice cues do affect memory, is the effect voice-specific? Since most standardized assessments of student learning and tests of human memory rest their conclusions about human learning solely on non-aural tests, it is necessary to determine if student performance changes with test modality. Via a computer program, ninety-five adults each listened to a male voice read a one-minute story and were then randomly assigned to take one of three different tests consisting of multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank items. In the first test, the male voice from the story read all questions and possible answers. The second test used a different male voice to read while the third test was text-only. All tests contained identical content and gave single-modality cues only, text or speech. Results show no significant difference in long-term recall or recognition with respect to test-modality. Further research in this area is encouraged to determine if conclusions are generalizable to wider populations and hold for longer memory intervals. ii...|$|R

Leslie of Boxoffice magazine said that [...] "The script and Leguizamo's talents don't mesh, so the actor comes off as more offensive than funny." [...] Bill Hoffman of The New York Post gave the comedy three and half out of five stars. Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle said of Leguizamo's performance [...] "Obviously, <b>someone</b> must <b>have</b> <b>told</b> Leguizamo he's a comic genius.

Gibson had been a commissioner of the District of Columbia Board of Parole; a community organizer for the United Planning Organization and the Washington Urban League; and a staff member for the District of Columbia Board of Education, the District of Columbia Office of Personnel, and the Department of Housing and Community Development. Gibson said he was surprised that Lightfoot had decided to run because he {{was under the impression}} that Lightfood had said he would support his campaign. Gibson speculated that perhaps <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> mistakenly <b>told</b> Lightfoot that Gibson would not actually run for the office.|$|R

5000|$|Sartre {{disapproved of}} Camus for seeing {{both sides in}} the Algerians' {{rebellion}} against their French colonial masters (The Algerian War—1954-62). In his bitterness against Camus, Sartre selected Francis Jeanson, who did not like the works of Camus, to review the Camus essay L'Homme Révolté (The Rebel). When Camus responded to the review with hurt feelings, Sartre put the final blow to a friendship that had lasted for years. He said, [...] "Vous êtes devenu la proie d'une morne démesure qui masque vos difficultés intérieures. ... Tôt ou tard, quelqu'un vous l'eût dit, autant que ce soit moi."

[...] They continued to call her voice [...] "an unabashedly loud and sexual fuck-you New York honk—that translates perfectly to rap." [...] In a 2017 Complex article about her, the editor wrote [...] "unapologetic does not begin to describe the totally unfiltered and sheer Cardi B-ness of Cardi B's personality. She's a hood chick who's not afraid to be hood no matter the setting. Cardi B is Cardi B 24/7, 365, this is why she resonates with people, and that same energy comes out in her music." ...|$|R

At some point during his military career, he {{came to the attention of}} the sadistic, perverted Ges Vorrutyer, who used him to fulfill his personal sadistic sexual fantasies, especially with captured prisoners of war. Compelled to exist in this environment, Bothari's personality crumbled even further, but under the stolid command of Vorrutyer's sometime lover and later foe, Aral Vorkosigan, he was able to pull himself back together to a certain extent. Completely loyal to Vorkosigan, he retained his fealty even when Vorrutyer began using him again, so when Vorrutyer directed him to rape Cordelia Naismith, formerly Vorkosigan's prisoner and <b>someone</b> Vorkosigan <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him to protect, he first refused to do it, and then when Vorrutyer attempted to do the deed himself, killed Vorrutyer instead.|$|R

Jim Carroll of The Irish Times dismissed Arcade Fire's Main Stage headlining performance as a [...] "Friday night flop". Rosemary Mac Cabe, in the same publication, praised the performance of Empire of the Sun, saying [...] "Facepaint, masks and pantomime-style dancers were mere embellishments to standout beats and choruses - and lead vocalist Luke Steele gave us something to talk about by breaking his guitar and throwing the pieces into the outstretched hands of an awestruck crowd".|$|R
