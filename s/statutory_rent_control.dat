This study estimates {{the costs and benefits of}} <b>rent</b> <b>control</b> to tenants in private rental dwellings in 1990 using the years 1998 and 2001 as benchmarks. Special emphasis is placed on the welfare costs of increased discrepancies between actual and desired housing consumption due to the overdemand situation caused by <b>rent</b> <b>control.</b> Earlier studies on the welfare effects of <b>rent</b> <b>control</b> usually assume that the household would consume on the estimated demand curve in the absence of <b>rent</b> <b>control.</b> Here it is shown that this assumption biases estimates of the net benefit of <b>rent</b> <b>control</b> to tenants downwards and welfare measures are derived that also allow for suboptimal housing consumption in the absence of <b>rent</b> <b>control.</b> The empirical implementation of these measures utilizes micro-simulation to differentiate between ?natural? free market disequilibrium costs and additional disequilibrium costs caused by <b>rent</b> <b>control.</b> According to the results, the additional disequilibrium costs offset roughly 30 per cent of the benefits of lower rents to tenants and amounted to over 2 per cent of consumption expenditure of tenant households. The estimated net benefit of <b>rent</b> <b>control</b> to tenants, taking both low rents and disequilibrium costs into account, was 4. 5 or 6. 5 per cent of consumption expenditure, depending on the reference year.

Using data on Cambridge, Massachusetts and adjacent census tracts straddling the state imposed end of <b>rent</b> <b>controls,</b> I find evidence that <b>rent</b> <b>control</b> increased the presence of minority residents but also decreased the proportion of poor residents.

It has been documented that <b>rent</b> <b>control</b> distorts the supply and demand relationship in housing markets which contributes to the rapid deterioration of the community and to urban blight and does not provide the supposed benefits its proponents promise. <b>Rent</b> <b>control</b> contributes to urban blight by reducing new construction and investment in housing and deincentivizing maintenance. If a landlord's costs to perform maintenance consume too large a proportion of revenue from rent, the landlord will feel pressure to drastically reduce or eliminate maintenance entirely.
