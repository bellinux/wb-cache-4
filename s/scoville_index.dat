Four types of hot red peppers (A-Industrial red ground pepper, B-Industrial deep-red/ blackish ground pepper, C-Traditional deep-red/ blackish ground pepper sold {{in the market and}} D-Traditional deep-red/ blackish ground pepper consumed in home only) that were produced from the same pepper variety were taken for analyses. Results obtained indicated that with the exception of sample A, the rest of the samples were found not to contain aflatoxin. No significant differences between test samples were found in terms of chemical properties. Sample A had the highest level of invert sugar (20. 8 %), {{while the rest of the}} samples gave close values to each other. The industrial samples (samples A and B) had higher extractable colour (as ASTA unit) and pungency (as <b>Scoville</b> <b>index)</b> values than their traditional counterparts. To conclude, as long as the optimum hygienic conditions are provided, it is possible to manufacture hot red ground pepper which does not carry any potential health risk for human...|$|E
