5|$|The {{two small}} upper {{register}} panels show a rather traditional Annunciation <b>scene,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> usual dove representing the Holy Spirit near Mary. The {{two sets of}} panels, unlike those on the interior, are compositionally very different. The figures occupy distinctly separate niches and the colour schemes of the grisaille saints and donors contrast sharply.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} input into {{certain parts of}} the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut a scene in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the parody of King Leopold II, Méliès's scenario for the film features another topical element: the <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tar wagon {{is based on the}} experiments of Ernest Guglielminetti, who spread tar over {{a small part of the}} gravel road to Monaco. This experiment, widely reported by the press, successfully eliminated the dust clouds kicked up by cars on gravel and sand roads.|$|E

5|$|Other pirate radio {{stations}} in Britain were connected with the indie <b>scene,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> most notable being Q102 and Radio Phoenix in London, and KFM Radio in Manchester.

5|$|The cave {{was used}} for the filming of episodes of the BBC TV series Doctor Who: the serial Revenge of the Cybermen (1975) {{starring}} Tom Baker. This has since been referenced in the comedy of The League of Gentlemen. The cave was also used in the filming of the British series Blake's 7 (1978) and Robin of Sherwood (1983). The caves were used again for Doctor Who in The End of Time (2009), including a <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Doctor sharing thoughts and visions with the Ood.|$|E
5|$|The one reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on May 27, 1910.

5|$|The western face {{is divided}} into three sections. The {{uppermost}} section is almost completely weathered.

5|$|Visual effects at Kroma were {{supervised}} by Bert Yukich and produced by Amy Yukich. A {{key part of}} the video is a 24-second visual effects sequence in which Rihanna is surrounded by silvery strands of liquid that crisscross the frame in graceful arcs in response to her movements. Water elements were recorded on a special effects stage using a high-speed 35mm camera. Bert Yukich then composited them into the <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> singer. He then added lighting effects to the practical water elements to give them the mirror-like texture of mercury.|$|E
5|$|When Kukunoor was {{thinking}} of a character full of disguises, he first {{came up with an}} old man. When the thought of a <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> three major characters dancing in the dunes came up, he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being.|$|E

5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted at this point to make a comeback in the local art <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had been up for grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E
5|$|The Wiz {{was filmed}} at Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The {{decaying}} New York State Pavilion from the 1964 New York World's Fair {{was used as}} the set for Munchkinland, Astroland at Coney Island was used for the Tinman <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Cyclone as a backdrop, while the World Trade Center served as the Emerald City. The scenes filmed at the Emerald City were elaborate, utilizing 650 dancers, 385 crew members and 1,200 costumes. Costume designer Tony Walton enlisted the help of high fashion designers in New York City for the Emerald City sequence, and obtained exotic costumes and fabric from designers such as Oscar de la Renta and Norma Kamali. Albert Whitlock created the film's visual special effects, while Stan Winston served as the head makeup artist.|$|E
5|$|The <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{drinking}} {{game between}} Tyrion, Bronn and Shae was written {{specifically for the}} episode, but the story of Tyrion's ill-fated marriage to Tysha was taken from a previous chapter of the books. Shae's background was changed from Westerosi to foreign to accommodate Kekilli's accent. Other notable divergence from the books include the modification of the whole strategy of Robb Stark when dividing his forces, and a change to the Targaryen genealogy as explained by Maester Aemon: in the TV adaptation the Mad King is described as the son, rather than the grandson, of Aegon V (thus eliminating Jaehaerys II from the succession of kings).|$|E

5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some even after they had been filmed. These included a fight <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Doctor and Rosanna's steward (Simon Gregor), a longer fight sequence between Rory and Francesco, and some dialogue between the Doctor and Amy following the climax. In the original script, Amy and Rory cornered Francesco after suspecting him of killing a villager and Francesco climbed up the wall. Whithouse thought this would be a relatively easy stunt, but was told it would be too hard to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, thought that she should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while she is in the chamber.|$|E

Alternatively, there is a secret idol in Wave 8 that will reveal the hidden exit. To pass {{requires the}} use of both TNT and the Sankara Stones.

5|$|Dr. Caligari is not {{the only}} symbol of arrogant {{authority}} in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the <b>scene</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare {{can be seen as a}} rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.|$|E
