5|$|In September 2010 Archie Comics {{introduced}} an openly gay character, Kevin Keller in Veronica #202, {{though it was}} only published in the U.S. and Canada. In the story, Veronica quickly falls for the new-boy-in-town, with a sweet <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> chiseled good looks, Kevin. Kevin beats Jughead in a burger-eating contest, and he tells Jughead that he's not interested in Veronica because he's gay. Unbeknownst to Kevin, Jughead has a score to settle with Veronica. So, when Jughead requests for Kevin not tell Veronica about his sexuality, Kevin willingly agrees. The bulk of the story is about Veronica's cluelessness.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosthetic}} phase begins {{once the}} implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance {{that it will}} integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.|$|E
5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E

5|$|Nick calls Norah, {{apologizing for}} leaving, and she agrees {{to meet him}} again. Deciding to go somewhere where no one they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play {{something}} {{he wrote in the}} studio, but then joins him in the recording room. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E

Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> the largest power is love.|$|E
25|$|Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke in 1979 was in {{the process}} of selling the team to Jerry Buss. Possessing the first overall pick in the {{upcoming}} 1979 NBA Draft, the Lakers narrowed their choice to either Magic Johnson or Sidney Moncrief. Los Angeles already had a fine point guard in Norm Nixon, making Moncrief potentially a wonderful complement at off guard. However, Cooke liked Johnson's <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> playing style. In one of Cooke's last acts as Lakers owner, the Lakers drafted the point guard Johnson.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> {{laughter}} {{have received}} considerable attention from researchers, {{little is known}} about the way they are displayed in naturally occurring group interactions. This aspect could be crucial if we want to understand the function of affiliative behaviours in social relationships. Naturalistic observations were conducted in areas where people could be watched interacting in small groups. Focal sampling of men and women allowed the recording of <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughter frequencies, as well as group size and composition in terms of age <b>and</b> sex. Overall, <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughter were influenced by group size and age of people involved. <b>Smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughter were also affected by other aspects of social context, depending on the type of behaviour concerned and the sex of individuals. By deriving predictions from three hypotheses - sexual advertisement, social competition, and cooperation - this study revealed that <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughter are likely to be involved in the formation of cooperative relationships. © 2008 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden...|$|R

25|$|Tytla {{was one of}} {{the first}} animators {{assigned}} to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Fred Moore and Tytla were responsible for much of the design of the film and the definition of the personalities of the seven dwarfs. One of Tytla's famous scenes from the film (as described by John Canemaker) is where woman-hating Grumpy is kissed by Snow White. As he brusquely walks away, an internal warmth generated by the kiss gradually slows him, bringing a soft <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> sigh to his lips, revealing his true feelings of love. Grumpy's inner feelings are portrayed solely through pantomimein his telling facial expressions, his body language, and the timing of his reactions.|$|E
