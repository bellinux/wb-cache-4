5|$|From {{the point}} of view of sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} is related to Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E

5|$|The biopolymers that {{comprise}} DNA, RNA and (poly)peptides are linear polymers (i.e.: each monomer {{is connected to}} at most two other monomers). The sequence of their monomers effectively encodes information. The transfers of information described by the central dogma ideally are faithful, deterministic transfers, wherein one biopolymer's sequence {{is used as a}} template for the construction of another biopolymer with a <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> is entirely dependent on the original biopolymer's sequence.|$|E

50|$|In the quasispecies model, {{mutations}} occur through errors made in {{the process}} of copying already existing sequences. Further, selection arises because different types of sequences tend to replicate at different rates, which leads to the suppression of <b>sequences</b> <b>that</b> replicate more slowly in favor of <b>sequences</b> <b>that</b> replicate faster. However, the quasispecies model does not predict the ultimate extinction of all but the fastest replicating sequence. Although the <b>sequences</b> <b>that</b> replicate more slowly cannot sustain their abundance level by themselves, they are constantly replenished as <b>sequences</b> <b>that</b> replicate faster mutate into them. At equilibrium, removal of slowly replicating sequences due to decay or outflow is balanced by replenishing, so that even relatively slowly replicating sequences can remain present in finite abundance.|$|R
5|$|Clark Gregg reprises {{his role}} as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by {{principal}} cast members Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, and Nick Blood. The series was renewed for a second season in May 2014, and production began that July. That month, guest star Lucy Lawless's role was revealed, building hype for her appearance, although her character was always intended to be killed off {{at the end of}} the episode. Other guest stars include Hayley Atwell, Neal McDonough, and Kenneth Choi, reprising their roles from previous MCU projects in a <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> ties-in with another MCU television series, Agent Carter. Series composer Bear McCreary used Christopher Lennertz's Agent Carter theme when writing the music for this sequence.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX {{outlined}} a deployment that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> added more and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E

The developers wanted to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube by making an opening full motion video <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> would attract people's attention to the graphics. HAL worked with three separate graphic houses in Tokyo to make the opening sequence. On their official website, the developers posted screenshots and information highlighting and explaining the attention to physics and detail in the game, with references to changes from its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Maeda {{wrote the}} episode after being {{inspired}} by the situation of a real-life French journalist, Jean-Dominique Bauby, who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and was created by Maeda {{in the hopes that}} he would go on to be a memorable villain. Effects expert Mat Beck created the unique visual <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes. To create the effect of a parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown.|$|E
5|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E

The July mainshock had a significant aftershock <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> persisted into July and August with many magnitude 5+ events with intensities of V (Moderate) to VII (Very strong). Six of these aftershocks occurred {{on the day of}} the mainshock, but the strongest aftershock came on August 22 as a M5.8 event that had a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) and resulted in the deaths of two people and caused an additional $10 million in property damage.|$|E
5|$|This complex {{scenario}} {{leads to}} the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient {{in the course of}} one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping {{back and forth between the}} two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.|$|E

5|$|Bioinformatics {{involves}} {{the development of}} techniques to store, data mine, search and manipulate biological data, including DNA nucleic acid sequence data. These have led to widely applied advances in computer science, especially string searching algorithms, machine learning, and database theory. String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides. The DNA sequence may be aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate the specific mutations that make them distinct. These techniques, especially multiple sequence alignment, are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function. Data sets representing entire genomes' worth of DNA sequences, such as those produced by the Human Genome Project, are difficult to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of DNA <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by gene finding algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally. Entire genomes may also be compared, which can {{shed light on the}} evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{then shot}} the {{sequence}} where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being hired}} after the {{completion}} of nearly all the principal photography, Trumbull had an enormous amount of creative input on the film. The Spock spacewalk sequence, for example, was radically changed from the Abel version. The original plan was for Kirk to follow Spock in a spacesuit and come under attack from a mass of sensor-type organisms. Spock would save his friend, and the two would proceed through V'ger. Wise, Kline and Abel had been unable to agree on how to photograph the sequence, and the result was a poorly designed and ungainly effect that Trumbull was convinced was disruptive to the plot and would have cost millions to fix. Instead, he recommended a stripped-down <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> omitted Kirk entirely and would be simple and easy to shoot; Robert McCall, known for designing the original posters to 2001: A Space Odyssey, provided Trumbull with concept art to inform the new event.|$|E

5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E
5|$|Players control Conan the Barbarian from a third-person {{perspective}} {{while attempting}} to advance through the series of levels that subdivide the game. The gameplay {{is the same for}} each level: Conan moves from area to area, fighting groups of enemies until he reaches the end. At the end of certain levels, the barbarian has to fight a more powerful opponent called a boss. Defeating a boss involves a two-stage process: Conan has to inflict heavy damage on the creature and thus trigger an interactive button-pressing <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> players have to complete to kill the boss. Several cycles of this process are required to defeat most bosses. Besides combat, button-pressing sequences are also used to interact with the environment, such as knocking down obstacles to create passageways, or as parts of platforming sequences in which Conan climbs walls and jumps from ledge to ledge. Players can save their progress by using special stones that are placed throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid <b>sequence</b> <b>that</b> is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E
