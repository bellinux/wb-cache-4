40|$|With the 2008 {{reform of}} {{business}} taxation (Unternehmensteuerreform 2008) a preferential treatment of retained earnings for non-incorporated companies was introduced: Earnings may be retained at a preferential tax rate (29. 8 %) {{and will be}} subjected to supplementary tax (26. 4 %) when they will be withdrawn in the future. By now, studies on this topic {{have been based on}} case studies. Our article is based on microdata of the German Income Tax Statistics 2002 and provides a general empirical analysis of the new regulation's fiscal effects. Unlike studies before, we do not only consider marginal tax rates but also take into account that retained earnings may reduce progressive income tax for other earnings. Moreover we consider that taxpayers may retain earnings without having to pay supplementary taxes on these earnings if they are withdrawn within two years. On the individual level, beneficiaries of the preferential treatment are mainly taxpayers with high income. For instance, those with an annual income of at least 750, 000 Euro reduce their tax burden by approximately 10 % (unmarried, withdrawal before retention of 100, 000 Euro). By contrast, taxpayers with an annual income of less than 22, 087 Euro do not benefit from the reform at all. On the macroeconomic level, the fiscal effects of the reform are considerable: Depending on the scenario, we estimate a <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> <b>receipts</b> of 3. 4 bn, 5. 0 bn Euro and 7. 5 bn Euro (theoretical upper limit) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{shadow economy}} and tax evasion are both {{widespread}} in Greece. This has adverse effects {{in terms of}} horizontal and vertical equity, {{as well as in}} terms of efficiency. We take advantage of access to a large sample of income tax returns in 2004 / 05, and compare tax reported incomes with those observed in the household budget survey of that year. We re-weight our two datasets to make them fully comparable, and carefully select the reference population. We then calculate ratios of income under-reporting by region and income source. The synthetic distribution of reported incomes is then fed into a taxbenefit model to provide preliminary estimates of the size and distribution of income tax evasion in Greece. Income under-reporting is estimated at 10 %, resulting in a 26 % <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> tax <b>receipts.</b> The paper finds that the effects of tax evasion are higher income inequality and poverty, as well as lower progressivity of the income tax system. tax evasion, inequality, microsimulation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{shadow economy}} and {{resulting}} tax evasion are both very widespread in Greece (up to 37 % and 15 % of GDP respectively, {{according to some}} estimates). This has adverse effects in terms of horizontal and vertical equity, {{as well as in}} terms of efficiency. The paper takes advantage of access to a large sample of income tax returns (approximately 41, 300 tax payers in 27, 700 tax units, a fraction of 0. 53 %) in Greece in 2004 / 05. Specifically, the paper compares incomes reported in tax returns with those observed in the household budget survey of the same year. It then calculates ratios of income under-reporting by region and main source of income. The synthetic distribution of reported income is then fed into a tax-benefit model to provide preliminary estimates of the size and distribution of income tax evasion. Income under-reporting in Greece is estimated at 10 %, resulting in a 26 % <b>shortfall</b> <b>in</b> tax <b>receipts.</b> The paper concludes that the effects of tax evasion are higher income inequality and poverty, as well as lower progressivity of the income tax system...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme via the DOI in this record. Background <b>Shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> the <b>receipt</b> of {{recommended}} health care have been previously reported in England, leading to preventable poor health. Objectives To assess changes over 6 years <b>in</b> the <b>receipt</b> of effective health-care interventions for people aged 50 years or over in England with cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes or osteoarthritis; to identify how quality varied with participant characteristics; and to compare the distribution of illness burden in the population with the distributions of diagnosis and treatment. Setting and participants Information on health-care quality indicators and participant characteristics was collected using face-to-face structured interviews and nurse visits in participants’ homes by the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing in 2004 – 5, 2006 – 7, 2008 – 9 and 2010 – 11. A total of 16, 773 participants aged 50 years or older were interviewed at least once and 5114 were interviewed in all four waves; 5404 reported diagnosis of one or more of four conditions in 2010 – 11. Main outcome measures Percentage of indicated health care received by eligible participants for 19 quality indicators: seven for cardiovascular disease, three for depression, five for diabetes and four for osteoarthritis, and condition-level quality indicator achievement, including achievement of a bundle of three diabetes indicators. Analysis Changes in quality indicator achievement over time and variations in quality with participant characteristics were tested with Pearson’s chi-squared test and logistic regression models. The size of inequality between the hypothetically wealthiest and poorest participants, for illness burden, diagnosis and treatment, was estimated using slope indices of wealth inequality. Results Achievement of indicators for cardiovascular disease was 82. 7...|$|R

By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families {{to get back into}} employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other’s debts.|$|R

40|$|Summary Despite their {{apparent}} gender?neutrality, most {{discussions of}} poverty have been {{premised on the}} concept of a male actor and of male?centred notions of well?being and agency. The assumption underpinning income/consumption and well?being measures is that <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> income/consumption translate into <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> choice, and are manifested <b>in</b> <b>shortfalls</b> <b>in</b> well?being. However, gender introduces disjunctures into this process, with the result that these measures inadequately capture women's experience of poverty. The basic conundrum that plagues attempts to conceptualize the gender dimensions of poverty stems from the operation of the forces that create scarcity, on the one hand, and discrimination, on the other. The form in which women's poverty manifests itself depends on the cultural context far more than it does for men, suggesting that it cannot be understood through the same conceptual lens...|$|R
