40|$|National and {{international}} organizations and programs like the United States Global Change Research Project and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change agree, and scientific evidence indicates, that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are resulting in global climate change. Unless actions are taken to reverse and reduce {{the effects of these}} emissions, future generations will need to either adapt to or bear the burden of the changed environment. Individuals, companies, institutions, municipalities and countries are being called upon during this urgent world crisis. Universities, which support research and education, have a unique opportunity to become leaders in sustainability. In October 2007, the UNLV President appointed 11 members to the President 2 ̆ 7 s Advisory Task Force on Sustainability. The purpose of the task force was to promote environmental management and sustainable development by recommending specific activities to the president that will allow UNLV to appropriately address future sustainability issues. One specific recommendation was that a carbon footprint analysis, also known as a greenhouse gas inventory (GHGI), be completed within year. Another important recommendation was that the American College 2 ̆ 6 University Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) be signed by the president. The task force submitted a report to UNLV’s President on June 30, 2008. As described in the ACUPCC, each <b>signatory</b> <b>institution</b> must complete and report an inventory of all greenhouse gas emissions within one year of signing and then update the inventory every two years. In preparation for the signing of this commitment, UNLV took the initiative of completing a GHGI in the summer of 2008. The effort was headed by two undergraduate interns with UNLV’s Urban Sustainability Initiative. The inventory was nearly complete by the time the president signed the ACUPCC on August 18, 2008. Originally the inventory was to provide greenhouse gas data from Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 to 2008. Completing the inventory back to 2001 would highlight the successes in energy use reductions and other sustainability initiatives already accomplished at UNLV. As data collection progressed, some data were found to be inadequate or unavailable for the study period previously selected, thus in 2009 the period was re-adjusted to better reflect accurate record-keeping. At the same time, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Emissions Working Group of the Southern Nevada Regional Planning Coalition was drafting the GHGIs for cities of Southern Nevada and decided that its records were only reliable to 2005. As such, they set 2005 as their baseline year. UNLV decided to adopt this baseline as well. During the summer of 2009, the greenhouse gas inventory was updated to include FY 09, starting with data from FY 05 and disregarding previous years. The most current version of the software by Clean Air-Cool Planet does not allow for the input of FY 09 data. All FY 09 data were collected and saved, except for budget data which were not yet available. When the new version of the software is released, the inventory will be updated...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{absence of}} federal climate {{legislation}} in the United States {{has led to a}} growth of sub-federal and non-governmental programs to combat greenhouse gas emissions. One such program, the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) seeks to mitigate greenhouse emissions from higher education through the voluntary commitment of <b>signatory</b> <b>institutions</b> to become carbon neutral. <b>Signatory</b> <b>institutions</b> appoint an implementation liaison (IL) who is responsible for running ACUPCC activities, leading the development of a Climate Action Plan (CAP), and reporting on progress to the ACUPCC. Accountability is an important element in voluntary programs such as the ACUPCC, and assessing the factors that lead to program success and program accountability is critical to this endeavor. This paper seeks to understand the role that the implementation liaison’s background and capacity within the institution plays in successful implementation of the ACUPCC. Through logistic analysis of ACUPCC signatories’ implementation profiles and their reporting status, this paper presents evidence that the role of implementation liaisons in their respective institution has a significant effect on compliance with ACUPCC deadlines. Institutions which appoint implementation liaisons who specialize in sustainability or environmental issues or are from environmentally-based offices on campus {{are less likely to be}} delinquent in their reporting requirements than institutions whose IL comes from a non-environmental background or office...|$|R

This paper does so by telling the story of an academic journal. We wanted to explore whether the discipline and its evolution could be understood in terms of the journal BiD: Textos universitaris en Biblioteconomia i Documentació. We chose to track different parameters for the articles published in BiD in the period from 1998 to 2014 : the number of keywords used, the frequency variation in word use and the evolution of the <b>signatory</b> <b>institutions</b> in the papers regarding the ratio of professional to academic profiles of authors. This research is intended to complement the programme of the LIS-ER Seminar. Results will be presented for the first time at this seminar...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present briefly the {{projects}} called FONESYS (Forum & Network of System Thermal-Hydraulics Codes in Nuclear Reactor Thermal-Hydraulics) and SILENCE (Significant Light and Heavy Water Reactor Thermal Hydraulic Experiments Network for the Consistent Exploitation of the Data), their participants, their motivations, their main targets and working modalities. System Thermal-Hydraulics (SYS-TH) codes, also as part of the Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) approaches, are expected to achieve a more-and-more relevant role in nuclear reactor safety and design technology. Namely, the number of code-users is likely to increase in the countries where nuclear technology is exploited. Thus, the idea of establishing a forum and a network among the code developers and with possible extension to code users has started to have major importance and value. In this framework, the FONESYS initiative has been launched in 2010 aiming at creation of a common ground for discussing current limitations and envisaged improvements in various areas of SYS-TH and their application in the licensing process and safety analysis. According to FONESYS statute, there are seven <b>signatory</b> <b>Institutions</b> and two observer Institutions currently participating in the project. <b>Signatory</b> <b>Institutions</b> are AREVA-NP, Commissariat à l’Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives (CEA), San Piero a Grado Nuclear Research Group - University of Pisa (GRNSPG-UNIPI), Gesellschaft für Anlagenund Reaktorsicherheit (GRS), Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS), and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. SILENCE is a network that intends to promote the cooperation among teams of experimentalists managing or involved in significant experimental projects in nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulics, with the aim to contrast the risk of losing expertise and vision in this important area of the nuclear technology. This network was launched in 2012, replicating for the TH experimental domain the role that FONESYS plays in the code-development domain. Currently, the following Organizations are Members of SILENCE: AREVA GmbH, Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Hungarian Academy of Sciences Centre for Energy Research (MTA EK),Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT), and Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). SILENCE is currently organizing a “Specialists Workshop on Advanced Instrumentation and Measurement Techniques for Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics” (SWINTH- 2016). The San Piero a Grado Nuclear Research Group - University of Pisa (GRNSPG-UNIPI) is the Host Institution and plays as a Scientific Secretariat for both Networks...|$|R
5000|$|The ACUPCC text can be {{summarized}} in two sections: the statement, and the plan. The statement is a four-paragraph declaration that outlines the scientific knowledge regarding global climate change that the signatories accept as fact. It goes on to describe the perceived or predicted institutional and social benefits of taking steps to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. The text proposes that by acting to limit their carbon footprint, universities and colleges can act as leader institutions in their communities, and similarly better serve their students and their educational needs. It concludes that, {{in accordance with the}} many resultant institutional benefits expected, leaders of educational institutions ought to commit to the steps outlined in the plan. The plan is a three-part outline of certain steps <b>signatory</b> <b>institutions</b> should take [...] "in pursuit of climate neutrality." [...] The three parts of the plan involve developing a comprehensive plan, choosing from a menu of 'tangible actions' to initiate while developing a comprehensive plan, and issuing regular reports to AASHE regarding institutional progress. Comprehensive plan development under the ACUPCC follows three milestones. By the two-month milestone, signatories commit to having created formal institutional structures (and where appropriate, departments) {{for the express purpose of}} guiding the development of the plan as well as implementation of the other elements of the commitment. By the one-year milestone, signatories commit to having completed a greenhouse gas inventory, in accordance with the GHG protocol, with accordances in place to update the figures on a bi-yearly basis. The two-year milestone builds upon the greenhouse gas inventory, requiring that signatories create a comprehensive action plan for achieving climate neutrality. This action plan must include certain minimum elements: a target date for complete climate neutrality, intermediate institutional goals and target dates, steps to integrate climate neutrality and related concerns with educational curriculum and research, and institutional mechanisms for tracking intermediate goals above and beyond the specific structures outlined by the ACUPCC. The menu of possible actions includes conforming to LEED Silver standards or greater, purchasing Energy Star products, and encouraging and fostering use of public transportation. Finally, the reporting section of the three-part plan requires <b>signatory</b> <b>institutions</b> to make the details of their plans, inventories, and progress publicly available through AASHE. The final one-sentence paragraph of the text mentions the need to spread the knowledge contained in the commitment and recruit more signatories through institutional diplomacy.|$|R

40|$|Over 450 chancellors {{and presidents}} have signed the Presidents Climate Commitment. This {{was done with}} the best intentions, and with the strong {{encouragement}} of students, staff, faculty, and facilities staff; it feels like the right thing to do. However, making the commitment and implementing a program that meets its goals represent two very different tasks. This workshop will review current programs for addressing the climate challenge; identify their many obstacles; and explore strategies for overcoming these obstacles and achieving carbon neutrality. The format for this workshop will be simple. A matrix based on the most common issues and their possible solutions will be reviewed. In addition to our own information, we will use data collected from a handful of institutions as a guide. During the workshop, which will include the participation of key Signatories, we will solicit additional input from attendees regarding the solutions they have developed. This will be a highly interactive session. Issues and solutions will be recorded at the meeting and results will be distributed to participants. Working with the conference planning committee, we will identify participating <b>Signatories</b> and candidate <b>institutions</b> for soliciting initial input via written questionnaire; we will follow up with phone or email interviews...|$|R
40|$|The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is a {{voluntary}} investor-led initiative, {{backed by the}} United Nations. Together, the six principles are meant to provide a ‘best practice’ code of conduct for institutional investors seeking to adopt responsible investment practices with a secondary goal of contributing to improved corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Launched in 2006, the PRI has grown to be the single largest global investor initiative with over 700 <b>signatory</b> financial <b>institutions</b> representing assets under management in excess of $US 20 trillion. Contributing to the broader literature on plausible explanations for why firms participate in voluntary initiatives, the thesis is primarily concerned {{with the question of}} what has motivated institutional investors to create and publicly commit to the PRI. A review of the broader trends behind the growth of responsible investment and the emergence of the PRI indicates the dominant utilitarian, cost-benefit logic is not wholly persuasive in understanding investor motivations. The research findings indicate that decisions to integrate ESG issues and publicly commit to adopting the PRI should be primarily viewed as a response to formal pressures by external stakeholders and actors in an investor’s institutional environment. Regulatory and stakeholder influences in the form of NGO advocacy campaigns have established normative standards directed towards the conduct of investors. As public opinion has shifted to put greater emphasis on sustainable development, the image and reputation of a pension scheme in relation to these trends have come under increasing scrutiny such that being perceived as a ‘responsible’ investor – sometimes {{even in the absence of}} a direct market rationale – has become a central driver behind the growth of responsible investment. The decision to adopt the PRI and establish beyond-compliance commitments to integrate ESG issues into investment decision-making should principally be seen as embedded in broader reputational risk management strategies. These findings support complex market rationalism explanations for firm participation in voluntary initiatives which suggest that firms commit to such principles or codes of conduct as a means of assuring stakeholders that their concerns are being internalized into corporate practices. A secondary focus of the thesis is to examine signatory implementation to-date, assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the voluntary measure for the promotion of more socially-responsible and environmentally-sustainable investments. While substantial progress has been shown by a small group of PRI signatories, it remains unclear whether the PRI has generated significant improvement across the broader signatory base. The PRI suffers from several weaknesses commonly identified in the literature on voluntary initiatives. First, a lack of accountability measures limits incentives for investors to go beyond business-as-usual. Second, less stringent voluntary standards like the PRI are likely to suffer from adverse selection and free riding, therefore threatening the credibility of the initiative’s reputation over the longer-term. Ironically, weaknesses in the institutional design of the PRI may undermine the very reputational benefit sought after by signatories...|$|R
40|$|The European Convention on Human Rights is {{the most}} {{effective}} human rights regime in the world. The Convention (ECHR), which entered into force in 1953, established a basic catalogue of rights binding on the <b>signatories,</b> and new <b>institutions</b> charged with monitoring and enforcing compliance. Distinctive at its conception, the ECHR has since evolved into an intricate legal system. The High Contracting Parties have steadily upgraded the regime’s scope and capacities, in successive treaty revisions. They have added new rights, enhanced the powers of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and strengthened the links between individual applicants and the regime. For its part, the Strasbourg Court has built a sophisticated jurisprudence, whose progressive tenor and expansive reach has helped to propel the system forward. Today, the Court is an important, autonomous source of authority on the nature and content of fundamental rights in Europe. In addition to providing justice in individual cases, it works to identify and to consolidate universal standards of rights protection, in the face of wide national diversity and a steady stream of seemingly intractable problems. This book focuses on the impact of the Court and the Convention on the domestic legal systems of the regime’s members, a topic that has been understudied, given its increasing importance. Two previously published pieces of research inspired and guided this project. The book entitled “The European Court and the National Courts: Legal Change in its Social, Political, and Economic Context”, published in 1998, presented a series of single-country reports and comparative analyses of how the national courts reacted to, and ultimately, accommodated the European Court of Justice’s doctrine of the supremacy of European Community law. One premise of that earlier volume, which we share, is that national judges are important actors in their own right in the process through which European law becomes effective in national legal orders. This volume’s scope is somewhat wider, in that the reports examine the role of all national officials, not only judges, in facilitating or resisting the influence of the Convention. The basic template for the research was established by Helen Keller’s pilot study entitled “Reception of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in Poland and Switzerland”, an agenda we extended for this project. A first point of departure was the view that the Court is today institutionally well-positioned to exercise such influence. The Court has final jurisdiction over disputes concerning the content of the Convention, the compliance with the Convention of the High Contracting Parties, and the scope of its own jurisdiction (Kompetenz-Kompetenz); it has a burgeoning caseload in the form of individual applications; and it has produced a case law that defines what States owe to their own citizens under the Convention. A second point of departure was the observation that the regime’s influence on national officials and their decision making varies widely across States and across time. Indeed, as our research shows, the Court’s impact has been broad and pervasive in some States, and weak in others. Moreover, in those States that have been heavily influenced by the Convention, impact has been registered through quite different processes. How national officials use Convention norms, {{and the extent to which}} they resist or adapt to the Court’s case law, has also changed across time, sometimes radically. Our major objective, then, was to describe and analyse this variance, as systematically as possible, and to take some initial steps toward explaining it. This volume reports our results. Each of the nine substantive chapters examines comparatively what we will call “the reception of the ECHR” in two States. By reception, we mean how – that is, through what mechanisms – national officials confront, make use of, and resist or give agency to Convention rights. The book is fundamentally a work of comparative law, albeit with a twist. The project focuses empirical attention on the capacity of an international regime, and its transnational court, to shape law and politics at the domestic level. It thus addresses some of the same basic questions asked by students of the Europeanization of law and politics, of multi-level governance, and of the constitutionalization of treaty-based legal systems. The project also has a normative dimension, namely, to identify how the effectiveness of Convention rights in national legal orders has been, and can be, enhanced over time. We chart how the status of the Convention in domestic law and politics has changed over time, and examine, from a comparative perspective, the regime’s overall effectiveness...|$|R
