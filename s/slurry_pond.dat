Wiley’s granddaughter told him that the coal was making the children sick, driving Wiley to take his protest to then Governor Joe Manchin (now a U.S. Senator from West Virginia), and demand help from the state. Manchin and other West Virginia politicians argue that the state’s economy and its jobs depend on coal mining. Manchin calls himself [...] "friend of coal". But the film presents statistics showing that over the last 30 years while coal production has increased 140% due to the use of massive mining equipment and explosives, the number of jobs has decreased by 65%, due to the use of technology. While members of the coal industry maintain that environmental regulations take away jobs, others in the film suggest that the use of machines and explosives - in particular in the pursuit of strip mining - has been the cause of job losses in recent decades.|$|E
40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Amberly Hope Tobin, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Organic Geochemistry, {{presented}} on August 4 th 2016, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: OHD PROCESSING OF COAL WASTE MATERIALS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Susan M. Rimmer This research addresses coal-waste utilization via the OHD {{process and the}} implications for both economic and environmental impacts. The goal of this project is to determine if coal-waste products can be processed by the OHD technique. Furthermore, this project will determine what types of products are produced from the coal-waste materials and will compare these to those produced by the OHD processing of raw coal. This research {{has the potential to}} be beneficial to the coal industry as OHD would allow production of high-value products from what is currently viewed as a waste material; additionally, this research will provide a way to recycle what is considered a hazardous waste product and provide an incentive to reclaim coal slurry ponds that are an environmental concern. A preliminary suite of grab samples from an active coal <b>slurry</b> <b>pond</b> along with a stream reject sample were obtained in order to determine if these types of materials could be processed via OHD. After these samples were deemed viable in the OHD process, core samples were taken from a large <b>slurry</b> <b>pond.</b> These cores were then ii sampled at 2 ft (0. 61 m) intervals. The key analyses performed were geochemical, petrographic, OHD, and GC-MS. Geochemical analysis included carbon, sulfur, moisture, volatile matter, ash, and fixed carbon content of the coal-waste samples before OHD, and provided a basis for comparison with raw coal samples. Petrographic analysis was performed to determine the maceral composition before the OHD processing. The OHD process is the core technique of this research project. The preliminary <b>slurry</b> <b>pond</b> samples were processed in a small semi-continuous OHD reactor. While the stream reject and <b>slurry</b> <b>pond</b> core samples were processed using a continuous OHD reactor, as this type of reactor is best suited for fine-grained slurries. GC-MS was used to examine the OHD liquid products analysis in order to determine the types of compounds present in the final liquefied product; these products were then compared to raw coal OHD products in order to determine their economic potential. Petrography of the coal-waste materials showed that these samples did contain a notable amount of coal; predominantly vitrinites and inertinites were observed in the samples. Geochemical analysis proved that there were significant amounts of organic carbon in these materials, ranging between 25 and 37 %. OHD processing was successful on all coal-waste materials, although the continuous OHD reactor tended to work better with the fine-grained slurries than the semi-continuous OHD reactor. The GC-MS analysis of the coal-waste OHD product showed very similar suites of compounds to that of a bulk coal OHD product; in general, almost all major compounds that are found in a typical coal OHD product were also found in the coal-waste OHD products. This suggests that these slurry ponds, which are typically regarded as waste products, could be viable feedstocks for OHD processing...|$|E
40|$|A {{case study}} for the {{reclamation}} of a <b>slurry</b> <b>pond</b> {{as part of an}} offshore reclamation project in Singapore is presented in this paper. The <b>slurry</b> <b>pond</b> covered an area of 180 ha. The slurry in the pond was recently deposited ultra-soft high-plasticity clay. The water content of the slurry was more than 120 % and the undrained shear strength was less than 8 kPa. The reclamation was first carried out by spreading sand fill in thin layers 20 cm thick using a specially designed sand spreader. The filling speed was carefully controlled to allow the slurry to be consolidated before more fill could be placed. Despite the precautions a failure occurred, in the form of mud bursting. As a remedial measure, geotextile sheets were used to cover a total area of 630 000 m 2 before more sand fill was placed. After the completion of fill placement, fill surcharge and prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) were used to improve and accelerate the consolidation of the slurry. As the performance of PVDs would deteriorate after they had undergone large deformation, they were installed in two passes. In the first pass PVDs were inserted with a square grid spacing of 2. 0 m. After nearly 1. 5 m of settlement had taken place, the second pass of PVDs with the same spacing was installed at the centre of the square grid of the PVDs installed in the first pass. After nearly 4 years of consolidation, the top of the slurry had settled more than 3 m. The undrained shear strength had also increased substantially. Therefore the use of PVDs for the improvement of the ultra-soft slurry was successful in this project...|$|E

40|$|There exits {{multiphase}} flow of oxygenized air, lime slurry and limestone particles in power plant flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system. A rotary jet stirring device (RJSD) is {{installed in the}} <b>slurry</b> <b>pond</b> at the bottom center of absorption tank to get an appropriate mixing flow field so far as possible to get off sulfur dioxide. By employing the standard k-Îµ turbulence model and the Eulerian multiphase model, numerical investigations for liquid-solid and liquid-solid-gas flow field are presented to discuss the distribution of flow hydrodynamic parameters under a certain operational condition, respectively. In liquid-solid flow, limestone particle concentration {{shows a decreasing trend}} with the increase of the rotation angular velocity. The core jet length of the rotary mixer tend to be much longer with the increase of jet velocity under the surrounding pressure, but the dispersed slurry velocity tends to reduce after an initial increasing during the starting period due to the inadequate mixing process. This phenomenon shows that the stirring down-stream {{is more important than the}} advection stream in liquid-solid condition. Compared to the liquid-solid condition, the distribution of the air volume of fraction in gas-liquid-solid flow is getting uniform because of the participation of the solid phase, and the down-stream plays an important role in air lateral distribution. The concentration of the limestone particle in liquid-solid condition is higher than in the {{multiphase flow}} field. The reason is that the particle distributing velocity near the tank wall is lower and the vertical velocity is higher than in the liquid-solid condition when the jet down-stream velocity is equal. The numerical results could be a useful exploration for an attempt usage of rotary jet device in FGD system.

40|$|Many {{abandoned}} mine lands (AML) continue to present significant environmental concerns. The abandoned Friar Tuck Mining Complex in Greene and Sullivan counties, Indiana, continues to impair local water quality despite closing in 1952 for operations and multiple remediation attempts. Most areas within the Friar Tuck Mining Complex {{have been successfully}} remediated; however, {{the area of research}} interest requires additional treatment and continues to be impacted by runoff from gob piles. Subsequently, areas characterized by a loss of vegetation where mine seeps occur behave unpredictably and are characterized by the exposure of bare soil. These mine seep areas are of particular concern because contaminated soil may leave the site during summer months as aerosols due to soil desiccation. The primary goal of this project was to evaluate spatial variability in the distribution of metals in surface soils. In May 2010, 258 soil samples were collected at the Friar Tuck Mining Complex to evaluate metal accumulation and bioavailability using several different geochemical techniques, including bulk geochemistry following reaction with water and acid and a sequential extraction technique. Results indicate that surface soils at the Friar Tuck Mining Complex continue to be degraded, pH is moderately to highly acid (pH= 4 - 1) in areas of mine seeps, surface flow, and where the <b>slurry</b> <b>pond</b> narrows and begins to discharge into Mud creek. Surface soils also have elevated concentrations of bioavailable metals due to the persistent influence of AMD, such as Zn, Cu, Cr and Pb, especially in areas of mine seeps, surface flow, and water ponding.

40|$|Process based {{models have}} been {{developed}} to simulate ammonia (NH 3) volatilization after surface slurry spreading, but none of them have managed to realistically represent slurry infiltration into the soil {{and the development of a}} specific slurry interface that modifies surface temperature and humidity conditions. To account for these physical effects, it is proposed to add to the model a layer of slurry on the surface of the soil. It is hypothesized that the slurry layer can be regarded as a soil layer from the hydrological point of view, characterized by its specific hydraulic parameters, and whose thickness depends on the quantity and bulk density of the slurry dry matter. An assessment was performed by comparisons with measurements of NH 3 volatilization fluxes from two specific datasets. The addition of the slurry layer clearly improved the simulations of both the NH 3 volatilization flux and ammoniacal nitrogen (NHX-N) distribution in the soil. This concept together with its parameterization proved to be relevant for accounting for effect of the slurry application rates on volatilization, and subsequent abatement obtained with band spreading. The efficiency factor was improved from - 0. 35 to 0. 71. This concept also succeeded in describing the slurry layer state over the whole range from <b>slurry</b> <b>ponding</b> at the surface to the dried-out state, via a slurry in an intermediate drying state. This was actually a prerequisite for the good simulation of NH 3 volatilization over the whole volatilization event.

30|$|Processing of mined {{product to}} meet {{customer}} requirements is common and necessary. Current bituminous coal cleaning technologies for coarse coal employ density separation while fine coal cleaning applies surface chemistry-based methods, (Demir et al. 1999). Processing plant recoveries in the US range 50  %– 80  % depending upon seam thickness and associated strata {{in the roof}} and floor with typical values around 60  %– 65  %. The 35  %– 40  % reject material consists of two components: coarse coal processing waste (CCPW) larger than 100  mesh (150  micron) size {{or in some cases}} larger than 3  mm (1 / 8  inch) size, and fine coal processing waste (FCPW) or slurry generally less than 100  mesh sizes. The term “coal refuse” refers to coal processing waste and reject from rotary breakers prior to the ROM coal entering the processing plant circuits. The ratio of CCPW/FCPW varies depending upon the mining site but the ratio of 2.5 : 1 by weight is typical. Current processing trends tend to increase the top particle size reporting to the fine circuit to be about 10  mesh to reduce the load on the intermediate size circuits or to allow processing of the entire + 10  mesh fraction using a single processing unit operation. This will lead to higher amounts reporting to fine circuits which typically use inefficient technologies for recovering the coal. Some processing plant operators have opted to dispose fine material {{due to the lack of}} technologies available for treating moderately difficult-to-clean fine coal and for dewatering of the final product. The result of these practices would be increased number of FCPW <b>ponds</b> (<b>slurry</b> <b>ponds)</b> containing a significant amount of recoverable high purity carbon material (Black et al. 1996; Beck 2007).|$|R

40|$|MIng (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Beneficiation of {{fine coal}} (+ 500 μm – 2000 μm) is a {{worldwide}} {{problem in the}} mining industry, especially dry beneficiation of fine coal. Coal beneficiation can be divided primarily into two methods, namely wet- and dry beneficiation. Wet beneficiation methods are utilized more in today‘s industry because of the sharp separation efficiency that can be achieved. These processes include wet jigging, dense medium cyclones, spiral beneficiation etc. Due {{to the lack of}} a sufficient water supply in some regions around the world including South Africa, dry beneficiation methods are becoming more popular. Recent mechanized mining methods caused the fraction of fines from coal mines to increase over the years. However, due to old inefficient technologies, coal fines contained in <b>slurry</b> <b>ponds</b> could not be beneficiated and had to be discarded. One new dry beneficiation technology that has been used and researched extensively is the fluidized dense medium bed (FDMB) technology. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether fine coal can be successfully beneficiated with a FDMB. It also has to be determined whether adding magnetite and introducing a jigging (pulse) motion to the air feed will increase the separation efficiency of the fluidization process. Witbank seam 4 and a Waterberg coal was used in experiments during this study. A coarse (+ 1180 μm – 2000 μm), fine (+ 500 μm – 1180 μm) and a mix of the two samples were prepared and tested. It was found that adding magnetite to the feed of the fluidized bed did not increase the separation efficiency. However, previous studies indicated the opposite results with regards to magnetite addition. The difference in results obtained could be prescribed to the ultrafine nature of the magnetite and the small coal particles size range used. If the presence of fine particles in the bed increases, the stability of fluidization decreases. In turn, the separation efficiency of the process decreases. Subjecting the feed air flow to a pulsating motion did not have a significant effect on separation. Good results were still obtained with jigging experiments, although not better than with normal fluidization. Stratification of coal particles according to quality was evident by the results obtained during experiments. The quality of coal increases from the bottom to the top of the bed. Overall the fluidized bed, in the absence of magnetite, was found to be a sufficient de-ashing process and further research on this technology could be very beneficial to the coal industry.
