5000|$|Truckin: Truckin is a shuffle step {{variation}} popularized after the vaudeville era. The right hand is held up (as in a right turn signal) with {{the index finger}} extended and wagging. In Harlem Truckin the shoulder is set back. Feet are parallel at all times. With both feet together and facing slight left the right foot <b>scoopes</b> down and brushes the floor, the left foot is then gathered at the right ankle and the right heel twists (this should cause forward movement as the foot <b>scoopes</b> past the other foot). The action is repeated creating a [...] "hearts in the snow" [...] effect from the overlapping steps. At {{the same time the}} left hand is placed over the stomach (like a waiter holding a towel) and never really moves. The stomach twistes with the feet therefore, the [...] "stomach rubs the hand". If truckin is being done around a circle the outside hand is always up.|$|R

Not being {{furnished}} with such <b>Scoopes</b> as our Enemies made use of, in tossing their hand Grenadoes some distance off, {{one of our own}} Soldiers aiming to throw one over the Wall into the Counterscarp among the Enemy, it so happen'd that he unfortunately miss'd his Aim, and the Grenade fell down again on our side the Wall, very near the Person who fir'd it. He starting back to save himself, and some others who saw it fall, doing the like, those who knew nothing of the Matter fell into a sudden Confusion, and imagining some greater danger than there really was, every body was struck with a panick Fear, and endeavour'd to be the first who should quit the Bastion, and secure himself by a real Shame from an imaginary Evil. Thus was a Bastion, that had been gloriously gain'd, inadvertently deserted; and that too, with the Loss of almost as many Men in the Retreat, as had been slain in the Onset, and the Enemy most triumphantly again took Possession of it.|$|R
