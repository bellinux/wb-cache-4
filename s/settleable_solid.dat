Overview Section 303 (d) (1) (C) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) implementing regulations (40 CFR Part 130) require the establishment of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the achievement of state water quality standards when a waterbody is water quality-limited. A TMDL identifies the degree of pollution control needed to maintain compliance with standards using an appropriate margin of safety. The focus of the TMDL is the reduction of pollutant inputs to a level (or "load") that fully supports the designated uses of a given waterbody. The mechanisms used to address water quality problems after the TMDL is developed can include best management practices and/or effluent limits and monitoring required unde...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} and toxicity of untreatedwastewater at Davis Station, East Antarctica,were investigated to inform decisions regarding the appropriate level {{of treatment for}} local discharge purposes and more generally, {{to better understand the}} risk associated with dispersal and impact of wastewaters in Antarctica. Suspended solids, nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), biological oxygen demand (BOD), metals, organic contaminants, surfactants and microbiological load were measured at various locations throughout the wastewater discharge system. Wastewater quality and properties varied greatly between buildings on station, each ofwhich has separate holding tanks. Nutrients, BOD and <b>settleable</b> <b>solid</b> levelswere higher than standard municipal wastewaters. Microbiological loads were typical of untreated wastewater.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{realistic}} values of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), an ultrasonic flow meter and an automatic water sampler were installed at the basin outlet for three Reno tributaries (Bologna Apennine, Italy). The basins have a similar geological setting: in the Sillaro basin, however, clays represent the dominant feature; in the Lavino basin, sandstone and clay marl are widely present; and {{the main part of}} the Savena watershed is characterised by sandrock, pebbly sandstone and clay marls. These differences are recognisable in the particle size distribution of the suspended sediment samples collected in these basins. The aim of this work is to estimate the SSCs of river water samples with two indirect methods, turbidity measurement and free <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> in Imhoff cones, and the relations with suspended sediment concentration and particle size distribution. Alongside these investigations, laboratory analyses were performed in order to validate these methods under controlled conditions. The turbidity measurements were highly significant, but their reliability was influenced by the concentration and the particle size distribution. In order to estimate the SSCs, it was necessary to establish specific regression curves for each stream. The estimate of the SSC obtained through a free <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> analysis was not only reliable but also less sensitive to sample characteristics. The measure of the <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> after 1 and 24 h presented a constant relationship in all the samples from the three streams, due to the compaction of the sediment. The measure of the <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> after 24 h gave a better estimate of the SSC. This last method was shown to be inexpensive, fast, reliable and applicable to all the situations studied...|$|R
25|$|Secondary {{treatment}} is a treatment process for wastewater (or sewage) {{to achieve a}} certain degree of effluent quality by using a sewage treatment plant with physical phase separation to remove <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> and a biological process to remove dissolved and suspended organic compounds.

40|$|Settling ponds {{properly}} designed, constructed, operated {{and maintained}} are absolutely necessary for improving effluent water quality. The settling pond {{system must be}} in place and able to retain sediment laden water before constructing the placer mine, The use of vibrating screen decks or rotating trommel screens not only increase gold recovery, they also dramatically decrease {{the amount of water}} that needs to be treated. The control of erosion of disturbed areas by surface runoff should also be incorporated into an overall sediment control plan. Settling ponds are used at placer mines for clarifying water due to their efficiency, simplicity and low cost. Settling ponds are efficient at removing <b>settleable</b> <b>solids,</b> generally those soil particles greater in size than from 0. 002 to 0. 02 mm in diameter. Settling ponds will permit the <b>settleable</b> <b>solids,</b> which includes the fine sand and silt fractions, to accumulate but are not successful in eliminating the turbidity caused by the presence of finely dispersed particles in the clay size range...|$|R
50|$|Removal of {{suspended}} particles by sedimentation {{depends upon the}} size and specific gravity of those particles.

40|$|A top-loading {{settling}} {{column is}} described {{and used to}} characterize the settling properties of the solids in the discharge water from a commercial rainbow trout production facility. Mass-based and phosphorus-based settling curves are presented. The median settling velocity on a mass-basis for the <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> was 1. 7 cm s 1. The median settling velocity for the settleable phosphorus was 1. 15 cm s 1. Manually stripping fecal material from rainbow trout resulted in <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> with a median settling velocity of 0. 7 cm s 1. Examination of the settling velocity curves show that halving the overflow rate (OFR) from 2 to 1 cm s 1 changes the removal efficiency from 0. 61 to 0. 73, an increase of about 20 %. Halving the OFR again to 0. 5 cm s 1 increases the removal efficiency to 0. 81, an improvement of about 11 %. Settling characteristics of aquacultural solids will vary from facility to facility.

50|$|Most of the {{alternative}} treatment technologies applied today treat wastes after they exit the septic tank; the tank retains <b>settleable</b> <b>solids,</b> grease, and oils and provides an environment for partial digestion of settled organic wastes. Post-tank treatment can include aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (with no or low oxygen) biological treatment in suspended or fixed-film reactors, physical/chemical treatment, soil infiltration, fixed-media filtration, and/or disinfection. The application and sizing of treatment units based on these technologies are defined by performance requirements, wastewater characteristics, and site conditions.|$|R

40|$|A {{key element}} in a stream-monitoring {{programme}} for sediment transport is {{the choice of the}} measuring technique for suspended sediment concentration: this can highly affect both project costs and data reliability. The gravimetric method represents the standard analysis to directly measure suspended sediment concentration in a water sample. Indirect techniques are often employed for their inexpensiveness, although they need to be calibrated on gravimetric analysis results. In this study, the reliability of <b>settleable</b> <b>solids</b> in Imhoff cones was addressed as an alternative indirect method to estimate suspended sediment concentration (SSC), verifying the results with the turbidity measures of a laboratory nephelometer. The results show a high correlation of settled solids with suspended sediment concentration. Also, the results from the turbidimetric analysis showed a good correlation with SSC, but limited to water samples that did not need dilution. Measurements were repeated after storing the samples for 1 month: results exhibit an increase in turbidity and <b>settleable</b> <b>solids,</b> probably due to algae growth and anaerobic processes with the production of gases, causing an increase in matter. From our study, the Imhoff cone was shown to be a useful instrument to estimate suspended sediment concentration for the simplicity, the reliability and the low cost of their results. Our results prove how Imhoff cones are preferable to turbidimetric analysis to estimate SSC, specifically for highly turbid samples...|$|R
