He considered the album as [...] "more focused" [...] than its predecessor. He noted that Free continued [...] "the mood of some of the songs of the first album and the melodies and mixing up some of the heavy <b>stuff</b> <b>with</b> the programming. As opposed to the instrumental, straight ahead, progressive stuff we did". He attributed the band's sound to the [...] "very different" [...] ideas he and Matheos' had.|$|E
500|$|Coxon {{struggled}} with drinking problems and, in {{a rejection of}} the group's former Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. In the 2010 documentary on the band, No Distance Left to Run, Coxon stated that he was getting more influenced by American guitarists as [...] "a lot of them were doing very interesting <b>stuff</b> <b>with</b> guitars and I needed to be nourished. I suppose as a guitar player and there was none of that happening in English music although English music was now more popular [...] I started listening to more stuff from the States from smaller labels." ...|$|E

In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase <b>stuff</b> <b>with</b> Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna.

500|$|Although {{the game}} is based on Greek mythology, the {{development}} team gave themselves [...] "lots of freedom" [...] to modify the myths, and Jaffe said they took the [...] "coolest aspects of the subject" [...] and wrote a story using those elements. In an interview for Eurogamer, he said while the idea for God of War was his own, the concept owed a debt to Capcom because he had played Onimusha and said [...] "let's do that with Greek Mythology". He was inspired {{in part by the}} 1981 feature film, Clash of the Titans, saying, [...] "the real high concept for me was ... merging it with Heavy Metal magazine". He said he liked both [...] "the kids <b>stuff...</b> <b>with</b> Greek Mythology" [...] and the idea of adding more adult themes such as sex and violence.|$|E

In February 2012, One Direction expressed interest in working with Ed Sheeran, and in June 2012, Sheeran confirmed that they were in contact: [...] "I'm going into the studio in August to produce the tracks for them.

500|$|Other {{critics are}} more demanding. M. Keith Booker writes: For their part, the Coens deny any {{intention}} of presenting an allegorical message. They chose the detectives' names deliberately, but [...] "we just {{wanted them to be}} representative of the Axis world powers at the time. It just seemed kind of amusing. It's a tease. All that <b>stuff</b> <b>with</b> Charlie– [...] the [...] "Heil Hitler!" [...] business– [...] sure, it's all there, but it's kind of a tease." [...] In 2001, Joel responded to a question about critics who provide extended comprehensive analysis: [...] "That's how they've been trained to watch movies. In Barton Fink, we may have encouraged it– [...] like teasing animals at the zoo. The movie is intentionally ambiguous in ways they may not be used to seeing".|$|E
500|$|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo {{were formed}} in late 1972 by Richard Elfman, as a musical theatre troupe. As Richard's {{interest}} shifted to filmmaking, he passed {{leadership of the}} band to younger brother Danny Elfman, who had begun to lose interest in musical theatre, and had gained interest in other musical styles such as ska, and had become [...] "sick of lugging around so much <b>stuff</b> <b>with</b> the theatre troupe. Towards the end", Elfman remembers, [...] "it was a big production... there was, like a semi full of stuff. And that was becoming burdensome. So, for me, {{the idea of being}} a band that can fit all their gear into a van and set up in a club, and an hour later be playing, became a goal." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music at}} the start of the episode of the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon parodies the theme from the {{original}} [...] series. Itchy bursts out of Scratchy's stomach in a parody of the creature from the Alien films. Homer hopes that his crew will not be sent to [...] "that terrible Planet of the Apes", only to suddenly figure out the film's ending; he then unwittingly performs Charlton Heston's final scene in the film. Much of the episode parodies The Right <b>Stuff,</b> <b>with</b> sequences such as Barney and Homer's training, Homer's walk to the shuttle and the shuttle's re-entry paying homage to the film. Barney sings the first part of the Major-General's Song from Gilbert and Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance while doing flips to show how fit he is, while Homer responds with cartwheels, reciting [...] "There once was a man from Nantucket...".|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers {{praised the}} film for being more subdued {{than most of}} Sci-Fi's gore-filled {{creature}} films and for its use of a live tiger rather than poor CGI effects. However, David Johnson of DVD Verdict, heavily criticized the film for [...] "its significant dearth of righteous tiger-attack action". He found the implied violence resulted in a boring film that will not satisfy more horror film buff: [...] "the gore-hounds that might be attracted to {{the promise of a}} big-ass tiger sinking his teeth into some hapless rednecks will be almost certainly disappointed. The big bummer is that we don't even get any tiger on human direct action until the very end, and that's boilerplate Lassie <b>stuff</b> <b>with</b> a stuntman fending off a laid-back stunt tiger". Conversely, unlike other reviewers, he praised the characters, feeling they were interesting and ended up being ones he [...] "somewhat cared about." ...|$|E

Steve is an amazing actor." [...] Lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret agreed to close their store {{to the public for}} filming. In the episode, Angela reveals that she wears large sizes of clothes purchased from American Girl, a doll store chain, but will not shop at children's retailer Gap Kids because it is [...] "too flashy."

500|$|In an {{interview}} by Neil Bennett from Digital Arts Magazine, Kricfalusi {{revealed that he}} would have taken a different approach to the animation if he were to animate the entire episode. Primarily, the animation would be slower paced {{than it was in the}} 35-second-long segment. The couch gag was done at a faster pace so he was able to include all of his ideas. Kricfalusi explains that [...] ", I would definitely keep on experimenting with the way they move and the acting. I'm sure I would do of my trademark long scenes of two characters interacting with each other without a cut. I would [...] want to do more <b>stuff</b> <b>with</b> Marge. I loved animating her and was inspired by the way the Fleischers animated Olive Oyl. I couldn't animate a whole half hour myself, so I would hire other animators (and designers, painters, etc.) with strong styles and cast them according to which parts of the story would best take advantage of their individual talent." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{songs of}} the album are noted for their {{changing}} dynamics – with [...] "middle sections [...] turn into this mass orchestrated swarm and ridiculous time signatures" [...] which include musical references to 1970s soft rock bands such as Wings, Eagles and Bread - summed by Hawkins by saying the band [...] "wanted {{to make sure that}} everything 'built' on this record, that each instrument started somewhere and went somewhere else {{in the course of a}} song". The drummer attributed this to the acoustic tour leading the band to [...] "shed some of the fear of incorporating mellower <b>stuff</b> <b>with</b> the heavy stuff", and Grohl added that [...] "we wanted the stops to be pin-drop silent before exploding. If we had a beautiful melody, we'd throw a fucking string quartet in there. So we did everything we could to really magnify all those elements and that was fun. Usually you have a few parameters you're afraid to pass but, this time, there was no fear of going too far." [...] Mix engineer Rich Costey added that his work ...|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{said the}} film [...] "succeeds well enough as a genial {{diversion}} {{and sometimes a}} delightful one, predicated on the rarely heeded Hollywood wisdom that less really can be more." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, [...] "Although the story dynamics are fundamentally silly and the family <b>stuff,</b> <b>with</b> its parallel father-daughter melodrama, is elemental button-pushing, a good cast led by a winning Paul Rudd puts the nonsense over in reasonably disarming fashion." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Playful in unexpected ways and graced with a genuinely off-center sense of humor, Ant-Man (engagingly directed by Peyton Reed) is light on its feet the way the standard-issue Marvel behemoths never are." [...] Kim Newman of Empire wrote that it [...] "straddles as many genres as the Avengers films have characters but manages to do most of them pretty well. Extremely likable, with {{a few moments of}} proper wonder." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "This film is a passable piece of drone work from the ever-expanding Marvel-Disney colony." ...|$|E

Reviewers said that the film mostly belongs {{to the level of}} Pulp Fiction; Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called it [...] "Bollywood's first all-the-way-out-to-there pulp fiction". Bedi wrote, [...] "there's Buñuel in the Bengali dons, there's Kurosawa...in that surreal train car in which Charlie lives, there's Ray in money-floating dreams that Charlie has". Keshav Chaturvedi of the Hindustan Times compared the apocalyptical gang war in the climax to Apocalypse Now (1979). He said, [...] "Bhardwaj just demolishes the cliches of Bollywood. In ripping apart the stereotype, he gives us a prototype: a Bollywood that deals with alienation,...angst,... and atrocity."

[...] Early in development when Barlog was still with the team, he expressed interest in a cooperative mode [...] "if we can do something unique with it". In November 2009, Asmussen told GamePro that although a multiplayer option had been discussed, it was unsuitable for God of War III: [...] "There's a story we want to tell and an experience we want to deliver, and multi-player doesn't fit into that." [...] By December 2009, the game was in its final developmental stages.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and <b>stuff.</b> <b>With</b> all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat.
