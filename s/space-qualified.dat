2500|$|Each Galileo {{satellite}} has two master passive {{hydrogen maser}} atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks which {{are independent of}} one other. As precise and stable <b>space-qualified</b> atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10−9 or 1/1,000,000,000 s) translates into a [...] positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate {{the time that it}} takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.|$|E

40|$|BurstCube will detect long GRBs, {{attributed}} {{to the collapse of}} massive stars, short GRBs (sGRBs), resulting from binary neutron star mergers, as well as other gamma-ray transients in the energy range 10 - 1000 keV. sGRBs are of particular interest because they are predicted to be the counterparts of gravitational wave (GW) sources soon to be detectable by LIGO/Virgo. BurstCube contains 4 CsI scintillators coupled with arrays of compact low-power Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) on a 6 U Dellingr bus, a flagship modular platform that is easily modifiable for a variety of 6 U CubeSat architectures. BurstCube will complement existing facilities such as Swift and Fermi in the short term, and provide a means for GRB detection, localization, and characterization in the interim time before the next generation future gamma-ray mission flies, as well as <b>space-qualify</b> SiPMs and test technologies for future use on larger gamma-ray missions. The ultimate configuration of BurstCube is to have a set of ∼ 10 BurstCubes to provide all-sky coverage to GRBs for substantially lower cost than a full-scale mission.

40|$|The Clementine Mission, a {{joint project}} of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) and NASA, has been planned {{primarily}} to test and demonstrate a suite of lightweight sensors and other lightweight spacecraft components under extended exposure to the space environment. Although the primary objective of the mission is to <b>space-qualify</b> sensors for Department of Defense applications, it was recognized in 1990 that such a mission might also be designed to acquire scientific observations of the Moon and of Apollo asteroid (1620) Geographos. This possibility was explored jointly by SDIO and NASA, including representatives from NASA's Discovery Program Science Working Group, in early 1991. Besides the direct return of scientific information, {{one of the benefits}} envisioned from a joint venture was the development of lightweight components for possible future use in NASA's Discovery-class spacecraft. In Jan. 1992, SDIO informed NASA of its intent to fly a 'Deep Space Program Science Experiment,' now popularly called Clementine; NASA then formed an advisory science working group to assist in the early development of the mission. The Clementine spacecraft is being assembled at the Naval Research Laboratory, which is also in charge of the overall mission design and mission operations. Support for mission design is being provided by GSFC and by JPL. NASA's Deep Space Network will be utilized in tracking and communicating with the spacecraft. Following a recommendation of the COMPLEX committee of the Space Science Board, NASA will issue an NRA and appoint a formal science team in early 1993. Clementine is a 3 -axis stabilized, 200 kg (dry weight) spacecraft that will be launched on a refurbished Titan- 2 G. One of the goals has been to build two spacecraft, including the sensors, for $ 100 M. Total time elapsed from the decision to proceed to the launch will be two years...|$|R

50|$|SpaceWire's {{modulation}} {{and data}} formats generally follow the data strobe encoding - differential ended signaling (DS-DE) {{part of the}} IEEE Std 1355-1995. SpaceWire utilizes asynchronous communication and allows speeds between 2 Mbit/s and 400 Mbit/s. DS-DE is well-favored because it describes modulation, bit formats, routing, flow control and error detection in hardware, with little need for software. SpaceWire also has very low error rates, deterministic system behavior, and relatively simple digital electronics. SpaceWire replaced old PECL differential drivers in the physical layer of IEEE 1355 DS-DE by low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS). SpaceWire also proposes the use of <b>space-qualified</b> 9-pin connectors.|$|E
5000|$|The SNAP-10A was a <b>space-qualified</b> {{nuclear reactor}} power system.

The reactor employed two moveable beryllium reflectors for control, and generated 35 kWt at beginning of life. The system generated electricity by circulating NaK around lead tellurium thermocouples. To mitigate launch hazards, the reactor was never started until it reached a safe orbit. It was launched into earth orbit in April, 1965, and used to power an Agena-D research satellite, built by Lockheed/Martin. The system produced 500W of electrical power during an abbreviated 43-day flight test. The reactor was prematurely shut down by a faulty command receiver. It is predicted to remain in orbit for 4,000 years.|$|E
5000|$|The DF-224 is a <b>space-qualified</b> {{computer}} used {{in space}} missions from the 1980s. It {{was built by}} Rockwell Autonetics. As with many spacecraft computers, the design is very redundant, since servicing in space is at best difficult and often impossible. The configuration had three CPUs, one active and two spares. The main memory consisted of six memory units, each with 8K 24-bit words of plated wire memory, with up to 48K words total. Four memory modules could be powered up at one time, resulting in a maximum of 32K words of available memory, though some applications such as the Hubble Space Telescope used fewer memory banks to allow for graceful failure modes. [...] There were three I/O processors, one operational and two backups. The power supply consisted of 6 independent power converters, with overlapping coverage of the operating functions. [...] The processor used fixed-point arithmetic with a two's complement format.|$|E

The only available <b>space-qualified</b> Digital Signal Processor (DSP) free of International Traffic in Arms Regulations restrictions (ATMEL TSC 21020) faces a poor performance of 60 MFLOPs peak, and it is becoming inadequate to fulfill the computation demand of the space missions.
