5000|$|A type of {{pan shot}} {{in which the}} camera pans so quickly that the {{resulting}} image is badly blurred. It is sometimes used as an editorial transition and {{is also known as}} a <b>swish</b> <b>pan</b> or [...] "flash pan." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Hero {{walks off}} into the distance, and the camera zooms into his panel. The title The Wild Wild West appears. The camera then <b>swish</b> <b>pans</b> to an {{illustration}} of the train, with Conrad's and Martin's names {{on the ends of}} different cars.|$|R
50|$|Biberman {{opened up}} the action a bit, but the plot, based on Stout's Fer-de-Lance (1934), {{defeated}} him. He simply {{did not understand the}} medium; the cast reacts as it would on stage, but in film a stage reaction is overacting. Apart from some filmic touches — <b>swish</b> <b>pans,</b> dissolves, wipes, and an eerie shot of a dead man's hand clutching a newspaper clipping that another hand reaches down to retrieve — Meet Nero Wolfe is like a West End melodrama aimed at the tourist trade — slick, but so ephemeral that two days later the plot has vanished from the memory.|$|R
5000|$|The album's layered {{production}} incorporates spacious beats, oscillating keyboards, throbbing synths, and baroque {{elements such}} as synthetic strings and harpsichords. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly characterizes The-Dream's electronic arrangements as [...] "unorthodox". Tracks on the album share common elements and suite-like sequencing. Allmusic's Andy Kellman dubs Love Hate [...] "a post-Timbaland/post-Neptunes pop album" [...] and calls its sound [...] "state-of-the art pop circa 2007-2008 ... resolutely luminescent". He describes its rhythms as [...] "rubbery" [...] and [...] "sometimes colored by those <b>swishing,</b> <b>panning</b> effects heard in 'Bed' and its many imitators." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times notes a [...] "gooey, robotic ’80s-influenced R&B" [...] and writes that the album [...] "captured the ecstatic sound of pop radio in 2007." [...] Slant Magazine's Wilson McBee views that The-Dream is influenced by [...] "Timbaland's space jams and Prince's gleeful synth lines". Robert Christgau of MSN Music summarized {{the content of the}} album, musing: ...|$|R
500|$|Welles had {{originally}} wanted the entire film to use high contrast cinematography, resembling engravings of the Middle Ages; only the opening title sequence uses this technique. The film's most famous sequence is the Battle of Shrewsbury; only about 180 extras were available and Welles used editing techniques {{to give the}} appearance of armies of thousands. Welles filmed all of the battle scenes in long takes, but cut the shots into fragments to create the effect that he wanted. It took ten days to shoot the scenes and six weeks to edit what became a six-minute sequence. In filming the sequence, Welles often used hand-held cameras, wide-angle lenses, slow motion and speed up shots, static shots, <b>swish</b> <b>pans</b> and constant rapid movement of the characters to create a kinetic and chaotic atmosphere. Anderegg has said that [...] "in the end, both armies have become one huge, awkward, disintegrating war machine, a grotesque robot whose power source slowly begins to fail and finally comes to a frozen halt. Verbal rhetoric—language itself—seems, for the moment, both irrelevant and obscene." ...|$|R
