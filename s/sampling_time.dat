25|$|Temporal {{resolution}} {{is the smallest}} time period of neural activity reliably separated out by fMRI. One element deciding this is the <b>sampling</b> <b>time,</b> the TR. Below a TR of 1 or 2seconds, however, scanning just generates sharper HDR curves, without adding much additional information (e.g. beyond what is alternatively achieved by mathematically interpolating the curve gaps at a lower TR). Temporal resolution can be improved by staggering stimulus presentation across trials. If one-third of data trials are sampled normally, one-third at 1s, 4s, 7s and so on, and the last third at 2s, 5s and 8s, the combined data provide a resolution of 1s, though with only one-third as many total events.|$|E

2500|$|The {{physiological}} blood-flow response largely decides {{the temporal}} sensitivity, {{that is how}} accurately we can measure when neurons are active, in BOLD fMRI. The basic time resolution parameter (<b>sampling</b> <b>time)</b> is designated TR; the TR dictates how often a particular brain slice is excited and allowed to lose its magnetization. [...] TRs could vary from the very short (500ms) to the very long (3s). For fMRI specifically, the hemodynamic response lasts over 10 seconds, rising multiplicatively (that is, {{as a proportion of}} current value), peaking at 4 to 6 seconds, and then falling multiplicatively. Changes in the blood-flow system, the vascular system, integrate responses to neuronal activity over time. Because this response is a smooth continuous function, sampling with ever-faster TRs does not help; it just gives more points on the response curve obtainable by simple linear interpolation anyway. Experimental paradigms such as staggering when a stimulus is presented at various trials can improve temporal resolution, but reduces the number of effective data points obtained.|$|E

40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} (RL) is {{a powerful}} method for learning policies in environments with delayed feedback in a model-free way. Another powerful method for obtaining control policies is the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem, which utilizes knowledge of a linear model to derive the optimal policy. However, the continuously evolving dynamics of linear systems pose a challenge to using RL techniques as the underlying theory is discrete in nature. Therefore, reinforcement learners must discretize the dynamics by <b>sampling</b> at specific <b>time</b> intervals. The time interval used by the reinforcement learner directly affects {{the quality of the}} control policy that is learned. This work attempts to characterize the quality of learned policies {{as a function of the}} <b>sample</b> <b>time</b> of the reinforcement learner and in comparison with the optimal control as it is derived from the LQR framework. It is shown that in the limit as the <b>sample</b> <b>time</b> is decreased to zero, the policies generated converge to the optimal policies. In addition, any non-zero <b>sample</b> <b>time</b> introduces error into the learned policies. This error increases exponentially as a function of the <b>sample</b> <b>time</b> used to train the reinforcement learner...|$|R

We evaluate two competing strategies, a short <b>sample</b> <b>time</b> strategy designed to minimize overhead and a long <b>sample</b> <b>time</b> strategy designed to get better averaging.
