For instance, in drawing the trunk of a birch tree, there will be probably white high lights, then a pale rosy grey round them on the light side, then a (probably greenish) deeper grey on the dark side, varied by reflected colours, and over all, rich black strips of bark and brown spots of moss. Lay first the rosy grey, leaving white for the high lights and for the spots of moss, and not touching the dark side. Then lay the grey for the dark <b>side,</b> <b>fitting</b> it well up to the rosy grey of the light, leaving also in this darker grey the white paper in the places for the black and brown moss; then prepare the moss colours separately for each spot, and lay each in the white place left for it. Not one grain of white, except that purposely left for the high lights, must be visible when the work is done, even through a magnifying-glass, so cunningly must you fit the edges to each other. Finally, take your background colours, and put them on each side of the tree-trunk, fitting them carefully to its edge.|$|E

The dominant peak located at 529.8 ± 0.2 eV (Oa), which corresponds to O 2 − ions of the pure composites [27, 28], and the highest binding energy peak at 532.4 ± 0.2 eV (Oc) {{can be attributed to}} the chemisorbed oxygen of surface hydroxylation, oxygen atoms in carbonate ions, and adsorbed H 2 O or O 2 [29]. Furthermore, the medium binding energy component (Ob) located at 531.2 ± 0.2 eV (Oc) is associated with the O 2 − ions in the oxygen-deficient regions (O vacancies) [30].

IstraŽlivanje je pokazalo da je riječ o kompleksnom nalazištu čiji se nalazi protežu od prapovijesti do kasnoga srednjeg vijeka. Uz ostatke Timskoga razdoblja (villa rustica i dr.) došlo se i do ostataka 2 ̆ 7 kasnoantičke ba 1 ?ilike kompleksnog tipa koja se sastoji od broda sapsidom inarteksom, zida oltarne pregrade i sporednih prostorija što zatvaraju apsidu. Kompleksnost građevine i bogatstvo kamene plastike svrstavaju baziliku među sakralne objekte salonitansko-naronitanskog područja i njihova zaleđa od 4. do 6. stoljeća. U prostoru bazilike i oko nje su srednjovjekovni grobovi. Među grobovima ot!kriveni su i oni koji posjeduju izuzetno značajne nalaze kao što su karolirnški mač i ostruge, noževi itd. Na nekropoli se ukopavanja mogu pratiti od 8. pa sve do druge. polovice 15. st., kada Rešetarica postaje zapušteno selište i pusto područje. On {{the site}} of Rešetarica by Livno in Buško blato stand the nave, apse and narthex of the late Roman {{basilica}} and its later longitudinal additions. The basilica was built of limestone. Its ceiling construction was of timber and it probably had a timbel 2 ̆ 7 roof whereas the walls were plastered and whitewashed. The windows were of glass. For its period it had the usual appointments: all furniture was made of lime stone except for the a 1 tar mensa which was of marble. The altar screen was {{in the shape of}} a pergola and iJt consistect of ornamental pilasters and plutei, smaU columns and a. rchitraves. The pilasters and plutei bear geometrical motifs and Christian symbols; on the pilasters dominate six-Ieaved rosettes, vines and acanthus leaves, and on the plutei rosettes, vine leaves and grapes. Small columns with enthasis are subdivided with horizontal lines. Rectangular pilasters and imposts on the windows of the front side of the building are ornamented by crosses with spread arms. The central part of the basilica was most probably bullt in the second half of the fourth century, certainly before the invasion of the Western Goths, whereas the accompanying spaces were added in the first half of the fifth century. The basilica was destroyed in a great fire probably ca 600 at the time of the i. nvasion and destruction by the Avars and Slavs. On Rešetarica are also mediaeval graves. All types are present from simple burials to those with standing tombstones. The burials are aligned and had the usual west-east orientation. In the earliest periods, larger stones taken from the basilica served as grave markers, at a later date standing tombstones came from the quarry which is situated nearby. Several graves in the area of the basilica and around it contained exceptional finds. Thus grave number 4 contained a Carolingian sword and massive spurs, a razor, knife, tinder box and parts of belt fittings. Grave number 3 contained light Carolingian spurs and their <b>side</b> <b>fittings,</b> a knife and an iron object probably a part of a bag. Grave number 8 contained a neckIace and two knives as well as a ceramic vessel with some fifty snail shells. Iron objects and pottery sherds were found in sand on the east and south-east sides of the basilica and probably derive from destroyed graves of the same period. The cemetery and especially the graves on the territory of the basilica and its envjrons, where burial took place from the early to the late mediaeval periods, hat the same features as the cemeteries of Grborezi, Korita, Glavica in Podgradina, Rapovine: all of them are situated in Livanjsko polje and have the same features as the cemeteries in DaImatdan Croatia of mediaeval date. In Roman times the settlement was on Kraljičin nasip in Buško blato, whereas in the mediaeval period it was on the hillside of Kamešnica. The former had a basilica, the latter a small church. Both were wealthy and related to larger centres but both suffered the same fate. The first was destroyed ca 600 by the Avars, the second ca 1482 by the Turks. Both remained nameless and unknown to historical sources...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This project {{studies the}} effect of {{high-performance}} polyethylene (HPPE) fibers on stress distributions in a maxillary denture {{and the influence of}} fiber position on improving denture performance. Methods: A denture was scanned with a 3 D Advanced Topometric Sensor digitizing system. The measuring system converted the images into a 3 D digital model. A 3 D reverse engineering technology then produced a numerical model which was then refined with Rapidform software. The underlying mucosa and bone were constructed using a freeform system integrated with a PHANTOM haptic device. A fiber lamella reinforcement was incorporated into the denture at different positions (<b>fitting</b> <b>side,</b> mid-palatal plane, polished side) with SolidWorks software. Boundary conditions were constrained {{at the top of the}} basal bone while bite force of 230 N was applied to the posterior teeth on both sides. The denture models were analyzed with ABAQUS software. Results: Stress concentrations were found at the incisal notch and at the anterior and posterior palatal surfaces of the unreinforced denture. The incorporated reinforcement effectively reduced the stress concentrations at these surfaces. Placement of the fibers at polished side was the best position in reducing stress concentrations. Significance: 3 D FEM usefully provides a non-laboratory means to reveal the weak areas in the maxillary complete denture, and exhibit the effectiveness of HPPE reinforcement together with fiber positions on enhancement of denture strength. © 2010 Academy of Dental Materials. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the viewing angles of the LMC disk plane. We find that our viewing direction differs considerably from the commonly accepted values, which {{has important implications for}} the structure of the LMC. The discussion is based on an analysis of spatial variations in the apparent magnitude of features in the near-IR color-magnitude diagrams extracted from the DENIS and 2 MASS surveys. Sinusoidal brightness variations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 0. 25 mag are detected as function of position angle, for both AGB and RGB stars. This is naturally interpreted as the result of distance variations, due {{to one side of the}} LMC plane being closer to us than the opposite <b>side.</b> The best <b>fitting</b> geometric model of an inclined plane yields an inclination angle i = 34. 7 +/- 6. 2 degrees and line-of-nodes position angle Theta = 122. 5 +/- 8. 3 degrees. There is tentative evidence that the LMC disk plane may be warped. Traditional methods to estimate the position angle of the line of nodes have used either the major axis position angle Theta_maj of the spatial distribution of tracers on the sky, or the position angle Theta_max of the line of maximum gradient in the velocity field, given that for a circular disk Theta_maj = Theta_max = Theta. The present study does not rely on the assumption of circular symmetry, and is considerably more accurate than previous studies of its kind. We find that the actual position angle of the line of nodes differs considerably from both Theta_maj and Theta_max, for which measurements have fallen in the range 140 - 190 degrees. This indicates that the intrinsic shape of the LMC disk is not circular, but elliptical, as discussed further in Paper II. [Abridged...|$|R
40|$|Bell-and-spigot gasket-joint {{thermoplastic}} pipes such as Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) {{are widely}} used in pressure applications for potable water distribution and transmission, and sewer force mains. The thrust forces which result at joints due {{to changes in the}} direction of flow or changes in the diameter size of a pipeline must be counterbalanced to prevent joint separation. This is accomplished using either concrete thrust blocks or joint restraint devices, or a combination of the two. In the past fifteen years, use of joint restraints in PVC pipes has increased significantly while the use of concrete thrust blocks has lowered. In many parts of the US, both are used in tandem. Traditional joint restraints, “lug-type restraints, ” are external to a piping system and must be fitted {{on the outside of the}} joint, exposing the device to in-situ soils, which makes it susceptible to corrosion. Assembly is also time consuming and prone to human error. When using joint restraints only, without thrust blocks, it is usually necessary to also restrain one or more pipe-to-pipe joints on either <b>side</b> of the <b>fitting.</b> The number of pipe joints or the length of pipe to be restrained on either side of the appurtenance can be calculated based on several parameters. The next generation of joint restraints for PVC pipe-to pipe and ductile iron fitting-to- PVC pipe connections are internal to the system. The BullDog ™ joint is integral to a PVC pipe bell and is intended for pipe-to-pipe joints, while the fitting-to-pipe restraint is a self-restraining gasket, called the MJ Filed Lok®. These devices are easier to assemble than traditional alternatives and much less susceptible to corrosion.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a greater project run by No Picnic: the {{development}} of a brand new food store concept with a clear focus on healthy and ecological food and good service. It should be easy and pleasant to shop healthy food. The concept gives a global approach including skilled staff, interior decoration, advanced technology solutions and a good layout. The main focus of the thesis is to develop functional and intelligent interior for the store, and the project later focuses on developing a concept shopping cart, cart flow, a check-out station and the user interface for the information system. Literature studies, competitor analysis and a survey are carried through. They indicate that more focus on health is needed since people’s health is deteriorating. People need to find more pleasure in shopping and cooking, and make it with consideration for both their own health and the environment. There are some food stores similar to the concept internationally. However, they tend to focus on ecological food rather than healthy food, even if the first often implies the other. A problem definition is set to construct and design a smart, ergonomic and aesthetic concept for moving merchandise through the store that also helps finding nutrition values and other information about the products. The concept should also integrate an automatic check out function. A problem analysis is made which results in lists of requirements and wishes. One condition is given from the beginning, namely that the concept is to be optimized for use with an item-level RFID solution. This eliminates repacking of merchandise but requires an environment with no radio signal disturbance. Six concepts for moving items in-store are presented: one handheld, one carried on the arm, one shoulder-strap basket, two carts and one modular cart with bagholders. Evaluation shows that the concepts need to be improved to allow space-efficient storage and to minimize metal as construction material as it disturbs radio waves for the implemented RFID solutions. The concept development results in a small and convenient four-wheeled cart concept, CartER, almost solely made of plastic and with two foldable shelves. The back wheels are fixed while the front ones are flywheels, which makes the cart easy to manoeuvre. The sides of the cart are low to avoid heavy lifting and extra functions such as coat hanger, shopping list display and dampers, are integrated. The cart is supplemented with high quality, stable and strong paper bags, BagZ, with soft handles and slightly converging <b>sides</b> for optimal <b>fitting</b> in the cart. These bags can either be used like conventional baskets, or up to two can be placed on each shelf of the cart. The information system consists of E-ink signs and shelf strips, possibly a display on CartER, the check-out system CheckOUT and Active Spots, which are small areas within reach of a RFID reader with a touch screen for customer interaction. The information system is connected to the Internet and the store's website. The check-out is an Active Spot for non- staff operated payment.

40|$|Mono- and di-alkyltins {{are used}} {{extensively}} as heat stabilizers for processing of poly vinyl chloride (PVC). Tin mercaptide stabilizers {{are some of}} the most effective PVC stabilizers available. The main applications for tin stabilizers are building/construction products, such as pipes, <b>fittings,</b> <b>siding</b> and profiles (windows etc.), packaging and flexible PVC plastics. Most PVC products have been and are subjected to landfilling, when their use is terminated. The structure of the polymer itself and the substances used as additives have been a concern for environmental authorities in many countries since long, which also includes their presence in landfills. In the case of the organotin stabilizers their leaching out from (PVC) plastics into the leachate phase of landfills with the risk for further transport to ground and surface waters is in focus. The main objectives of this thesis take their start in this background and, thus, included the elucidation of whether organotin compounds (OTs) in stabilized PVC products contribute to the pool of OTs observed in landfill leachates and if these compounds are degradable by the microorganisms developing under anaerobic landfill conditions. To reach these aims and the research questions raised the forwarded PVC materials were added to muniscipal solid waste (MSW) processed in containers used to simulate the ageing of landfills under forced conditions. These include traditional landfill simulation reactors (LSRs) at a scale of ca 100 L and also at a smaller scale ca 5 L constructed for the purpose of this study, i. e. the modular environmental test system (METS). The latter were used to investigate temperature effects on the possible release of OTs from different types of PVC materials. The capacity by microorganisms in landfill environments were used to investigate their capacity to degrade or transform organotin stabilizer compounds focused on in this thesis. Differences in this capacity in relation to the ageing of landfills and exposure to the alkyltin stabilizers were studied with microorganisms sampled from LSRs spiked with PVC over time and from landfill site. Access to sensitive and reliable equipment and analytical protocols for the analysis of OTs and their transformation intermediates and end products are prerequisites for this kind of studies. This necessitated an adoption and adaptation of analytical methods for the low concentrations occurring in the environment. Two methods were established and well served the requirements. Indeed OTs migrated out from especially flexible PVC materials, while rigid PVC was less prone for OT release as judged from the METS simulations. The METS studies showed that the OT release increase substantially at higher temperatures and especially so when the temperature was higher than the glass transition of the PVC. materials. The organotin stabilizers were transformed, partly or completely degraded, by anaerobic microorganisms derived from landfill environments. Upon prolonged exposure to OTs leaching from PVC in LSR simulations the microorganisms displayed a higher efficiency in degradation of the leached OTs. The microorganisms would methylate inorganic tin and metyltin present in the MSW material as well as perform dealkylation depending on the tin concentrations prevailing. During these studies it was discovered that the organotin stabilzers were inhibiting the methanogens and fermentative bacteria, which lead to a retardation of the anaerobic mineralisation of the MSW in the assays. An in depth study revealed that the OTs themselves but also their ligands and degradation products from these together effected the inhibition. However, given the extent of leaching in relation to the water flows in landfills, the concentrations will mainly be too low to pose any risks to the surrounding environment...|$|R
