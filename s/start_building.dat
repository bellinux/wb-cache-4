5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games Retro said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce a few basic buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then <b>start</b> <b>building</b> combat units, while the enemy starts with more buildings {{and the ability to}} immediately send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the basic units of the two sides are essentially identical and that the interface is clunky, but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E
5|$|When {{termites}} {{construct their}} nests, they use predominantly indirect communication. No single termite {{would be in}} charge of any particular construction project. Individual termites react rather than think, but at a group level, they exhibit a sort of collective cognition. Specific structures or other objects such as pellets of soil or pillars cause termites to <b>start</b> <b>building.</b> The termite adds these objects onto existing structures, and such behaviour encourages building behaviour in other workers. The result is a self-organised process whereby the information that directs termite activity results from changes in the environment rather than from direct contact among individuals.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the stadium}} was {{expected}} to start in late 2007 and finish {{in time for the}} 2010 season. Planning permission for the first stage of developments was granted on 7 April 2008 and work on the new players' block was planned to commence in the summer of 2008. It was decided to not <b>start</b> <b>building</b> until permission had been received for all phases of the development including the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand. In October 2008, the project was put on hold by the club {{as a result of the}} global economic crisis restricting available funds. Revised plans were revealed in November 2009, with further announcements expected in early 2010. However further developments may be further delayed due to the club's relegation from the Premier League.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to build an}} arena in the area was first presented by Nilsson in May 1997, and developed further over the following decade. The permit to <b>start</b> <b>building</b> Malmö Arena was granted in September 2006, and the first sod was turned on 10 January 2007 by Nilsson, hockey players Pekka Lindmark, Juha Rihiijärvi, and Carl Söderberg, and two politicians from Malmö Stad. The main contractors for {{the building of the}} arena were Parkfast AB, with the collaboration of the structural engineer Byggteknik i Skåne. The arena was designed by Mats Matson of MM Matsson Konsult AB, Hannu Helkiö of Pöyry Architects, and Gert Wingårdh of Wingårdh arkitektkontor. The final construction cost for the arena was 750 million kronor– 100 million kronor over budget because of additions to the initial plan. The arena was entirely financed by Percy Nilsson of Parkfast AB. Malmö Arena was inaugurated on 6 November 2008 with a large concert featuring a variety of artists, among them Robyn, Helen Sjöholm, Sanne Salomonsen, and Jill Johnson.|$|E

The Ministry of Defence Industry of Azerbaijan supervises the design, manufacturing, regulation and maintenance of military equipment.

25|$|The {{actions of}} Hamilcar, and his {{immunity}} to defeat, plus the stalemate at {{the siege of}} Lilybaeum caused the Romans to <b>start</b> <b>building</b> a fleet in 243 BC to seek a decision at sea. However, the constant skirmishing without ultimate victory may have caused the morale of some of Hamilcar’s troops to crack and 1,000 Celtic mercenaries tried to betray the Punic camp to the Romans, which was foiled. Hamilcar had to promise considerable rewards to keep the morale of his army up, which was to produce near fatal problems for Carthage later on.|$|E

25|$|A year later, {{with its}} share of the American market at 1.83%, the company struck a deal with Renault, the nationally owned French automaker. AMC would receive a $150million cash injection, $50million in credits, and also the rights to <b>start</b> <b>building</b> the Renault 5 in 1982. (A deal for Renault {{products}} to be sold through the AMC-Jeep dealer network had already been made in 1979.) In return, Renault acquired a 22.5% interest in AMC. This {{was not the first time}} the two companies had worked together. Lacking its own prestige model line in the early 1960s, Renault assembled CKD kits and marketed Rambler cars in France.|$|E
25|$|After the {{founding}} phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers <b>start</b> <b>building</b> on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The {{majority of the}} food resource brought in by the workers are fed to the queen larvae, known as gynes {{and the lack of}} feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods. To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers will remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as worker policing.|$|E
25|$|Missouri and Kansas {{were the}} first states to <b>start</b> <b>building</b> interstates with Interstate 70. Interstate 435, which encircles the entire city, is the second longest beltway in the nation. (Interstate 275 around Cincinnati, Ohio is the longest.) The Kansas City metro area has more limited access highway lane-miles per capita than any other large US metro area, over 27% more than the second-place Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, over 50% {{more than the average}} American {{metropolitan}} area. The Sierra Club blames the extensive freeway network for excessive sprawl and the decline of central Kansas City. On the other hand, the relatively uncongested road network contributes significantly to Kansas City's position as one of America's largest logistics hubs.|$|E
