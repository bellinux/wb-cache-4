The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are <b>so</b> <b>sharp,</b> even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and <b>so</b> <b>sharp</b> that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The barrier {{causing the}} hiatus {{mentioned}} above {{does not have}} an immediate geographical cause.

25|$|The {{gradients}} are distressing and {{the curves}} <b>so</b> <b>sharp</b> that the drivers {{were unable to}} see the semaphore arms until tell-tale arms were erected close to the ground.

25|$|Even so, Winema proceeded, backwards, up the Wood River, {{until it}} reached a bend <b>so</b> <b>sharp</b> that the boat could not {{negotiate}} it. The attempt {{to reach the}} bridge had to be abandoned, but the boat still had to be extricated from the river. Upon return {{to the mouth of}} the river, the sand bar had filled up again, and it was only with some difficulty that Winema was turned around so that the sternwheel could be used to dredge out a channel through the bar.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} {{described here}} was originally developed to describe FowlerNordheim tunneling from smooth, classically flat, planar emitting surfaces. It is adequate for smooth, classical curved surfaces of radii {{down to about}} 10 to 20nm. It {{can be adapted to}} surfaces of sharper radius, but quantities such as ν and D then become significant functions of the parameter(s) used to describe the surface curvature. When the emitter is <b>so</b> <b>sharp</b> that atomic-level detail cannot be neglected, and/or the tunneling barrier is thicker than the emitter-apex dimensions, then a more sophisticated approach is desirable.|$|E

25|$|Traditional depth-of-field {{formulas}} {{and tables}} assume equal circles of confusion for {{near and far}} objects. Some authors, such as Merklinger (1992), have suggested that distant objects often need to be much sharper to be clearly recognizable, whereas closer objects, being larger on the film, {{do not need to}} be <b>so</b> <b>sharp.</b> The loss of detail in distant objects may be particularly noticeable with extreme enlargements. Achieving this additional sharpness in distant objects usually requires focusing beyond the hyperfocal distance, sometimes almost at infinity. For example, if photographing a cityscape with a traffic bollard in the foreground, this approach, termed the object field method by Merklinger, would recommend focusing very close to infinity, and stopping down to make the bollard sharp enough. With this approach, foreground objects cannot always be made perfectly sharp, but the loss of sharpness in near objects may be acceptable if recognizability of distant objects is paramount.|$|E

They were permitted to visit him on 29 January, and he bade them a tearful farewell. The following morning, he called for two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear: [...] "the season is <b>so</b> <b>sharp</b> as probably may make me shake, which some observers may imagine proceeds from fear.

500|$|Senator Beauchamp {{eventually}} found a publisher for his nephew's Confession. The first printing ran on August 11, 1826. Sharp's brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, attempted to counter Beauchamp's Confession with Vindication of the Character {{of the late}} Col. Solomon P. Sharp, which he wrote in 1827. In this book, Dr. Sharp claimed to have seen a [...] "first version" [...] of the confession in which Beauchamp implicated Darby. Darby threatened to sue Dr. Sharp if he published Vindication, and John Waring threatened to kill him if he did <b>so.</b> <b>Sharp</b> did not release the manuscript and hid it in his house. The completed printed version was found in 1877 during a remodel of Sharp's house.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. It {{was named the}} second best episode of The Simpsons by Kirk Baird of the Las Vegas Sun and the third best episode by Sarah Culp of The Quindecim. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented: [...] "Despite the potential for some heavy-handed moralizing, 'Radio Bart' provides a terrific show. From Bart's crappy birthday to his pranks to the public reaction to Timmy's trapping, the humor flies fast and furious in this excellent episode. It's {{one of the better}} ones." [...] The Daily Telegraph characterized the episode as one of ten best episodes of The Simpsons. DVD Times's Chris Kaye said [...] "Radio Bart" [...] is [...] "another demonstration of the series' knack for cultural references, parodying the Billy Wilder movie Ace in the Hole." [...] Entertainment Weekly ranked [...] "Radio Bart" [...] as the twentieth best episode of The Simpsons and commented that [...] "it's a media parody <b>so</b> <b>sharp,</b> we're still stinging a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|The Great Gatsby {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from literary {{critics of the}} day. Generally the most effusive of the positive reviews was Edwin Clark of The New York Times, who felt the novel was [...] "A curious book, a mystical, glamourous [...] story of today." [...] Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] " [...] leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder," [...] calling the book [...] "a revelation of life" [...] and [...] "a work of art." [...] The New York Post called the book [...] "fascinating... His style fairly scintillates, and with a genuine brilliance; he writes surely and soundly." [...] The New York Herald Tribune was unimpressed, but referred to The Great Gatsby as [...] "purely ephemeral phenomenon, but it contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine-so light, so delicate, <b>so</b> <b>sharp....</b> a literary lemon meringue." [...] In The Chicago Daily Tribune, H.L. Mencken called the book [...] "in form {{no more than a}} glorified anecdote, and not too probable at that," [...] while praising the book's [...] "careful and brilliant finish." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rose, Savedra {{knew that}} the Mohave rarely ventured this far from their homelands, so they assumed the Hualapai had taken the animals, which were {{returned}} the following morning as the party camped at Peach Springs. The animals were led back by twenty-five Natives hoping for compensation in return, as Udell explained: [...] "It was soon evident that they expected very extravagant rewards, all expecting shoes, clothing, and trinkets, besides some cattle... many remained in camp with us that night, doubtless {{for the purpose of}} stealing, but the guard kept <b>so</b> <b>sharp</b> a lookout that they found no opportunity." [...] On August 20, the party awoke to another fifty Hualapai anticipating gifts in exchange for the return of the stolen animals. The Natives left around noon, after receiving tobacco, trinkets, and food, but the emigrants noticed that six oxen were missing. A search team located four carcasses that had been stripped of their flesh; the other two animals were found nearby, having been recently killed, but not yet butchered. That night, the Rose–Baley Party decided to once again split their wagon train in response to the scarcity of water. According to Baley, as they journeyed from their campsite at Peach Springs to the Colorado River more than [...] away, they were almost continuously harassed by Natives, who sent arrows flying into their wagon train during the day and raided their camp at night.|$|E

500|$|When Wintour {{responded to}} the summons he found his cousin with the swordsman John Wright. Catesby told him of his plan to kill the king and his {{government}} by blowing up [...] "the Parliament howse with Gunpowder... in that place have they done us all the mischiefe, and perchance God hath designed that place for their punishment". Wintour at first objected to his cousin's scheme, but Catesby, who said that [...] "the nature of the disease required <b>so</b> <b>sharp</b> a remedy", won him over. Despite Catholic Spain's moves toward diplomacy with England, Catesby still harboured hopes of foreign support and a peaceful solution. Wintour therefore returned to the continent, where he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the affable Constable of Castile to press for good terms for English Catholics in forthcoming peace negotiations. He then turned to Sir William Stanley, an English Catholic and veteran commander who had switched sides from England to Spain, and the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen; both {{cast doubt on the}} plotters' chances of receiving Spanish support. Owen did, however, introduce Wintour to Guy Fawkes, whose name Catesby had already supplied as [...] "a confidant gentleman" [...] who might enter their ranks. Fawkes was a devout English Catholic who had travelled to the continent to fight for Spain in the Dutch War of Independence. Wintour told him of their plan to [...] "doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott", and thus in April 1604 the two men returned home. Wintour told Catesby that despite positive noises from the Spanish, he feared that [...] "the deeds would nott answere". This was a response that in Nicholls's opinion came as no surprise to Catesby, who wanted and expected nothing less.|$|E
