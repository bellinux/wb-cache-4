40|$|Most {{strategic}} {{programs are}} merely slogans idealizing {{past or present}} corporate strategies. Furthermore, many of these 'success strategies' are not genuinely novel and when diffused among many companies, lose their distinctive features. Stereotypical strategy concepts also imply stereotypical organizational structures which impair employees' innovative potential. Leading companies excel by developing new slogans, that is, new strategic concepts and consequently strategic innovations. Manfred Perlitz demonstrates a flexible individual concept {{in connection with the}} process of international strategy development. It starts with <b>strategic</b> <b>deficiency</b> analysis and tries to generate solutions with a question sequence of how to do the repair. The special know-how of employees is integrated into the strategy development at a very early point. ...|$|R
40|$|Since Emile Borel’s {{study in}} 1938, {{the game of}} poker has resurfaced every decade as a test bed for {{research}} in mathe-matics, economics, game theory, and now a variety of com-puter science subfields. Poker is an excellent domain for AI research {{because it is a}} game of imperfect information and a game where opponent modeling can yield virtually unlim-ited complexity. Recent strides in poker research have pro-duced computer programs that can outplay most intermediate players, but there is still a significant gap between computer programs and human experts {{due to the lack of}} accurate, pur-poseful opponent models. We present a method for construct-ing models of <b>strategic</b> <b>deficiency,</b> that is, an opponent model with an inherent roadmap for exploitation. In our model, a player using this method is able to outperform even the best static player when playing against a wide variety of oppo-nents...|$|R

If Black defends correctly against White's attack, these <b>strategic</b> <b>deficiencies</b> can become quite serious. Because of this, the Stonewall Attack is almost never seen in master-level chess any more, although it is seen occasionally among club players. However, Black playing the Stonewall variation of the Dutch Defense is seen occasionally at master level.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains a}} series of studies examining the effect of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s competitive strategy and operational effectiveness on its ability to gain advantage in its business-level competitive environment and in its corporate-level strategic actions, specifically its acquisition activity. Its main premise is that the resources and capabilities that result from a firm 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to achieve competitive advantage in its business-level competition {{can also be used to}} advantage in its acquisitions. It develops concepts of strategic and effectiveness capabilities. It tests two issues of debate within strategic management: whether economizing or strategizing is more important to achieving competitive advantage and whether mixing competitive strategies of cost leadership and differentiation improves or harms firm performance. The empirical findings show economizing is 3. 5 times more important to competitive advantage than strategic positioning and mixed strategies perform better than pure-form strategies. ^ It examines how strategic and effectiveness capabilities affect acquirers 2 ̆ 7 ability to create economic value in acquisitions. An acquirer 2 ̆ 7 s capabilities are predicted to affect the type and amount of performance improvement realized in acquisitions. Regression models show a significant relationship between cost leadership, differentiation, and effectiveness capabilities in acquirers and post-acquisition ROA, costs, and revenues. ^ It develops theory on how differences between an acquirer 2 ̆ 7 s and target 2 ̆ 7 s strategy and effectiveness influence acquisition performance. It introduces concepts <b>strategic</b> distance, <b>strategic</b> <b>deficiency,</b> and effectiveness deficiency. The analysis examines the importance of acquirer capabilities versus the fit between the acquirer and target in affecting acquisition performance. The results indicate that both the capabilities of an acquirer and its target contribute to acquisition success. ^ It explores how a firm 2 ̆ 7 s profitability, competitive strategy, operational effectiveness, and size affect its involvement in M 2 ̆ 6 A activity. It explores whether more capable acquirers are also more likely to make acquisitions and whether the weakest firms in terms of profitability, efficiency, and strategy are most likely to be acquired. The findings oppose perspectives that predict the “survival of the fittest” and demise of the weakest. ^ We conclude that strategy and efficiency are critical to understanding competitive advantage within business-level competition, corporate advantage resulting from acquisition activity, and in shaping M 2 ̆ 6 A activity within an industry. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of a developmental continuum for intelligence professionals, based on a traditional competency model may be ubiquitous across the breadth of intelligence. This paper argues that specialised contextual and cultural education and training and subsequent recognition of those skills, knowledge and attributes, is an essential element in achieving organisational and individual objectives for criminal intelligence professionals. The full integration of criminal intelligence operations into police and law enforcement decision making at the tactical, operational and strategic levels is an aspirational step in achieving a multidisciplinary operational environment. The delineation of intelligence practitioners based on employment status, facilitated {{by the absence of}} specialised law enforcement training, is an impediment to organisational and individual efficiency and effectiveness. The key issues are explored through a case study of a number of state and federal law enforcement organisations within Australia and internationally. A thematic analysis identified impediments to the full integration model. Those impediments including a lack of a sense of community, lack of a sense of inclusiveness and belonging, incomplete operational and <b>strategic</b> alignment, <b>deficiencies</b> and inadequacies of skills across the full operational context and th...|$|R

In 1984, 37 % of computer science bachelor's degrees were awarded to women and in 1998 that percentage was down to 26 % [3]. A number of variables have been proposed to account for this gender difference including: traditional socialization practices that reinforce math and science as male domains; lower confidence ratings and greater math anxiety among women; and women's tendency to take fewer advanced mathematics courses.

40|$|Qatar's {{leadership}} showed great {{ambition to}} transform the state into a developed country where its economy is based on knowledge and not rent; even though that Qatar is privileged to have massive natural gas reserves compared to a small population. Achieving this ambitious goal is a challenging task, {{but it is not}} impossible. Qatar would need to best utilize its advantages, such as political coherence and wealth. However, there are some <b>strategic</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and imbalances that can greatly hinder its long-term aspirations. Qatar can best achieve this goal and avoid potential drawbacks in the process by learning from the experience of others. Singapore's case is remarkable where it had virtually non-existent resources but it still managed to transform itself. Within a generation, Singapore became a first world developed country starting from an underdeveloped, newly born state. In addition, Singapore shares core similarities with Qatar in regards to similar country size and the role of leadership for example. The thesis compares between Qatar and Singapore by following a comparative public policy analysis framework. This approach is followed in order to achieve two primary goals. First is to highlight the significance of politics, education and labor market policies towards development, given their direct impact. This would aim to provide these three areas with further attention by policy makers. The second goal is to identify key success factors, by drawing from Singapore's experience. That would allow Qatar formulate better policies in those three indicated areas. The outcomes of the comparative analysis would then be reflected on Michael Porter's Competitive Advantage of Nations framework. This is in order to further underline their position on a macro level, especially in relation to other factors that contribute to the state's overall competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|Protected {{areas are}} {{arguably the most}} {{important}} instrument of biodiversity conservation. To keep them fit under climate change, their management needs to be adapted to address related direct and indirect changes. In our study {{we focus on the}} adaptation of conservation management planning, evaluating management plans of 60 protected areas throughout Germany with regard to their climate change-robustness. First, climate change-robust conservation management was defined using 11 principles and 44 criteria, which followed an approach similar to sustainability standards. We then evaluated the performance of individual management plans concerning the climate change-robustness framework. We found that climate change-robustness of protected areas hardly exceeded 50 percent of the potential performance, with most plans ranking in the lower quarter. Most Natura 2000 protected areas, established under conservation legislation of the European Union, belong to the sites with especially poor performance, with lower values in smaller areas. In general, the individual principles showed very different rates of accordance with our principles, but similarly low intensity. Principles with generally higher performance values included holistic knowledge management, public accountability and acceptance as well as systemic and <b>strategic</b> coherence. <b>Deficiencies</b> were connected to dealing with the future and uncertainty. Lastly, we recommended the presented principles and criteria as essential guideposts that {{can be used as a}} checklist for working towards more climate change-robust planning...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's, AD) is {{the sixth}} {{leading cause of}} death in the United States (U. S.), {{claiming}} the lives of more than 500, 000 individuals each year. Today, approximately 5. 3 million Americans are living with this disease. AD burdens the U. S. with a project economic cost of $ 226 billion in 2015, and is on pace to cost $ 1. 1 trillion in 2050. Although AD is widely recognized as an epidemic by individual nations {{as well as by the}} World Health Organization, progress in AD clinical research and integrated care has been modest at best. Key challenges to combating this disease include: Poor understanding of disease onset and progression Gaps in funding to support high-risk research efforts Insufficient research tools and companion resources Lack of disease-modifying treatments Limited public awareness of its societal impact In order to avoid the economic and social catastrophes caused by AD, we must address these <b>deficiencies.</b> <b>Strategic</b> focus on funding high-impact research and critical infrastructure to support both AD research and patients are essential to achieving this goal. The Milken Institute Philanthropy Advisory Service has developed this Giving Smarter Guide for Alzheimer's disease to help patients, supporters, and other stakeholders understand the state of the science and how they can help accelerate research progress. Although philanthropy accounts for only 3 percent of medical research funding, it can have an outsized impact if it is strategically focused. This guide will help to answer the following questions: What are key facts about the disease? Why is it important to invest in AD research? What is the current state of care? What is the current state of research? What are major barriers to progress? How can philanthropy advance a cure for AD...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} dissertation {{develops a}} theoretical framework for guiding the strategy of democratic states in successfully countering the hostilities of nationalistic substate terrorist organizations (NSTOs), and effectively manipulating the terrorist group’s (and its supporting elements’) decision-making calculus. In particular, the theory of strategic coercion has been chosen {{as a basis for}} formulating this framework, based upon: 1) the invaluable guidance it offers in dynamically drawing upon all instruments of national power—economic, diplomatic, military, etc. —to accomplish politico-strategic objectives; and 2) the unique insights it provides into making strategic moves aimed at influencing the choices taken by an adversary. However, strategic coercion theory as it currently stands is inadequate for applications against substate terrorist organizations. As a quintessential cornerstone for prescriptive policy in strategic studies, such a looming deficiency vis-à-vis one the most important security threats of the modern age is unacceptable. The new theoretical framework established in this dissertation—entitled the Balance Theory of <b>strategic</b> coercion—addresses this <b>deficiency.</b> The Balance Theory stresses that three key coercive elements of strategic coercion are fundamentally important for successfully ending the hostilities posed by NSTOs, being: A) Isolation of external/international support; B) Denial; and C) Isolation of popular support. It posits that these three aspects of strategic coercion serve as the sine qua non for success in countering an NSTO’s campaign of violence and effectively manipulating its decision-making process. Implementation of these three elements, moreover, must be pursued in tandem, taking care so as not to sacrifice one aspect for the other. The Balance Theory is tested through the employment of case-study analysis. In pursuing this end, both cross-case and within-case analyses are performed, accompanied by the utilization of the methods of focused, structured comparison. The cases examined are those of: 1) The United Kingdom versus Republican NSTOs (1969 - 2007); and 2) Israel versus Palestinian NSTOs (1967 -present). The dissertation concludes with an examination of how the Balance Theory may provide insights for the formulation of counter-terrorism strategy against Al Qaeda in the current "War on Terror".
