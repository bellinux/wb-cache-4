In RM 3 integration, partially processed heterostructure devices are placed in recesses formed in the dielectric layers covering the surface of an integrated circuit chip, the surface is planarized, and monolithic processing is continued to transform the heterostructures into optoelectronic devices monolithically integrated with the underlying electronic circuitry. Two different RM 3 techniques have been investigated, Aligned Pillar Bonding (APB) and OptoPill Assembly (OPA). APB integrates lattice mismatched materials using aligned, selective area wafer bonding at reduced temperature (under 3500 C), which protects the electronic chips from the adverse effects of high temperatures, and reduces the thermal expansion mismatch concerns. In the OPA technique, optoelectronic heterostructures are processed into circular pills of 8 gm height and 45 gm diameter, the pills are released from the substrate, and collected through a process that involves decanting.

Solder was also used as a release layer as well as bond layer for forming transferred thin-film packages. Several different standard solder alloy / under bump metallization combinations were used for wafer bonding. Only the Au-Sn solder alloy, with its low tin content, proved to be compatible with the thermal limitations of commercial wafer bonders. The bond is formed at 300 °C in under an hour and has a shear strength of 28 MPa. It was used to create packages (2. 3 mm X 2. 3 mm X 0. 5 mm) with integrated Pirani gauges.

The microstructure and thermal aging characteristics of <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> of crystalline silicon solar cells are investigated, whereby two solders, Sn 60 Pb 40 and a lead-free, low melting point alternative Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 are considered. <b>Solder</b> <b>bonds</b> of front side busbars are formed with a semi-automatic tool and cross sections are prepared, which are characterized with confocal laser microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (EDX). The kinetic of IMC growth is modeled with a diffusion model, and the parameters are obtained with systematic thermal aging studies and the Arrhenius relationship. The model is capable of processing non-isothermal temperature profiles and is used to simulate IMC growth during PV module reliability tests like thermal cycling 600 (TC) and damp heat for 3000 h. Furthermore, the thicknesses of the IMCs are estimated for a PV module in an outdoor location. It is found that solder joints undergo strong ripening processes during thermal aging. In particular, Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 solder joints show faster IMC growth, grain coarsening and Sn-penetration into the busbar than Sn 60 Pb 40 bonds. Sn-penetration is observed already in the as-soldered condition and EDX confirms the existence of significant amounts of diffused Sn around cavities in the busbar. Large portions of the busbar are consumed by the Ag 3 Sn IMC after 155 h at 130 °C and further aging of the Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 joint leads to Bi segregation and, in some cases, complete depletion of Sn from the solder matrix.

MEMS techniques have found wide acceptance in such devices as ac- celerometers, micro-mirrors, resonators, probes, and micro-tweezers {{to name a}} few. Though small linear motions are common in MEMS applications, few devices exhibit reliable rotary motion. This work explores several methods of fabricating rotary bearings using micro-balls as the support mechanism. Micro-ball bearings have several advantages over other MEMS bearing tech- nologies in that they provide robust mechanical support, require no external control systems, and basic designs require very few fabrication steps. Ball cages or retainers are common in macro-scale bearings, providing uniform spacing between the balls. Several cage designs are proposed and explored in this work: a radial ball bearing with an integrated ball cage, a dual-row style cage, and ve unique cage geometries integrated into silicon micro-turbines (SMTs.) Also, {{an example of a}} curved or angular contact race- way is presented as an example of this type of raceway geometry in MEMS devices. Each is presented with a discussion of the design considerations and fabrication process. This is followed by a characterization of the performance of each design. These studies found that the integrated cage in the radial ball bearing performs well at speeds ranging up to 20 000 RPM. Minimal wear was ob- served after 6 hours of continuous testing. However, the <b>solder</b> <b>bond</b> in the cage was a common failure point in these devices, limiting the reliability and longevity. The dual groove style cage was designed to eliminate the <b>solder</b> <b>bond.</b> However, the higher frictional forces between the ball and the cage in this design resulted in higher losses during operation. Taking into account the higher losses and the added complexity of the design, it seems unlikely that this approach would be appropriate for further study. However, the design does represent a novel approach for releasing multi-wafer rotary structures and is presented here as example of this technique. Testing of the cage de- signs for the SMTs indicated that a full ring design (a full annulus with holes for the balls) performed the best of the 5 cage geometries. However, these devices do not perform as well as cage-less designs for high speed applications due to higher ctional forces and increased raceway wear at the interface be- tween the ball and the raceway edge. Finally, the curved raceway has shown excellent performance up to 2500 RPM with normal loads up to 40 mN in tribometer testing. SMTs with this raceway desing were also tested for over 10 million revolutions and at speeds over 70 000 RPM.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The durability and lifetime of photovoltaic (PV) modules {{is one of the}} chief concerns for an industry which is rapidly approaching maturity. Guaranteeing the economic viability of potential PV installations is paramount to fostering growth of the industry. Whilst certification standards have helped to improve the reliability of modules, with a significant reduction in early failures, long-term performance degradation and overall lifetimes are yet to be addressed in a meaningful way. For this, it is necessary to quantify the effects of use-environment and module design. Long-term degradation of the solder bonds in PV modules causes steady power loss and leads to the generation of more devastating, secondary mechanisms such as hot-spots. Whilst <b>solder</b> <b>bond</b> degradation is well-recognised and even tested for in certification protocols, the potential rate of degradation is not well understood, particularly with respect to different environmental conditions and material selection. The complex nature of a standard silicon PV module construction makes it difficult to observe the stresses experienced by the various components during normal operation. This thesis presents the development of a finite-element model which is used to observe the stresses and strains experienced by module components during normal operating conditions and quantifies the degradation of solder bonds under different environmental conditions. First, module operating temperatures are examined across a range of climates and locations to evaluate the thermal profiles experienced by modules. Using finite-element techniques, the thermomechanical behaviour of modules is then simulated using the same thermal profiles and a quantification of <b>solder</b> <b>bond</b> degradation potential in each location is achieved. It is shown that hot climates are responsible for the highest degradation potential, but further to this, hot environments with many ii clear sky days, allowing for large swings in module temperature, are significantly more damaging. A comparison is drawn between indoor accelerated stress procedures and outdoor exposure, such that an equivalence between test duration and location-dependent outdoor exposure can be determined. It is shown that for the most damaging climate studied, 86 standard thermal cycles is appropriate for one-year of outdoor exposure whereas the least damaging environment would require 11 standard thermal cycles. However, these conclusions may only be applicable to the specific module design which was modelled as the material selection and interaction within a device {{plays a major role in}} the thermomechanical behaviour and degradation potential. In addition to a study on the influence of use-environment, a study on the influence of the encapsulating material is conducted with a particular focus on the effects of the viscoelastic properties of the materials. It is shown that the degradation of solder bonds can vary depending on the encapsulating material. Furthermore, the intended use-environment could inform the selection of the encapsulating material. The temperature-dependency of the material properties means that some materials will mitigate thermomechanical degradation mechanisms more than others under certain conditions i. e. hotter or colder climates...|$|E

In 3 D {{integration}} package using TSV technology, bonding is {{the core}} technology for stacking and interconnecting the chips or wafers. During bonding process, however, warpage and high stress are introduced, and {{will lead to the}} misalignment problem between two chips being bonded and failure of the chips. In this paper, a finite element approach is used to predict the warpages and stresses during the bonding process. In particular, in-plane deformation which directly affects the bonding misalignment is closely analyzed. Three types of bonding technology, which are Sn-Ag <b>solder</b> <b>bonding,</b> Cu-Cu direct bonding and SiO 2 direct bonding, are compared. Numerical analysis indicates that warpage and stress are accuμlated and become larger for each bonding step. In-plane deformation is μch larger than out-of-plane deformation during bonding process. Cu-Cu bonding shows the largest warpage, while SiO 2 direct bonding shows the smallest warpage. For stress, Sn-Ag <b>solder</b> <b>bonding</b> shows the largest stress, while Cu-Cu bonding shows the smallest. The stress is mainly concentrated at the interface between the via hole and silicon chip or via hole and bonding area. Misalignment induced during Cu-Cu and Sn-Ag <b>solder</b> <b>bonding</b> is equal to or larger than the size of via diameter, therefore should be reduced by lowering bonding temperature and proper selection of package materials. ope...|$|R
40|$|Interconnects in microelectronic {{packages}} and devices {{serve as the}} mechanical and electrical connections as well as thermal paths for heat dissipation. Miniaturization of electronic devices demands very high density interconnects and <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> {{with only a few}} microns of stand-off height. Although Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are essential to form a reliable joint, large volume ratios of IMCs can be degrading to long term reliability. At very small joints, the volume of IMCs becomes significant, and in some cases, joints may completely transform to IMCs. Furthermore, small joints experience anisotropy {{due to the fact that}} all compositions may only contain a few grains. However, very few studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of the IMCs thickness and anisotropy on the mechanical behavior of <b>solder</b> <b>bonds.</b> In this work, these effects are studied through a combination of experiments and finite element simulations. Traditionally, regular finite element (FE) modeling techniques have been used to simulate the solder joints. However, in order to evaluate joint with only a few grains, a more sophisticated modeling of elastic and plastic behavior of grains is needed through crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) modeling. In this study, CPFE is used to model all materials including solder, IMCs, and Cu in joints with different IMC thicknesses. Nanoindentation experiment on single grains of IMCs and CPFE simulation of the same were combined to obtain slip system parameters of IMCs that are necessary constants for CPFE modeling. Furthermore, the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis was used to determine the preferred grain growth orientation of Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC on polycrystalline Cu substrate. A lap-shear experiment was designed and conducted to investigate the effects of the different volume fraction of IMCs on the shear behavior of micro-scale solder joints with a 50 µm stand-off height. The local strain was measured using a micro-scale Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique. This experiment was used to determine the local and global stress-strain behavior of these joints. The joints were tested to failure, and fractography was conducted to determine the failure modes and failure sites. Comparison between experiment and modeling shows that the CPFE models are successful in capturing the local mechanical behavior of the <b>solder</b> <b>bonds.</b> CPFE models are observed to be more efficient in predicting the local plastic deformation behavior of micro-scale bonds with few grains than the regular FE analysis. Simulation results show that the overall stress distribution and shear deformation changes as the IMC thickness increases. Stiffer response and higher shear yield strength are seen as the IMC thickness increases for both simulation and experiment results. Also, the stress-strain distributions observed in the CPFE analysis performed to mimic the experiment gave a clear idea of the locations of the possible failure sites. Fractography shows failure mode changing from ductile to brittle where crack propagation path is modulated by the different volume fraction of IMCs. A significant influence of Cu 3 Sn/Cu 6 Sn 5 interfacial morphology on the ultimate shear strength at a higher volume fraction of IMC samples was observed during the lap-shear experiment where planar interfacial morphology promoted lower ultimate shear strength. The effect of different interfacial morphologies on the shear behavior was verified using CPFE simulation. Calculation of the fatigue life indicates that high volume fractions of IMCs could degrade fatigue life of the <b>solder</b> <b>bonds...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper details an {{investigation}} into the appearance of hot-spots in two large grid-connected photovoltaics (PV) plants, which were detected after the visual inspection of trackers whose energy output was decreasing at anomalous rate. Detected hot-spots appeared not only in the solar cells but also in resistive <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> (RSB) between cells and contact ribbons. Both types cause similar irreversible damage to the PV modules, but the latter are the main responsible for the detected decrease in energy output, which was confirmed in an experimental testing campaign.
