50|$|Iron(III) oxide-hydroxide occurs {{naturally}} as four minerals, the polymorphs {{denoted by}} the Greek letters α, β, γ and δ. Goethite, α-FeO(OH), {{has been used}} as a pigment since prehistoric times. Akaganéite is the β polymorph, formed by weathering and noted for its presence in some meteorites and the lunar surface. The γ polymorph lepidocrocite is commonly encountered as rust on the inside of steel water pipes and tanks. Feroxyhyte (δ) is formed under the high pressure conditions of sea and ocean floors, being thermodynamically unstable with respect to the α polymorph (goethite) at surface conditions. It also occurs as siderogel - a colloid - and limonite, which is a commonly found mixture of mainly goethite, lepidocrocite, quartz and clay minerals. Goethite and lepidocrocite, both crystallizing in orthorhombic system, are the most common forms of iron(III) oxide-hydroxide and the most important mineral carriers of iron in soils.

This paper presents a modelling structure that allows a simulation of the redistribution of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> on complex topographies for various tillage implements. The model simulates the redistribution of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> by convoluting the probability distribution of the tillage displacement with the spatial distribution of the <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> The probability distributions in two dimensions are derived from a series of tillage experiments conducted with a mouldboard plough at various positions in the landscape.

40|$|Recent studies clearly {{indicated}} that soil tillage {{is a major}} Factor affecting soil redistribution on arable land. However, existing modeling studies of the redistribution of soil constituents by tillage are largely theoretical in nature {{due to the lack}} of sufficient experimental data. This paper describes the results of field experiments carried out with a moldboard plow on different slope gradients showing that an important net downslope translocation and dispersion of soil constituents is associated with soil tillage. Both translocation and dispersion are strongly affected by slope gradient. Available experimental evidence suggests that redistribution of soil constituents can be modeled by convoluting the displacement probability distribution with the spatial distribution of the <b>soil</b> <b>constituent.</b> The convolution model presented here was found to be superior to existing models because it accounts for dispersion, directionality of tillage, and topogaphy.

The total arsenic (As) content ranged from ca. 20 – 100 mg kg− 1 and the bioaccessible As content, as measured by a physiologically based in vitro extraction test, ranged from 1 to 6 mg kg− 1. A chemometric algorithm for mixture resolution, when applied to total element and total organic carbon concentration of the soils, was able to identify chemically distinct soil constituents and their associated As content.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{mechanisms that}} govern glyphosate interactions with <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> {{are not fully}} understood. In studies of single <b>soil</b> <b>constituents,</b> iron and aluminum oxides have shown a particularly high affinity for glyphosate compared to other <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> We used goethite and poorly crystalline boehmite (PCB) in this study as model sorbents to show the interactions of glyphosate on <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> We identified glyphosate sorption on goethite and PCB using coupled sorption and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), diffuse reflectance, and in situ attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FTIR measurements. ^ Glyphosate sorbed strongly to goethite and PCB. The sorption of glyphosate reached a maximum of 133 and 217 μmol/g glyphosate for goethite and PCB, respectively. As the loading of glyphosate increased, the solution pH also increased. The increase in pH suggests that hydroxyl groups were displaced from the sorbent surfaces, thus evidence of ligand exchange. ^ By using ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, {{we found that the}} phosphonate bands of glyphosate shifted with changes in pH. At pH 3 the protonated P-OH group displayed a band at 917 cm- 1, and the symmetric and asymmetric P-OH modes appear at 1080 and 1186 cm- 1, respectively. At higher pH values, the P-OH band disappears due to deprotonation of the P-O bond. The POH modes merge and form a single band at 1093 cm- 1, which represents the P-O asymmetric stretching mode. ^ We also compared the spectra of glyphosate in solution with those of glyphosate on the sorbents. We noticed that the sorbent perturbed the phosphonate group of glyphosate. In the presence of goethite and PCB, the phosphonate stretching bands appeared at 1137 and 1107 cm- 1, respectively. In solution, this band appeared at 1093 cm- 1. The shift of the P-O stretch to a higher frequency when {{in the presence of the}} sorbents is evidence for glyphosate binding via its phosphonate moiety. ^ In an effort to join batch sorption and spectroscopic studies, we also found that the coupled batch sorption and spectroscopic studies showed good agreement concerning the macroscopic sorption behavior of glyphosate on the sorbents. This information, linked with the aforementioned spectroscopic work is significant because it provides further information concerning the binding of glyphosate with the sorbents. ...|$|R
40|$|Climatic {{variations}} {{and human}} activity now and increasingly {{in the future}} cause land cover changes and introduce perturbations in the terrestrial carbon reservoirs in vegetation, soil and detritus. Optical remote sensing and in particular Imaging Spectroscopy has shown the potential to quantify land surface parameters over large areas, which is accomplished {{by taking advantage of}} the characteristic interactions of incident radiation and the physico-chemical properties of a material. The objective of this thesis is to quantify key soil parameters, including soil organic carbon, using field and Imaging Spectroscopy. Organic carbon, iron oxides and clay content are selected to be analyzed to provide indicators for ecosystem function in relation to land degradation, and additionally to facilitate a quantification of carbon inventories in semiarid soils. The semiarid Albany Thicket Biome in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa is chosen as study site. It provides a regional example for a semiarid ecosystem that currently undergoes land changes due to unadapted management practices and furthermore has to face climate change induced land changes in the future. The thesis is divided in three methodical steps. Based on reflectance spectra measured in the field and chemically determined constituents of the upper topsoil, physically based models are developed to quantify soil organic carbon, iron oxides and clay content. Taking account of the benefits limitations of existing methods, the approach is based on the direct application of known diagnostic spectral features and their combination with multivariate statistical approaches. It benefits from the collinearity of several diagnostic features and a number of their properties to reduce signal disturbances by influences of other spectral features. In a following step, the acquired hyperspectral image data are prepared for an analysis of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> The data show a large spatial heterogeneity that is caused by the patchiness of the natural vegetation in the study area that is inherent to most semiarid landscapes. Spectral mixture analysis is performed and used to deconvolve non-homogenous pixels into their <b>constituent</b> components. For <b>soil</b> dominated pixels, the subpixel information is used to remove the spectral influence of vegetation and to approximate the pure spectral signature coming from the soil. This step is an integral part when working in natural non-agricultural areas where pure bare soil pixels are rare. It is identified as the largest benefit within the multi-stage methodology, providing the basis for a successful and unbiased prediction of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> from hyperspectral imagery. With the proposed approach it is possible (1) to significantly increase the spatial extent of derived information of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> to areas with about 40 % vegetation coverage and (2) to reduce the influence of materials such as vegetation on the quantification of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> to a minimum. Subsequently, soil parameter quantities are predicted by the application of the feature-based soil prediction models to the maps of locally approximated soil signatures. Thematic maps showing the spatial distribution of the three considered soil parameters in October 2009 are produced for the Albany Thicket Biome of South Africa. The maps are evaluated for their potential to detect erosion affected areas as effects of land changes and to identify degradation hot spots in regard to support local restoration efforts. A regional validation, carried out using available ground truth sites, suggests remaining factors disturbing the correlation of spectral characteristics and chemical <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> The approach is developed for semiarid areas in general and not adapted to specific conditions in the study area. All processing steps of the developed methodology are implemented in software modules, where crucial steps of the workflow are fully automated. The transferability of the methodology is shown for simulated data of the future EnMAP hyperspectral satellite. Soil parameters are successfully predicted from these data despite intense spectral mixing within the lower spatial resolution EnMAP pixels. This study shows an innovative approach to use Imaging Spectroscopy for mapping of key <b>soil</b> <b>constituents,</b> including <b>soil</b> organic carbon, for large areas in a non-agricultural ecosystem and under consideration of a partially vegetation coverage. It can contribute to a better assessment of <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> that describe ecosystem processes relevant to detect and monitor land changes.

Using the <b>soil</b> <b>constituent</b> of PM 2. 5 (particles of aerodynamic particle diameter less than 2. 5 micrometers (m)) as an illustration, a Bayesian hierarchical calibration model is developed that combines information from reference and equivalent monitors to produce a temporally resolved posterior distribution of the complete concentration time series.

Four 14 C-labeled surfactants were aseptically adsorbed to montmorillonite, kaolinite, illite, sand, and humic acids. These complexes were mixed with a woodlot soil, and 14 CO 2 production was measured over time. The mineralization data were fitted to various production models by nonlinear regression, and a mixed (3 / 2) -order model was found to most accurately describe the mineralization patterns. Different mineralization patterns were observed {{as a function of the}} chemical and <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> Surfactants that had been preadsorbed to sand or kaolinite usually showed similar mineralization kinetics to the control treatments, in which the surfactants were added to the soil as an aqueous solution. Surfactants that had been bound to illite or montmorillonite were typically degraded to lesser extents than the other forms, while surfactant-humic acid complexes were degraded more slowly than the other forms. The desorption coefficients (Kd) of the soil constituent-bound surfactants were negatively correlated with the initial rates of degradation (k 1) and estimates of 14 CO 2 yield (Po) as well as actual total yields of 14 CO 2. However, there was no relationship between Kd and second-stage zero-order rates of mineralization (ko). Microbial community characteristics (biomass and activity) were not correlated with any of the mineralization kinetic parameters.

Soil samples were taken between November 2006 and May 2007 in a control Pasture, in the FL-High (Upper Slope position) and FL-Low (Lower Slope position) of the FL, and in the runoff area (RA). Urease activity and concentrations of Ammonium-N, Nitrate-N and urea-N were evaluated in the soil up to 60 cm depth. Urea-N values were always low (6 mg kg- 1), due to the high urease activity measured (438 mg kg- 1). Ammonium-N concentration was highest in FL-Low, reaching a value of 65. 5 mg kg- 1 at 40 - 60 cm soil depth.

Th erefore, the objective of this study was to test the structural and parametrical uncertainties associated with four conversion models typically used in cultivated agricultural landscapes. For the structural uncertainties, the <b>Soil</b> <b>Constituent</b> Redistribution by Erosion Model (SCREM) was developed and used to simulate the redistribution of fallout 137 Cs due to tillage and water erosion along a simple two-dimensional (horizontal and vertical) transect. Th e SCREM-predicted 137 Cs inventories were then imported into the conversion models to estimate the erosion rates. Th e structural uncertainties of the conversion models were assessed based on the comparisons between the conversion-model-estimated erosion rates and the erosion rates determined or used in the SCREM. For the parametrical uncertainties, test runs were conducted by varying the values of the parameters used in the model, and the parametrical uncertainties were assessed based on the responsive changes of the estimated erosion rates. Our results suggest that: (i) the performance/ accuracy of the conversion models was largely dependent on the relative contributions of water vs. tillage erosion; and (ii) the estimated erosion rates were highly sensitive to the input values of the reference 137 Cs level, particle size correction factors and tillage depth.

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} potential ecotoxicity of two emerging carbonaceous materials: C 60 and biochar. The {{use of these}} materials is rapidly increasing, {{as well as their}} potential for widespread applications. Thus, information about unintended consequences associated the widespread use, incidental or accidental release, and disposal of these emerging materials is needed. The environmental impacts of C 60, its stable water suspension (nC 60), and biochar are assessed here using bacteria and earthworms as model receptors. The antibacterial activity of nC 60 can be mitigated by the presence of natural organic matter as a <b>soil</b> <b>constituent</b> or dissolved in the water column. Sorption to soil might decrease the bioavailability of nC 60 and thus its toxicity to bacteria. Aqueous organic matter also may mitigate nC 60 toxicity. Pristine C 60 showed toxicity to the earthworm's reproduction and was rapidly bioaccumulated by earthworms, although to a lower extent than smaller phenanthrene molecules that are more hydrophobic; thus, the large molecular size of C 60 hinders its bioaccumulation. Less bioaccumulation occurred at higher C 60 concentration in soil, which is counterintuitive and reflects that higher C 60 concentrations that exceed the soil sorption capacity exist as larger precipitates that are less bioavailable. Earthworms avoided soils amended with high concentrations of dry biochar, and experienced significant weight loss after 28 -day exposure. The avoidance response was likely to avert desiccation rather than to avoid potential toxicants (i. e., PAHs formed during biochar production by pyrolysis) or nutrient scarcity. By wetting the biochar to field capacity before exposing the worms, this adverse effect can be completely mitigated. Overall, this research provides a foundation for ecotoxicity assessment associated with exposure to C 60 or biochar, and establishes a method by which other emerging materials can be evaluated for their potential environmental impacts...|$|E

In binary sorbents, ferrihydrite and humic acid coatings on montmorillonite provided sorption sites for 2, 4 -D, although the exclusion of the anionic form from highly charged clay surfaces partially obscured the role of Fe and HA as sorbents of 2, 4 D. Sorption of 2, 4 -D on ferrihydrite-HA binary particles was not very different from that on pure ferrihydrite because most of the ferrihydrite surface area was from micropores being not accessible to large humic macromolecules and hence remained available for herbicide sorption. In ternary sorbents HA coatings reduced the sorption of 2, 4 -D by the montmorillonite-ferrihydrite binary complex, indicating that HA blocked many of the sorption sites provided by the Fe coatings. This work shows that the amount and nature of the surface that remains available after the interassociation of single <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> is a critical parameter in determining the sorptive behavior of the resultant aggregate for ionizable contaminants such as 2, 4 D. Thus, the use of calculated sorption parameters such as K(oc), K(ow), K(minera), or K(Fe), for modeling contaminant behavior. In aquatic or soil environments may result in serious deviation from the reality. | Binary and ternary model particles containing montmorillonite, ferrihydrite, and humic acid (HA) {{were used to determine}} the changes in the sorption behavior of the herbicide 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dicholorophenoxyacetic acid) upon the interassociation of these three major <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> The results showed that the amount and nature of the surface that remains available after the interassociation of single oil constituents is a critical parameter in determining the sorptive behavior of the resultant aggregate for ionizable contaminants such as 2, 4 -D.

40|$|Near-infrared {{reflectance}} spectroscopy (NIRS) {{has been}} accepted as a fast method to evaluate various <b>soil</b> <b>constituents.</b> However, very few studies have used NIRS {{as a predictor of}} the textural and mineralogical content of tropical soils. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential use of NIRS as a tool for assessment of diverse soil properties, with specific attention to the prediction of properties related to the mineralogy of a wide range of Latosols from the Cerrado region of central Brazil. The reflectance of the soil samples, 148 in total, taken from 0. 0 to 0. 2 and 0. 6 to 0. 8 -m depth, was determined in the near-infrared region between 1100 and 2500 nm at 2 -nm intervals with a NIRS spectrophotometer. Our results show that for soil sampling corresponding to a large-scale map and taking into account the variability of Latosols over a wide region, NIRS can predict most of the mineralogical properties of the Latosols accurately. Near-infrared spectroscopy did not predict most of the physico-chemical characteristics of soils accurately, in particular those that are largely dependent on agricultural practice, such as pH or CEC. However, the main characteristics that correspond to <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> (organic matter and clay content) were relatively well predicted...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} elucidates {{the influence}} of special functional groups of organic xenobiotic chemicals on partly simultaneous molecular binding mechanisms. Organic xenobiotics are released as contaminants into the environment and are partially bound to <b>soil</b> <b>constituents,</b> such as humic substances (HS) and the mineral phase. The interaction of chemical contaminants with HS of soil was investigated using a labeling technique of soil samples with stable nitroxide radicals as model contaminants. These nitroxide radicals only differed in one functionality, a hydroxy or an amino functional group. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analyses of contaminated soil samples showed that the interaction was a multistage process that comprised an initial increase in the concentration of free organic radicals of soil influenced by contaminants with hydroxy or amino functionality, {{a decrease in the}} polarity of the molecular environment of soil, and a change in mobility of contaminant molecules. Towards the end of interaction, the concentration of free organic radicals usually decreased. Binding of contaminants to <b>soil</b> <b>constituents</b> via specific functionality was revealed detecting a change in their ESR spectra. Basing on the ESR analyses, a two-way exchange of protons' electron pairs between contaminants and HS was hypothesized to interpret the beginning of interaction. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of organic matter}} sources in soil is related to climate and vegetation dynamics in the past recorded in paleoenvironmental Quaternary deposits such as peatlands. For this reason, a Histosol of the mineralotrophic peatland from the Pau-de-Fruta Special Protection Area - SPA, Espinhaço Meridional, State of Minas Gerais, was described and characterized to evidence the <b>soil</b> <b>constituent</b> materials and properties as related to changes in environmental conditions, supported by the isotopic and elementary characterization of soil C and N and 14 C ages. Samples were collected in a depression at 1, 350 m asl, where Histosols are possibly more developed due to the great thickness (505 cm). Nowadays, the area is colonized by vegetation physiognomies of the Cerrado Biome, mainly rocky and wet fields (Campo Rupestre and Campo Úmido), aside from fragments of Semidecidual Seasonal Forest, called Capões forests. The results {{this study showed that}} early the genesis of the analyzed soil profile showed a high initial contribution of mostly herbaceous organic matter before 8, 090 ± 30 years BP (14 C age). In the lower-mid Holocene, between 8, 090 ± 30 years AP (14 C age) to ± 4, 100 years BP (interpolated age), the vegetation gradually became more woody, with forest expansion, possibly due to increased humidity, suggesting the existence of a more woody Cerrado in the past than at present. Drier climate conditions than the current were concluded ± 2, 500 years BP (interpolated age) and that after 430 years BP (14 C age) the forest gave way to grassland, predominantly. After the dry season, humidity increased to the current conditions. Due to these climate fluctuations during the Holocene, three decomposition stages of organic matter were observed in the Histosols of this study, with prevalence of the most advanced (sapric), typical of a deposit in a highly advanced stage of pedogenetic evolution...|$|E
40|$|Public {{pressure}} to use peat alternatives in horticultural rooting media offers {{room for the}} re-use of local organic waste materials. The re-use of organic wastes requires value added processing such as composting, co-composting, digestion, fractioning/sieving, pressing, binding, stabilising by torrefaction and charification, washing and nutrient exchange. Three cases are presented. In case 1, the new growing media project showed a successful reduction of peat in potting soil mixes at nurseries of 15 plant species. Peat use decreased from 78 to 27 %-v/v. The 51 %-v/v extra peat alternatives used were, averaged over all mixes used, 24 %-v/v coir products, 13 %-v/v wood fibre, 6 %-v/v bark products and 2 %-v/v for each of compost, rice husks, perlite or rockwool granulate. When compared to the standard control mixes yield decreased for two species, increased for two species and was equal for the remaining species. Important, sometimes limiting, properties were stability, nitrogen fixation, EC level, sodium level, rewetting rate and water holding capacity. In case 2 torrefaction at 250 °C was used to turn a fast degrading nitrate fixing reed (Phragmites australis) into a non-toxic potting <b>soil</b> <b>constituent</b> which could be added to potting soil mixes up to 80 %-v/v. In case 3 the cation exchange complex of coir was measured and saturated with calcium ions. The amount and concentration of a solution necessary to exchange sodium and potassium was 600 meq kg - 1 and was dosed as 10 L of 30 mmol L - 1 calcium nitrate. In all 3 cases product quality measurements and adapted processing or cultivation practises were discussed. A set {{of the most important}} measurements is presented, including: pH, EC, EC level, sodium level, potassium level, stability, nitrogen fixation, easily available water and rewetting rate. In conclusion additional or adapted processing of organic waste guided by proper measurements can increase the value of such organic waste for use in horticulture. </p...|$|E

Sequential extraction of soils and sediments has been developed to selectively remove and quantify contaminants from various defined geochemical fractions or mineral phases. The objective of these sequential extraction procedures (SEPs) is not to identify the actual form of a given metal in a soil or similar material, but to categorize the metals into defined geochemical fractions: e. g., exchangeable, acid extractable, reducible, organic, oxidizable, or residual. SEPs provide: (1) information on likely metal immobilization mechanism(s), (2) a mass balance of metal immobilization mechanisms, which can be used to gauge long term stability and develop site management criteria, (3) estimates on the fraction of metal in soil or sediment that may have ready impact to {{human health and the environment}} (free ion concentration from the exchangeable extraction), (4) estimates on the fraction of metal in soil or sediment that has the potential to be bioaccumulated in less-complex organisms and plants, (5) estimates on the fraction of metal in soil or sediment that has the potential to be bioaccumulated by more complex organisms...|$|R
