25|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>respiration</b> and its rate across {{ecosystems}} {{is extremely}} important to understand. This is because <b>soil</b> <b>respiration</b> plays {{a large role in}} global carbon cycling as well as other nutrient cycles. The respiration of plant structures releases not only CO2 but also other nutrients in those structures, such as nitrogen. <b>Soil</b> <b>respiration</b> is also associated with positive feedbacks with global climate change. Positive feedbacks are when a change in a system produces response in the same direction of the change. Therefore, <b>soil</b> <b>respiration</b> rates can be effected by climate change and then respond by enhancing climate change.|$|E
25|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>respiration</b> rates can {{be largely}} {{affected}} by human activity. This is because humans {{have the ability}} to and have been changing the various controlling factors of <b>soil</b> <b>respiration</b> for numerous years. Global climate change is composed of numerous changing factors including rising atmospheric CO2, increasing temperature and shifting precipitation patterns.

More specifically, in the agricultural ecosystems the influence of cultural practices and residue management techniques is important. Global change impacts on the phenomenon are still unclear. Some studies suggest that a positive feedback may occur. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} get to a better knowledge of the mechanisms involved. To reach this goal, many semi-mechanistic models have been developed. Compared to empiric models, they allow a better understanding of soil carbon dynamics by distributing total soil carbon content into several pools. This carbon allocation is based on carbon decomposition constants. However, these models work at very different spatial and temporal scales and many differences exist between them. These ones are put forward in this paper and the main biotic and abiotic <b>soil</b> heterotrophic <b>respiration</b> factors are also described...|$|R
25|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>respiration</b> {{is a key}} {{ecosystem}} {{process that}} releases carbon from the soil {{in the form of}} CO2. CO2 is acquired from the atmosphere and converted into organic compounds in the process of photosynthesis. Plants use these organic compounds to build structural components or respire them to release energy. When plant respiration occurs below-ground in the roots, it adds to <b>soil</b> <b>respiration.</b> Over time, plant structural components are consumed by heterotrophs. This heterotrophic consumption releases CO2 and when this CO2 is released by below-ground organisms, it is considered <b>soil</b> <b>respiration.</b>|$|E
25|$|As stated earlier, the CO2 {{released}} by <b>soil</b> <b>respiration</b> is a greenhouse gas {{that will continue}} to trap energy and increase the global mean temperature if concentrations continue to rise. As global temperature rises, so will the rate of <b>soil</b> <b>respiration</b> across the globe thereby leading to a higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, again leading to higher global temperatures. This {{is an example of a}} positive feedback loop. It is estimated that a rise in temperature by 2 degrees Celsius will lead to an additional release of 10 Pg carbon per year to the atmosphere from <b>soil</b> <b>respiration.</b> This is a larger amount than current anthropogenic carbon emissions. There also exists a possibility that this increase in temperature will release carbon stored in permanently frozen soils, which are now melting.

In this study, we collected forest soils from eight locations along a 3700 km north-south transect in eastern China (NSTEC). For 8 weeks these soils were incubated under a periodically changing temperature range of 6 - 30 degrees C while frequently measuring <b>soil</b> microbial <b>respiration</b> rate (Rs; each sample about every 20 min). This experimental design allowed us to investigate Rs and the temperature sensitivity of Rs (Q(10)) along the NSTEC. Both Rs at 20 degrees C (R- 20) and Q(10) significantly increased (logarithmically) with increasing latitude along the NSTEC suggesting that the sensitivity of <b>soil</b> microbial <b>respiration</b> to changing temperatures is higher in forest soils from locations with lower temperature. Our findings from an incubation experiment provide support for the hypothesis that temperature sensitivity of <b>soil</b> microbial <b>respiration</b> increases with biochemical recalcitrance (C quality-temperature hypothesis) across forest soils on a large spatial scale. Furthermore, microbial properties primarily controlled the observed patterns of R- 20, whereas both substrate and microbial properties collectively controlled the observed patterns of Q(10).

There were little differences in the functional diversity (AWCD) of soil microbial communities. Dehydrogenase, catalase, alkaline phosphatase, B-glucosidase and lipase showed little variability among soils while arylsulphatase, protease and urease activities varied within a fairly wide range of values. Values of the alkali-and water-soluble TEAC of urban soils varied within quite large ranges (2. 53 – 11. 45 mM g− 1 soil and 0. 11 – 2. 91 mM g− 1 dry soil, respectively) and were generally {{higher than those of}} control.
