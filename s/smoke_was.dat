5|$|By Thursday morning, the <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> {{visible as}} far south as South Bay, Los Angeles as well as in Antelope Valley {{prompting}} the Los Angeles Fire Department to issue a statement regarding multiple 9-1-1 calls being received for the smell of smoke. On the evening of Thursday 16, the sundowner winds resurfaced and once again forced the closure of the 101.|$|E
5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> {{observed}} at the mountain. However, {{this is often}} not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
50|$|Sidestream <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> <b>smoke</b> {{which goes}} into the air {{directly}} from a burning cigarette, cigar, or smoking pipe. Sidestream <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> the main component (around 85%) of Second-hand smoke (SHS), also known as Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) or passive smoking The chemical constituents of sidestream <b>smoke</b> <b>are</b> {{different from those of}} directly inhaled ("mainstream") smoke. Sidestream <b>smoke</b> has <b>been</b> classified as a Class A carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.|$|R

40|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>is</b> a {{temporal}} matter, a subtle substance that is looped and latticed with time. It is a substance born into and itself invoking inversiveness. <b>Smoke</b> <b>is</b> always mobile, {{it is the}} form of a passage, the passage of matter coming into form. <b>Smokes</b> <b>are</b> commonly thought of as rising or aspiring, hence their significance in the various holy smokes of ceremony and sacrifice. But <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> also cadent, and therefore lowering, the softness of its fall cloaking its unavoidability. <b>Smoke</b> <b>is</b> the body volatilised whether into spirit or intellection (Sherlock Holmes famously smoked his way through prodigious quantities of tobacco, almost in the process subliming himself into pure <b>smoke).</b> But it <b>is</b> always the sign too of the reversibility of that sublimation, of the dying fall into soot, dust or cinders. Perhaps this <b>is</b> why <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> always so premonitory. In the expression ‘no smoke without fire’, it functions as the index of indexicality itself, of the fact that nothing can come of nothing, that everything has been something else, elsewhere, otherwise, elsewhen. Smoke testifies not just to the slow...|$|R
5|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>was</b> not {{the only}} thing emitted from the power station. In July 1956, the {{discharge}} of cooling water from the stations was noted to have increased the water temperature of the river by 1.5°C between Ryton and Scotswood. However, this was found to not be too deleterious, as it did not seem to affect the passage of migratory fish. In fact, because of the stations' introduction of warm water into the river, basking sharks were known to be attracted to the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} cities {{continued}} into 1944 when another batch of four, Nos. 6249–6252, was built without streamlining. The cost of these locomotives averaged £11,664 each. A follow-up batch of three locomotives (Nos. 6253–6255) {{was built in}} 1946 and this batch attracted an inflationary average cost of £15,460 each. The problem of hanging <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> addressed and smoke deflectors were now incorporated into the design.|$|E
5|$|Byard {{moved to}} New York City {{in the early}} 1960s. His first {{recording}} as a leader, the solo piano Blues for <b>Smoke,</b> <b>was</b> recorded there on December 16, 1960 (but not released in the United States until 1988). Also in 1960, Byard first played with the bassist Charles Mingus. He recorded extensively with Mingus in the period 1962–64 (including on the important albums on Impulse! Records – Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus and The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady), and toured Europe with him in 1964. Byard also made recordings as a sideman between 1960 and 1966 with Eric Dolphy, Booker Ervin, Roland Kirk, and Rivers. His performance on Dolphy's Outward Bound put Byard {{at the forefront of}} modern jazz.|$|E
50|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>is</b> a {{collection}} of airborne solid and liquid particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may {{also be used for}} pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke-screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc.). <b>Smoke</b> <b>is</b> used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual purposes. <b>Smoke</b> <b>is</b> sometimes used as a flavoring agent, and preservative for various foodstuffs. <b>Smoke</b> <b>is</b> also a component of internal combustion engine exhaust gas, particularly diesel exhaust.|$|R
50|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>is</b> of {{questionable}} use with a swarm, because swarms {{do not have}} honey stores to feed on in response. Usually <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> not needed, since swarms {{tend to be less}} defensive, as they have no stores or brood to defend, and a fresh swarm has fed well from the hive.|$|R

5|$|During {{the second}} {{hour of the}} fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> {{building}} up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
5|$|On 20 March 2009, Emirates Airline Flight 407, an Airbus A340-500, {{was taking}} off from Melbourne Airport on Runway 16 for a flight to Dubai International Airport and failed to become {{airborne}} in the normal distance. When the aircraft was {{nearing the end of}} the runway, the crew commanded nose-up sharply, causing its tail to scrape along the runway as it became airborne, during which <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> observed in the cabin. The crew dumped fuel and returned to the airport. The damage caused to the aircraft was considered substantial. The aircraft damaged a strobe {{light at the end of}} the runway as well as an antenna on the localiser, which led to the ILS being out of service for some time causing some disruptions to the airport's operation.|$|E
5|$|Period dramas rely to {{an extent}} {{on the quality of}} production, so {{combining}} regal opulence with scruffy, depression-era London on the relatively limited £8million budget presented a challenge. On 25 November 2009 the crew took over the Pullens buildings in Southwark. To emphasise Logue's humble background, the entire street was transformed into one from 1930s London. Large advertisements for (among other things) Bovril and fascism were added to walls, grit and grime to streets and buildings. To reproduce London smog of the timethick enough that cars might need guidance from someone walking aheadso much artificial <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> used that fire alarms were triggered.|$|E

5|$|The {{fire started}} on August 17, 2013 at 3:25pm in the Stanislaus National Forest, east of Groveland, when a hunter {{lost control of}} an illegal campfire. The hunter was not {{identified}} publicly until a year later, when two felony, and two misdemeanor charges were filed against Keith Matthew Emerald of Columbia, California. The fire had only burned 40 acres when it was discovered, but it grew to 10,000 acres within 36 hours and 100,000 acres after just four days. In two days, in mid-August, the fire burned nearly 90,000 acres. The fire's rapid spread was attributed to drought and extreme weather conditions. It burned into backcountry areas of Yosemite National Park. The park remained open, and though Yosemite Valley was never in danger, the fire did burn 78,895 acres of parkland. Heavy <b>smoke</b> <b>was,</b> at times, a factor.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{controversy}} {{between the}} local organisation Galleri Texas and the state-owned corporation Follo Futura arose, regarding the hiring contract {{of the station}} building, and which of them were to operate the cultural meeting place. Follo Futura, which together with the Norwegian National Rail Administration and Rom Eiendom officially owned the station building wanted {{to take over the}} café business. They argued that they were better fit to operate it, since Galleri Texas did not have the economical capacity to run the café with the art exhibition and gift shop the whole week. The local community wanted Galleri Texas to operate the café, arguing that replacing a local company for a governmental one would weaken the local and patriotic spirit of the café. On 1 January 2010, the operation of the café and the cultural meeting place was transferred from Galleri Texas to Follo Futura, since Galleri Texas no longer could pay the rental costs. In 2010, <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> tumbling out of the station, but it turned out that it was only a cigarette that had not been quenched, and had been laying overnight in a flower basket.|$|E
5|$|The firefighters built bashings, {{walls of}} sandbags, turf and sand, {{approximately}} 18feet (5.5metres) deep and 17feet (5.2metres) {{up to the}} tunnel's roof to prevent smoke filling {{the rest of the}} workings and allow men to explore areas previously cut off. Within two days the temperatures dropped and the volume of <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> reduced. Although the fire was contained, miners still faced several obstacles, including roof collapses and large pockets of trapped firedamp. The first collapse consisted of more than 100 tons of debris, while another fall was more than 300feet (91.5metres) long and 30 to 40feet (10–12metres) high. Clearing the falls and finding bodies was slow, and it took until 8 November for the first of the 4 working districts to be explored and cleared of bodies. Many victims were unidentifiable—either the explosion, fire or subsequent decomposition had taken its toll—and many had to be identified by their personal effects, although some bodies remained unidentified.|$|E

50|$|In {{infectious}} disease control a <b>smoke</b> test <b>is</b> done {{to see whether}} a room is under negative pressure. A tube containing <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> held {{near the bottom of}} the negative pressure room door, about two inches in front of the door. The <b>smoke</b> tube <b>is</b> held parallel to the door, and a small amount of <b>smoke</b> <b>is</b> then generated by gently squeezing the bulb. Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not at negative pressure, the <b>smoke</b> will <b>be</b> blown outward or will stay stationary.|$|R

25|$|After {{a minute}} or so, a dark plume of <b>smoke</b> <b>was</b> {{observed}} rising from the wreckage. The fire was traced to a ruptured oil tank above the right engine. The leaking oil fell onto the hot engine and ignited. The fire was not fed by jet fuel.|$|E
