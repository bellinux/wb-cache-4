5000|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to the}} {{relative}} manufacturing quality of each nation's SKS production. The Chinese SKSs varied significantly even among new rifles with some having screwed in barrels, milled trigger groups and bolt carriers with lightening reliefs cut into them being at the top end and cheaper rifles having pinned barrels, stamped trigger groups and slab-sided bolt carriers - though overall quality and serviceability remained high. The main reason for the manufacturing variance comes from differences between rifles made for the Chinese army and those made for export. Yugoslav types are {{generally considered to be}} better made than Chinese export rifles when new, but this is often negated by the poor condition they are in due to hard use and neglect [...] The Chinese types typically have chrome-lined barrels while the Yugoslav versions do not, resulting in some Yugoslavian carbines having bores in considerably worse condition than even the cheapest Chinese SKSs. The Yugo M59/66 rifles also are unique in having a gas <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> <b>valve</b> for grenade launching, which is a common source of malfunctions. While often encountered in well-used condition, Romanian carbines were as well-built as the Soviet versions. In general, carbines made in the USSR are considered the highest quality.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLab on Chip {{technologies}} have enabled {{the possibility of}} novel μTAS devices (micro Total Analysis System) that could drastically improve health care services for billions {{of people around the}} world. However, serious drawbacks that reside in fluid handling technology currently available for these systems often restrict the commercialization of such devices. This work demonstrates a novel fluid handling method as a possible alternative to current micropumping techniques for disposable microfluidic chips. This technology is based on a single use, low cost, thermal micropumping system in which expandable microsphere mixtures are activated by commercial grade laser diodes to achieve flow rates as high as 2. 2 μl/s and total volumes over 160 μl. With the addition of a volume dependent <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> <b>valve,</b> nanoliter repeatability is realized. Pressure and heat transfer related data are presented.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 This thesis {{presents}} a novel microlamination architecture {{that enables the}} large scale integration of valves into low cost micro energy and chemical systems via membrane entrapment. Polycarbonate layers embossed with microfluidic channels were bonded by ultrasonic welding of raised embossed protrusions that penetrate though the PDMS membranes. The bonding pressure compresses the membranes and forms a conformal seal across the interface of the PDMS and polycarbonate effectively sealing the fluidic channels up to 22 PSI fluid pressure. When deflected into the microchannels by pneumatic pressure the membrane acts as proportional flow control and <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> <b>valves.</b> The architecture gives additional design freedom {{in the selection of}} materials since membranes can be entrapped in polymers that are incompatible for traditional bonding methods. The combination of high modulus polycarbonate layers with low modulus PDMS layers increases spatial intensification over monolithic PDMS microdevices that rely on bulk for rigidity. The ability to number up the layers for high throughput was demonstrated as well as the potential for two way valves and pumping mechanism...|$|R

50|$|Operation {{is similar}} to that of a ball valve, which allows for quick <b>shut</b> <b>off.</b> Butterfly <b>valves</b> are {{generally}} favored because they cost less than other valve design, and are lighter weight so they need less support. The disc is positioned in the center of the pipe. A rod passes through the disc to an actuator on the outside of the valve. Rotating the actuator turns the disc either parallel or perpendicular to the flow. Unlike a ball valve, the disc is always present within the flow, so it induces a pressure drop, even when open.|$|R

50|$|Slide valves were fitted {{underneath}} the cylinders, and were driven directly by eccentrics {{on the leading}} driving axle through Stephenson valve gear. This position had the advantage that, when the regulator was closed and steam pressure <b>shut</b> <b>off,</b> the <b>valves</b> would drop away from the steam ports, thus reducing wear on the valves and port faces. Dean's earlier designs had used slide valves mounted vertically between the cylinders; the new position allowed an increase in cylinder diameter from 17 in to 20 in in the Armstrong Class. The Dukes had 18 in diameter cylinders, possibly due to permanent way weight restrictions and a reduced supply of steam from the Dukes' smaller boilers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{battalion}} {{also designed}} a water distribution {{system for the}} village of Abu Suwaich, Iraq and installed a lift pump {{to improve the quality}} of life for the local villagers. Upon completion of its mission at Tallil Airbase, Iraq the battalion was moved to Al Taji Military Base, north of Baghdad, Iraq and served under the commands of the 1st Armored Division and the 1st Cavalry Division. [...] While at the Al Taji Military Base, the battalion operated construction supply and contractor entry points; constructed entry lanes and improved the primary entry point into the base. The battalion also designed and installed 25 low voltage power grids; calculated the electrical demand load for the entire Al Taji Military Base footprint for the prime power design team from the US Army Corps of Engineers; and identified and recorded grid locations for the black water treatment/removal system. Additionally, the battalion installed, repaired or renovated approximately 7 1/2 miles of 4 inch and below galvanized and PVC water distribution lines complete with main <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> <b>valves</b> and distribution gate valves. Over 300 emergency repairs were made to existing water distribution lines. The battalion conducted the master plan survey and design of Al Taji Military Base which included over 180 building assessments completed and drawn using Computer Aided Design (CAD). Over 524,000 cubic meters of debris was removed; over 1,178,000 square meters were cleared, grubbed and graded; over 130,000 cubic meters of gravel was hauled, spread and compacted; and the battalion contracted for over 31 million dollars worth of building renovations while at Al Taji Military Base. The battalion's average strength during the one-year deployment to Iraq was 479 soldiers and the battalion did not receive any combat casualties. The battalion redeployed on 3 June 2004 and demobilized at Ft Stewart, GA after serving approximately 15 months on active duty.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} an actuating device for opening and closing a shut-off fitting for pipes, said device automatically closing when a preset temperature is exceeded. In known automatically closing shut-off valves, complex measures are required to trigger the temperature monitoring function to prepare the valve for re-use. The actuating device according to the invention has a triggering device which prevents a first spring from <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> the <b>valve.</b> The triggering device is formed such that, {{in the event of}} rising temperature, the spring releases {{as the result of a}} temperature-related change in position and/or change in length, which closes the valve. After a preset temperature is undershot, the triggering device returns to its original position. By a simple rotating movement, the temperature monitoring function of the actuating device can be re-activated.

50|$|The {{throttle}} lever assembly is often designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine.

Pushing the levers forward automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The throttle lever must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> the fuel <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Trofimoff {{piston valve}} {{consisted}} of two fixed discs secured to the valve spindle, and two junk rings, each carrying a bull ring and four valve rings and both free to move longitudinally on the spindle. When the regulator is opened, steam forces the loose valve bodies against their respective fixed discs and they then act as units, similar to ordinary piston valves. When steam is <b>shut</b> <b>off,</b> the loose <b>valve</b> heads become detached from their respective discs and remain in their idle positions near {{the centre of the}} steam chest, while the valve spindle and fixed disks continue their reciprocating motion with the spindle sliding freely through the now stationary loose valve heads, and with the steam and exhaust ports now in communi&shy;ca&shy;tion. With both ends of the cylinders now in communication, the use of ordinary by-bass or snifting valves became unnecessary.|$|R
5000|$|Vickers {{pioneered the}} use of common rail {{injection}} in submarine engines. Vickers engines with the common rail fuel system were first used in 1916 in the G-class submarines. It used four plunger pumps to deliver a pressure of up to [...] every 90 degrees of rotation to keep the fuel pressure adequately constant in the rail. Fuel delivery to individual cylinders could be <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> via <b>valves</b> in the injector lines. Doxford Engines used a common rail system in their opposed-piston marine engines from 1921 to 1980, where a multi-cylinder reciprocating fuel pump generated a pressure of approximately , with the fuel being stored in accumulator bottles. [...] Pressure control was achieved {{by means of an}} adjustable pump discharge stroke and a [...] "spill valve". Camshaft-operated mechanical timing valves were used to supply the spring-loaded Brice/CAV/Lucas injectors, which injected through the side of the cylinder into the chamber formed between the pistons. Early engines had a pair of timing cams, one for ahead running and one for astern. Later engines had two injectors per cylinder, and the final series of constant-pressure turbocharged engines were fitted with four injectors per cylinder. This system was used for the injection of both diesel oil and heavy fuel oil (600cSt heated to a temperature of approximately 130 °C).|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{injectors}} {{composed of}} an orifice {{connected to a}} small plenum cavity were mounted on a detonation tube. These fuel injectors, termed fluidic valves, utilize their geometry and a supply pressure to deliver fuel and contain no moving parts. Behavior of these fluidic valves is characterized {{in order to determine}} their feasibility for integration with high-frequency pulsed or rotating detonation wave engines. Fuel flow is initiated just prior to ignition of the detonation tube to understand the interaction between the fluidic valves and the wave. Parametric studies have been conducted with the type of fuel injected, the orifice diameter, and the plenum cavity pressure. Results indicate that the detonation wave pressure temporarily <b>shuts</b> <b>off</b> the fluidic <b>valve</b> supply, but the wave products can be quickly expelled by the fresh fuel supply to allow for refueling. The interruption time of the valve scales with the injection and detonation wave pressure ratios as well as a characteristic time.

40|$|WSSPC {{recommends}} that each state, province or territory which is considering implementing requirements for installing automatic gas shutoff devices in industrial, commercial and/or residential applications assure that shutoff valves meet {{the provisions of}} the most currently available revision of ANSI/ASCE/SEI Standard 25 (Earthquake-Actuated Automatic Gas Shutoff Devices) and be installed in conformance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions. The cost versus benefit of turning gas on after an event or the analysis of false activation is left to the jurisdiction. The policy only advocates that if a decision is made to proceed with earthquake actuated automatic gas shutoff devices that the current state-of-the-art provisions be utilized. Executive Summary Natural gas piping and appliances may be damaged during earthquakes, causing gas leaks. These leaks, if ignited, can result in fires and explosions which may jeopardize personal safety as well as resulting in significant damage to structures. Fires and explosions may be more destructive to buildings than the earthquake itself. The ability to manually <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> a gas <b>valve</b> after an earthquake may be difficult or impossible due to debris or ground movement. Risk of gas related damage is further exacerbated if structures are unoccupied, thus placing the burden of <b>shutting</b> <b>off</b> gas service upon utilities or government agencies. The reliability of automatic gas shutoff valves has been greatly improved with the adoption o...|$|R
