5000|$|This {{distinction}} characterises [...] "intrinsic rights" [...] as {{the rights}} {{stemming from the}} issue of the security (voting rights, perception of dividends, ... as provided under company law), whereas [...] "substantive rights", are characterised as the rights resulting from the incorporation of the latter intrinsic rights in the securities (right to dispose and to acquire without the consent of the other shareholders or bondholders): these so-called [...] "substantive rights" [...] are closely linked to the [...] "rights in rem", which itself pertains to financial law, and, if not, to civil law. Making it short, [...] "intrinsic rights" [...] focus the content, whereas [...] "substantive rights" [...] focus on the external envelop constituted by the security. The Geneva Securities Convention, is thus limited to the external aspect of the security, that is to say the way securities are handled, in particular in case of acquisition (purchase, securities borrowing, receiving a collateral on securities) and in case of disposition (sell, <b>security</b> <b>lending,</b> constitution of a collateral on the security).|$|E
5000|$|This {{decomposition}} {{of the rights}} organised by Article 8 of the UCC results in preventing the investor to rivindicate the security in case of bankruptcy of the account provider, {{that is to say}} the possibility to claim the security as its own asset, without being obliged to share it at its prorate value with the other creditors of the account provider. As a consequence, it also prevents the investor, to assert its securities at the upper level of the holding chain, either up to the DTC or up to a sub-custodian. Such a [...] "security entitlement", unlike a normal ownership right, is no longer enforceable [...] "erga omnes" [...] to any person supposed to have the security in its custody. The [...] "security entitlement" [...] is a mere relative right, therefore a contractual right. Furthermore, this re-characterisation of the proprietary right into a simple contractual right enables the account provider, to [...] "re-use" [...] the security without necessarily being obliged to ask for the authorisation of the investor, in particular within the framework of temporary operations such as <b>security</b> <b>lending,</b> option to repurchase, buy to sell back or repurchase agreement.

40|$|Over the years, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has {{established}} margin regulations to limit purpose loans by banks and nonbanks to broker-dealers or other borrowers. In this study, the author reviews those regulations affecting <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> by banks and nonbanks. He examines data on security loans during the 1920 s and 1930 s, {{as well as}} in recent years, noting that <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> by banks and borrowing by broker-dealers often diverge-the popular notion that the two are tightly linked is not correct-and that during the 1920 s the volume of loans by banks to brokers may have been driven less by margin loans than by new issues of stocks and bonds by corporations. Also, during the 1928 - 29 episode, security loans by nonbank lenders, domestic and foreign, became increasingly important. The author points out that these observations have recent parallels.; The author also looks at the credit absorption hypothesis popular in the 1930 s, which argues that margin loans diverted credit from legitimate business uses to speculation, thereby weakening the financial positions of businesses. While the credit absorption view suggests that an increase in bank security loans should result in higher business loan rates relative to other short-term interest rates, the author finds no such effect. He concludes that the recent evidence suggests no credit absorption from bank security loans.

40|$|AbstractA stock loan, or equity <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> service, is a loan {{which uses}} stocks as collateral. The {{borrower}} {{has the right}} to repay the principal with interest and regain the stock, or make no repayment and surrender the stock. Therefore, the valuation of stock loan is an optimal stopping problem related to a perpetual American option with a negative effective interest rate. The negative effective interest rate makes standard techniques for perpetual American option pricing failure. Using a fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility model, we applied a perturbation technique to the free-boundary value problem for the stock loan price.

40|$|There {{are some}} {{statistical}} anomalies in the Chinese stock market, i. e., positive return skewness, anti-leverage effect (positive returns induce higher volatility than negative returns); and reverse volatility asymmetry (contemporaneous return-volatility correlation is positive). In this paper, we first confirm {{the existence of}} these anomalies using daily firm-level stock return data on the raw returns, excess returns and normalized excess returns. We empirically show that the asymmetry response of investors to news is one cause of the statistical anomalies if short sales are constrained. Then in the context of slow adoption of <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> policy, we conduct panel analysis and empirically verify that the lifting of short sale constraints leads to significantly less skewness, less anti-leverage effect and less reverse volatility asymmetry. Positive skewness is a feature of lottery. Investors are encouraged to bet on the upside lottery like potentials in the Chinese markets where the stocks skew more to the upside when short sales are constrained.

40|$|The first essay (Chapter 2) {{examines}} how investors behave in parallel markets that trade the same asset but have {{different degrees of}} transparency level. Using data from the Taiwan Security Borrowing and Lending market, we find that short sellers with private information prefer to trade in the opaque market, with momentum and risk-bearing trading strategies prefer to trade in the semi-transparent market, and with urgent liquidity needs (such as short-squeezed short sellers) prefer to trade in the transparent market. We show that transactions in both transparent and opaque markets contain information and provide liquidity. Our results indicate that parallel markets complement each other by serving different types of investors. The second essay (Chapter 3) shows {{that the presence of}} <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> supply before an initial public offering (IPO) reduces the initial stock return following IPO and improves the subsequent long-run performance. We use a sample of British firms that went public via a two-stage IPO procedure where a firm becomes publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange in the first stage, and offers new shares to the public in the second stage. Stocks are lendable before the new equity issuance which relaxes the short sale constraints that investors typically face in a conventional IPO. We find that twostage offerings with higher <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> supply before offering are associated with lower IPO underpricing and better long-run performance. Our results are consistent with the conjecture that short selling improves the pricing efficiency of the IPO market. The third essay (Chapter 4) examines the effect of short sellers as arbitrageurs on market liquidity in cases of toxic and non-toxic arbitrage opportunities. Arbitrage opportunities can be toxic when the prices of an asset-pair adjust to information at different speeds. In this case, market makers increase spread to avoid being picked off by informed arbitrageurs. Using price-parity deviations of Canadian stocks cross-listed in the U. S. market as arbitrage opportunities identifiers, we document that short arbitrageurs provide liquidity to the market in general, but impair liquidity in cases of toxic relative to non-toxic arbitrage opportunities. We also show that the liquidity impairment effect of short arbitrageurs is stronger when limits to arbitrage are high...|$|E

The fees are considerably lower compared to active managed fonds. For liquid share indices both strategies can replicate the index convincingly. In the EUROSTOXX the ETF can outperform the Index due to dividend and tax optimization. This was not possible for the Dax.

I provide new stylized facts and test the model’s implications using repo-rate data from regular US Treasury auctions. I find evidence that short-selling in on-the-run US treasuries is motivated by hedging rather than arbitrage activity. The hedging-based model matches a number of empirical patterns in prices and repo fees over regular auction cycles in US Treasury notes...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three studies in the investments field, which examines the interaction between long and short positions {{and their impact on}} market participants, prices and portfolio allocations. In chapter 2, I examine the optimal portfolio composition for institutional investors when considering liabilities. Institutional investors, by taking into account their short positions, which in effect are their liabilities, make different asset allocation decisions (long positions). Important in the optimization in excess of liabilities {{is the role of the}} asset classes in hedging the market value of liabilities. In chapter 3, I turn to the impact of short positions of market participants on prices by showing that limits to shorting lead to biased prices. In particular, I find that the presence of short sale constraints can explain the existence of a premium to Net Asset Value for Real Estate Investment Trusts. Miller (1977) argues that as short-sale constraints keep more pessimistic investors out of the market, prices tend to reflect a more optimistic valuation than they otherwise would. The results of 4 suggest that overpricing caused by the presence of short sale constraints is not solely due to restriction on negative information but also partly a result of capitalized lending income. I show that revenue associated with <b>security</b> <b>lending</b> is capitalization in prices, as investors are willing to pay a premium associated with lending fees...|$|E
