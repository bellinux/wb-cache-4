The aim of the diploma thesis is firstly to inform about availability <b>of</b> ecological <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> for poultry bred in ecological agriculture, also to suggest measures which would lead for ensuring of organic food sufficiency. To accomplish the given aim, the diploma thesis is divided into two main sections. The first section is a literary overview and the second one is a practical section. The literary overview introduces the ecological agriculture in the Czech Republic discussing plant and animal production. In the section concerning plant production is dealt with basic conditions which must be observed to lead to good yield. Animal production focuses on breeding of poultry in ecological agriculture and analyses main specifics of their breeding. The practical part of the diploma thesis was created on the basis of ascertained information from poultry breeders and specialized literature materials. Gained information were evaluated. The result of the practical should be: 1. availability <b>of</b> ecological <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> for poultry bred in ecological agriculture in the Czech Republic 2. suggestion of possible measures leading for ensuring of organic food sufficiency for poultry 3. suggestion of alternatives for shortage <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> in organic food Contribution of the diploma thesis is in findings of necessity of new agricultural areas for ensuring <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> base for poultry as dynamically developing sector of ecological agriculture...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{the general}} {{rules for the}} {{marketing}} <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> are spread over several Directives according to the type <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> concerned. There is Directive 79 / 373 /EEC on compound feed covering also pet food where the rules for the circulation <b>of</b> this <b>feed</b> in the EU are laid down (e. g. labelling requirements). Directive 93 / 74 /EEC lays down the principles for feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes (dietetic feeds). Directive 96 / 25 /EC contains the general rules for the circulation and use <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> Directive 82 / 471 /EEC lays down the marketing conditions for certain products, belonging to the category <b>feed</b> <b>materials,</b> used in animal nutrition (bio-proteins). Thus, the current rules are found in old Directives and some 50 amending or implementing acts. This has made existing legislation extremely scattered with many cross references and difficult to understand and implement in a uniform way. Feed legislation sets the rules for the different categories as <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials,</b> dietetic <b>feed,</b> feed additives and medicated feed, differentiating between food producing animals and pets. Though horses might {{not be used for}} food production in all cases, feed legislation has to consider them as food producing animals because they enter to a significant extent the food chain. The main improvement of the proposal will be achieved by setting modern rules under one Regulation resulting in more legal clarity and a more homogenous market. In particular, the grey zone between <b>feed</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>feed</b> additives and veterinary drugs would be cleared. Further, the use of claims will be better regulated and thus enforceable for the control authorities. On feed intended for particular nutritional purposes, the current system will be more or less retained. The proposal introduces a broad definition of labelling. Consequently, the required truthfulness of the information attributed to a product is not only limited to the sack label but as well to all other material supporting the sale. Additionally, it is highlighted that sales via the internet are covered by the marketing rules. Furthermore, proposal increases the accuracy of the indication <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> incorporated in compound feed for food producing animals by requiring the indication in descending order of weight. The exact percentage has to be indicated for raw <b>materials</b> in compound <b>feed</b> that are highlighted on the label. The proposal follows the philosophy that information needed by the feed user for an informed choice and safety relevant information must be provided unequivocally and in a harmonised way throughout the Community. Further labelling particulars can be given on a voluntary basis to fulfil special interest of customers, but then these have to be accurate and understandable for each target group, and the industry could label all details voluntarily. Stakeholders will be encouraged to develop EU codes for good labelling practice in the context of voluntary labelling provisions. The proposal is now in negotiation in the Council of the EU and the European Parliament for adoption. vo...|$|R
40|$|Near-infrared {{spectroscopy}} {{combined with}} chemometrics {{was applied to}} construct a hybrid model for the non-invasive detection of protein content in different types <b>of</b> plant <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> In total, 829 samples <b>of</b> plant <b>feed</b> <b>materials,</b> which included corn distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS), corn germ meal, corn gluten meal, distillers' dried grains (DDG) and rapeseed meal, were collected from markets in China. Based on the different preprocessed spectral data, specific models for each type <b>of</b> plant <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> and a hybrid model for all the materials were built. Performances of specific model and hybrid model constructed with full spectrum (full spectrum model) and selected wavenumbers with VIP (variable importance in the projection) scores value bigger than 1. 00 (VIP scores model) were also compared. The best spectral preprocessing method {{for this study was}} found to be the standard normal variate transformation combined with the first derivative. For both full spectrum and VIP scores model, the prediction performance of the hybrid model was slightly worse than those of the specific models but was nevertheless satisfactory. Moreover, the VIP scores model obtained generally better performances than corresponding full spectrum model. Wavenumbers around 4500 cm- 1, 4664 cm- 1 and 4836 cm- 1 were found to be the key wavenumbers in modeling protein content in these plant <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> The values for the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and the relative prediction deviation (RPD) obtained with the VIP scores hybrid model were 1. 05 % and 2. 53 for corn DDGS, 0. 98 % and 4. 17 for corn germ meal, 0. 75 % and 6. 99 for corn gluten meal, 1. 54 % and 4. 59 for DDG, and 0. 90 % and 3. 33 for rapeseed meal, respectively.

The process variables were particle size, die temperature, and screw speed. Experimental results showed that: (1) Particle size had strong effects on the starch digestibility, and physical properties <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> corn extrudates. The extrudate''s starch digestibility, expansion ratio, shear force, yellow value, and moisture content <b>of</b> 10 mesh <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> were greater than 18 mesh. (2) For the extrudates of 10 mesh material, the maximum starch digestibility, expansion ratio, and specfic volume occurred at 140 die temperature. Increasing the die temperature increased the yellow value; but decreased the extrudate''s shear force. However, there were no significance differences between moisture content and die temperature. Increasing the screw speed lifted the extrudate''s shear force; but decreased the extrudate''s starch digestibility, epansion ratio, specfic volume, and yellow value. (3) For the extrudates <b>of</b> 18 mesh <b>feed</b> <b>material,</b> increasing the die temperature decreased the extrudate''s expansion ratio, shear force, specfic volume, yellow value, and moisture content. There were no significant effects between extrudate''s starch digestibility and die temperature.
