5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the <b>sun</b> <b>sets.</b> Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E

5|$|While on {{the trail}} of the vampire known as The Moon, they then run into trouble when the shape-shifting vampire Hierophant tracks them and finds them. The group {{attempts}} to fight him, but he proves to be too powerful. When notified by Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) that the Hierophant cannot enter houses without permission, Jake shapeshifts into a house and the group takes shelter inside. The Hierophant then tells Marceline that he didn't come to fight, but to propose an alliance to take down the Vampire King together. Marceline agrees only on the condition that the Hierophant no longer drinks blood, but he attacks her instead. During the struggle, he is accidentally knocked into Jake and dies due to entering a house uninvited. Marceline reabsorbs his shapeshifting powers but then falls ill, having been stung and poisoned by the Hierophant's stinger. Princess Bubblegum takes Marceline to the Candy Kingdom {{to try to find a}} cure for the Hierophant's poison. Meanwhile, Finn and Jake track down the Moon in hopes of using her healing power to heal Marceline. Upon finding the Moon, they find that due to her healing powers, they can't kill her with their stakes. When the <b>sun</b> <b>sets,</b> the Moon wakes up and Finn and Jake flee, luring the Moon to the Candy Kingdom. However, when they try to fight back, the Moon uses her powers to incapacitate Finn and Jake as she attempts to kill Marceline.

25|$|SÃ£o Paulo {{is known}} for its rapidly {{changing}} weather. Locals say that all four seasons can be experienced in one day. In the morning, when winds blow from the ocean, the weather can be cool or sometimes even cold. When the sun hits its peak, the weather can be extremely dry and hot. When the <b>sun</b> <b>sets,</b> the cold wind comes back bringing cool temperatures. This phenomenon happens usually in the winter.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that sleep patterns vary significantly across cultures. The most striking differences are between societies that have plentiful sources of artificial light and {{ones that do}} not. The primary difference appears to be that pre-light cultures have more broken-up sleep patterns. For example, people without artificial light might go to sleep far sooner after the <b>sun</b> <b>sets,</b> but then wake up several times throughout the night, punctuating their sleep with periods of wakefulness, perhaps lasting several hours.|$|E

25|$|The {{lighting}} {{effects are}} {{the work of}} Claude Engle, world-renowned engineer and theatrical lighting consultant, notable for his lighting schemes in The Louvre and the Reichstag. The colours slowly cycle through the colour spectrum, and come alive as <b>sun</b> <b>sets.</b> Every 15 minutes, the pods change to different colours: red, green, blue, purple, and orange. Also, a reflection from the inside with different lights illuminating the pods causes mirror images over panes of glass, creating 6 more pods. The lighting is computer-controlled and uses simple PAR can spotlights and gels.|$|E

GC troopers continued to wear aluminium badges of rank, which were worn on the right sleeve, 11.5 centimetres below the right shoulder strap. Constables wore aluminium bars at the outer edges of the shoulder straps. The dark blue trousers were secured by the two-pronged black leather Garrison Belt, and completed by standard-issued black leather boots.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sun</b> <b>sets</b> on November 18 or 19, and {{it remains}} below the horizon for about 65 days. This creates a polar night that lasts until the Sun returns to lightly touch the horizon (due to the {{refraction}} and scattering of the atmosphere) by January 22 or January 23. The sun then rises again completely over the horizon by January 27 or 28. During {{the first half of}} the polar night, there is a decreasing amount of twilight each day, and on the winter solstice (around December 21 or December 22), civil twilight in Barrow lasts for a mere 3 hours.|$|E

The Great Pumpkin Fest is a family-friendly Halloween event open during the day, while the park is under normal operation.

25|$|Among {{the guests}} are three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, {{who have come}} to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their gifts of beauty and song, respectively. Before Merryweather is able to give her blessing, the evil fairy Maleficent appears, only to be told that she was not invited. Maleficent turns to leave, but when Queen Leah asks if she's offended, the evil fairy curses the princess, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the <b>sun</b> <b>sets</b> on her sixteenth birthday, she will use her finger to touch the spindle of a {{spinning}} wheel and die. King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the fairies to break the curse. Unfortunately, they are not strong enough to break it, but Merryweather uses her blessing to soften the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they spirit her away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday.|$|E
