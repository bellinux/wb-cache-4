It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen {{under the influence of}} the Internet and other new media, such as <b>Short</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Service</b> (SMS) text messaging. Since the beginning of human-computer interaction (HCI) leading to computer-mediated communication (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and usability. Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and web usability. This study is intended to benefit both linguists and web users.|$|E

500|$|Comverse {{became a}} market leader in voice {{messaging}} software and boomed {{during the late}} 1990s with the surge in mobile phone use. [...] Much of its market focus was on wireless operators and overseas companies, and it gained a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market. The growth coincided with SMS text messages becoming popular; the first big application for SMS was as a notification mechanism to tell a wireless subscriber that voicemail were stored in a voicemail box. [...] Comverse expanded this application into a full-blown <b>short</b> <b>message</b> <b>service</b> center (SMSC), which receives, buffers, processes, and dispatches all SMS messages throughout a mobile network. [...] Comverse branded and productised this as the Intelligent <b>Short</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Service</b> Center, or ISMSC. [...] Typical of telecomm software, it ran on Unix-based platforms, such as UnixWare and later Linux. [...] Comverse's ISMSC found success as a lower-price solution for lower-traffic networks, where it competed with Logica's Telepath solution. [...] Other companies in the SMSC space included CMG and Openwave. [...] ISMSC found considerable market penetration, exemplified by all six of Hong Kong's wireless carriers using it.|$|E

This paper aims {{to assess}} the {{effectiveness}} of reinforcement of oral health education <b>message</b> through <b>short</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>service</b> (SMS) in mobile phones. Material and Methods. 400 subjects from two colleges (200 from each college) belonging to 18 – 20 years age group possessing mobile phones were randomly selected and baseline examination of oral hygiene and gingival status was carried out using Oral Hygiene Index (OHI) and Gingival Index (GI). Oral health education was provided to all the subjects. Oral health education message was reinforced through <b>short</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>service</b> (SMS) in mobile phones for the subjects belonging to the intervention group. There was no such reinforcement for the control group. Follow-up examinations were done {{at the end of}} 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, and 6 th month.

[...] It established a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market and sold a popular <b>short</b> <b>message</b> <b>service</b> center (SMSC) product.
