2500|$|Initially, the album's {{original}} working {{title was}} [...] "Condition of a Heart", however she claimed she didn't want a complicated album, claiming, [...] "I {{want people to}} take this album home and wrap it around their own lives {{the way they did}} with 'Innocent Eyes'." [...] She also claimed that the new album was going to be lighter than her previous work. The newspaper Sydney Morning Herald revealed that the album was going to be [...] "a more upbeat, inspirational tone in her pop music." [...] In contrast to her previous album, which was darker because Goodrem had written about her cancer battle, Delta reflects changes in her personal life; her parents had divorced, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> mother Lea stand down as her manager as well as discussed her relationship with pop-singer Brian McFadden, whom Delta co-wrote the majority of the songs on the album.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing a live Garbage performance, Jon Parales of The New York Times commented, [...] "Temptress, lover, sufferer, {{scrapper}} – {{those have}} been Ms. Manson's personae since Garbage started in 1995. In other eras {{she might have been}} a pop torch singer, a soul belter or a new-wave frontwoman: a Shirley Bassey, a Dusty Springfield, or a Chrissie Hynde. There's a little of each of them in her voice" [...] also stating [...] "In the course of each song <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> voice rise in anger, contempt or passion". Jen Crothers of Green Left Weekly, in a review of Garbage, remarked that [...] "Manson, vocalist and guitarist, has a powerful voice, which soars and dips like a bird. It can plead or demand. It can sound dreamy or psychotic." [...] Reviewing a 2012 live Garbage performance, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph noted that Manson [...] "remains a striking performer whose distinctive contralto snarl can still raise the hairs {{on the back of your}} neck." [...] In a review of Garbage, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Manson's voice as [...] "thin and airy", whilst Mike Diver of the BBC stated Manson owned [...] "a snarl in her voice but [...] equally capable of a purr to melt away any resistance." [...] also adding [...] "even at her most vulnerable, Manson maintains her controlling condition".|$|E

2500|$|She {{capitalized}} on the attention received from her duet with artist Andy Hui, [...] "Do {{you really have}} me in your heart?" [...] (其實你心裡有沒有我), winning the 1993 Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards with that song. Cheng then went through a transformation, dying her hair orange, changing her style. Her 4th studio album [...] "Sammi's Happy Maze" [...] (鄭秀文的快樂迷宮) was also released, which include the hit single [...] "Chotto Matte" [...] (Chotto 等等). Her new image fitted well with the new single, which was a remake of a Japanese song by Maki Ohguro. The success helped Sammi and boosted her singing career. In 1994 she continued to capitalize on her wild, new image. Her first album of that year was [...] "Big Revenge" [...] (大報復). The album included the hit [...] "Ding Dong" [...] (叮噹), which became one of Sammi's signature songs. But with her new fame also came a lot of backlash from the media. Critics argued that Sammi purposely westernized her Cantonese. Instead of saying [...] "Ding Dong", Sammi pronounced it as [...] "Deen Dong". Despite the criticism, the song {{was one of the}} most popular dance songs of that year. In 1994 the racy and controversial cut of [...] "Ten Commandments" [...] (十誡) was banned from the radio for a few days after its initial airplay of the track including tiny bits of what can be recognized as pornography soundtrack. In 1995 Cheng disappeared from the public eye for nearly half a year. Later that year, it was revealed that Warner Music Group had signed her. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> hair color return to black and temporarily abandoned the wild image she used to have.|$|E
