40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} management strategies on growth, composition and nutrient up¬take of a cover crop mixture of <b>summer</b> <b>vetch</b> and oil radish {{were tested in}} field ex¬pe¬ri¬ments on the Research Station Gladbacherhof. Slurry application and cereal straw management (incorporation vs. harvesting) affected composition of cover crop signifi-cantly: slurry application decreased legume content and biological N 2 -fixation signifi-cantly. By this way the N-input in farm cycle were reduced. The higher the amount of straw residues were left on field, the higher the legume content was in the cover crop mixture. High legume content in cover crop mixtures not only increased N 2 -fixation, but also P uptake of the cover crop. According to available literature additionally mobilised P increased the P supply of following crops. The harvest of cover crop sprout reduced nitrate leaching potential significantly especially when winter crops were following. The harvest of the cover crops increased the amounts of N cycling within the farming system. Hence it allows higher N manuring to selected crops with a high N demand...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} effects of saffron residues on wheat, rye, vetch and bean, an experiment {{was conducted in}} Research Greenhouse of College of Agriculture, Frdowsi University of Mashhad, in 2005. The type of design was split factorial arrangement of treatment based on randomized complete block design with three replications. Main plots included of four crop species, wheat, rye, vetch and bean, and sub plots were saffron corm and foliage, and amount of saffron tissue added to the soil (4. 25, 15, 30 and 75 g of grounded tissues in 1. 5 kg soil). Results showed that source of saffron tissues {{and the amount of}} added tissue to soil, had a significant effect on some of the studied factors in four crops. With increasing the amount of saffron leaf tissue added to the soil, in compare with control, chlorophyll percentage, plant height, leaf surface area, shoot and root biomass were increased, but with increasing the amount of saffron corm tissue compare with control, all studied traits were decreased. <b>Summer</b> crops (<b>vetch</b> and bean) were affected by saffron corm and foliage tissues less than winter crops (wheat and rye). In conclusion, saffron corm and foliage residue had a pronounce allelopathic and promotive effect on the studied crops.

40|$|In {{the trial}} {{carried out in}} Van, Turkey in spring in 2003, 6 common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), 1 hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) and 1 {{hungarian}} vetch (Vicia pannonica Crantz) cultivars were grown. The experiment was conducted in the randomized complete block design with three replications. The highest dry matter yield (6068 kg ha - 1) and crude protein yield (987 kg ha - 1) {{were obtained from the}} hairy vetch Cv. Efes- 79. Alinoglu and Farukbey cultivars (Vicia sativa L.) gave the highest N content whereas Alinoglu Cv. gave the highest Ca content. The hairy vetch had the highest nutrient uptake. The tetany rates were in the normal limit values in all vetch cultivars. As a result, among the different vetch species and cultivars grown in the <b>summer,</b> the hairy <b>vetch</b> (Vicia villosa Roth) can be suggested in Van ecological condition because of its high dry matter yield, protein yield and nutrient content...|$|R
40|$|Vegetables {{are among}} the main {{ingredients}} of the Mediterranean cuisine and thus enlarging organic local markets increase their demand for a diversity of vegetables. Long-term rotations based mainly on vegetables are rather rare in the Mediterranean countries. A four year experiment was carried out between 2006 and 2010 at Ege University Department of Horticulture in cooperation with CIHEAM Mediterranean Institute of Bari. And two different pre-crops, broccoli and vetch were tested under an organic management system as compared to fallow during the autumn-winter period. The summer main crops were rotated between solanaceous and cucurbitaceous vegetables as tomato (2007), zucchini (2008) pepper (2009) and eggplant (2010). The experiment aimed at recommending sustainable rotation plans for organic vegetable growers in western Turkey. Broccoli represented the farmers’ choice as a winter vegetable prior to the <b>summer</b> crop. <b>Vetch</b> (incorporated) was selected as leguminous green manure well adapted to the regional conditions. All the management including disease and pests were handled according to the organic regulations valid in Turkey and the EU. Soil fertility was maintained by incorporation of crop residues {{at the end of}} both cycles and addition of organic-certified commercial compost and compost tea during the main cycle as a standard amendment. Effect of pre crops and main crops on soil organic matter and, primary nutrients, and weed abundance and yield were assessed for each main crop cycle. Soil organic matter values showed significant differences before and after the winter or summer cycle and fluctuated between 0. 7 and 3. 0 %. Soil N, P and K contents were kept at rich or sufficient levels for four years. The variation in soil organic matter, N, P and K displayed similar trends during in the tested precrop and fallow control plots during the four year period. The broccoli plots had lower soil potassium levels compared to the other two. Weed diversity varied according to the annual climatic conditions however broccoli exhibited a marked weed suppressing effect mainly due to shading and allelopathy...|$|R
40|$|The current {{interest}} in conservation agriculture (CA) technologies {{is a result}} of the need to reduce excessive land degradation in most crop producing areas as well as to enhance sustainable food production. Cover crops that are usually grown under CA to provide soil cover, may offer secondary benefits, depending on the farming system. The concept of growing cover crops is a relatively new phenomenon to smallholder farmers. Production of large biomass yields and weed suppression from cover crops were major challenges affecting success and uptake of CA technologies by smallholder irrigation farmers. Coupled with this, low soil fertility limit maize productivity and reduce water use efficiency on smallholder irrigation schemes in what is largely a water strained agro-ecology in South Africa. While cover cropping can increase maize productivity, benefits of different types of mulch are not well understood, leading to challenges in selecting the most appropriate cover crop species to grow in the Eastern Cape Province (EC) of South Africa (SA) which has a warm temperate climate. With respect to any new technology, smallholder farmers are more interested in the economic benefits. Cover crops have been defined as leguminous or non-leguminous plants used for ground cover in various temporal and special configurations used in crop or animal production systems. The purpose of these cover crops is to improve on or more of the following: soil erosion, availability and cycling of N, P, K, Ca and other nutrients, soil moisture and water infiltration, and weed or pest control (Eilitta et al., 2004) [...] Improvement of animal or human diet may be additional goals. This definition accommodates diverse systems which may include intercrop and sole-cropping systems. In the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, a government initiative has promoted the growing of winter cover crops in smallholder irrigation schemes (Allwood, 2006). In other parts of Africa, legume food crops have been simultaneously grown with cereal staples to improve both soil cover and human diet (Eilitta et al., 2004). Winter experiments were undertaken in 2007 and 2008 to evaluate biomass accumulation, C and N uptake, weed suppression and response to fertilization. Winter cover crops planted included; oats (Avena sativa), grazing vetch (Vicia dasycarpa), faba bean (Vicia faba), forage peas (Pisum sativum) and lupin (Lupinus angustifolius). After cover crops were terminated, the effects of residues on weeds, fertility, moisture conservation and maize productivity were undertaken in the 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09 summer seasons. Field studies were also done in the 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09 summer seasons to investigate effects of strip intercropping patterns (3 : 2; 4 : 2; and 6 : 2 patterns) of maize (cv. PAN 6479) with mucuna (Mucuna pruriens) or sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea) on maize productivity and summer cover crop biomass production. In a separate experiment effects of relay intercropping sunnhemp, mucuna and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) on biomass accumulation and maize productivity were investigated. Decomposition, N and P release from both winter cover crops and summer cover crops were also assessed in laboratory incubation experiments. Oats, grazing vetch and forage peas cover crops produced mean dry mass of 13873 kg/ha, 8945. 5 kg/ha and 11073 kg/ha, respectively, while lupin had the lowest dry mass of 1226 kg/ha over the two seasons. Oats responded to fertilization while, there was little or no response from the other winter cover crops. Oats and grazing vetch also reduced weed density by 90 % and 80 % respectively while lupin only reduced weed density by 23 % in relation to the control plots. Nitrogen uptake was 254 kg N/ha for oats while it was 346 kg N /ha for grazing vetch. In the subsequent <b>summer</b> season, grazing <b>vetch</b> and forage pea residues significantly (P 0. 05) affect maize biomass and grain yield. Sorghum experienced the largest drop in biomass when relay-intercropped with maize. Mucuna resulted in the highest N uptake (271 kg N/ha) in sole cropping while sorghum had the lowest (88 kg N/ha). Grazing vetch results in high biomass yields with minimal fertilizer application in a warm-temperate climate. Grazing vetch mulch is also the most cost effective mulch for better early weed control, improving soil mineral N status, water conservation and ultimately enhanced maize productivity in smallholder irrigation maize-based systems. The 3 : 2 pattern maximizes summer cover crop biomass yields compared to the 6 : 2 and 4 : 2 patterns. However, the 3 : 2 pattern may slightly depress yields in a water stressed environment. Relay intercropping mucuna, sunnhemp and sorghum into a maize crop at 42 days after maize sowing has no effect on maize productivity while cover crop biomass yields are low. Having a long winter fallow period after maize harvesting, a common practice in the study area, reduces the positive impact of legume cover crops on soil mineral N. Results suggest that winter cover crops may result in weed control, soil fertility and maize yield improvement benefits while a long fallow period may cancel-out these benefits for summer cover crops. Grazing vetch is a cost effective cover crop that produces high maize yields with minimal fertilizer input. Maize growing on oat mulch requires more fertilizer application than crops growing on grazing vetch mulch. Conservation agriculture systems in which summer cover crops are grown alongside the maize crop with a long winter fallow period do not produce the intended CA benefits...|$|R
