2500|$|In 1987, Denise [...] "Vanity" [...] Matthews {{claimed she}} {{was engaged to}} Sixx. In his book , he {{describes}} his relationship with her, [...] "Vanity came and went during different periods of my addiction. She was a wild black chick who had sung with Prince: she’d also been his lover for a while. At the time I thought of Vanity as a disposable human being, like a used needle. Once its purpose was fulfilled it {{was ready for the}} trash, only to be dug up if you were really desperate…We became drug buddies: sometimes, you could even just about call us boyfriend and girlfriend. Vanity also taught me how to really freebase: the first time I based was with Tommy when Mötley just started and only a few times after that. So up until then, I’d been mostly snorting or injecting. But as soon as <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the real ins and outs of cooking up a good rock…it was love. Not her. The drug." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally named Dead Lesbian {{and then}} the Fibrillating Scissor Sisters, the final two words of the latter being derived from the lesbian sexual act tribadism, the band was founded in 2000 after friends Jake Shears and Scott [...] "Babydaddy" [...] Hoffman (who had met in 1999 in Lexington) both moved to New York City, enjoying its open and gay-friendly ethos. They began {{producing}} music together, with Babydaddy composing music and Shears writing lyrics. The duo released a couple of singles to little success and began appearing at underground clubs on New York's Lower East Side. On a trip to Disneyland, the pair met Ana [...] "Ana Matronic" [...] Lynch at a screening of Michael Jackson's Captain EO. During a subsequent teacup ride, they discovered {{that they had a}} lot in common. Shears later remarked, [...] "I really thought she was a freak but when I started singing [...] "Another Part of Me" [...] <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the best moonwalk I've ever seen." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> Juans {{who feared}} their call-time, [...] Guessing their lot; <b>She</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> her sort that cursed their fall-time, [...] And that did not. Till {{suddenly}} murmured she: [...] "Now, tell me, Why asked you never, ere death befell me, [...] To have my love, [...] Much as I dreamt thereof?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To have a {{nice little}} room, and make flowers, like a French girl I know. It's such pretty work, and she gets lots of money, for every one likes her flowers. <b>She</b> <b>shows</b> <b>me</b> how, sometimes, and I can do leaves first-rate; but--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{slightly}} <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> her arm, {{and it was}} fearfully thin indeed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Jo! She's fast asleep, so I won't {{wake her}} to ask leave. <b>She</b> <b>shows</b> <b>me</b> all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I look at this", thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug, with the tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} of the quarrel, and of how Josephine had looked and talked when <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> her cheek.|$|E
60|$|At last <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> {{the letter}} he had written. I was {{curious to see}} it, but had not ventured to ask for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "As to you, {{you have}} been flirting with Miss Mann. <b>She</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the other day a plant you had given her.--Fanny, I am ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{done more}} than that, Jack. She's waked <b>me</b> up. <b>She's</b> <b>shown</b> <b>me</b> that I can't afford to ride trail and camp and cook and fight fire any more. I've {{got to get out}} into the world and rustle a home that a girl like her can be happy in. I'm started at last. I want to do something. I'm as ambitious as a ward politician!" ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Janie said <b>she</b> would <b>show</b> <b>me</b> {{the short}} {{cut across the}} fields; we could talk as we went. We walked in silence for awhile.|$|R
50|$|Robyn - Following Robyn {{while she}} records {{her new album}} with Röyksopp, dancing and a photoshoot. <b>She</b> {{performs}} <b>Show</b> <b>Me</b> Love at Sergels torg at the end.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! No; <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> {{over the}} {{greatest}} part on Saturday--and {{we were coming}} here to these rooms--but only"--dropping her voice--"your father was with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{wrote to}} her, but <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the letter, {{and put it}} in the fire unopened. He had written his name, Marmaduke Ingles, on a corner of the envelope.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To Mrs. Sankey I owe {{very much}} for the {{kindness}} <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me,</b> and the pains she took with me; and I owe much, too, to Mr. Jeemajee, the Parsee merchant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{she has not}} {{proposed}} it. But {{she talks}} of it, saying {{that it would not}} do. Then when I tell her that of course it would not do, <b>she</b> <b>shows</b> <b>me</b> all that would make it expedient. She is so sly and so false, that with all my eyes open I cannot quite understand her, or quite know what she is doing. I do not feel sure that she wishes it herself." ...|$|R
60|$|And yet {{in spite}} of this and many lesser kindnesses <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> to <b>me,</b> I never really liked her; but rather feared her, {{dreading}} always the sudden raising of those ever half-closed eyelids.|$|R
6000|$|A day or {{two later}} Mr. Spillikins was saying, [...] "I think Mrs. Everleigh must have had great sorrow, don't you? Yesterday <b>she</b> was <b>showing</b> <b>me</b> a {{photograph}} of her little boy--she has a little boy you know--" ...|$|R
6000|$|She had an hesitation. [...] "Yes, <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> her letter. She wouldn't {{have done}} {{anything}} else. I let it go because I didn't know what course was best. I'm afraid to oppose her to her face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look {{forth and}} view the night!" [...] was her cry; and when I lifted the heavy blind from the {{casement}} close at hand--with her own royal gesture, <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> a moon supreme, in an element deep and splendid.|$|E
60|$|The {{criminal}} {{left the}} prison, on the expiration of her sentence, so secretly {{that it was}} impossible to trace her. Some months later, Miss Jillgall received an illustrated newspaper published in the United States. <b>She</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> one of the portraits in it.|$|E
6000|$|... “I know it. She {{come from}} New York. But {{yesterday}} she say to me: ‘Let us wheel leetle Jane to the live oak at Burney’s.’ How can she {{know there is}} live oak at Burney’s? Then, the first day she come, she say: ‘Take baby’s milk into vault under your room an’ put on stone shelf to keep cool.’ I, who live here, do not know of such a vault. <b>She</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> some stone steps in one corner, an’ she push against stone wall. Then wall open like door, an’ I find vault. But how she know it, unless she is witch-woman?” ...|$|R
60|$|Her voice, when <b>she</b> {{answered}} <b>me,</b> <b>showed</b> {{some signs}} of agitation.|$|R
60|$|FENWICK. Mr. Austin, Dorothy Musgrave is {{the oldest}} and dearest of my friends; is the lady whom for ten years {{it has been my}} hope to make my wife. <b>She</b> has <b>shown</b> <b>me</b> reason to discard that hope for another: that I may call her Mrs. Austin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "if {{you will}} not be caring for my pretty clothes, see what I have done with our two chambers." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the place all very finely swept and the fires glowing in the two chimneys.|$|E
60|$|It was {{no matter}} of wonder {{to me to}} find Mrs. Steerforth devoted to her son. She seemed {{to be able to}} speak or think about nothing else. <b>She</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> his picture as an infant, in a locket, with some of his baby-hair in it; <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> his picture as he had been when I first knew him; and she wore at her breast his picture as he was now. All the letters he had ever written to her, she kept in a cabinet near her own chair by the fire; and she would have read me some of them, and I should have been very glad to hear them too, if he had not interposed, and coaxed her out of the design.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{that would}} be too bad! Mamma has talked to me so much. She said I must make it a rule never to have debts. <b>She</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> how she pays her bills every week, and gave me a great book like hers. I began at Winchester.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes {{they are}} now, by letter, {{and she says}} she will wait for him till I die, or she is twenty-six, if I don't give my consent. He writes every mail, from places with outlandish names, in Africa. And she keeps looking in a glass ball, like the labourers' women, some of them; she's sunk as low as that; so superstitious; and {{sometimes}} she tells me that she sees what he is doing, and where he is; and now and then, when his letters come, <b>she</b> <b>shows</b> <b>me</b> bits of them, to prove she was right. But just as often she's wrong; only she won't listen to me. She says it's Telly, Tellyopathy. I say it's flat nonsense.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She replied, with {{a mixture}} of modest evasiveness and adorable simplicity, that she had {{sometimes}} seen gentlemen angling from a meadow-bank {{about a quarter of a}} mile below her flower-garden. I risked everything in my usual venturesome way, and asked if <b>she</b> would <b>show</b> <b>me</b> where the place was, in case I called the next morning with my fishing-rod. She looked dutifully at her father. He smiled and nodded. Inestimable parent! ...|$|R
60|$|Looking more bewildered, {{and even}} frightened, than before, the girl hurriedly opened {{one of the}} doors in the passage. I saw, as I entered, that <b>she</b> had <b>shown</b> <b>me,</b> in her confusion, into the wrong room. Mr. Sherwin, who was in the apartment, hastily drew a screen across the lower end of it, {{apparently}} to hide something from me; which, however, I had not seen as I came in.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} maid-servant {{had shut}} the door, I told her to inform her master that I wanted {{to say a word}} to him in private. <b>She</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> into the parlor behind the shop, and there was Mr. Yatman all alone, reading the newspaper.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the set range, at one side, and the {{refrigerator}} in an alcove, {{which she said}} went with the flat, and, [...] "Lena," [...] {{she said to the}} cook, [...] "this is the Altrurian gentleman I was telling you about, and I want him to see your kitchen. Can I take him into your room?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miriam was engaged, as I {{have told}} you, {{to a young}} Harvard man named Sidney Claxton. I knew she loved him very deeply. When <b>she</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> his photograph, I liked his {{appearance}} and said so. Then I made some teasing remark about her love-letters--just for a joke, you know. Miriam {{looked at me with}} an odd little smile and said quickly: ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabel judged {{best not}} to show this letter to her uncle; but she acquainted him with its purport, and, as she expected, he begged her {{instantly}} to assure Miss Stackpole, in his name, {{that he should be}} delighted to receive her at Gardencourt. [...] "Though she's a literary lady," [...] he said, [...] "I suppose that, being an American, <b>she</b> won't <b>show</b> <b>me</b> up, as that other one did. She has seen others like me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Forel, [...] "you know best. Still, I can't help fancying you are unduly {{proud of}} your affliction, {{because it is}} {{scarcely}} perceptible to other people, while Miss Deringham has {{not a great deal}} to maintain her position with. You see the death duties are heavy in the old country, and from the letters <b>she</b> has <b>shown</b> <b>me</b> Deringham appears to have involved the estate considerably during his stewardship." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{thing she}} brought in was two flat Dutch spirit-bottles, sewn between {{two pieces of}} canvas. It had got strings sewed on for tying round the body, and put on as <b>she</b> did to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> how, one bottle {{each side of the}} chest, it lay pretty flat.|$|R
