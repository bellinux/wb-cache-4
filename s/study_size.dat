30|$|When {{comparisons}} between DLS and TEM radiuses are made, {{it must be}} noted that these techniques and particle size distributions are fundamentally different. TEM distribution datapoint is based on the number of the particles in a <b>studied</b> <b>size</b> class whereas DLS distribution is based on the intensity of light that is scattered by the <b>studied</b> <b>size</b> class. Some overestimation is therefore expected. For a polydisperse sample, this might be significant, and in case of PSi nanoparticles, which all have a wide size distribution, it is possible that the overestimation is explained by this difference between techniques. But in this case, we should observe correlation between the overestimation and the polydispersity.|$|R

50|$|The {{strategy}} of development of GKT-831 was initially {{focused on the}} treatment of fibrosis and particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a life-threatening disease. GKT-831 obtained orphan drug designation from regulatory agencies in US and EU in early 2010. Despite excellent in vitro and in vivo pharmacology results obtained in preclinical pharmacological models of fibrosis and IPF, and promising phase 1 data showing low toxicity of GKT-831, the company Genkyotex decided to initiate a phase 2 Proof-of-concept in the complex indication of diabetic nephropathy in 2014. As a result, GKT-831 did not reach primary clinical end point and the compound failed to make any significant reduction in albuminuria. Thereafter, the company decided to refocus development to initial clinical applications in fibrosis. In May 2017, Genkyotex announced FDA approval of IND for phase 2 clinical trials in patients with primary biliary cholangitis with extended treatment duration and large <b>study</b> <b>size</b> potentially allowing to assess the effects of GKT-831 on liver inflammation and fibrosis.|$|E

40|$|Estimating {{the power}} for a {{non-linear}} mixed-effects model-based analysis is challenging {{due to the}} lack of a closed form analytic expression. Often, computationally intensive Monte Carlo studies need to be employed to evaluate the power of a planned experiment. This is especially time consuming if full power versus sample size curves are to be obtained. A novel parametric power estimation (PPE) algorithm utilizing the theoretical distribution of the alternative hypothesis is presented in this work. The PPE algorithm estimates the unknown non-centrality parameter in the theoretical distribution from a limited number of Monte Carlo simulation and estimations. The estimated parameter linearly scales with <b>study</b> <b>size</b> allowing a quick generation of the full power versus <b>study</b> <b>size</b> curve. A comparison of the PPE with the classical, purely Monte Carlo-based power estimation (MCPE) algorithm for five diverse pharmacometric models showed an excellent agreement between both algorithms, with a low bias of less than 1. 2  % and higher precision for the PPE. The power extrapolated from a specific <b>study</b> <b>size</b> was in a very good agreement with power curves obtained with the MCPE algorithm. PPE represents a promising approach to accelerate the power calculation for non-linear mixed effect models...|$|E

40|$|Background Empirical {{research}} has illustrated {{an association between}} <b>study</b> <b>size</b> and relative treatment effects, but conclusions have been inconsistent about the association of <b>study</b> <b>size</b> with the risk of bias items. Small studies give generally imprecisely estimated treatment effects, and study variance {{can serve as a}} surrogate for <b>study</b> <b>size.</b> Methods We conducted a network meta-epidemiological study analyzing 32 networks including 613 randomized controlled trials, and used Bayesian network meta-analysis and meta-regression models to evaluate the impact of trial characteristics and study variance on the results of network meta-analysis. We examined changes in relative effects and between-studies variation in network meta-regression models {{as a function of the}} variance of the observed effect size and indicators for the adequacy of each risk of bias item. Adjustment was performed both within and across networks, allowing for between-networks variability. Results Imprecise studies with large variances tended to exaggerate the effects of the active or new intervention in the majority of networks, with a ratio of odds ratios of 1. 83 (95 % CI: 1. 09, 3. 32). Inappropriate or unclear conduct of random sequence generation and allocation concealment, as well as lack of blinding of patients and outcome assessors, did not materially impact on the summary results. Imprecise studies also appeared to be more prone to inadequate conduct. Conclusions Compared to more precise studies, studies with large variance may give substantially different answers that alter the results of network meta-analyses for dichotomous outcome...|$|E
