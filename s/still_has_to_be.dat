It also reduces risks of an employee taking money from the drawer without a record and the owner's consent, such as when a customer does not expressly ask for a receipt but <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given change (cash is more easily checked against recorded sales than inventory).|$|E

However, the adoption of such amendment <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confirmed by the Council of States, the upper house of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland. In addition, a citizens' initiative to restrict the operational life-time of nuclear reactors to 45 years will have to be voted upon, irrespective of whether the legislature's amendment will actually come into force or not.|$|E
25|$|The soft spile in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile.

There <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with a hard one (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped up to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E

500|$|Barroso's first Commission term expired on 31 October 2009. Under the Treaty of Nice, {{the first}} Commission to be {{appointed}} after the number of member states reached 27 {{would have to be}} reduced to [...] "less than the number of Member States". The exact number of Commissioners was to be decided by a unanimous vote of the European Council and membership would rotate equally between member states. Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007, this clause took effect for the next Commission. The Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on 1 December 2009, mandated a reduction of the number of commissioners to two-thirds of member-states from 2014 unless the Council decided otherwise. Membership would rotate equally and no member state would have more than one Commissioner. However, the treaty was rejected by voters in Ireland in 2008 with one main concern being the loss of their Commissioner. Hence a guarantee given for a rerun of the vote was that the Council would use its power to amend the number of Commissioners upwards. However, according to the treaties it <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fewer than the total number of members, thus it was proposed that the member state that does not get a Commissioner would get the post of High Representative– the so-called 26+1 formula. This guarantee (which may find its way into the next treaty amendment, probably in an accession treaty) contributed to the Irish approving the treaty in a second referendum in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|According to Zimmerman, garbha {{may also}} mean the {{interior}} or center of something, and its essence or central part.

As a bahuvrihi it may refer to a person as having an embryonic tathagata inside. In both cases, this embryonic tathagata <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developed. Zimmerman concludes that tathagatagarbha is a bahuvrihi, meaning [...] "containing a tathagata", but notes the variety of meanings of garbha, such as [...] "containing", [...] "born from", [...] "embryo", [...] "(embracing/concealing) womb", [...] "calyx", [...] "child", [...] "member of a clan", [...] "core", which may all be brought into mind when the term tahtagatagarbha is being used.|$|E
2500|$|Sigmund Freud: In the Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1916-1917) Freud wrote: [...] "There can be {{no doubt}} that the source [...] lie in the instincts; but it <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{explained}} why the same fantasies with the same content are created on every occasion. I am prepared with an answer that I know will seem daring to you. I believe that...primal fantasies, and no doubt a few others as well, are a phylogenetic endowment". His suggestion that primal fantasies are a residue of specific memories of prehistoric experiences have been construed as being aligned with the idea of archetypes. Laplanehe and Pontalis point out that all the so-called primal fantasies relate to the origins and that [...] "like collective myths they claim to provide a representation of and a 'solution' to whatever constitutes an enigma for the child".|$|E

60|$|Anyhow, {{we could}} have believed, {{in the time of}} the Free Silver fight, that the Democratic party was {{democratic}} with a small d. In Mr. Wilson it was transfigured, his friends would say into a higher and his foes into a hazier thing. And the Republican reaction against him, even where it has been healthy, has also been hazy. In fact, it has been not so much the victory of a political party as a relapse into repose after certain political passions; and in that sense there is a truth in the strange phrase about normalcy; in the sense that there is nothing more normal than going to sleep. But an even larger truth is this; it is most likely that America is no longer concentrated on these faction fights at all, but is considering certain large problems upon which those factions hardly troubled to take sides. They are too large even to be classified as foreign policy distinct from domestic policy. They are so large as to be inside as well as outside the state. From an English standpoint the most obvious example is the Irish; for the Irish problem is not a British problem, but also an American problem. And this is true even of the great external enigma of Japan. The Japanese question may be a part of foreign policy for America, but it is a part of domestic policy for California. And {{the same is true of}} that other intense and intelligent Eastern people, the genius and limitations of which have troubled the world so much longer. What the Japs are in California, the Jews are in America. That is, they are a piece of foreign policy that has become imbedded in domestic policy; something which is found inside but <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regarded from the outside. On these great international matters I doubt if Americans got much guidance from their party system; especially as most of these questions have grown very recently and rapidly to enormous size. Men are left free to judge of them with fresh minds. And that is the truth in the statement that the Washington Conference has opened the gates of a new world.|$|E
60|$|But {{the voice}} of archaeological and {{historical}} criticism <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard; and it gives forth no uncertain sound. The marvellous recovery of the records of an antiquity, far superior to any that can be ascribed to the Pentateuch, which has been effected by the decipherers of cuneiform characters, has put us {{in possession of a}} series, once more, not of speculations, but of facts, which have a most remarkable bearing upon the question of the truthworthiness of the narrative of the Flood. It is established, that for centuries before the asserted migration of Terah from Ur of the Chaldees (which, according to the orthodox interpreters of the Pentateuch, took place after the year 2000 B.C.) Lower Mesopotamia was the seat of a civilisation in which art and science and literature had attained a development formerly unsuspected or, if there were faint reports of it, treated as fabulous. And it is also no matter of speculation, but a fact, that the libraries of these people contain versions of a long epic poem, one of the twelve books of which tells a story of a deluge, which, in a number of its leading features, corresponds with the story attributed to Berosus, no less than with the story given in Genesis, with curious exactness. Thus, the correctness of Canon Rawlinson's conclusion, cited above, that the story of Berosus was neither drawn from the Hebrew record, nor is the foundation of it, can hardly be questioned. It is highly probable, if not certain, that Berosus relied upon one of the versions (for there seem to have been several) of the old Babylonian epos, extant in his time; and, if that is a reasonable conclusion, why is it unreasonable to believe that the two stories, which the Hebrew compiler has put together in such an inartistic fashion, were ultimately derived from the same source? I say ultimately, because it does not at all follow that the two versions, possibly trimmed by the Jehovistic writer on the one hand, and by the Elohistic on the other, to suit Hebrew requirements, may not have been current among the Israelites for ages. And they may have acquired great authority before they were combined in the Pentateuch.|$|E
