50|$|Baba Faqir Chand, (18 November 1886 - 11 September 1981) was an Indian {{master of}} Surat Shabd Yoga, or {{consciously}} controlled near death experience. He {{was one of}} the first saints or gurus of Sant Mat tradition to openly speak and write against the deceptive and harmful practices of modern guruism and religious intolerance. As a highly pragmatic individual, Faqir also strove to explain the various practices and principles of Sant Mat based on his own experiences and in the context of modern science and psychology. He was also the first Sant Mat guru to talk about the phenomena consisting of a believer experiencing a <b>subjective</b> <b>projection</b> of a sacred or holy form of a guru or idol without the conscious knowledge of the person at the center of the experience, i.e., the guru. This was termed the 'Chandian Effect', and described by researcher David C. Lane. Faqir Chand claimed that he had no knowledge of his form manifesting before a person and helping them with their worldly or spiritual problems. He fervently expressed that in his experience, the real helper is one's own true self and faith.Mark Juergensmeyer, another researcher on new religious movements (including Radha Soami Mat), intrigued by the uniqueness of Faqir Chand's experiences, also interviewed him. This insightful interview was included in Faqir's autobiography.|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that speakers signal the informational status of referents {{through a combination of}} intonation, word order and lexical realisation. In this paper, I argue for a non-binary view of information structure with referents being (1) hearer and discourse new, (2) discourse new but hearer given and (3) hearer and discourse given. Thus there can be no simple one-to-one relationship between information structure, lexical realisation and accenting. In the spoken data examined, evidence was found to substantiate a relationship between referential distance and lexical realisation but not between referential distance and tonic accenting. Tonic accents signal speakers’ <b>subjective</b> <b>projection</b> of the importance of a referent but the exact informational meaning signalled by the referent depends on a combination of tonic accent, tone choice, key, linear position and lexical realisation...|$|E

Para tanto, apresenta o fenômeno pela ótica do sistema subjetivo de projeção onde o consumidor não é livre e racional no ato de consumo, mas sim iludido pela possibilidade de ascensão social imediata com a alienação de seu trabalho futuro. Com esta visão, propugna pela criação do prazo de reflexão e ampliação do direito de arrependimento como forma de combate às compras irrefletidas e, pelo reconhecimento do direito de renegociação quando as dívidas de consumo se tornem excessivamente onerosas ao consumidor. Ao final, demonstra a importância do plano de renegociação via câmaras judiciais ou extrajudiciais, fixando-lhe contornos. Abstract: This {{article focuses}} on demystifying the main paradigm of the consumer over-indebtedness is a misconduct punishable, the setback of the solution. It presents the phenomenon {{from the perspective of}} <b>subjective</b> <b>projection</b> system where the consumer is not free and rational in the act of consumption, but misled by the possibility of upward mobility with the immediate sale of their future work. With this view, advocates the creation of the period, and expansion of the right of repentance as a way to combat mindless shopping and the recognition of the right to renegotiate if the consumer debt becomes too costly to consumers. In the end, demonstrates the importance of the plan through renegotiation or extra-judicial chambers, fixing her contours...|$|E

40|$|Records from 18 of {{the longest}} and most {{reliable}} rainfall stations in the sugar industry were subjected to a spectral analysis which showed significant long-term oscillations with a mean wavelength of 19, 2 years. The wavelength varied from 17, 7 years in the northern rainfed areas to 22, 5 years {{in the southern part}} of the cane belt. Shorter oscillations were also found with wavelengths of 2, 2, 3; 6 and 6, 8 years. The last wavelength (6, 8 years) is of greater significance in the south. The data are presented graphically following smoothing with a binomial filter which attenuates wavelengths shorter than 5 years. Examination of sunspot records show that the double sunspot series has in recent times had a period of about 20 years and that it appears to be related to the rainfall oscillations. Based on <b>subjective</b> <b>projections,</b> as well as on predictions based on sunspot behaviour ther...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{philosophical}} project outlined by Hermann Schmitz and Gernot Böhme and subsequently developed by many other scholars (philosophers and architects, urban planners and sociologists, geographers and psychologists, designers and political experts, etc.), {{the purpose is}} to thematise the emotional tones of different spaces (affordances) and to assess their impact on the felt-body: an impact that cannot be reductively considered as an arbitrary <b>subjective</b> <b>projection</b> and that poses not only aesthetical but also ethical problems. An atmospherological approach could have vast and promising applications in the field of human sciences for all those who are interested in understanding the effectiveness of the emotions we feel in natural and/or artificial environments. In this way, by becoming {{aware of the fact that}} atmospheres are more effective than we have been rationally willing to admit and that traditional aesthetics, unilaterally oriented towards art, has understimated this truth, it would be also possible to recognize und undestand the mise-en-scène that makes up a large part of our daily life. And, last but not least, it would be also possible to realise the possibility we have of not being acritically subjected to the effects of atmospheres, if we are aware of their generative mechanisms. An atmosphere possesses and exercises authority over the perceiver and his felt-body. This authority (in a sense a “numinous” one) exists in the proper sense only when it prevails over our resistance and we cannot access a further critical level. This is because an atmosphere that I feel externally, as poured out into the surrounding space is mine not because I possess it, but because it concerns me. Its normativity, moreover, is not so much discreet but rather loosely diffused into a situation and yet it is able to inhibit any critical distance in those who come across it, especially if unexpectedly. This atmospherogical approach implies of course a reflection about the ethical consequences of our “necessary” felt-bodily feelings. Even if the manipulative appearance is implicit in every practice that generates an atmosphere, it’s true that only by acquiring a better atmospheric “competence” (both as thinkers and perceivers) we can really learn how not to be grossly manipulated. An atmosphere is moreover maybe less manipulative when it allows a quick alternation between an uncritical-pathic immersion and a critical-rational emersion, namely between an emotional mood and a more analytical one...|$|E
5000|$|Dehumanized {{perception}} {{has been}} indicated to occur when a subject experiences low frequencies of activation within their social cognition neural network. This includes areas of neural networking {{such as the}} superior temporal sulcus and the medial prefrontal cortex. A study by Frith & Frith in 2001 suggests the criticality of social interaction within a neural network has tendencies for subjects to dehumanize those seen as disgust-inducing leading to social disengagement. Tasks involving social cognition typically activate the neural network responsible for <b>subjective</b> <b>projections</b> of disgust-inducing perceptions and patterns of dehumanization. [...] "Besides manipulations of target persons, manipulations of social goals validate this prediction: Inferring preference, a mental-state inference, significantly increases MPFC and STS activity to these otherwise dehumanized targets." [...] A 2007 study by Harris, McClure, van den Bos, Cohen & Fiske suggest a subject's mental reliability towards dehumanizing social cognition due to the decrease of neural activity towards the projected target, replicating across stimuli and contexts.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this thesis, {{emphasis}} was situated around {{the development of}} academic awareness among students studying to become teachers of English. To enable such investigation, {{a limited number of}} students were requested to submit written papers, conducted within two particular English courses provided at Linnaeus University. The courses concerned are named Academic writing – provided during the first semester of English studies – and Academic writing and rhetoric – provided during the second semester of English studies –. By investigating papers written within these two courses, conclusions could be drawn regarding the students’ development in academic writing. Twenty-five students decided to share their material, and submitted two productions each. Hence, the amount of written work to investigate was delimited to fifty papers. The investigation was conducted through a qualitative study where certain features, connected to the formal genre of academic writing, were analyzed. Information packaging and <b>subjective</b> <b>projections</b> were found to be valid measures of such investigation. The results showed that there was an overall improvement. In fact, all calculations conducted within these measures, indicated that the students had developed their academic awareness...|$|R

Thus, neglect results in a tilt of the body midline representation...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} {{discussion}} of disenchantment and re-enchantment Charles Taylor {{suggests that it}} is possible to respond to the disenchanted view of the world, in which meaning and value are understood as <b>subjective</b> <b>projections,</b> by articulating a re-enchanted sense of nature or the universe from the perspective of human ‘agency-in-the-world’, in which meaning and value are objective. The question I address in this thesis is, what could it mean to articulate a re-enchantment from within our ‘agency-in-the-world’? In Chapter One I examine the work of John McDowell in order to explore the possibility that he gives sense to the idea of a re-enchantment from within our agency-in-the-world. I conclude that he provides one way of doing so. However I argue that McDowell’s naturalism of second nature can seem limited as it does not address the ‘proto-religious’ dimension to Taylor’s understanding of re-enchantment. In Chapter Two I turn to the work of Roger Scruton to consider whether he provides a re-enchantment from within our agency-in-the-world that does accommodate this proto-religious dimension. I conclude that he does, but raise concerns about how convincing Scruton’s re-enchantment is. I argue that, from a McDowellian point of view, a case can be made that Scruton implicitly accepts as true certain significant elements of the disenchanted view of the world. In Chapter Three I look to the later Heidegger for an alternative re-enchantment from within our agency-in-the-world that attempts to accommodate the proto-religious. I focus on two interpretations of the later Heidegger given by Julian Young and Charles Taylor. In response to a worry put forward by Young, I argue that Charles Taylor’s interpretation can accommodate a proto-religious dimension. In my Conclusion I argue that McDowell’s naturalism of second nature and the understanding of our agency-in-the-world as presented by Taylor’s Heidegger, form interestingly continuous re-enchantments. On this basis I argue that although McDowell himself does not extend his idea of second nature to accommodate the proto-religious, the example of later Heidegger shows that there is nothing inherently limited about the framework of second nature that means it cannot be extended to encompass important proto-religious responses to the world...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} since World War II of authoritative demographic projections {{has brought}} to discussions ofhuman population prospects an unwarranted sense of complacency. Because the projections are gener-ally accepted as expert and reliable, non-demographic analysts tend to see projected population growth as an inevitable and unstoppable force in human affairs. A common but erroneous statement is that population is expected to double or even will double in size {{in the next century}} or so. It is my intention to discuss population prospects while challenging public perceptions of population pro-jections. These projections are valuable tools for considering the human prospect. They are, however, misun-derstood as reliable guides to the future of human numbers, and this misunderstanding has potentially hazard-ous consequences. In particular, the apparent mathematical precision of projections encourages the misconcep-tion that there is nothing anyone can do about population growth, when there is very much we can and should do. The usefulness of projections could be enhanced by much more open discussion of the assumptions that underlie them, and an occasional challenge of some of those assumptions. The challenge presented here is based on several principles. One, prediction of human behavior is necessar-ily <b>subjective.</b> The <b>projection</b> process is only objective insofar as it is made manageable by a handful of consis-tent assumptions, all of which depend on subjective judgment about future trends in fertility, mortality and migration, the three key variables of demographic analysis. Two, consideration of population prospects ideally should be an interdisciplinary endeavor that takes int...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores how {{different}} interfaces to a problem-solving task affect how users perform it. Specifically, {{it focuses on}} a customized version of the game of Four-in-a-row and compares play on a physical, tangible game board with that conducted in mouse and touch-screen driven virtual versions. This is achieved through a repeated measures study involving a total of 36 participants and which explicitly assesses aspects of cognitive work through measures of time task, <b>subjective</b> workload, the <b>projection</b> of mental constructs onto external structures and the occurrence of explanatory epistemic actions. The results highlight the relevance of projection and epistemic action to this problem-solving task and suggest that the different interface forms afford instantiation of these activities in different ways. The tangible version of the system supports the most rapid execution of these actions and future work on this topic should explore the unique advantages of tangible interfaces in supporting epistemic actions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a prototype for an educational toolkit (DIY GIS) {{to learn and}} teach some important elements of urban design, planning and management. The project aimed at developing a platform that addresses geographic mapping as {{a process that is}} <b>subjective</b> (of a <b>projection</b> of the user-inhabitant’s imagination) as well as objective (of the territory as a concrete structure). The platform applies text mining and conversation analysis to geolocalized user generated content (real-time data coming from Twitter, Facebook, FourSquareFoursquare, Flickr) in order to return meaningful visual images and maps about citizens' perception of public services, urban public spaces, and of the city as a whole. This platform has been developed and tested in some workshops with students in the field of architecture. From an educational point of view the platform itself can be considered a sort of toolkit that allows students to harvest, connect, analyze and interpret real-time data streams and to visually represent them in a personalized way. The students have to actively configure this toolkit in order to perform queries and design maps that are meaningful for the specific place under analysis and for their objectives. The paper focuses on both the design process of the toolkit and the first observations of the platform in use during some workshops carried out in the last months of 2011 in order to assess its education potential...|$|R
