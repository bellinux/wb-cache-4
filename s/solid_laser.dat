50|$|The {{principal}} {{differences between}} the behavior of glass and crystalline ceramic laser host materials {{are associated with the}} greater variation in the local environment of lasing ions in amorphous solids. This leads to a broadening of the fluorescent levels in glasses. For example, the width of the Nd3+ emission in YAG is ~ 10 angstroms as compared to ~ 300 angstroms in typical oxide glasses. The broadened fluorescent lines in glasses {{make it more difficult to}} obtain continuous wave laser operation (CW), relative to the same lasing ions in crystalline <b>solid</b> <b>laser</b> hosts.|$|E

50|$|Gokudera is a {{dynamite}} {{specialist who}} {{uses it to}} either threaten or battle opponents. He was revealed {{to be able to}} conceal dynamite on his body. Originally, Gokudera's main weakness was {{the fact that it was}} difficult to pinpoint and calculate the exact distance between himself and his target and sync it with the amount of time it would take for the bombs to actually explode. Gokudera learned from Dr. Shamal, to use a type of Rocket Bombs. Each one, once thrown, causes the backside of the bombs to fire up and rocket towards his opponent like high-speed missiles, which then explode on impact.he also smokes in the manga but doesn't in the anime which makes his way of lighting his bomb a mysteryIn the future arc of the manga, the future Gokudera created Sistema Cambio Arma Istantaneo (lit. System Change Arms Instantaneous; Italian for Instantaneous Arms Rearrangement System), commonly called Sistema C.A.I., a system of box weapons that utilize the five different Dying Will Flames that flow within his body. Each attribute of flame has a different effect when used with the storm-attribute rockets fired with the C.A.I.; the storm attribute attacks causes the object or person to degenerate, the rain attribute slows and weakens enemy attacks or dying will flames, it can even go through a solid shield of lightning attribute flames, the lightning attribute creates a <b>solid</b> <b>laser</b> beam, which is his most powerful attack with Sistema C.A.I., Gokudera calls it Flame Thunder, the cloud attribute creates a branching effect, the cloud flame's special ability is propagation, and the sun attribute gives his projectiles an unpredictable acceleration. His box weapons contain a number of miscellaneous accessories used in battle; one creates a lightning disc to ride atop in battle, while two others create shields to defend against enemy attacks. He also possesses a box containing a wild cat which he named Uri. While in his natural form Uri is useless and shows no respect for Gokudera, often scratching and biting him, with Sun Flames, Uri can transform into a massive leopard. Uri is later given an upgrade and now can transform into the Storm Vongola Box, G. Archery, a weapon similar to a crossbow attached to Gokudera's arm that lets him store up his energy to release in powerful flame shots.|$|E
