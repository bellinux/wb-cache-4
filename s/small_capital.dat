5|$|On 3 September 1843, the {{infantry}} led by Colonel Dimitris Kallergis and the respected Revolutionary captain and former President of the Athens City Council General Yiannis Makriyiannis assembled in Palace Square {{in front of}} the Palace in Athens. Eventually joined by much {{of the population of the}} <b>small</b> <b>capital,</b> the rebellion refused to disperse until the King agreed to grant a Constitution, which would require that there be Greeks in the Council, that he convene a permanent National Assembly and that Otto personally thank the leaders of the uprising.|$|E
5|$|The sound {{values of}} {{modified}} Latin letters {{can often be}} derived {{from those of the}} original letters. For example, letters with a rightward-facing hook at the bottom represent retroflex consonants; and <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> letters usually represent uvular consonants. Apart from the fact that certain kinds of modification to the shape of a letter generally correspond to certain kinds of modification to the sound represented, {{there is no way to}} deduce the sound represented by a symbol from its shape (as for example in Visible Speech) nor even any systematic relation between signs and the sounds they represent (as in Hangul).|$|E

Above are lancet windows with more stained glass. On its south is the bishop's cathedra.|$|E

25|$|The royalty, nobility, and gentry of Europe {{traditionally}} have many names, including phrases for the lands that they own. The French developed {{the method of}} putting the term by which the person is referred in <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> letters.

Notice that he possessed the lands both of Motier and Lafayette.|$|E
25|$|Topoxte was an {{important}} site in the Postclassic and had close ties {{with the city of}} Mayapan in the north of the Yucatán Peninsula. It was fortified and probably served as {{an important}} nexus in the trade routes between the Maya highlands and the Yucatán. It was a <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> with about six temples and a similar number of open halls. As well as strong ties with Mayapan, there are striking similarities with sites of the Tulum group, indicating that these sites belong to the same specific cultural tradition.|$|E

25|$|Funding for {{maintaining}} {{and improving the}} {{water supply and sanitation}} infrastructure comes from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. Indirectly, substantial funding historically came from the European Union through its European Regional Development Fund. In addition, local authorities levy planning contributions mainly for <b>small</b> <b>capital</b> improvements. Group scheme members are entitled to a subsidy from their local authority. After the abolition of domestic water charges in 1997, it was intended that this scheme would extend those benefits to households supplied by group water schemes. The amount of subsidy is 100% of the qualifying expenditure, meaning that all running costs of the scheme are covered by the subsidy {{as long as they do}} not exceed the subsidy limit. The amount is around €50 per house per year. Group water schemes are also entitled to technical and grant assistance for any upgrading works that may need to be carried out.|$|E
