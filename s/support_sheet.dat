50|$|Carbon tissue, a {{layer of}} unsensitized {{pigmented}} gelatin on a thin paper <b>support</b> <b>sheet,</b> was introduced by British physicist and chemist Joseph Swan in 1864. Marketing began in 1866. Initially, his ready-made tissues were sold in only three colors: black, sepia and purple-brown. Eventually, {{a wide array of}} hues became available. Carbon tissue was a stock item in Europe and the US well into the 20th century, but by the 1950s carbon printing was very rare and supplies for it became an exotic specialty item. Some companies produced small quantities of carbon tissue and transfer papers for monochrome and three-color work until around 1990.|$|E
50|$|TFC {{membranes}} {{are commonly}} classified as nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Both types are typically {{made out of}} a thin polyamide layer (<200 nm) deposited {{on top of a}} polyethersulfone or polysulfone porous layer (about 50 microns) on top of a non-woven fabric <b>support</b> <b>sheet.</b> The three layer configuration gives the desired properties of high rejection of undesired materials (like salts), high filtration rate, and good mechanical strength. The polyamide top layer is responsible for the high rejection and is chosen primarily for its permeability to water and relative impermeability to various dissolved impurities including salt ions and other small, unfilterable molecules.|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} version of the printing process, carbon tissue (a temporary <b>support</b> <b>sheet</b> coated {{with a layer of}} gelatin mixed with a pigment—originally carbon black, from which the name derives) is bathed in a potassium dichromate sensitizing solution, dried, then exposed to strong ultraviolet light through a photographic negative, hardening the gelatin in proportion to the amount of light reaching it. The tissue is then developed by treatment with warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin. The resulting pigment image is physically transferred to a final support surface, either directly or indirectly. In an important early 20th century variation of the process, known as carbro (carbon-bromide) printing, contact with a conventional silver bromide paper print, rather than exposure to light, was used to selectively harden the gelatin. A wide variety of colored pigments can be used instead of carbon black.|$|E

40|$|Sandwich {{panel has}} been widely applied to enhance the {{stiffness}} to weight performance of components in many industries. The manufacturing procedure of curved metal sandwich panels typically consists of forming the sheet and core material into prescribed shapes and applying the adhesive to bond the material in shaped molds. An alternative manufacturing method is to apply the conventional sheet metal forming technique to deform the flat sandwich panel into a curved panel. However, the face sheet will significantly limit the formability of the sandwich panel. To solve the problem, one face sheet was removed in the sandwich panel to increase the formability, then the metal sheet and the metallic open-cell foam were selected as the face sheet and the core material to form the metallic open-cell foam <b>supported</b> <b>sheet</b> metals. The main objective {{of this study is}} to develop a proper forming method to deform the metallic open-cell foam <b>supported</b> <b>sheet</b> metal without failure occurring. Two forming processes, press brake bending and hydroforming, which can reduce the contact stress to avoid the structure damage were investigated. Experiments were designed to understand the possible failure modes and the failure mechanism. Through the parametric study in the experimental results, the effects of material dimensions, material properties, and test parameters were analyzed to establish a failure criterion. In addition, a finite element analysis with a proper foam model was implemented to further inspect the failure mechanism and develop a guideline for the selection of materials and test parameters. For the press brake bending process, the experiment results have shown that the <b>supported</b> <b>sheet</b> metal can be successfully bent into a curved panel within small thickness reduction. The prediction in both geometric hoop strain failure criterion and shear strain failure in the finite element analysis were matched and agreed with the experimental result. For the hydroforming process, the experimental result indicated that the major failure mode is the adhesive failure. The early adhesive failure at the perimeter of the attached foam disc caused the open-cell foam to separate from the sheet metal. The required adhesive strength to the attainable dome height relationship was given by finite element analysis...|$|R
5000|$|In 1860 Cros began {{studies in}} medicine, {{but he soon}} {{abandoned}} them {{for a life of}} literary and scientific pursuits. In 1869 he published a theory of color photography in which he proposed that a single scene could be photographed through glass filters colored green, violet, and orange. The three negatives obtained through those filters could be developed to produce positive impressions that contained varying amounts of red, yellow, and blue (the [...] "antichromatic" [...] or complementary colors of the filters). The three positive impressions, when superimposed on one another (for instance, by making three carbon prints using sufficiently transparent pigments, then transferring the pigmented gelatin onto a single <b>support</b> <b>sheet)</b> would recompose the original colors of the photographed scene. Cros's proposals, which anticipated the subtractive method of modern photography, were similar to more influential ideas advanced about the same time by Louis Ducos du Hauron. The same day, May 7, 1869, Charles Cros and Louis Ducos du Hauron presented their method of creating color photographs to the French Society of Photography. They had not been in communication beforehand and each knew nothing about the other's research. Cros ended up conceding the invention to Ducos Du Hauron, despite having deposited a sealed paper at the French Academy of Sciences on December 2, 1867. Ducos du Hauron had patented his ideas on November 28, 1868, almost a full year later, but claimed to have written an unpublished paper on the subject in 1862.|$|E
40|$|Conformable {{electronic}} systems consisting of laterally distributed electronic components (typically sensors, actuators or LEDs) have attracted considerable interest {{during the last}} years. By using different technology approaches considerable elasticity, repeated stretchability and conformability of such systems has been shown by research groups. Contrary to the expression of interest by many potential industrial manufactures of stretchable electronics, the adaptation of related technologies into fabrication environments is lagging.

In this paper an approach for “single cycle deformable” - {{electronic systems}} and some of its application scenarios will be presented. Based on a previously developed technology for stretchable electronics using thermoplastic polyurethane as the matrix material, an approach for three dimensionally shaped electronic systems was developed. In order to fabricate a stable self-supported structure the stretchable system is attached to a thermoplastic polymer sheet (typically polycarbonate) with a thickness between 200 and 800 μm prior to being 3 D-deformed by thermo-forming. Potential applications are any kind of products (consumer electronics, automotive, household appliances), where a need to integrate sensors and actuators into ergonomically or aesthetically 3 D-shaped surfaces is identified.

40|$|The {{question}} whether our brain pathways {{adhere to a}} geometric grid structure has been a popular topic of debate in the diffusion imaging and neuroscience societies. Wedeen et al. (2012 a, b) proposed that the brain's white matter is organized like parallel sheets of interwoven pathways. Catani et al. (2012) concluded that this grid pattern is most likely an artifact, resulting from methodological biases that cause the tractography pathways to cross in orthogonal angles. To date, ambiguities in the mathematical conditions for a sheet structure to exist (e. g. its relation to orthogonal angles) combined {{with the lack of}} extensive quantitative evidence have prevented wide acceptance of the hypothesis. In this work, we formalize the relevant terminology and recapitulate the condition for a sheet structure to exist. Note that this condition is not related to {{the presence or absence of}} orthogonal crossing fibers, and that sheet structure is defined formally as a surface formed by two sets of interwoven pathways intersecting at arbitrary angles within the surface. To quantify the existence of sheet structure, we present a novel framework to compute the sheet probability index (SPI), which reflects the presence of sheet structure in discrete orientation data (e. g. fiber peaks derived from diffusion MRI). With simulation experiments we investigate the effect of spatial resolution, curvature of the fiber pathways, and measurement noise on the ability to detect sheet structure. In real diffusion MRI data experiments we can identify various regions where the data supports sheet structure (high SPI values), but also areas where the data does not <b>support</b> <b>sheet</b> structure (low SPI values) or where no reliable conclusion can be drawn. Several areas with high SPI values were found to be consistent across subjects, across multiple data sets obtained with different scanners, resolutions, and degrees of diffusion weighting, and across various modeling techniques. Under the strong assumption that the diffusion MRI peaks reflect true axons, our results would therefore indicate that pathways do not form sheet structures at every crossing fiber region but instead at well-defined locations in the brain. With this framework, sheet structure location, extent, and orientation could potentially serve as new structural features of brain tissue. The proposed method can be extended to quantify sheet structure in directional data obtained with techniques other than diffusion MRI, which is essential for further validation...|$|E
