5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E

25|$|Video game {{development}} and authorship, much {{like any other}} form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. Video game developers, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include programmers and graphic designers. Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including sound designers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> specific to video games, such as the game designer.

Within the realm of teaching, it includes both the undergraduate level, and beyond that, graduate-level (or postgraduate level). The latter level of education {{is often referred to}} as graduate school, especially in North America. In addition to the <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> specific to any particular degree, potential employers in any profession are looking for evidence of critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills, teamworking skills, information literacy, ethical judgment, decision-making skills, language skills, problem solving skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences.|$|E
25|$|Every student {{engages in}} a mentored {{scholarly}} project conducted longitudinally throughout the four-year curriculum.

Students pursue their projects through several program options, which may include areas of concentration. Students can focus on more traditional laboratory-based or clinical research projects or can conduct research in less common areas such as health policy, epidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research. An innovative system of Web-based learning portfolios facilitates learner-mentor communication and enriches the possibilities for collaboration within and beyond the University. The Scholarly Project immerses students in scientific investigation to foster data-collection, hypothesis-development, and research <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> critical to the practice of clinical medicine.|$|E

25|$|APO Leads (stylized as APO LEADS) is a {{leadership}} development program {{organized by the}} national organization of Alpha Phi Omega in the United States. The APO Leads program consists of five individual modular components of leadership development. Each of these modular components focus on skills {{that will help the}} participant be a successful leader and team member in Alpha Phi Omega and in life. The five components of APO Leads are Launch, Explore, Achieve, Discover, and Serve. Launch is a pre-requisite for participation in any of the other four courses. At the completion of the series of courses, the participant will have a set of transferable <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> applicable to Alpha Phi Omega, to the working world, as well as to leadership in other organizations. APO Leads has its roots in an earlier program, the Leadership Development Workshop (LDW). The LDW was an all-day, eight-hour leadership development course that was offered to members during the 1980s and 1990s. It was reorganized into the current APO Leads program, which was rolled out in 2002.|$|E
500|$|While one set {{of critics}} and bloggers used the UCLA study to dismiss the {{argument}} raised in Carr's essay, another set took {{a closer look at}} the conclusions that could be drawn from the study concerning the effects of Internet usage. Among the reflections concerning the possible interpretations of the UCLA study were whether greater breadth of brain activity while using the Internet in comparison with reading a book improved or impaired the quality of a reading session; and whether the decision-making and complex reasoning <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> apparently involved in Internet search, according to the study, suggest a high quality of thought or simply the use of puzzle solving skills. Thomas Claburn, in InformationWeek, observed that the study's findings regarding the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage were inconclusive and stated that [...] "it will take time before it's clear whether we should mourn the old ways, celebrate the new, or learn to stop worrying and love the Net".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Collins, {{it was noted that}} the novel [...] "tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war among others." [...] The novel deals with the struggle for self-preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and the Hunger Games in which they must participate. The citizens' starvation and their need for resources, both in and outside of the arena, create an atmosphere of helplessness that the main characters try to overcome in their fight for survival. Katniss needs to hunt to provide food for her family, resulting in the development of <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> useful to her in the Games (such as her proficiency with the bow and arrow), and represents her rejection of the Capitol's rules in the face of life-threatening situations. On the subject of the Games' parallels with popular culture, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly writes that the book [...] "is an incisive satire of reality television shows", and that the character of Cinna [...] "almost seems like a contestant on a fascist version of Project Runway, using Katniss' outfits as a vehicle to express potentially dangerous ideas." ...|$|E

2500|$|Heinz Kohut thought {{similarly}} to Freud's idea of transference. He used narcissism {{as a model}} of how people develop their sense of self. Narcissism is the exaggerated sense of one self in which one is believed to exist in order to protect one's low self-esteem and sense of worthlessness. Kohut {{had a significant impact on}} the field by extending Freud's theory of narcissism and introducing what he called the 'self-object transferences' of mirroring and idealization. In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally [...] "sink into" [...] and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures such as parents or older siblings. They also need to have their self-worth mirrored by these people. These experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other <b>skills</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> necessary for the development of a healthy sense of self.|$|E
