500|$|Peter, not cowardly {{enough to}} fear an old woman, nor superstitious {{enough to believe}} in her power, {{threaten}}s the old fairy, trying to chase her away. Unfortunately, she does indeed have fairy powers and casts a spell that forces Peter to threaten anyone he encounters or, if alone, to fight imaginary enemies. Peter flees before he can get himself into trouble by threatening anyone bigger than him, calling out challenges as he goes. Sergeant Klooque approaches the old woman next and tries to use his military charm to win her over. It turns out that she hates soldiers, and she strikes out with her stick, making him duck and dodge. She then casts a spell to make his cringing, dodging and ducking permanent, intending that he lose his reputation and be branded a coward. Pipette arrives and watches his behaviour in astonishment. [...] "He's <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> how he fought the enemy at Johannesburg," [...] exclaims the old lady, but he replies [...] "No, my dear!" [...] I'm <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> how the enemy fought us. This {{is the way they}} retreated". He leaves, cringing and pleading for imaginary attackers to stop as he goes.|$|E

I wasn't going to show this to another soul, but I'm <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> because you're my wife; because it's me and you together." ...|$|E

Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're put in that situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But as I got into it, I realized it was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend." [...] Harris commented on the single, [...] "He's <b>showing</b> <b>you,</b> I'm still the Michael Jackson that did 'Billie Jean' and 'Rock With You' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|After his 2010 {{debut album}} Doo-Wops & Hooligans, which {{produced}} the singles [...] "Just the Way You Are" [...] and [...] "Grenade", Bruno Mars revealed {{he wanted to}} create something unexpected with its follow-up. [...] "This is me going into the studio and recording and writing whatever I want," [...] Mars said confidently. [...] "This album represents my freedom." [...] It all started backstage, after a show, during a jamming session in a [...] "greenroom", while singing the phrase [...] "Locked Out of Heaven". According to Philip Lawrence, the track developed a meaning as they started to write it, [...] "when you’re with someone who’s <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> {{a new way to}} love." [...] The Smeezingtons went to New York to work with Jeff Bhasker, Emile Haynie and Mark Ronson and during a jamming session with drums, bass, and guitar, Mars created the riff of the song. He started singing the chorus previously created {{on the top of the}} riff. Then, The Smeezingtons went back to L.A., where they finished the lyrics and changed the original melody. Lawrence felt that the recording was [...] "sort of empty but it had a carnal vibe to it", making them enthusiastic to place a [...] "driving rhythm" [...] in it. The composer recalled thinking it was [...] "something special" [...] in the studio, the same way he did during the creation of [...] "Just The Way You Are" [...] and [...] "Billionaire".|$|E

2500|$|Dziga Vertov {{believed}} {{his concept of}} Kino-Glaz, or [...] "Cine Eye" [...] in English, [...] would help contemporary [...] "man" [...] evolve from a flawed creature into a higher, more precise form. He compared man unfavorably to machines: [...] "In {{the face of the}} machine we are ashamed of man’s inability to control himself, but what are we to do if we find the unerring ways of electricity more exciting than the disorderly haste of active people [...] " [...] "I am an eye.

[...] "Walt would say to Al, 'Of course, Al, this is really how you should draw Daisy Mae, I'm only <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> this for your own good.' Then Walt would do a sketch. Capp, of course, got ticked off by this, as you can imagine! So he retaliated by doing his version of Pogo. Unfortunately, the drawings are long gone; no recording was made. What a shame! Nobody anticipated there'd be this dueling back and forth between the two of them..." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{it became}} known that George W. Bush {{authorized}} NSA wiretaps without warrants, Dean asserted that Bush is [...] "the first President to admit to an impeachable offense". On March 31, 2006, Dean testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during hearings on censuring the president over the issue. Senator Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who sponsored the censure resolution, introduced Dean as a [...] "patriot" [...] who put [...] "rule of law above {{the interests of the}} president." [...] In his testimony, Dean asserted that Richard Nixon covered up Watergate because he believed it was in the interest of national security. This sparked a sharp debate with Republican South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who repeatedly asserted that Nixon authorized the break-in at Democratic headquarters. Dean finally replied, [...] "You're <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> don't know that subject very well." [...] Spectators laughed, and soon the senator was [...] "sputtering mad".|$|E

2500|$|The {{position}} of Richard Owen was unknown: when emphasising to a Parliamentary committee {{the need for}} a new Natural History museum, he pointed out that [...] "The whole intellectual world this year has been excited by a book on the origin of species; and what is the consequence?

2500|$|In {{spite of}} this rocky start, CAP became an {{official}} [...] "hearts and minds" [...] civic action program, and a school of sorts was eventually established near Da Nang. Training was brief (ten days) and covered a few bare essentials – some Vietnamese phrases, customs, and culture, some civic action precepts, and some military topics – far too short to be of much real good, though {{a step in the}} right direction. Upon graduation, you were posted to your unit. Eventually they began issuing certificates <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> had graduated. Initially, CAP Marines were issued a special cloth and leather insignia to be worn from the button on the breast pocket of the uniform jacket. These were later replaced by handsome enameled metal pins, also made to be worn on the breast pocket. These, however, were easily lost, and also made a good aiming point for the enemy. They were usually dispensed with on patrols.|$|E

[...] Coker was as specific with his choices of music in the season as [...] "Martin Scorsese is with the rock 'n' roll references like in Casino or in Goodfellas", rather than just adding hip-hop music for the sake of it.
