6000|$|Rose {{laughed and}} let him fan her, leaning from his seat behind with the devoted air he always assumed in public, but her wounded {{feelings}} were not soothed and she continued to frown at the stout man on the left who had dared to <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> and <b>a</b> glance at Phebe's next piece, [...] "That young woman can no more sing this Italian thing than she can fly, and they ought not to let her attempt it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allons, toujours des questions!" [...] <b>says</b> mademoiselle, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of {{her pretty}} shoulders. (Florac has {{recommended}} her to us, and I suspect the little Chevalier has himself an eye upon this pretty Mademoiselle de Blois.) ...|$|R

5000|$|Mann {{remained}} with the Packers through the 1954 NFL season. [...] Lee Remmel, {{who worked for}} the Packers in public relations and served as a team historian, described Mann as [...] "on the small side" [...] (5 feet 11 inches, 175 pounds), but a [...] "nifty and productive wide receiver." [...] Green Bay Gazette sports writer Art Daley recalled a story involving Mann and teammate Dick Afflis, who later became known in professional wrestling as [...] "Dick the Bruiser." [...] The Packers stayed at a Baltimore hotel that would not allow Mann to stay with the team on account of a policy against allowing African-American guests. When Mann left to go to another hotel, the 252-pound Afflis left <b>with</b> him. When <b>a</b> cab driver told Afflis that he would not drive Mann because of his race, Afflis grabbed the driver by the shirt and said, [...] "You will take him wherever he wants to go." [...] Daley also recalled how he had protested the hotel not accepting Mann and Mann calmed him down by <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug,</b> [...] "That's just politics." ...|$|R
6000|$|But I cannot conceal from myself, or you, {{that the}} earnestness which was awakened {{in those days}} is dying out in these. The richer classes of every country are tempted {{from time to time}} to fits of laziness--fits of frivolity and luxury, surfeits, in which men <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> and <b>a</b> yawn--"Why be very much in earnest? Why take so much trouble? Somebody must always be rich, why should not I? Somebody must enjoy the money, why should not I? At all events, things will last my time." [...] And that such a surfeit has fallen upon the rich of this land, is a fact; for that this is the tone of to-day, and that the tone increases, none can deny who knows that which calls itself the WORLD, and calls itself so only too truly; the world of which it is written, that all that is in the world-- the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life-- is not of the Father, but of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof. But he who doeth the will of God, he alone abideth for ever.|$|R
6000|$|Even then {{no great}} harm {{might have been}} done {{had it not been}} for Saul's ill temper. Little Frenchie, seeing that we had thus {{inadvertently}} come upon the lad whom we knew to be an enemy to us as well as a traitor to his country, would have treated the matter as a pleasing incident, and began by <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friendly <b>shrug</b> of his shoulders and a wave of the hands, that he was glad we had found a friend in the town because we were feeling like cats in a strange garret, when Saul interrupted him as he cried angrily: ...|$|R
6000|$|Clive and {{his father}} had found not only a model friend in the lady above mentioned, but a perfect prize landlady in their happy lodgings. In her house, besides those apartments which Mr. Newcome had {{originally}} engaged, were rooms just sufficient to accommodate his wife, child, and servant, when they should come to him, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very snug little upper chamber for the Colonel, close by Boy's nursery, where he liked best to be. [...] "And if there is not room for the Campaigner, as you call her," [...] <b>says</b> Mrs. Laura, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of her shoulders, [...] "why, I am very sorry, but Clive must try and bear her absence as well as possible. After all, my dear Pen, you know he is married to Rosa and not to her mamma; and so, and so I think it will be quite best that they shall have their menage as before." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{material}} {{apparatus of}} perfected civilization which obliterates the individuality of old towns under the stereotyped conveniences {{of modern life}} had not intruded as yet; but over the worn-out antiquity of Sulaco, so characteristic with its stuccoed houses and barred windows, with the great yellowy-white walls of abandoned convents behind the rows of sombre green cypresses, that fact--very modern in its spirit--the San Tome mine had already thrown its subtle influence. It had altered, too, the outward character of the crowds on feast days on the plaza before the open portal of the cathedral, {{by the number of}} white ponchos <b>with</b> <b>a</b> green stripe affected as holiday wear by the San Tome miners. They had also adopted white hats with green cord and braid--articles of good quality, which could be obtained in the storehouse of the administration for very little money. A peaceable Cholo wearing these colours (unusual in Costaguana) was somehow very seldom beaten to within an inch of his life on a charge of disrespect to the town police; neither ran he much risk of being suddenly lassoed on the road by a recruiting party of lanceros--a method of voluntary enlistment looked upon as almost legal in the Republic. Whole villages were known to have volunteered for the army in that way; but, as Don Pepe would <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hopeless <b>shrug</b> to Mrs. Gould, [...] "What would you! Poor people! Pobrecitos! Pobrecitos! But the State must have its soldiers." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Aunt Bernstein came to Castlewood, her {{relatives}} there, more, I think, {{on account of}} her own force of character, imperiousness, and sarcastic wit, than from their desire to possess her money, were accustomed to pay her {{a great deal of}} respect and deference, which she accepted as her due. She expected the same treatment from the new Countess, whom she was prepared to greet with special good-humour. The match had been of her making. [...] "As you, you silly creature, would not have the heiress," [...] she said, [...] "I was determined she should not go out of the family," [...] and she laughingly told of many little schemes for bringing the marriage about. She had given the girl a coronet and her nephew a hundred thousand pounds. Of course she should be welcome to both of them. She was delighted with the little Countess's courage and spirit in routing the Dowager and Lady Fanny. Almost always pleased with pretty people on her first introduction to them, Madame Bernstein raffled of her niece Lydia's bright eyes and lovely little figure. The marriage was altogether desirable. The old man was an obstacle, to be sure, and his talk and appearance somewhat too homely. But he will be got rid of. He is old and in delicate health. [...] "He will want to go to America, or perhaps farther," [...] <b>says</b> the Baroness, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b> [...] "As for the child, she had great fire and liveliness, and a Cherokee manner which is not without its charm," [...] said the pleased old Baroness. [...] "Your brother had it--so have you, Master George! Nous la formerons, cette petite. Eugene wants character and vigour, but he is a finished gentleman, and between us we shall make the little savage perfectly presentable." [...] In this way we discoursed on the second afternoon as we journeyed towards Castlewood. We lay at the King's Arms at Bagshot the first night, where the Baroness was always received with profound respect, and thence drove post to Hexton, where she had written to have my lord's horses in waiting for her; but these were not forthcoming at the inn, and after a couple of hours we were obliged to proceed with our Bagshot horses to Castlewood.|$|R
