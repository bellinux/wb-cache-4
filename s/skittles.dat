5|$|Gossip {{was also}} a noted writer. His {{treatise}} The Chess-Player's Manual—A Complete Guide to Chess, a 900-page tome published in 1874 {{after several years of}} work, was harshly received by the critics, largely because he had included a number of informal <b>skittles</b> games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Chess Champion, wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess-Player's Manual {{was one of the best}} available books on the game. Thanks in part to a 122-page appendix by S. Lipschütz, it became one of the standard opening works of the time.|$|E
5|$|After his batting {{displays}} in Perth, Pathan {{was promoted to}} open the batting in the Fourth Test in Adelaide, replacing the struggling Wasim Jaffer and thereby allowing Harbhajan to return in a five-bowler attack. In a high-scoring match, Pathan took 3/112, but he struggled with the responsibility of opening, scoring nine and a duck. In a high-scoring match, he took 3/112 in Australia's 563.Following the Test series, he top-scored with 26 as India were <b>skittles</b> for 74 in the one-off T20 international. Pathan held {{his place in the}} ODI team and played all 10 matches in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy, scoring 118 runs at 19.66 mostly in the lower order and taking 11 wickets at 34.27 at an economy rate of 5.49. His best performance was a 4/41 against Australia at Adelaide to help restrict the hosts to 203 but India then collapsed to a 50-run loss. His top-score of 31 in the series came in partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the closing stages of a successful and tense run-chase against Sri Lanka. Pathan struggled in the two finals against Australia, taking three wickets at 39.00 at an economy rate of 7.46 but his teammates did enough to ensure a 2–0 win.|$|E

On December 30, 2011, he was fined $10,000 for wearing cleats featuring a <b>Skittles</b> pattern. On January 28, 2014, an official deal with <b>Skittles</b> was announced.

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{increasingly}} evident {{that there are}} multiple and overlapping patterns within the genome, and that these patterns contain different types of information - regarding both genome function and genome history. In order to discover additional genomic patterns which may have biological significance, novel strategies are required. To partially address this need, we introduce a new data visualization tool entitled <b>Skittle.</b> Results This program first creates a 2 -dimensional nucleotide display by assigning four colors to the four nucleotides, and then text-wraps to a user adjustable width. This nucleotide display {{is accompanied by a}} "repeat map" which comprehensively displays all local repeating units, based upon analysis of all possible local alignments. <b>Skittle</b> includes a smooth-zooming interface which allows the user to analyze genomic patterns at any scale. <b>Skittle</b> is especially useful in identifying and analyzing tandem repeats, including repeats not normally detectable by other methods. However, <b>Skittle</b> is also more generally useful for analysis of any genomic data, allowing users to correlate published annotations and observable visual patterns, and allowing for sequence and construct quality control. Conclusions Preliminary observations using <b>Skittle</b> reveal intriguing genomic patterns not otherwise obvious, including structured variations inside tandem repeats. The striking visual patterns revealed by <b>Skittle</b> appear to be useful for hypothesis development, and have already led the authors to theorize that imperfect tandem repeats could act as information carriers, and may form tertiary structures within the interphase nucleus. </p...|$|R

25|$|Lynch started 15 games, missing {{only one}} regular season game on November 23, 2011, due to back problems.

25|$|Front {{first or}} All-in?:Skittles is played either front first or all-in. I.e., in all-in <b>skittles</b> {{each and every}} pin that is felled counts towards the total scored. In front first <b>skittles,</b> the front pin must be felled before any score is recorded. In other words, in a {{worst-case}} scenario, should one fell all pins except the front pin with one's first two balls (of three), the maximum score that one could record for that 'up' can only be 1 pin.|$|E

Cope finished 27th in the final point standings. Veteran driver Ernie Irvan took over from Cope in 1998. The season was highlighted by Irvan's pole win at the Brickyard 400. M's replaced <b>Skittles</b> as the team's sponsor in 1999. Irvan retired from racing in September following a crash at Michigan International Speedway. Dick Trickle temporarily replaced Irvan before the driving chores were permanently turned over to journeyman Jerry Nadeau.|$|E

25|$|Scattles is {{a version}} of <b>skittles</b> {{in which all the}} pins are numbered. Players take turn in {{throwing}} the baton at the pins with a view to totalling exactly 50 points. If more than one pin is knocked over, the score received is that quantity of pins. But if only one pin is knocked over, the value on it is scored. If a player exceeds 50, their total reduces to 25. Pins are then placed upright where they stand, thus scattering. Scattles is made by Jaques of London and reminiscent of the older Cornish game, smite, itself based on the Finnish <b>skittles</b> game mölkky.|$|E
