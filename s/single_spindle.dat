40|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{functions}} of static γ-motoneurones {{are based on the}} responses of primary and secondary endings to electrical stimulation of single static γ-axons, usually at high frequencies. We compared these effects with the actions of spontaneously active γ-motoneurones. In anaesthetised cats, afferents and efferents were recorded in intramuscular nerve branches to <b>single</b> muscle <b>spindles.</b> The occurrence of γ-spikes, identified by a spike shape recognition system, was linked to video-taped contractions of type-identified intrafusal fibres in the dissected muscle spindles. When some static γ-motoneurones were active at low frequency (&# 60; 15 Hz) they coupled the firing of group Ia and II afferents. Activity of other static γ-motoneurones which tensed the intrafusal fibres appeared to enhance this effect. Under these conditions the secondary ending responded at shorter latency than the primary ending. In another series of experiments on decerebrate cats, responses of primary and secondary endings of <b>single</b> muscle <b>spindles</b> to activation of γ-motoneurones by natural stimuli were compared with their responses to electrical stimulation of single γ-axons supplying the same spindle. Electrical stimulation mimicked the natural actions of γ-motoneurones on either the primary or the secondary ending, but not on both together. However, γ-activity evoked by natural stimuli coupled the firing of afferents with the muscle at constant length, and also when it was stretched. Analysis showed that the timing and tightness of this coupling determined the degree of summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by each afferent in α-motoneurones and interneurones contacted by terminals of both endings, and thus the degree of facilitation of reflex actions of group II afferents...|$|R

40|$|Intranodal myofibroblastoma is a rare, primitive, mesenchymal {{neoplasm}} of {{the lymph}} nodes first described in 1989. It behaves in a benign fashion and has a great predilection for the inguinal region. CASE REPORT: A 56 -year-old man was referred for fine needle aspiration cytology of an inguinal lymph node. Smears were moderately cellular, with a predominant population of <b>single,</b> small <b>spindle</b> cells with no atypia. Most neoplastic cells were distributed as dissociated, single cells, with few groups. The cells showed metachromatic stromal material with a fibrillary quality. Nuclei were elongated, with pointed ends and occasional twisted forms. A remarkable finding on Papanicolaou-stained smears was hemosiderin granules. After a cytologic report of low grade spindle cell tumor, the node was excised, and a histologic and immunohistochemical diagnosis of intranodal myofibroblastoma was established. CONCLUSION: Intranodal myofibroblastoma should always be considered when aspirating solitary inguinal lymph nodes. The presence of a low grade spindle cell pattern of variably dissociated cells with hemosiderin granules should lead to immunocytochemical studies.

The range of Group II fibres to secondary (S) sensory endings was 2. 0 - 8. 5 micron with a peak at 5. 0 micron. In a sample of 234 spindle capsules, 171 (84. 2 %) were <b>single</b> capsule <b>spindles</b> and 31 (15. 8 %) were tandem spindles. With respect to the sensory endings of <b>single</b> capsule <b>spindles,</b> 19. 7 % showed only a P-ending, 32. 5 % had an additional S-ending and 15. 8 %, 3. 0 % and 2. 1 % had two, three and four S-endings, respectively. In the tandem spindle capsules, 0. 8 % of the larger proximal capsules showed only a P-ending, 5. 1 % had an additional S-ending and 4. 7 %, 2. 6 % and 0. 4 % had two, three and four S-endings, respectively. In the 31 tandem spindles, one of which had a triple capsule, there were 14 types of sensory ending combination in the proximal and distal capsules.

Cytomorphology of desmoplastic melanoma has been previously described on conventional smears; however, to our knowledge, detailed cytomorphology on ThinPrep has {{so far not been}} described. Herein, we describe the cytomorphology of two cases of desmoplastic melanoma on fine needle aspiration processed as ThinPrep slides and compare it to that seen on conventional smears. Pertinent immunocytochemical stains, performed on ThinPrep slides are also discussed. Case presentation The first case is a woman with a history of desmoplastic melanoma of the scalp with previous local recurrences and lymph node metastasis with a new submandibular mass. The second case is a man with a previously resected desmoplastic melanoma with his first local recurrence. Conventional smears, including air-dried Diff-Quik-stained and alcohol-fixed Papanicolaou-stained smears, demonstrated aggregates of pleomorphic spindle cells admixed with fibrous stroma and <b>single</b> <b>spindle</b> cells. In both cases, nuclei were elongated and plump with irregular nuclear contours, deep grooves, and folds. Chromatin was dark and coarse with either inconspicuous or multiple prominent nucleoli. Cytoplasm was located at the nuclear poles and was fine, wispy, and delicate. The background was clean with no evidence of necrosis or melanin pigment. Papanicolaou-stained ThinPrep slides were prepared from needle rinses and demonstrated excellent correlation of nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of <b>single</b> <b>spindle</b> cells to that seen on conventional smears with the exception of only slight decrease in nuclear size; however, nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of spindle cells embedded in stroma was markedly attenuated.

Conclusion The cytomorphology of desmoplastic melanoma shows excellent correlation between cytomorphology of <b>single</b> <b>spindle</b> cells on conventional smears and on ThinPrep slides. The major difference noted on ThinPrep slides was attenuated nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of spindle cells embedded in fibrous stoma. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA milling {{operation}} is inherently an intermittent material removal process where cutter engagement and disengagement is repeated {{until the end}} of the material removal process. During the process, the cutter receives multiple impacts and mechanical and thermal vibrations which eventually damage the cutting edge. The optimum rigidity and damping of the spindle motor for the least tool damage highly depends on the cutter and workpiece material properties and the cutting application. This paper introduces the concept of flexible rotational rigidity control using a high performance Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) which is used as a direct spindle drive. With the PMSM spindle, the spindle rotational characteristics can be adjusted for optimizing the cutting process in order to prevent tools from unwanted premature damage. Simulation models of the spindle motor drive system are presented, which show that a very stiff spindle can be realized by fully utilizing the potential capability of the PMSM and a spindle with the same dynamic properties of a conventionally used induction motor can be realized with a <b>single</b> PMSM <b>spindle.</b> The system prototype and feasibility studies are also presented in this paper.

They have been {{characterized}} by their responses to passive muscle stretch {{and the effects of}} succinylcholine (SCh) and by their sensitivity to vibration. The use of SCh permitted the assessment for each afferent of the influence of bag 1 (b 1) and bag 2 (b 2) intrafusal muscle fibres. From this, on the assumption that all afferents were affected by chain (c) fibres, they were classified in four groups: b 1 b 2 c (41. 9 %), b 2 c (51. 4 %), b 1 c (1. 3 %) and c (5. 4 %). All the afferents with b 1 influence were able to respond one to one to vibration at frequencies above 100 Hz and were considered to belong to primary endings. On the basis of the vibration test, 64 % of the b 2 c type afferents appeared to be primaries and 36 % secondaries. Of the units classified as primaries, 41 % were designated as b 2 c and would not therefore be able to respond to dynamic fusimotor activity.

Similar responses are elicited by stimulating a population of muscle spindles but not when a <b>single</b> muscle <b>spindle</b> is activated. The current study investigated whether short-latency EMG responses could be evoked from the discharge of a single cutaneous afferent. Thirty-three tactile afferents were recorded via tungsten microelectrodes in the median nerve of awake humans. Spike-triggered averaging revealed EMG events time-locked to the afferent discharge. The afferents were activated by an external probe and the EMG was elicited by a weak voluntary contraction. Eleven cutaneous afferents (33 %) showed a short-latency response in the ongoing EMG. Overt increases or decreases in EMG were observed for seven afferents (onset latency 20. 0 - 41. 1 11 hms 1 h). For four slowly adapting (SA) type II afferents, EMG showed a periodicity that was correlated to the afferent interspike interval (r = 0. 99). The EMG associated with two rapidly adapting (FA) type I afferents (29 %) showed a short-latency excitation while five showed neither excitation nor inhibition. Seven SA II afferents (39 %) showed excitation and 11 no response; {{and none of the}} six SA I afferents showed any response. We conclude that, unlike muscle spindle afferents, the input from a single cutaneous afferent is strong enough to drive, via interneurones, motoneurones supplying muscles acting on the digits.

The response was considered as linear when the discharge was approximately sinusoidally modulated. The linearity was further checked by a linear increase in the response with the amplitude and a constancy of the phase and mean level. Fifteen of 25 primary afferents were active at rest with a mean rate of 10. 6 impulses s− 1 (median). The linear response to sinusoidal stretching was limited to amplitudes lower than about 1. 0 deg. The sensitivity was 5. 6 impulses s− 1 deg− 1 (median) in the linear range and decreased at larger amplitudes. The other 10 primary afferents were silent at rest and lacked a linear response at low amplitudes. Nine secondary afferents were active at rest with a mean rate of 9. 5 impulses s− 1. The linear range extended up to about 4. 0 deg with a sensitivity of 1. 4 impulses s− 1 deg− 1. In the linear range, the phase advance of the response to sinusoidal stretching was about 50 deg and was similar between the two types of spindle afferents. In primary afferents, the phase advance increased to nearly 90 deg outside the linear range. The findings suggest that high sensitivity to small stretches is important in determining primary afferent firing during natural movements in intact humans...|$|R
40|$|Muscle {{spindles}} provide exquisitely sensitive proprioceptive {{information regarding}} joint position and movement. Through passively driven length {{changes in the}} muscle-tendon unit (MTU), muscle spindles detect joint rotations because of their in-parallel mechanical linkage to muscle fascicles. In human microneurography studies, muscle fascicles are assumed to follow the MTU and, as such, fascicle length is not measured in such studies. However, under certain mechanical conditions compliant structures can act to decouple the fascicles, and therefore the spindles, from the MTU. Such decoupling may reduce the fidelity by which muscle spindles encode joint position and movement. The aim {{of the present study}} was to measure, for the first time, both the changes in firing of <b>single</b> muscle <b>spindle</b> afferents and changes in muscle fascicle length in vivo from the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) during passive rotations about the ankle. Unitary recordings were made from 15 muscle spindle afferents supplying TA via a microelectrode inserted into the common peroneal nerve. Ultrasonography was used to measure the length of an individual fascicle of TA. We saw a strong correlation between fascicle length and firing rate during passive ankle rotations of varying rates (0. 1 - 0. 5 Hz) and amplitudes (1 - 9 °). In particular, we saw responses observed at relatively small changes in muscle length that highlight the sensitivity of the TA muscle to small length changes. This study is the first to measure spindle firing and fascicle dynamics in vivo and provides an experimental basis for further understanding the link between fascicle length, MTU length and spindle firing patterns...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{orientation}} of the mitotic spindle {{plays a key role}} in determining whether a polarized cell will divide symmetrically or asymmetrically. In most cell types, cytoplasmic dynein plays a critical role in spindle orientation. However, how dynein directs opposite spindle poles toward distinct and predetermined cell ends is poorly understood. Here, we show that dynein distributes preferentially to the spindle pole bodies (SPB) and astral microtubules (MTs) proximal to the bud in metaphase yeast cells. Dynein asymmetry depended on the bud neck kinases Elm 1, Hsl 1, and Gin 4, on the spindle pole components Cnm 67 and Cdk 1, and on the B-type cyclins Clb 1 and Clb 2. Furthermore, phenotypic and genetic studies both indicated that dynein is unable to orient the spindle when it localizes to both poles and associated microtubules.

30|$|Centromeric core {{chromatin}} {{is defined}} by CENP-A, a centromere-specific histone 3 (H 3) variant. CENP-A partially replaces canonical H 3 histone at centromeres and is responsible for nucleating {{the formation of the}} kinetochore (Palmer et al., 1991; Black and Cleveland, 2011). In most eukaryotic centromeres, the centromeric core contains more than one CENP-A nucleosome, and is therefore bound by multiple spindle microtubules. Such centromeres are referred to as “regional centromeres” (Pluta et al., 1995). In contrast, budding yeast centromeres which consists of a single CENP-A nucleosome bound by a <b>single</b> <b>spindle</b> microtubule, are referred to as “point centromeres”. Point centromeres are defined by the underlying DNA sequence, which consists of 125  bp of DNA wrapped around the sole CENP-A nucleosome (Cottarel et al., 1989). In contrast, in regional centromeres, although their architecture and function are conserved across eukaryotes, their underlying DNA varies significantly in size and sequence across species, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms are important determinants in their regulation. CENP-A is considered the most likely candidate epigenetic mark for centromere identity and {{has been the subject of}} intense study (Henikoff and Furuyama, 2010).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{proprioceptive}} feedback {{associated with the}} performance of even quite simple movements is always generated by the whole set of muscles subjected to mechanical deformation (lengthening, shortening, contraction, etc.) during that particular movement. The question was addressed here as to how muscle spindle feedbacks arising from agonist and antagonist muscles may contribute to the coding of movement parameters such as the direction and velocity. For this purpose, the activity of <b>single</b> muscle <b>spindle</b> afferents located in the lateral peroneal nerve was analysed using the microneurographic technique, in human subjects performing repetitive voluntary movements, i. e., plantar/dorsal flexions of the ankle, at three different velocities (3, 4. 5 and 6 degrees/s). The data obtained suggest that in humans, the direction of a slow movement may be specified {{on the basis of the}} spindle discharge rate, which is greater in the stretched than in the shortened muscle, and that the velocity of this movement might be correlated with the difference between the spindle activity occurring in the agonist and antagonist muscles. These neurophysiological data are in agreement with the results of previous psychophysical studies showing for example that a sensation of illusory movement can be elicited only when there exists an imbalance between the agonist versus antagonist vibration-induced Ia inputs. In addition, the greater the difference between the vibration frequencies applied to the two antagonist muscles, the higher the perceived movement velocity was found to be. All in all, joint movement perception seems to result from the co-processing by the central nervous system of the multiple spindle feedbacks originating from the whole set of muscles involved in the performance of a movement.

However, the maximum speed of shortening of the spindle fibres was merely 0. 95 ± 0. 006 lengths s− 1 (mean ± s. e. m., n = 11), which is approximately half the value recorded in extrafusal fibres of the same muscle. The maximum tetanic force, 91 ± 10 kN m− 2, n = 14, was likewise only approximately half that produced by extrafusal fibres. The force generated by the capsule segment was lower than that produced by the whole spindle resulting in elongation of the capsule region during a fixed-end tetanus. The intracellular calcium ion concentration reached during the plateau of the tetanus, 1. 7 ± 0. 1 μM (n = 8), was substantially lower than the value attained in extrafusal fibres under equivalent conditions. In accordance, the spindle fibres did not become fully activated during supramaximal electrical stimulation as indicated by the finding that the tetanic force could be further increased by 16. 6 ± 0. 04 % (n = 5) on addition of 0. 5 mm caffeine. Inadequate activation may thus, to a certain extent, account for the relatively low force per cross-sectional area of the spindle fibres. The contractile properties of the intrafusal fibres should make the spindle organ suited to provide feedback control during eccentric (forced lengthening) and static (isometric) contractions and, with reduced effectiveness, during slow muscle shortening...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} a 4 x accession of Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. {{and four}} 2 x accessions of Ipomoea triloba for 2 n pollen production. Approximately 90 % of the genotypes of accession 81. 2 (I. batatas, 4 x) produced 2 n pollen with different frequencies. In contrast, {{none of the}} genotypes of I. triloba produced 2 n pollen. The diameter of the 2 n pollen was approximately 30 % () larger {{than that of the}} n pollen, making 32 it easy to identify, measure, and quantify. The correlation (r 0. 93 **) between the frequency of giant pollen and the frequency of dyads and triads was highly signif-icant, strongly suggesting that the giant pollen grains were 2 n pollen. The 2 n pollen producers presented either a parallel or tripolar spindle arrangement (Y shaped) at anaphase II instead of the normal 60 crossed spindle orientation. These two ab-normal spindle configurations produced dyads and triads, with different frequen-cies (13 – 67 %), instead of tetrads. Occasionally a metaphase II spindle variation was found with a <b>single</b> fused <b>spindle,</b> which also forms a dyad. The correlation (r 0. 89 **) between the frequency of 2 n pollen and the frequency of parallel, fused, and tripolar spindle arrangements was also highly significant, suggesting that these abnormal spindle configurations are involved in the production of 2 n pollen in I. batatas. When we evaluated the efficiency of 2 n pollen in polyploidization using 4 x 4 x (2 n) crosses, all progenies were 4 x, suggesting the existence of barriers to crossability between 4 x genotypes and their 2 n pollen-producer counterparts. The sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., is the ninth most important crop in {{the world in terms of}} production. In 2000 it yielded 141 106 metric ton...|$|R
