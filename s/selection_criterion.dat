25|$|Three axioms presupposed by the {{scientific}} method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends {{on the fact that}} they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (<b>selection</b> <b>criterion)</b> rests upon the axioms mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> for {{decision}} analysis is subjective. The choice of criterion is made {{outside of the}} analysis (it is exogenous). One of the influences on this choice on this is attitude to risk. Risk aversion describes how willing or unwilling someone is to take risks. Evidence indicates that most, but not all, individuals prefer certain outcomes to uncertain ones. Risk-averse individuals prefer decision criteria that reduce the chance of the worst possible outcome, while risk-seeking individuals prefer decision criteria that maximize the chance of the best possible outcome. In terms of returns on investment, if {{society as a whole}} is risk-averse, we might be willing to accept some investments with negative expected returns, e.g., in mitigation. Such investments may help to reduce the possibility of future climate damages or the costs of adaptation.|$|E
25|$|Water {{investment}} planning for rural areas is {{done at the}} district level by the respective water departments. In 2009 the NGO WaterAid studied the local government planning process for water investments {{in four of the}} country's 99 rural districts, namely in Mpwapwa, Kongwa, Iramba and Nzega. Planning begins with long wish-lists based on demands from the village level. Since real priorities are difficult to identify, one <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> used is the balance of money held in the village water fund. This is seen as a sign of community ownership and can be easily explained to councillors and villagers. Other purported criteria are health statistics and data collected from a waterpoint mapping exercise, but they are not given high priority in practice. Selection is done {{in such a way that}} water projects are equally divided between the constituencies of the district’s Members of Parliament. Furthermore, councilors steer projects to villages in their wards, with more dynamic councillors exerting greater influence. Another de facto criterion is the previous track record in caring for infrastructure: In some areas handpumps have been stolen, making it hard to justify new investments. Communities close to town, located on main roads or with existing social services have an advantage in the decision-making process, since officials visit them more often and the cost of providing infrastructure is lower. The WaterAid report suggests that if there was better availability of data on rural water supply infrastructure this could help the representatives of underserved communities to lobby on behalf of their constituents.|$|E

Many were still being used by the RAF and USAF, while others had been turned over to other uses but were still in good condition. The use of government-owned land saved the costs of land acquisition. RAF Witchford was initially included at the instigation of the Americans, but [...] the land was owned by the Church Commissioners, and nearby RAF Mepal was substituted. The main <b>selection</b> <b>criterion</b> was the condition of the road network connecting the bases; a grade of more that one in seventeen was considered an unacceptable risk of grounding the missile transport. Some proposed sites in Yorkshire based around RAF Dishforth ran into problems with radar coverage, and a new group of stations was found around RAF North Luffenham. These were not considered ideal as the missiles would have to fly over populated areas.|$|E

The highest ranked strategic motives of the Chinese firms are maintaining market position, international expansion, and technology exchange. In contrast, the major strategic motives for alliance formation of the foreign firms are characterised by market penetration and learning how to operate successfully in China. As anticipated the relative importance of strategic motives for ISA formation is found to vary between Chinese firms and foreign firms. We also examine aspects of partner <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> for ISA formation from the perspective of Chinese partners. Findings show that the task-related <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> are determined more by the strategic motives for ISA formation than are the partner-related <b>selection</b> <b>criteria.</b> This confirms that task-related <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> tend to be specific to the alliance whereas partner-related <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> are more general in nature.

The criteria select the correct model specification and all correct moment conditions asymptotically. The <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> resemble the widely used likelihood-based <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> BIC, HQIC, and AIC. (The latter is not consistent.) The GMM <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> {{are based on}} the J statistic for testing over-identifying restrictions. Bonus terms reward the use of fewer parameters for a given number of moment conditions and the use of more moment conditions for a given number of parameters. The paper applies the model and moment <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> to dynamic panel data models with unobserved individual effects. The paper shows how to apply the <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> to select the lag length for lagged dependent variables, to detect the number and locations of structural breaks, to determine the exogeneity of regressors, and/or to determine the existence of correlation between some regressors and the individual effect. To illustrate the finite sample performance of the <b>selection</b> <b>criteria</b> and their impact on parameter estimation, the paper reports the results of a Monte Carlo experiment on a dynamic panel data model.
