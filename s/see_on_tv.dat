Shows featured a variety of sexual messages, including characters talking about when they wanted to have sex {{and how to use}} sex to keep a relationship alive. Some researchers believe that adolescents can use these messages as well as the sexual actions they <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> in their own sexual lives.|$|E
500|$|Jim Shelley {{from the}} Daily Mirror praised Jordan's writing and Brown's acting, saying [...] "tonight's episode of EastEnders is as {{powerful}} and poignant {{a piece of}} drama as you will <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> all year". Shelley opined that [...] "June [...] proves what the soaps can achieve when they use actors of genuine class and let them show what they are capable of" [...] and stated [...] "The fact that co-star John Bardon [...] is recovering from a stroke in real life adds an extra terrible pathos to the episode." [...] Cole Moreton of The Independent wrote [...] "The preview disc had revealed {{it to be a}} mesmerising piece of television, a kind of cor blimey Samuel Beckett, in which Brown conveyed her character's conflicting emotions beautifully." [...] Mark Wright of The Stage [...] praised Brown's acting as [...] "amazing", observing that she made the episode look [...] "effortless" [...] and commenting: [...] "I don't think there's another soap actress out there who could carry this." [...] Virgin Media selected the episode as showcasing one of the best ever soap opera performances, deeming Brown's portrayal [...] "comic and endearing" [...] and the episode [...] "never less than riveting." ...|$|E
500|$|It took 25 days to film, {{requiring}} 500 extras, 600 {{crew members}} and 70 horses. Benioff described {{the difficulty of}} coordinating horses in battle scenes, {{which is why they}} are rarely used except in [...] "big budget war films". Weiss added, [...] "Miguel's really outdone himself. Fully fleshed out medieval battles require a tremendous amount of resources and choreography to get them right. It feels like we're doing something fresh that you don't <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> and movies very often." [...] Four camera crews were used for the battle scene. The 500 extras were largely the Snow and Bolton armies as Wildlings, archers, swordsmen and spearmen. Each army was trained separately to create off-screen rivalry between the two groups, and visual effects were used to expand the army to thousands. Kristofer Hivju, who plays Tormund Giantsbane, said about the intensity of filming the scenes: [...] "It was pretty intense, actually. When you have 20 people running around getting squeezed together, and you're trying to chop at another bearded guy with a sword, you are not out of danger. You're laying down in the mud, and one wrong step, you won't have a face anymore. It was very intense, and Miguel insisted on making it that muddy and messy. War is not beautiful. Sometimes you see action sequences where battles seem organized. I know that from how the Vikings fought. It's not beautiful. It's hard. It's hard work. We had to shoot moment-to-moment, chronologically. We would shoot one sequence 80 times per day." ...|$|E

Sun writer David Zurawik said Gyllenhaal's direction was as good as anything he had done in film, and called the script [...] "one of the most ambitious scripts you'll <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> this year". Lon Grahnke of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the episode his highest rating of four stars, and called Williams portrayal [...] "a piercing dramatic performance". Grahnke also said, [...] "In one hour, 'Bop Gun' says more about firearms, urban tragedies, crime victims and racial politics than any yammering congressman trying to blame television for our violent society." [...] Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker complimented the episode, noting, [...] "Don't let Williams distract you from the real stuff here: the brilliantly jagged murder-investigation scenes and the exceptional performances from homicide-detective costars Daniel Baldwin and Melissa Leo." [...] Tribune Company television critic Kate O'Hare praised [...] "Bop Gun" [...] for focusing on characterization and dialogue rather than action, and said of the episode, [...] "With a mix of intense emotion, dogged police work and humorous banter among the detectives, [...] "Bop Gun" [...] typifies the philosophy of Homicide." [...] David P. Kalat, author of Homicide: Life on the Street - The Unofficial Companion, called it a [...] "grueling" [...] episode, and that Williams performed [...] "probably his finest noncomedic [...] performance ever". The Philadelphia Inquirer television critic Jonathan Storm lauded the cast, the [...] "visual art of the camera" [...] and the [...] "realistic, yet nearly literary dialogue" [...] of [...] "Bop Gun".|$|E

[...] The talks, chaired by President Mwai Kibaki and attended by former President of Tanzania Benjamin Mkapa, who represented the African Union, were referred to as [...] "an opportunity that should neither be lost nor wasted" [...] by Obasanjo, who stated that [...] "A military solution is not an option. We appeal to your principles to make this dialogue a success." [...] Obasanjo went on to declare that the talks should accomplish a permanent cease-fire in eastern Congo, continued reinforcement of a corridor for humanitarian assistance in the region, and a lasting peace in Congo; he also praised the delegations for their efforts. Wetangula added, [...] "The pictures and clips we have been seeing on international TV screens remains a terrible indictment to all of us Africans, you Congolese in particular.

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you <b>see</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV.</b> There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
