25|$|The United States {{needed to}} find a vehicle to {{continue}} to contain Saddam because the CIA said {{all we have to}} do is wait six months and <b>Saddam</b> <b>is</b> going to collapse on his own volition. That vehicle is sanctions. They needed a justification; the justification was disarmament. They drafted a Chapter 7 resolution of the United Nations Security Council calling for the disarmament of Iraq and saying in Paragraph 14 that if Iraq complies, sanctions will be lifted. Within months of this resolution being passed—and the United States drafted and voted in favor of this resolution—within months, the President, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his Secretary of State, James Baker, are saying publicly, not privately, publicly that even if Iraq complies with its obligation to disarm, economic sanctions will be maintained until which time Saddam Hussein is removed from power.|$|E
500|$|Terrance and Phillip {{become aware}} of the {{kidnapping}} when they receive a letter, but they immediately locate Sally upon arrival in Tehran. The duo return Sally to her home, where Saddam has now taken control. Celine, Terrance's now ex-wife, is dating, and has become pregnant by a friend of the duo named Ugly Bob. While the couple discuss their relationship, Saddam interrupts and takes them hostage, with Celine having planned to sing at a Canadian football game. Scott has also become worried about the presence of the Iraqi soldiers in Canada, but becomes infuriated when he finds that Terrance and Phillip have returned to Canada safely. He confronts Saddam about the double-cross, but Saddam's armed guards scare him into backing away. It is revealed that <b>Saddam</b> <b>is</b> trying to take over Canada as {{the first step in a}} plan for world domination. Terrance and Phillip arrive at the game. Instead of following a plan set up by Scott to commit suicide by using a bomb, they come up with a new plan and put on gas masks. With brute force, everyone farts a huge gas cloud which kills Saddam and his soldiers. Scott arrives, and is annoyed to find that Terrance and Phillip are still alive. Terrance, Phillip, Celine, and everyone else (excluding Scott) celebrate their freedom with a rendition of [...] "O Canada". During the credits, an announcement is made that the solution to who Cartman's father is would be answered [...] "in a few weeks".|$|E

[...] In November of that year, Blair further stated that, [...] "So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not régime change – that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of <b>Saddam</b> <b>is</b> a very brutal and repressive regime, I think it does enormous damage to the Iraqi people ... so I have got no doubt <b>Saddam</b> <b>is</b> very bad for Iraq, {{but on the other hand}} I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, it is not regime change." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jonah Goldberg claimed after {{a debate}} with O'Keefe, that [...] "O'Keefe {{and his friends}} are objectively in favour of Saddam Hussein and his murderous regime because they believe he is uniquely worth {{defending}} with their bodies.

2500|$|On 12 September 2002, Netanyahu testified (under oath as {{a private}} citizen) before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform {{regarding}} the nuclear threat posed by the Iraqi régime: [...] "There is no question whatsoever that <b>Saddam</b> <b>is</b> seeking and is working and is advancing towards the development of nuclear weapons – no question whatsoever," [...] he said. [...] "And {{there is no question}} that once he acquires it, history shifts immediately." [...] Netanyahu and other high rank officials from different countries had suspected that Iraq could develop a nuclear capability, as the country began building a nuclear power plant program in 1959 with the USSR, but Israeli airstrikes had destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981 (see Operation Opera).|$|E
2500|$|Friedman {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing that {{the establishment of}} a democratic state in the Middle East would force {{other countries in the region}} to liberalize and modernize. In his February 9, 2003, column for The Wall Street, Friedman also pointed to the lack of compliance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction: [...] "The French position is utterly incoherent. The inspections have not worked yet, says Mr. de Villepin, because Saddam has not fully cooperated, and, therefore, we should triple the number of inspectors. But the inspections have failed not because of a shortage of inspectors. They have failed because of a shortage of compliance on Saddam's part, as the French know. The way you get that compliance out of a thug like <b>Saddam</b> <b>is</b> not by tripling the inspectors, but by tripling the threat that if he does not comply he will be faced with a U.N.-approved war." [...] Since the invasion, Friedman has expressed alarm over the post-invasion conduct of the war by the George W. Bush administration. Nevertheless, until his piece dated August 4, 2006 (see below), his columns remained hopeful to the possibility of a positive conclusion to the Iraq conflict (although his optimism appeared to steadily diminish as the conflict continued). Friedman chided George W. Bush and Tony Blair [...] for [...] "hyping" [...] the evidence, and stated plainly that converting Iraq to democracy [...] "would be a huge undertaking, though, and maybe impossible, given Iraq's fractious history". In January 2004, he participated in a forum on Slate.com called [...] "Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War", in which he dismisses the justification for war based on Iraq's lack of compliance with the U.N. Resolutions: [...] "The right reason for this war.. was to oust Saddam's regime and partner with the Iraqi people to try to implement the Arab Human Development report's prescriptions in the heart of the Arab world. That report said the Arab world is falling off the globe because of a lack of freedom, women's empowerment, and modern education. The right reason for this war was to partner with Arab moderates in a long-term strategy of dehumiliation and redignification.|$|E

2500|$|George Bush, {{speaking}} in October 2002, said that [...] "The stated {{policy of the}} United States is regime change. ... However, if <b>Saddam</b> <b>were</b> to meet all {{the conditions of the}} United Nations, the conditions that I have described very clearly in terms that everybody can understand, that in itself will signal the regime has changed".

5000|$|On CBS, President Bush said U.N. weapons inspectors, {{before they}} were denied access to Iraq in 1998, {{concluded}} that <b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> [...] "six months away from developing a weapon."
