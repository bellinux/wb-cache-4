500|$|Completing {{the fifth}} of the five planned spacewalks, Grunsfeld and Feustel {{successfully}} installed the second battery, removed and replaced the Fine Guidance Sensor number three, and worked so efficiently that they were over an hour ahead of the timeline, giving them time to remove degraded insulation panels from three bays of the telescope, and install three New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs). Beginning the spacewalk at 12:20 UTC, the pair first worked on removing an aging battery module, {{and replaced it with}} a new pack, which combined with the battery replacement performed during the second spacewalk, gave the telescope all new nickel-hydrogen batteries. They then moved on to the removal and replacement of the Fine Guidance <b>Sensor</b> <b>unit</b> number three, improving Hubble's focus and stability when imaging. NASA engineers liken the new FGS to being able to keep a laser beam focused on a U.S. dime coin that is [...] away. Both the new batteries, and the FGS passed both aliveness and functional testing. The mission's final EVA concluded at 19:22 UTC, after seven hours and two minutes. The total time spent during the mission in extra-vehicular activity was thirty-six hours, fifty-six minutes. The twenty-third and final spacewalk to service Hubble brought the total time spent in EVA working on the telescope to one hundred and sixty-six hours, six minutes. Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noted that the final EVA was also the last planned spacewalk from a shuttle airlock. In what was likely his last EVA, Grunsfeld's has accumulated fifty-eight hours and thirty minutes spacewalking, just two minutes less than Jerry L. Ross, who is third on the list of spacewalking time.|$|E

40|$|The Radio Frequency Health Node (RFHN) {{wireless}} {{sensor system}} differs from other wireless sensor systems in ways {{originally intended to}} enhance utility as an instrumentation system for a spacecraft. The RFHN can also be adapted to use in terrestrial applications {{in which there are}} requirements for operational flexibility and integrability into higher-level instrumentation and data acquisition systems. As shown in the figure, the heart of the system is the RFHN, which is a unit that passes commands and data between (1) one or more commercially available wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> (optionally, also including wired <b>sensor</b> <b>units)</b> and (2) command and data interfaces with a local control computer that may be part of the spacecraft or other engineering system in which the wireless sensor system is installed. In turn, the local control computer can be in radio or wire communication with a remote control computer that may be part of a higher-level system. The remote control computer, acting via the local control computer and the RFHN, cannot only monitor readout data from the <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> but can also remotely configure (program or reprogram) the RFHN and the <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> during operation. In a spacecraft application, the RFHN and the <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> can also be configured more nearly directly, prior to launch, via a serial interface that includes an umbilical cable between the spacecraft and ground support equipment. In either case, the RFHN wireless sensor system has the flexibility to be configured, as required, with different numbers and types of sensors for different applications. The RFHN can be used to effect realtime transfer of data from, and commands to, the wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>units.</b> It can also store data for later retrieval by an external computer. The RFHN communicates with the wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> via a radio transceiver module. The modular design of the RFHN makes it possible to add radio transceiver modules as needed to accommodate additional sets of wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>units.</b> The RFHN includes a core module that performs generic computer functions, including management of power and input, output, processing, and storage of data. In a typical application, the processing capabilities in the RFHN are utilized to perform preprocessing, trending, and fusion of sensor data. The core module also serves as the unit through which the remote control computer configures the <b>sensor</b> <b>units</b> {{and the rest of the}} RFHN...|$|R

However, in November, Alex Kipman made a statement that [...] "the new motion control tech now only uses a single-digit percentage of Xbox 360's processing power, down from the previously stated 10 to 15 percent."
