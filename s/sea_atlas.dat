40|$|In this thesis, the {{improvement}} and {{extension of the}} North <b>Sea</b> Storm <b>Atlas</b> is studied. The North <b>Sea</b> Storm <b>Atlas</b> is a new statistical approach for rapid flood forecasting in coastal areas. The method {{is based on a}} large database of potential weather scenarios. A detailed hydrodynamic numerical model (WAQUA-in-Simona/DCSM 98) has been used to compute the storm surges of all the scenarios. In order to give a quick surge prediction for an upcoming storm event, a smart algorithm is used to compare the weather forecast to the database of weather scenarios. When the best matching scenario is found, the corresponding surge is retrieved as a forecast. In the current North <b>Sea</b> Storm <b>Atlas,</b> the weather patterns are characterized and matched based on the mean sea level pressure. In this research, the setup of an Extended North <b>Sea</b> Storm <b>Atlas</b> is proposed. The goal of the adjustments is to improve the accuracy of the surge predictions and to add predictions of significant wave heights. In order to do so, wind data is introduced in the characterization of the weather scenarios. Hereafter a new database of significant wave heights is built using the ECMWF daily forecast dataset and corresponding Wave Model (WAM) results. The validity of the Extended North <b>Sea</b> Storm <b>Atlas</b> is examined by hindcasting 33 historic storms. The outcomes are compared to hydrodynamic numerical model results at several locations along the North Sea coast. The root mean squared error is used as statistical measure to quantify the error in the 33 peaks of the surge and significant wave height hindcasts. It is concluded that the North <b>Sea</b> Storm <b>Atlas</b> can be used to construct reasonable predictions of the offshore significant wave height, with large time savings compared to real-time modeling. Besides it is found that solely wind as storm characterization does not lead to a structural improvement of the surge or wave predictions. Therefore it is suggested to use a combination of the mean sea level pressure and local wind speed in order to increase the accuracy. In this way the North <b>Sea</b> Storm <b>Atlas</b> will be able to account for both the complete storm system as well as local conditions.

5000|$|Pieter Goos (1616-1675) was a Dutch cartographer, {{copperplate}} engraver, {{publisher and}} bookseller. He {{was the son}} of Abraham Goos (1590-1643), also a cartographer and map seller. From 1666, Pieter Goos published a number of well produced atlases. He was the first to map Christmas Island, which he labelled [...] "Mony" [...] in his map of the East Indies, published in his 1666 Zee-Atlas (<b>Sea</b> <b>Atlas).</b> His Atlas ofte Water-Weereld (Atlas or Water World) has been cited {{as one of the best}} maritime atlases of its time. Another of his fine works was the Oost Indien (East Indies) map published in 1680.|$|E
50|$|At {{the auction}} {{most of the}} atlas plates {{and some of the}} wall map were sold to Pieter Mortier (1661-1711), a geographer, copper engraver, printer and {{publisher}} from Amsterdam. After Mortier’s death, his firm eventually passed to the ownership of his son, Cornelis Mortier and Johannes Covens I who together founded Covens & Mortier on November 20, 1721. Covens & Mortier grew {{to become one of the}} largest cartography publishing houses of the 18th century.The 27 chart plates from his 1675 <b>Sea</b> <b>atlas</b> were sold at the 1710 auction, to the Amsterdam print seller Luis Renard, who published them under his own name in 1715, and then sold them to Rennier and Joshua Ottens who continued to publish them until the mid-1700s.|$|E
5000|$|Goos' famous world map titled Atlas ofte Water-Weereld was in two parts, one {{for each}} hemisphere. The {{colourful}} presentation included the two poles. His maritime maps encompassed not only Europe, Great Britain and Ireland but also the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The Zee Atlas covered the English Channel, the Mediterranean and the Arctic Ocean {{as well as the}} Indian and Pacific Oceans. He also published regional maps covering the coastal areas of all the continents, facilitating navigation by including details of sandbars, sea depths and the islands near the coast. [...] A particular feature of the Goos maps was that they were embellished with [...] "large descriptive cartouches" [...] supplemented with sketches of ships, compass cards, and wind roses. His <b>sea</b> <b>atlas</b> of 1666, one of the most complete maritime atlases in existence {{in the second half of}} the seventeenth century, contained a frontispiece which featured ships in combat.Printed on thick paper with gilding, people bought the colourful maps just to decorate their offices and homes. At least one of Goos' atlases was published by his widow.|$|E
50|$|Goos {{was born}} in 1616 into a cartographer's family in Amsterdam, Netherlands. His father, Abraham, was an {{established}} cartographer having published globes as well as land and sea maps at Antwerp. His mother was Stijntgen Theunisdr de Ram. In Antwerp, his father had associated with Jodocus Hondius and Johannes Janssonius. Goos followed in his footsteps, first creating pilot books and then moving into global <b>sea</b> <b>atlases</b> to assist navigation. His son, Henrik, followed in the family tradition of cartography and publishing. Goos operated from Amsterdam, which was {{the focal point of}} cartography (as Antwerp was affected by war) and also trade during the seventeenth century. The Dutch maps were very detailed, colourful and attractive.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} uses of calculation {{in the works}} of John Seller, a seventeenth-century publisher of <b>sea</b> <b>atlases,</b> navigation manuals and popular geography texts. It is argued that Seller led his readers to calculate overseas places as distant but accessible and to calculate overseas peoples as different but similar. Foreign places thus were constructed as knowable, opening up a world wherein the English could engage in commerce and, in some instances, territorial domination. By inviting his readers to constitute projections of similitude and difference across time and space, Seller enabled them to use calculation to construct themselves as English subjects who knew their ‘place’, within the English nation and within the global community of nations...|$|R
5000|$|Pilot books, which {{contained}} {{a large number}} of navigation charts, were published by many authors, including Goos. He had a notarized agreement with two others, Jacob Lootsman and Hendrick Doncker, to publish pilot books for navigation along the Mediterranean coast, also covering easterly and westerly navigational routes. These were called the Dutch pilot books and remained valid for the period from 1643 to 1680. Goos was also instrumental in publishing the first pilot book for coastlines outside Europe. A further improvement over the pilot books in Dutch cartography was the publication of <b>sea</b> <b>atlases</b> covering the whole world. Initiated in 1659 by Doncker, the approach was also adopted by Goos from 1666. One of his larger works is named le grand & nouveau miroir ou flambeau de la mer (1662). In the same year, Goos published [...] "The Lighting Colomne or Sea-Mirrour", which not only contained nautical charts, but also [...] "a brief instruction of the art of navigation".|$|R

This is the second state of Dudley's map of Asia, showing New Guinea, {{the northern tip of}} Cape York Peninsula and the eastern part of south east Asia. Dudley 's famous atlas is the first English atlas to show any part of the Australian continent. It details the tip of the Cape York Peninsula to 12 degrees south, showing the northern most discoveries made by Carstensz along the west coast of Cape York Peninsula. Also charted is part of New Guinea which Dudley depicts with a passage between New Guinea and Australia marked "G. Incognito" [i. e. unknown gulf], {{but at the same time}} distinctly represented as a sea passage between the east and western parts of New Guinea. On this map eastern New Guinea is tentatively joined to Cape York Peninsula. In 1623 Dutch explorer Jan Carstensz with fellow explorer Van colster were assigned by Herman van Speult, Governor of Amroyna, to lead a voyage to New Guinea in the ships the 'Pera' and the 'Arnhem' to search for gold on the south coast of New Guinea and check the previous reports of the area made by Willem Janszoon in 1606. Thinking they were still sailing down New Guinea 's south coast, the expedition missed Torres Strait entering the Gulf of Carpentaria mistaking it still for New Guinea but actually landed on Cape York Peninsula. The placenames given by Carstensz are labelled as follows on the southeast corner of Dudley 's map:- 'Hogelondre' (high land), 'R. Van Speult', 'R. Batavia' and 'Water Plaets' (fresh water), and he named Cape York "Nova Guinea".

40|$|South-east of {{the island}} of Rügen is a narrow channel which {{provides}} access to the Western Pomeranian ports. Known as the Neues Tief, this shipping lane bore major significance from the sixteenth to the early nineteenth centuries. The first cartographers to record this difficult-to-navigate territory were the Dutchmen Lucas Jansz Waghenaer, Willem Jansz Blaeu, Johannes Janssonius and their copyists. ln 1623 the Neues Tief underwent revaluation as a subject for publication through a separate, detailed chart by Blaeu. The designation Neues Tief appears repeatedly {{in a wide variety}} of atlases, although it does not always refer to exactly the same geographical feature. During the period in question, the reliable and systematic recording of marine morphology was a science as yet unheard-of. As if to compensate, the scantiness of information concerning the true conditions of the waters off the Pomeranian coast was frequently disguised by the decorative or aesthetic effects of early sea charts. This circumstance was changed substantially by the first hydrographic surveys - undertaken by Swedish marine cartographers in the first half of the seventeenth century - as weil as by the publication in 1644 of Johann Mansson's survey results. Yet the disclosure of these re sults was short-lived, for the Swedish Admiralty was quick to recognise the strategic significance of the Neues Tiefas a means of access to the Western Pomeranian territories and sea ports. The Neues Tief was accordingly earmarked as a barrier against conceivable enemy attacks, and the detailed investigations carried out after Mansson's death (1659) by Captain Sparre, Werner von Rosenfeldt, Petter Gedda, Nils Strömcrona, Jonas Hahn and many others were subject to utmost secrecy for decades. Thus it is hardly surprising that the inaccuracy and informational deficits of early depictions were adopted uncritically by the copyists Gerard van Keulen, Johann Himmerich and others. ln the case of the Neues Tief, the precision and reliability of information so important for every nautical journey remained a desideratum for centuries. The results of Germany's own investigations did not appear in the form of reliable sea charts until the publication of the Prussian <b>Sea</b> <b>Atlas</b> in 1840 / 41, a delay which might strike many as incomprehensible. It must be added, however, that with regard to cartography a large number of other marine territories remained shrouded in darkness for similarly long periods of time. " (author's abstract...|$|E

Subsequently, it will cover demersal fisheries between 2016 and 2019. It only applies to fish stocks which are managed by catch limits, or quotas. Non-quota stocks are not covered by the discard ban. The {{landing obligation}}, {{often referred to as the}} discard ban, is a ban on discarding fish which are subject to catch limits, so that all catches must be brought ashore, except where they are subject to specific exemptions. This means that quotas now control what is caught at sea, rather than what is landed onshore. Article 14 of the new CFP basic regulation stipulates that “Member States may produce a “discard atlas” showing the level of discards in each of the fisheries covered by the landing obligation”. For the North Sea, the ‘Scheveningen Group’ developed a discard atlas to document the current knowledge of how much discards are generated in the North Sea and to assemble information on strategies to mitigate discards. This latest report presents an analogous document, following the format of the North Sea work, to produce a discards atlas for the North Western Waters (NWW) region – specifically, for demersal fisheries. The principle of the landing obligation is to provide a limit on total catch, whereby all catches of regulated species are landed, and once any of the quotas in a fishery are reached, fishing activities cease on species whose quotas are exhausted. It is anticipated this will motivate changes in fishing behaviour and practices. To maximize revenue from their catch, fishermen will attempt to avoid catching fish that will result in a curtailment of the fishing season (sometimes referred to as ‘choke species’) and avoid catching undersized, and low-value fish, which would be deducted from their quota for little or no profit. The level of incentive, and the potential impact for vessel operators, will be dependent on their catch and discard patterns and the quota availability. The purpose of this discard atlas is to provide evidence of discard patterns for different fishing fleets in the North Western Waters region. This information may be used to assist regional managers with the identification of fisheries which may need more focussed attention in the transition to the landing obligation, and in the formulation of a Discard Plan and Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs). There is substantial detail presented in this atlas. The NWW Atlas is intended to be interrogated by regional managers to enable comparisons between fishing vessel groups (fleet segments), fisheries and species, and in turn facilitate priority setting. It is not the intention of the atlas to articulate different management options; hence there is limited analysis and discussion of the content. With this purpose in mind, it is important to understand the quality of the data. The NWW Atlas is derived from the best available data. The results presented are based on the official STECF database which holds information on landings and discards between 2003 and 2012. The information on effort,landings and discards in EU fisheries are derived from two sources - effort and landings from the national fisheries statistics, and discards data collected under the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF, EEC, 2000). Discard data are sampled and recorded for less than 2 % of all fishing operations, and these data are extrapolated to the fleet level. Where no data exist for a fishery, fill-ins are used from data from related fisheries, as is standard practice. If an estimate is largely derived from such filled-in data it may be less accurate. As with the North <b>Sea</b> <b>atlas,</b> the data quality of discard estimates was assessed by calculating the proportion of the discard estimate derived from actual observations relative to the overall amount of discards. However, this does not account for the level of initial extrapolation from the samples to the fleet, which can mean estimates are based on low samples. Known uncertainties in the data are described in the text that support the tables. The STECF database was used to compile landings and discards data for some of the most-commonly caught species in the North Western Waters (STECF 2013 a) using data from 2010 to 2012. The data presented are from the west of Scotland (VIa), Irish Sea (VIIa) and the Celtic Sea (ICES Divisions VII b-c and e-k). The data for the Eastern Channel (VIId) was compiled for the Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries and can be found in Annex 8. Discard ratios were used to express the percentage proportion of the catch that consisted of discards. Data are presented in the same format as that in the ‘Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries’ - estimated totals of landings and discards (in tonnes) by year and species, country and fisheries. The analysis of the pelagic fisheries was conducted prior to, and separately from, the demersal fisheries. The ‘Discard Atlas of the North Western Waters Pelagic and Industrial Fisheries’ can be found here. Included within the NWW Discard Atlas is a review of some of the legislation introduced and research conducted to mitigate discards. To improve mitigation strategies, it is important to know the reasons for discarding. Unfortunately, precise reasons are often unknown, because they are not recorded by fishers, and also because a mix of market- and regulatory conditions may influence decisions to discard. Inferences on the drivers for discarding can be made based on the length of the fish and the presence of different regulations. This is further elaborated upon in the ‘Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries’ which can be found here. The various reasons for discarding will necessitate different solutions. It should be understood that the methods most effective at mitigating discards of larger fish, driven by quota restrictions, will be different to discards that are undersized and are driven by the selective properties of fishing gears. Therefore, the data presented here should be used as a start point to identify fisheries which require more attention in the implementation of the CFP. More detailed analysis of the discard patterns in these fisheries is then required to determine appropriate mitigation and management strategies. It should also be noted that historical discard patterns (2010 - 12) indicate the potential issues under the future landing obligation, but pulses in recruitment or changing distributions of species may create different issues for fishing vessel operators than those that can be deduced from the historical data presented here...|$|E
50|$|According to Michael Hübner, Atlantis {{core region}} {{was located in}} South-West Morocco at the Atlantic Ocean. In his papers an {{approach}} {{to the analysis of}} Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias is described. By means of a hierarchical constraint satisfaction procedure, a variety of geographically relevant indications from Plato's accounts are used to infer the most probable location of Plato's Atlantis Nesos. The outcome of this is the Souss-Massa plain in today's South-West Morocco. This plain is surrounded by the High Atlas, the Anti-Atlas, the <b>Sea</b> of <b>Atlas</b> (Atlantis Thalassa, today's Atlantic Ocean). Because of this isolated position, Hübner argued, this plain was called Atlantis Nesos, the Island of Atlas by ancient Greeks before the Greek Dark Ages. The Amazigh (Berber) People actually call the Souss-Massa plain island. Of major archaeological interest is {{the fact that in the}} North-West of the Souss-Massa plain a large annular caldera-like geomorphologic structure was discovered. This structure has almost the dimensions of Plato's capital of Atlantis and is covered with hundreds of large and small prehistoric ruins of different types. These ruins were made out of rocks coloured red, white and black. Hübner also shows possible harbour remains, an unusually geomorphological structure, which applies to Plato's description of roofed over docks, which were cut into red, white and black bedrock. These 'docks' are located close to the annular geomorphological structure and close to Cape Ghir, which was named Cape Heracles in antiquity. Hübner also argued, that Agadir is etymologically related to the semitic g-d-r and probably to Plato's Gadir. The semitic g-d-r means enclosure, fortification and sheep fold. The meaning of enclosure, sheep fold corresponds to the Greek translation of the name Gadeiros (Crit. 114b) which is Eumelos = Rich in Sheep.|$|R
40|$|Marine {{and coastal}} issues are coming under the spotlight, as the European Union looks {{for new ways}} of {{combining}} the apparently incompatible goals of protecting our environment and exploiting its resources to the fullest, sustainable extent. A “blue revolution” is required, to approach the sea from a new angle, explore the many unknowns that are left, make proper use of the knowledge we do have, and foster an era of blue growth. Oceanography, like other Earth Sciences, no longer pertains to the experts only: it is everybody’s concern, {{if we want to}} continue, and actually increase, enjoying the benefits of healthy <b>seas.</b> Marine <b>atlases,</b> detailed maps of maritime activities, plans to lay out the use of sea space, competence centers which specialists and laymen alike can turn to, to acquire the information needed in their activities, are the tools of a new era for sea-goers, in the scientific, economic as well as political arenas. Intelligence about the ecological boundary conditions of our socio-economic development is indispensable to support sustainable growth. Easier access to marine knowledge will reduce operational costs for data users, increase competition and innovation among re-users of marine data, and ease uncertainty in our understanding of the coastal seas. Regulations enacted by the European Union are forcing Member States to take stock of new marine knowledge requirements, and work together, at basin scales, to manage the well being of their near-coastal regions. Instruments such as the many sea-related information systems available today are starting to impact policing and managing of the European Seas, and are expected to have a major influence onto the way science is conducted and perceived by the general public.

40|$|The Wind Atlas of Italy, first {{developed}} in 2002, was refined by CESI RICERCA in 2006, {{when it was}} also enlarged to offshore areas up to 40 km from the coastline. It displays maps of annual average wind speed (m/s) and specific energy production (MWh/MW) up to 100 m above ground or <b>sea.</b> This <b>Atlas</b> is published in an interactive version (named ATLAEOLICO). The Italian Wind Atlas is based on maps calculated using the WINDS model developed by the Department of Physics of the University of Genoa and has then been fine-tuned by comparison with measuring data from over 400 stations scattered all over Italy. Concerning offshore areas, the calibration of maps resulted more difficult {{because of the lack}} of direct measurements. The resulting uncertainty of wind maps over offshore areas has been estimated from a minimum of 2 m/s to a maximum of more than 3 m/s, which results in an uncertainty of no less than 1000 MWh/MW in specific energy production, too high for purposes of energy production evaluation. To reduce this uncertainty, a new wind measurement station has recently been installed at Pianosa, a small uninhabited and flattish island located in the Adriatic Sea off the Gargano promontory, one of the offshore areas with higher discordance of wind speed values among the various maps published so far. This island could also be taken as representative of the transition from the southern zone with better resources to the less promising northern part of the Adriatic Sea. This paper presents the results of the first five months of measurements at this station. These results have been analyzed with commercial codes for wind resource assessment and have then been compared with available information on wind resources in the same area, mostly measurements from satellites and coastal stations, and other published wind atlases...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibilities}} for {{wind energy production}} on the Kola peninsula in north-western Russia were studied in an extensive feasibility study. The Kola peninsula constitutes the Murmansk oblast, i. e. a region with some autonomous features, within the Russian federation. The wind resources {{in the region are}} very good, with annual mean speeds up to 10 m/s on the coast of the Barents <b>Sea.</b> A wind <b>atlas</b> is produced according to the methodology developed at Risø National Laboratories in Denmark and makes it possible to do reliable wind resource as-sessments and production estimates at prospective sites. There are more than 30 civil and military settlements located off the common electrical network. In these settlements electricity needs are currently supplied mostly by autonomous diesel power stations. Due to long distances and difficult access transport of fuel is costly and thus power prices are high. In these communities wind turbines could provide both additional energy supply and fuel savings at competitive costs. The peninsula is powered mainly by nuclear and hydro power stations and there is for the mo-ment no scarcity of power in the electrical network. Power consumption was as high as 17 TWh in 1989 but has decreased to 13 – 14 TWh in the mid 90 's. However, the oldest nuclear reactor...|$|R
40|$|The Cenozoic East African rift (EAR), Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL), and Atlas Mountains {{formed on}} the slow-moving African continent, which last {{experienced}} orogeny during the Pan-African. We synthesize primarily geophysical data {{to evaluate the}} role of magmatism in shaping Africa's crust. In young magmatic rift zones, melt and volatiles migrate from the asthenosphere to gas-rich magma reservoirs at the Moho, altering crustal composition and reducing strength. Within the southernmost Eastern rift, the crust comprises ~ 20 % new magmatic material ponded in the lower crust and intruded as sills and dikes at shallower depths. In the Main Ethiopian Rift, intrusions comprise 30 % of the crust below axial zones of dike-dominated extension. In the incipient rupture zones of the Afar rift, magma intrusions fed from crustal magma chambers beneath segment centers create new columns of mafic crust, as along slow-spreading ridges. Our comparisons suggest that transitional crust, including seaward dipping sequences, is created as progressively smaller screens of continental crust are heated and weakened by magma intrusion into 15 – 20 km thick crust. In the 30 Ma Recent CVL, which lacks a hot spot age progression, extensional forces are small, inhibiting the creation and rise of magma into the crust. In the Atlas orogen, localized magmatism follows the strike of the Atlas Mountains from the Canary Islands hot spot toward the Alboran <b>Sea.</b> CVL and <b>Atlas</b> magmatism has had minimal impact on crustal structure. Our syntheses show that magma and volatiles are migrating from the asthenosphere through the plates, modifying rheology, and contributing significantly to global carbon and water fluxes...|$|R
