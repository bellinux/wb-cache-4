50|$|McFadden {{became an}} anchor of Primetime in 2004 and, having {{previously}} <b>substituted</b> <b>for</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> on several occasions, an anchor of Nightline on November 28, 2005, along with Martin Bashir and Terry Moran, following the longtime anchor's final broadcast. Bashir left the program due to fallout from credibility problems from the disputed and controversial reports on singer Michael Jackson {{and was replaced}} by Bill Weir in 2010. The three tended to anchor in shifts, leading the show by themselves every third night. While Nightline was threatened with cancellation in 2002 under Koppel's long form journalism format, it saw a resurgence in its ratings and prominence after switching to more celebrity topics, pop culture and entertainment news, often competing for higher numbers with the Late Show with David Letterman. As anchor, McFadden conducted a number of significant interviews including ones with celebrities such as Clint Eastwood and Paul McCartney, past and present world leaders such as Pervez Musharraf and Tony Blair, and five with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.|$|R

40|$|Compositional {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} for traditional reachability analysis in order to introduce modularity and to control the state explosion problem. While modularity has been achieved, state explosion is still a problem. Indeed, this problem may even be exacerbated as a locally minimised subsystem may contain many states and transitions forbidden by its context or environments. This paper presents a method to alleviate this problem effectively by including context constraints in local subsystem minimisation. The global behaviour generated using the method is observationally equivalent to that generated by compositional reachability analysis without the inclusion of context constraints. Context constraints, specified as interface processes, are restrictions imposed by the environment on subsystem behaviour. The minimisation produces a simplified machine that describes the behaviour of the subsystem constrained by its context.

40|$|Lectin-free supernatants {{obtained}} from PWM-stimulated lymphocytes, enable B cells to proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin. Both functions are augmented {{by the addition}} of irradiated T cells. In the presence of antigen, these supernatants also enhance specific anti-tetanus toxoid antibody production. The components of the supernatant responsible for these activities have a molecular weight between 30, 000 and 60, 000, and have the characteristics of non-specific factors: they are genetically unrestricted, and do not bind to either antigen or anti-DR affinity columns. There {{is no evidence that the}} partial T dependency of these factors is an indication that their target is a T cell.

Transfer of CD 4 + or CD 8 + T cells permitted nude mice to respond to IFN-"Y; treatment with T cell-regulated antileishmanial cyto-kines (interleukin- 2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or tumor necrosis fac-tor-a) could not <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>T</b> cells.

40|$|Synergism between {{transcriptional}} activators is {{a powerful}} way of potentiating their function. Here we show that the glial POU domain protein Tst- 1 (also known as Oct- 6 and SCIP) and large tumor antigen (T antigen) synergistically increased transcription from both the early and the late promoters of papovavirus JC in glial cells. Synergism between both proteins did not require T-antigen-mediated DNA replication or direct binding of T antigen to the promoter. The ability of T antigen to functionally cooperate with Tst- 1 was contained within its N-terminal region, shown {{by the fact that}} small tumor antigen (<b>t</b> antigen) could <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>T</b> antigen in transfection experiments. In addition to this functional synergism, a direct interaction between Tst- 1 and T antigen was observed in vitro. Using deletion mutants of Tst- 1 and T antigen, the POU domain of Tst- 1 and the N-terminal region of T antigen were found to participate in this interaction. Because of the low levels of Tst- 1 present in oligodendrocytes, synergism between Tst- 1 and T antigen could be an important factor in establishing the lytic infection of oligodendrocytes by JC virus {{during the course of the}} fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy...|$|R
