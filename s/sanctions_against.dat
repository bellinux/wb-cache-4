Until the outbreak of the Second Gulf War the Australian naval force in the Persian Gulf continued to enforce the <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Iraq. These operations were conducted by boarding parties from the RAN warships.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, 179 of 240 {{members of}} {{parliament}} {{voted in favor of}} pausing the subsidy reform, because of high inflation (exacerbated by the <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Iran). Consequently, the growth in consumption of subsidized products rebounded in 2012.|$|E

5|$|After the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI), the British {{government}} {{petitioned the}} United Nations for <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state. These sanctions were expanded again in 1968.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the situation, the United States consulate advised American nationals, including journalists, to leave Croatia. The US State Department {{announced that it would}} consider introducing economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Yugoslavia. Germany condemned the attack, calling it barbarous, and blamed it on the Yugoslav military.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, 1995, Serbian {{president}} Slobodan Milošević travelled to the United States to {{sign the}} Dayton Peace Accords with Croatian president Franjo Tuđman and Bosnian president Alija Izetbegović near Dayton, Ohio.

5|$|<b>Sanctions</b> <b>against</b> FR Yugoslavia {{were lifted}} in January 2001. The United States under the Bush {{administration}} denied giving any aid to Yugoslavia even {{several months after}} UN sanctions were lifted before Vojislav Koštunica promised to cooperate with demands from The Hague regarding the Slobodan Milošević trial.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom has {{followed}} a pro-Western {{foreign policy and}} maintained close relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. During the first Gulf War (1990), these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and its maintenance of relations with Iraq. Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the enforcement of UN <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Iraq and in the Southwest Asia peace process. After King Hussein's death in 1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly improved.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W. Bush enacted economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide in Darfur, Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in Darfur. He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E
50|$|In May 1717, the Convocation {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} study the sermon. When the report was ready for synodal <b>sanction</b> <b>against</b> Hoadly, the king dismissed the convocation, which did not meet again for over 130 years.|$|R

50|$|Cuba's {{relations}} with Iraq were prosperous during {{the presidency of}} Saddam Hussein. Cuba's friendly {{relations with}} Iraq dated back to the Non Aligned Movement meeting held in Cuba 1979. Fidel Castro even provided doctors to perform back surgery on Hussein. Cuba consistently supported Iraq at the United Nations <b>against</b> <b>sanctions</b> and threats made by the United States. The thirteen-year <b>sanction</b> <b>against</b> Iraq prevented much trade between Havana and Baghdad.|$|R
5|$|Humanitarian {{workers and}} foreign {{military}} observers had suspicions that the Croats deliberately abandoned Jajce, {{as well as}} territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS {{in exchange for the}} Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several Western diplomats denied this claim, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN to impose <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also {{been a part of the}} Vance plan, which was accepted by both Croatia and Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|In 1115 Henry sent Warelwast back to Rome to {{negotiate}} with Paschal, who was angry that the king was prohibiting papal legates in England, not allowing clerics {{to appeal to the}} papal court, and was failing to secure papal sanction for church councils or the translation of bishops. Warelwast was unable to change the pope's mind, but he did manage to prevent <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> the king. Henry also employed Warelwast as a papal envoy during the Canterbury–York disputes over the primacy in the English Church, with visits in 1119, 1120, and possibly also in 1116.|$|E
5|$|In 1978 Atrash {{hosted a}} dinner aimed at healing the rift between the ruling Ba'ath governments of Syria and {{neighboring}} Iraq.

Between 2000 and 2006 Atrash {{was a member of}} an organization in support of the Palestinian uprising against Israel. Between 2001 and 2006 he presided over the Syrian Arab Committee, which aimed to end the <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Iraq and later support it after the 2003 invasion.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 January 2005, Ohio's Secretary of State filed {{a motion}} for <b>sanction</b> <b>against</b> the plaintiffs, alleging that the claim in Moss v. Bush was meritless, {{did not meet the}} {{standards}} of evidence required by law, and was brought only for partisan political purposes.|$|R

5|$|The Bosnian War {{began in}} 1992, {{as a result}} of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The deteriorating {{situation}} led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9October 1992, ordering a no-fly zone over central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which NATO began enforcing on 12April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations instituted {{mandatory}} economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Rhodesia in December 1966. Over {{the next}} year British diplomatic activity regarding Rhodesia was diminished; the UK government's stated policy shifted towards NIBMAR—"no independence before majority rule". Beadle grappled with the Rhodesian problem privately and in correspondence, attempting to reconcile the Smith administration's control over {{the country with the}} unconstitutional nature of UDI. Erwin Griswold, the United States Solicitor General, wrote to him that as he saw it the Rhodesian judges could not recognise the post-UDI government as de facto while also claiming to act under the Queen's commission.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for victims and their families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E
2500|$|Palestinians {{and their}} {{supporters}} hailed the EU directive as a significant political and economic <b>sanction</b> <b>against</b> settlements.

50|$|During {{a raid on}} two {{influential}} Bhopal-based businessmen Dilip Suryavanshi and Sudhir Sharma, {{the income}} tax department had recovered diaries which had entries claiming that the two ministers had been paid bribes. Singh claimed that complaints against the two ministers are pending before the state Lokayukta but the Chief Minister has not accorded <b>sanction</b> <b>against</b> the two yet.|$|R
50|$|The blatant {{nature of}} the {{manipulation}} of the decisive match led to nationwide protests by long-suffering fans. The DFV (East German Football Federation) responded by placing a lifetime ban on Stumpf. However, there was no admission of complicity by Stumpf, the Stasi, or the football club, and no <b>sanction</b> <b>against</b> Dynamo - their title stood regardless of the protest.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was in the building, meeting Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, but none of them were injured in the attack. In {{immediate}} aftermath, Tuđman remarked that the attack was apparently meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia. Marković blamed Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević, who denied the accusation and suggested the event was staged by Croatia. The attack prompted international condemnation and consideration of economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> Yugoslavia. The presidential residence was immediately moved to the Presidential palace, which was formerly known as Villa Zagorje. The Banski dvori sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995. The building later became the seat of the Croatian Government.|$|E
5|$|Both second-round {{candidates}} and the incumbent president were initially {{arrested by the}} junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, {{said that one of}} the reasons for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed that led to the third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as interim president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed for at least two years into the future. An interim government is tasked with administering Guinea-Bissau in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{staged a}} tiring, dangerous, and {{high-profile}} trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending {{a night in}} the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became {{a leader in the}} push for economic <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E
50|$|In some instances, {{a player}} or coach who is ejected must serve a {{suspension}} and may pay a fine. Often, the suspension is one {{game for the}} first offense, with harsher penalties depending on subsequent ejections and {{the severity of the}} offense. Sometimes in professional sports, a fine may be <b>sanctioned</b> <b>against</b> a player or coach.|$|R
