60|$|She now {{directed}} her steps {{toward one of}} the hotels, where <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was a telegraph office.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me, mutely, because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was {{something}} wrong {{and that it was}} no use for her to ask what.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> {{was a dark}} side, but {{hope and}} love were more present to her than was fear. Happy those to whom such young days are granted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>there's</b> {{been some}} misunderstanding," [...] said Dan, {{with a laugh}} that was anxious, {{in view of the}} clouds {{possibly}} gathering again.|$|R
6000|$|Dick laughed. [...] "I've {{been trying}} {{to get a chance to}} tell her. I haven't had it yet. But <b>she</b> <b>knows.</b> <b>There</b> are other ways besides speech. And Mercedes has told her. I hope, I almost believe Nell cares a little for me." ...|$|R
50|$|Emma Lou {{realizes she}} has spent her life running: she ran from Boise's color prejudice; she left Los Angeles for similar reasons. But she decides never to run again. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>there</b> are many people like her and {{that she has to}} accept herself.|$|R
60|$|Harding met {{the gaze}} she quietly fixed on him. He saw that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was some secret {{between him and}} her son, but had {{confidence}} enough to ask no questions.|$|E
60|$|She made {{a sudden}} {{movement}} {{and dropped the}} red flower. It floated idly away. She swam a stroke or two till <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was ground within her depth and then stood up.|$|E
60|$|Ethel {{could answer}} with dignity, but her heart sank at {{the aspect of}} what she had undertaken. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> would be evil, but she had {{expected}} it in a more striking and less disagreeable form.|$|E
60|$|But she {{gathered}} up her courage; and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>there</b> {{was no time}} to be wasted.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{moving into}} the {{teachers}} cottage, Gwen asks her maid, Valerie Creek (Michele Dotrice), where she might find the rectory. Valerie is confused - <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>there</b> is no rectory - until Gwen explains {{she would like to}} thank Mr Bax. [...] "Oh, you mean the Baxes house!" [...] she says, and shows her the way after tea.|$|R
40|$|Camille {{wants to}} find the perfect boy, with an athlete's body and a poet's brain. But when she's {{rejected}} at her new college party, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>there</b> isn't a boy alive who'll ever measure up. Enter Zoe, her brilliant but strange best friend, who takes biology homework {{to a whole new}} level. She can create Camille's dream boy, but can she make him love her...|$|R
60|$|The blood came to Barbara's skin. She {{had meant}} to go and hated to be baffled, but Cartwright gave her a steady glance and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was no use in arguing when he looked like that.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No fire, my dear, but the sky all aglow with sunset, {{and the red}} cow {{standing}} up against the light, chewing her cud, and looking as well pleased as though <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> wasn't her match in Dorset.' ...|$|E
60|$|Dolores {{was not in}} a mood to be pleased, but she did {{not quite}} dare to say she did not choose to make herself ridiculous, and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was {{authority}} in the tone, so she followed and endured.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's right too. Of course <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>there's</b> somebody. <b>She</b> ain't such a fool as {{to think}} that I'm out at these hours to sing psalms {{with a lot of}} young women. She says that whoever it is ought to speak out his mind. There;--that's what she says. And she's right. A girl has to mind herself, though she's ever so fond of a young man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean Mrs. Charmond? Oh, <b>she</b> doesn't <b>know</b> <b>there's</b> such a tree on her estate. Besides, {{shrouding}} is not felling, and I'll {{risk that}} much." ...|$|R
40|$|In a tiny Iowa rural community, stuck like a mud dauber 2 ̆ 7 s nest on {{the banks}} of the Little Sioux River, a WASP was born and brought up {{thinking}} everyone in the world was just like her. As she went on to be educated, she was told she was the product of a culturally deprived childhood. Everyone was not like her. Didn 2 ̆ 7 t <b>she</b> <b>know</b> people were different? Didn 2 ̆ 7 t <b>she</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> were minorities in the world...|$|R
60|$|Her gown was a {{very simple}} one of sheer white organdie, and was the only evening dress she had. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> would be many smarter dresses at the reception, but the {{knowledge}} did not disturb her sensible head in the least.|$|E
60|$|She {{perceived}} quite {{early that}} this shortness of money would greatly embarrass the rebellion she contemplated. She was exceptionally ignorant of most worldly things, but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was never yet a campaign without a war chest. She felt entitled to money....|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} help giving herself the relief, when that most loving, sympathizing face was {{pleading}} with her to let him comfort her. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was no fiery nor rancorous temper to take umbrage, and it was best for him to know the completeness of the death-blow.|$|E
6000|$|... "How did <b>she</b> <b>know?</b> I hadn't {{said a word}} at {{the phone}} except 'Yes--yes--yes.' She says <b>she</b> doesn't <b>know</b> how <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> but <b>she</b> did <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> was awake and she heard the ring and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>there</b> was word from Jem.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's {{going to}} find it out sooner or later. I tell you <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> now <b>there's</b> {{something}} wrong out here. She's got eyes. Mark what I say." ...|$|R
60|$|I am {{sure that}} had the fairy godmother {{appeared}} just then and touched Irene with her wand, David would have been interested rather than astonished. As for myself, I believe I have surprised this little girl's secret. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>there</b> are no fairy godmothers nowadays, but she hopes that if she is always true and faithful she may some day turn into a lady in word and deed, like the mistress whom she adores.|$|R
60|$|The air and Sam's {{presence}} had revived her: {{her cheeks}} were quite pink--almost beautiful. She had something to live for {{in addition to her}} son. A woman of pure instincts, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> had been nothing really wrong in the journey, but supposed it conventionally to be very wrong indeed.|$|E
60|$|The ladies {{entered the}} carriage. Amy leant {{back in her}} corner, Laura forbore to scold either Eveleen or Charlotte till she could have them separately; Eveleen was silent, because she was dismayed at the effect she had produced, and Charlotte, because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was a scolding {{impending}} over her.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} also {{gradually}} recovering from her fright, since nothing terrible seemed to happen. They {{were having a}} long journey under the cliffs; but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> must come {{an end to it}} some time, and probably they would float out of the dark tunnel into the daylight sooner or later.|$|E
5000|$|In some versions, {{the woman}} stops for gas, and the {{attendant}} asks {{her to come}} inside to sort out a problem with her credit card. Inside the station, he asks if <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>there's</b> a man in her back seat. (An example of this rendition {{can be seen in}} the 1998 episode of Millennium, [...] "The Pest House".) In another, she sees a doll on the road in the moors, stops, and then the man gets in the back.|$|R
60|$|The castle {{had long}} been quiet and dark, so far as <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> when <b>there</b> was a faint sound and a low whistle. She sprang {{to the door and}} held Ridley's hand.|$|R
6000|$|... “I <b>know</b> it. <b>She</b> {{come from}} New York. But {{yesterday}} she say to me: ‘Let us wheel leetle Jane to the live oak at Burney’s.’ How can <b>she</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> is live oak at Burney’s? Then, {{the first day}} she come, she say: ‘Take baby’s milk into vault under your room an’ put on stone shelf to keep cool.’ I, who live here, do not know of such a vault. She show me some stone steps in one corner, an’ she push against stone wall. Then wall open like door, an’ I find vault. But how <b>she</b> <b>know</b> it, unless <b>she</b> is witch-woman?” ...|$|R
60|$|She knew {{values by}} instinct, and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was nothing shoddy and nothing {{carelessly}} purchased in the room. The Harveys were envied {{by some of}} their wealthier neighbors for the harmoniousness of their house. They contrived to make their furniture distinguish itself from a down-town stock--which requires taste in selection, and arrangement as well.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} bent low, {{his head}} inside the cover staring at that white ghostly oval. He wondered {{she had not}} rushed out on deck. She had remained quietly there. This was pluck. Wonderful self-restraint. And it was not stupidity on her part. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was imminent danger and probably had some notion of its nature.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, {{as he stood}} near {{the other side of}} the bed. His cap was pulled low over his brow, his black {{overcoat}} was buttoned close up to his chin. His face was strange and luminous. He was inevitable as a supernatural being. When she had seen him, she knew. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was something fatal in the situation, and she must accept it. Yet she must challenge him.|$|E
60|$|Her fuller {{explanation}} was that <b>she</b> was becoming <b>known</b> <b>there</b> as the round lady.|$|R
5000|$|Tuke shared interweaving, {{intimate}} {{relationships with other}} female writers, with whom she annually shared a rented summer home with Caroline Spurgeon and Virginia Gildersleeve and others. <b>She</b> was <b>known</b> <b>there</b> as [...] "Meta".|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{not asked}} her. <b>She</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>there</b> is any such lady-relation yet. But it would {{certainly}} {{put her in the}} way of a grand marriage, and she won't say nay to going." ...|$|R
