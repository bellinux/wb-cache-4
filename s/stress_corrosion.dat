Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E

Conditions of electrodeposition, the {{structure}} and physical-mechanical properties (microhardness, base cohesion, internal <b>stresses,</b> <b>corrosion</b> currents) of nickel-based galvanic composition coatings with nano and micropowders of titanium boride are investigated. It is determined that electrocrystallization of nickel {{in the presence of}} boride nanoparticles leads to the formation of coatings with small-sized structural fragments, low porosity and increased physical-mechanical properties. Titanium nanoboride is simultaneously a component of the composition coating and an effective modifier of the nickel matrix.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} grain {{refining}} {{elements such as}} titanium (Ti) on mechanical properties of AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel welds through {{gas tungsten arc welding}} process was studied. Titanium powder of - 100 μm mesh was added in the range from 1 g to 3 g between the butt joint of ferritic stainless steel. In order to investigate the influence of post- weld heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of welds, post-weld annealing was adopted at 830 °C, 30 min holding followed by water quenching. Residual <b>stresses</b> and <b>corrosion</b> behaviour of ferritic stainless steel welds was also studied. From this investigation, it is observed that the joints made by the addition of 2 g Ti (0. 7 wt %) in post-weld annealed condition led to improved strength and ductility.

25|$|The rate of {{corrosion}} protective {{formation is}} temperature dependent. For example, at 27°C (i.e., a common inlet temperature in the Middle East), rapid film formation and good corrosion protection can be expected within a few hours. At 16°C, it could take 2–3 months for the protection to mature. But once a good surface film forms, corrosion rates decrease, normally to 0.02–0.002mm/yr, as protective layers develop {{over a period of}} years. These alloys have good resistance to chloride pitting and crevice corrosion and are not susceptible to chloride <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Protective films can {{be applied}} to the inner surface of copper alloy tubes to {{increase}} corrosion resistance. For certain applications, the film is composed of iron. In power plant condensers, duplex tubes consisting of an inner titanium layer with outer copper-nickel alloys are employed. This enables the use of copper’s beneficial mechanical and chemical properties (e.g., <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion</b> cracking, ammonia attack) along with titanium’s excellent corrosion resistance. A duplex tube with inner aluminium brass or copper-nickel and outer stainless or mild steel can be used for cooling in the oil refining and petrochemical industries.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Canberra is of semi-monocoque construction with a pressurised nose compartment. The whole {{lower section}} of the fuselage is {{taken up by the}} sizable bomb bay, which was typically covered by a pair of hydraulically-driven doors. The Canberra's undercarriage used a simple arrangement, the main landing gear being equipped with a single outboard-mounted wheel and the nose gear being a twin-wheel arrangement. Due to the use of a new alloy, DTD683, the undercarriage suffered from <b>stress</b> <b>corrosion,</b> causing decay to start within only a few years. The extreme hazard posed of undercarriages collapsing during landings, especially if the aircraft were carrying nuclear weapons, led the RAF to institute regular inspections, at first using radiography before moving to more effective and reliable ultrasound technology. The Canberra is made up mostly of metal, only the forward portion of the tail-fin is made from wood.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{interaction}} of macroelastic <b>stress</b> and electrochemical <b>corrosion</b> of low carbon steel in 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), corrosion current density and open circuit potential (OCP) tests were used to represent the electrochemical behavior of low carbon steel. The microplastic deformation was studied through acoustic emission (AE) techniques and surface morphology observation. The results {{indicated that there was}} non-linear relationship between the applied <b>stress</b> and electrochemical <b>corrosion</b> of low carbon steel in 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution. At the beginning of macroelastic deformation, the applied mechanical energy would activate the metal surface, so the corrosive solution would more easily to cover the metal surface and become thin liquid film, then accelerate the electrochemical corrosion process. When the gradually increased stress came to a critical value, the extra mechanical energy would not only affect the surface corrosion behavior of samples, but also enhance the microplastic deformation at some local regions of metal surface even the applied stress was far below the yield strength. Usually these two processes competed with each other. The dominated process at the beginning of elastic deformation is <b>stress</b> accelerating <b>corrosion,</b> and when exceeding the critical stress, the applied energy would induce microplastic deformation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Indoor {{simulating}} {{experiment is}} a main method for oil field CO 2 corrosion research. Experimental parameters {{are very important}} for an accurate simulation. Based on the mechanical-chemical corrosion theory, the external load {{may be possible to}} accelerate the corrosion rate. However, the influence of N 2 pressure on CO 2 corrosion during the simulating experiment is negligible. Because the coupon stress induced by additional N 2 pressure is very low, therefore, the N 2 adding procedure can be cancelled and a more safety working space for researchers will be created. However, {{it does not mean that}} mechanical-chemical corrosion influence can be ignored. For downhole tubing, the hoop stress generated from the formation compress or liquid column internal pressure is remarkable; <b>stress</b> effect on <b>corrosion</b> has to be taken into consideration.

This study used cyclic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to study passive film stability of AA 5083 -H 116, and sought to understand how applied and residual tensile and compressive stresses impact the passive layer film and the materials electrochemistry. Sample plates of AA 5083 were sensitized to different levels to promote the formation of intergranular phase (Al 3 Mg 2).
