25|$|From the 18th century, donkey {{gradually}} replaced ass, {{and jenny}} replaced <b>she-ass,</b> {{which is now}} considered archaic. The change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative terms in speech, and be comparable to the substitution in North American English of rooster for cock, or that of rabbit for coney, which was formerly homophonic with cunny. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, changes in pronunciation of both ass and arse had caused them to become homophones. Other words used for the ass in English from this time include cuddy in Scotland, neddy in southwest England and dicky in the southeast; moke is documented in the 19th century, and may be of Welsh or Gypsy origin.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{a severe}} famine {{in the land}} of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, {{traveled}} south to Egypt. On the way Abram told his wife Sarai to say that she was his sister, so that the Egyptians would not kill him. When they entered Egypt, the Pharaoh's officials praised Sarai's beauty to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace, and Abram was given provisions: [...] "oxen, and he-asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and <b>she-asses,</b> and camels". However, God afflicted Pharaoh and his household with great plagues, for which he tried to find the reason. Upon discovering that Sarai was a married woman, Pharaoh demanded that they and their household leave immediately, with all their goods.|$|R

We cannot, indeed, find his tomb; but he has left us his great example. In his hero, Cervantes has given us the picture of a great and benevolent philosopher, and in his Sancho, a complete personification of the world, selfish and cunning, and yet overawed by the genius that he cannot comprehend: alive to all the material interests of existence, yet sighing after the ideal; securing his four young foals of the <b>she-ass,</b> yet indulging in dreams of empire.' ...|$|E
60|$|Nero, however, began well. He {{had been}} well {{brought up by}} Seneca, an {{excellent}} student of the Stoic philosophy, who, with Burrhus, {{the commander of the}} Prætorian Guard, guided the young Emperor with good advice through {{the first five years of}} his reign; and though his wicked mother called herself Augusta, and had equal honors paid her with her son, not much harm was done to the government till Nero fell in love with a wicked woman, Poppæa Sabina, who was a proverb for vanity, and was said to keep five hundred <b>she-asses</b> that she might bathe in their milk to preserve her complexion. Nero wanted to marry this lady, and as his mother befriended his neglected wife Octavia, he ordered that when she went to her favorite villa at Baiæ her galley should be wrecked, and if she was not drowned, she should be stabbed. Octavia was divorced, sent to an island, and put to death there; and after Nero married Poppæa, he quickly grew more violent and savage.|$|R
60|$|The cow-house {{stood at}} the {{junction}} of the garden with a small paddock, an isolated survival, in a suburban neighbourhood; of {{what had once been}} a small farm. Luke Steffink was complacently proud of his cow-house and his two cows; he felt that they gave him a stamp of solidity which no number of Wyandottes or Orpingtons could impart. They even seemed to link him in a sort of inconsequent way with those patriarchs who derived importance from their floating capital of flocks and herbs, he-asses and <b>she-asses.</b> It had been an anxious and momentous occasion when he had had to decide definitely between “the Byre” and “the Ranch” for the naming of his villa residence. A December midnight was hardly the moment he would have chosen for showing his farm-building to visitors, but since it was a fine night, and the young people were anxious for an excuse for a mild frolic, Luke consented to chaperon the expedition. The servants had long since gone to bed, so the house was left in charge of Bertie, who scornfully declined to stir out on the pretext of listening to bovine conversation.|$|R
6000|$|Father Cavazzi da Monte Cuccoli, Denis de Carli, and Merolla, {{themselves}} missioners, {{have left}} us ample {{accounts of the}} ecclesiastical rule which, during its short tenure of office, bore a remarkable family resemblance {{to that of the}} Jesuit missions in South America. The religious despotism was complete, a tyranny grossly aggravated by the credulity, the bigotry, and the superstition,--I will not say of the age, because such things are of all ages, but of the imperfect education which the age afforded. There was no improvement, but rather a deterioration from the days of Pliny. One father tells the converts that comets forbode ill to the world. Another describes a bird not much unlike a sparrow, at first sight it seems wholly black, but upon a nearer view it looks blue; the excellency of its song is that it harmoniously and articulately pronounces the name of Jesus Christ. A third remarks, [...] "they (the heathen) are excited by the heavens forming a cross under the zone; they are excited by the mountains which have the cross carved on them, without knowing by whom; they are excited by the earth which draws the crucifix in its fruit called Nicefo." [...] Yet all these things are of little force to move the hearts of those Gentiles who scoffingly cry, [...] "When we are sick, forsooth, the wood of this cross will cure us!" [...] Another father, resolving to denounce certain heathen practices, placed on the Feast of Purification an image of the Virgin in relievo upon the altar, and [...] "with a dagger struck through her breast on which the blood followed:" [...] like Mark Antony, he [...] "improved the occasion," [...] and sent home the fathers of families to thrash their wives and daughters who were shut up in the [...] "paint houses." [...] It is gravely related how a hungry friar dines copiously on fish with an angel; how another was saved by the [...] "father of miracles, the glorious Saint Anthony of Padua," [...] whom another priest, taking as his patron, sees before his hammock. A woman, bearing a child in her arms and supposed to be the Virgin, attends the Portuguese army, and she again appears {{in the shape of a}} [...] "beautiful beggar." [...] The miraculous resurrection of a boiled cock is gravely chronicled. A certain man lived 380 years [...] "at the intercession of Saint Francis d'Assise." [...] Of course, the missioners saw water-monsters in the Congo River. A child [...] "came from his mother's womb with a beard and all his teeth, perhaps to show he was born into the world grown old in vice." [...] A certain scoffer [...] "being one day to pass a river with two companions, was visibly taken up by an invisible hand into the air. One of his companions, going to take hold of him by the feet, had such a cuff given him that he fell down in the boat, and the offender was seen no more." [...] Father Merolla talks of a breed in the Cabo Verde Islands [...] "between bulls and <b>she-asses,</b> which they compassed by binding a cow's hide upon the latter:" [...] it would be worth inquiring if this was ever attempted, and it might add to our traditions about the [...] "Jumart." [...] And the tale of the elephant-hunters deceiving the animals by anointing themselves with their droppings deserves investigation. Wounds of poisoned arrows are healed by that which produced them. A woman's milk cures the venomous foam which cobras spit into the eyes. A snake as big as a beam kills and consumes men with its look. An [...] "ill liver," [...] reprimanded by his father for vicious inclinations, fires a pistol at him; the rebound of the bullet from the paternal forehead, which remains whole, severely wounds the would-be parricide: the ablest surgeons cannot heal the hurt, and the flesh ever continues to be sore and raw upon the forehead, acting like the brand of Cain.|$|R
60|$|But {{apart from}} that matter of general experience, there are some cases which put that curious mixture in a very clear light. You are aware that the {{offspring}} of the Ass and the Horse, or rather of the he-Ass and the Mare, is {{what is called a}} Mule; and, on the other hand, the offspring of the Stallion and the <b>she-Ass</b> is what is called a 'Hinny'. I never saw one myself; but they have been very carefully studied. Now, the curious thing is this, that although you have the same elements in the experiment in each case, the offspring is entirely different in character, according as the male influence comes from the Ass or the Horse. Where the Ass is the male, {{as in the case of}} the Mule, you find that the head is like that of the Ass, that the ears are long, the tail is tufted at the end, the feet are small, and the voice is an unmistakable bray; these are all points of similarity to the Ass; but, on the other hand, the barrel of the body and the cut of the neck are much more like those of the Mare. Then, if you look at the Hinny,--the result of the union of the Stallion and the <b>she-Ass,</b> then you find it is the Horse that has the predominance; that the head is more like that of the Horse, the ears are shorter, the legs coarser, and the type is altogether altered; while the voice, instead of being a bray, is the ordinary neigh of the Horse. Here, you see, is a most curious thing: you take exactly the same elements, Ass and Horse, but you combine the sexes in a different manner, and the result is modified accordingly. You have in this case, however, a result which is not general and universal--there is usually an important preponderance, but not always on the same side.|$|E

60|$|Alas, {{there were}} her two forelegs {{no better than}} raw beef on the inside, and blood was running from under her tail. They told me when I started, and I was ready to believe it, that before a few days I should come to love Modestine like a dog. Three days had passed, we had shared some misadventures, and my heart was still as cold as a potato towards my beast of burden. She was pretty enough to look at; but then she had given proof of dead stupidity, {{redeemed}} indeed by patience, but aggravated by flashes of sorry and ill-judged light-heartedness. And I own this new discovery seemed another point against her. What the devil was the good of a <b>she-ass</b> if she could not carry a sleeping-bag and a few necessaries? I saw {{the end of the}} fable rapidly approaching, when I should have to carry Modestine. AEsop was the man to know the world!

I dare not tell, do anything, or get anything done, because I am in debt to Bhagwan Dass the bunnia for two gold rings and a heavy anklet. I must get my food from his shop. The seal-cutter is the friend of Bhagwan Dass, and he would poison my food. A fool's jadoo {{has been going on for}} ten days, and has cost Suddhoo many rupees each night. The seal-cutter used black hens and lemons and mantras before. He never showed us anything like this till to-night. Azizun is a fool, and will be a purdahnashin soon. Suddhoo has lost his strength and his wits. See now! I had hoped to get from Suddhoo many rupees while he lived, and many more after his death; and behold, he is spending everything on that offspring of a devil and a <b>she-ass,</b> the seal-cutter!" ...|$|E
60|$|There dwelt {{an old man}} in Monastier, {{of rather}} unsound intellect {{according}} to some, much followed by street-boys, and known to fame as Father Adam. Father Adam had a cart, and to draw the cart a diminutive <b>she-ass,</b> not much bigger than a dog, the colour of a mouse, with a kindly eye and a determined under-jaw. There was something neat and high-bred, a quakerish elegance, about the rogue that hit my fancy on the spot. Our first interview was in Monastier market-place. To prove her good temper, one child after another was set upon her back to ride, and one after another went head over heels into the air; until a want of confidence began to reign in youthful bosoms, and the experiment was discontinued from a dearth of subjects. I was already backed by a deputation of my friends; but as if this were not enough, all the buyers and sellers came round and helped me in the bargain; and the ass and I and Father Adam were the centre of a hubbub for near half an hour. At length she passed into my service for the consideration of sixty-five francs and a glass of brandy. The sack had already cost eighty francs and two glasses of beer; so that Modestine, as I instantly baptized her, was upon all accounts the cheaper article. Indeed, that was as it should be; for she was only an appurtenance of my mattress, or self-acting bedstead on four castors.|$|E
60|$|The Punjabis of Isser Jang are all {{the sons}} of Belial and a <b>she-ass,</b> {{but they are very}} good witnesses, bearing {{testimony}} unshakingly whatever the pleaders may say. I would purchase witnesses by the score, and each man should give evidence, not only against Nur Ali, Wajib Ali, Abdul Latif and Elahi Baksh, but against the landholder, saying that he upon his white horse had called his men to beat me; and, further, that they had robbed me of two hundred rupees. For the latter testimony, I would remit a little of the debt of the man who sold the lac-bangles, and he should say that he had put the money into my hands, and had seen the robbery from afar, but, being afraid, had run away. This plan I told to my brother Ram Dass; and he said that the arrangement was good, and bade me take comfort and make swift work to be abroad again. My heart was opened to my brother in my sickness, and I told him the names of those whom I would call as witnesses--all men in my debt, but of that the Magistrate Sahib could have no knowledge, nor the landholder. The fever stayed with me, and after the fever, I was taken with colic, and gripings very terrible. In that day I thought that my end was at hand, but I know now that she who gave me the medicines, the sister of my father--a widow with a widow's heart--had brought about my second sickness. Ram Dass, my brother, said that my house was shut and locked, and brought me the big door-key and my books, together with all the moneys that were in my house--even the money that was buried under the floor; for I was in great fear lest thieves should break in and dig. I speak true talk; there was but very little money in the house. Perhaps ten rupees--perhaps twenty. How can I tell? God is my witness that I am a poor man.|$|E

Then Amasis went to kill his daughter as if he didn't he would be sentenced to hell. While preparing for the killing, Amasidia shouted her love for Nebuchad. Upon becoming the new bull god Nebuchad gained the ability to speak and shouted back to Amasidia that he will love her till his death. After this the bull regained his human form in front of the large crowd. Then Nebuchad said, [...] "I would rather be Amasidia's lover than a god. I am Nebuchadnezzar, King of Kings." [...] Nebuchad then married Amasidia on the spot and showed mercy to his new father-in-law and let him keep his kingdom of Tanis. He also bestowed foundations to the dove, <b>she-ass,</b> dog, whale, three magpies, and even the raven., showing the whole world that he could pardon as well as conquer. The old lady even received a fat pension. This created a custom that was passed on to all kings, that all can be pardoned after recognizing the error of their ways.|$|E

As expected, the thermal damage of the milk powder increased as the inlet air temperature increased; the outlet powder RH% was 96 - 98 % poorly correlated with the mass flow rate of the concentrate inlet. Moreover, the destruction kinetic of vitamin C was found highly correlated with the thermal damage to the milk powder. At 175 °C inlet air temperature the overall thermal treatment on the <b>she-ass</b> milk concentrate, which is very heat-sensitive due to its high lactose content, was “weak” (IDT< 80) and the milk powder of “premium or extra” quality (IINS< 1. 25 ml and lactic acid = 0. 07 % < 0. 15 % ADMI).

The place of <b>she-ass,</b> ewe, cow and other varieties of milk are considered within the medical discourse of the spas. Uses of these varieties produce a complex mosaic in the practices of the spas, between therapy and social distinction. A spa is not a spring in a human desert: the medical discourses about milk uses participate in the construction of images of the locals while the milk demand produces effects in the social and economic life of the countryside. Beyond the geographic and historic particularities of each area, analysing jointly the Corsican and Pyrenean situations reveals some of the main parameters within which were constituted relevant medical debates, patient practices, and the representation of dwellers; this joint analysis also underlines the fascinating originality of the universe of spa activity...|$|E
40|$|Morphosyntactic markedness theory classically assumes dynamic {{competition}} {{among the members}} of a paradigm. They are in opposition within a system of contrasts, and their meaning, or use, is determined by their relation {{to each other in the}} paradigm, not by their intrinsic features alone. This idea is embodied in Jakobson's (1984 : 1) often-cited formulation of morphosyntactic unmarkedness in his work on the structure of the Russian verb: When a linguist investigates two morphological categories in mutual opposition, he often starts from the assumption that both categories should be of equal value, and that each ofthemshould possess a positive meaning of its own: Category I should signify A, while Category II should signify B � or at least I should signify A, and II the absence or negation of A. In reality, the general meanings of correlative categories are distributed in a di erent way: If Category I announces the existence of A, then Category II does not announce the existence of A, i. e. it does not state whether A is present or not. The general meaning of the unmarked Category II, as compared to the marked Category I, is restricted to the lack of -signalization". Jakobson gives (1) as a simple example: (1) Russian: osl ca `she-ass', osel `donkey' eto osl ca? `Is it a <b>she-ass?</b> ' |net, osel `no, a donkey'...|$|E
40|$|The donkey {{is charged}} with a rich, {{important}} biblical symbolism. Usually the kings choose a strong and combatant animal for ceremonies – a thoroughbred horse, an imposing elephant or even a camel. Christ enters Jerusalem on “the foal of a she-ass”, as {{the king of the}} Jews. This is to fulfil the the tradition – David has a “royal she-ass” and Solomon is anointed as king on a “wild donkey”. It is either wisdom or stupidity for a king to ride an animal symbolizing love of peace and sexuality. According to other interpretations, the male donkey is related to the material domain with its flesh and strength, whereas those who ride it in ceremonies have mastered this aspect of the human being and society…. However, how do we account for the fact that in Hebrew the ass’s foal is not a diminutive of the word ‘donkey’, as well as the fact that the <b>she-ass</b> signifies ‘slow pace’ and has nothing in common with the jackass? And what does Solomon’s wild donkey signify? The book replies to these curious questions and to the riddle as to why the king of the Jews rides “the foal of a she-ass” and the king is of the tribe of Judah, of whom Jacob/Israel prophesies that he will untie his donkey, just as the apostles set free the ass’s foal for which Jesus Christ sent them…...|$|E
