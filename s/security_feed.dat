The study analyzed information needs of backyard fish farmers in Osun State, Nigeria. Specifically, the study investigated the socio-economic characteristics of backyard fish farmers, frequency of performance, importance and difficulties of management practices as well as the constraints facing backyard fish farming. Questionnaire was used to elicit information from 70 backyard fish farmers. The findings indicated that backyard fish farmers in Osun State were mostly males, middle aged, married and most of them rear catfish, Feeding and cleaning are frequently performed by the fish farmers, feeding and maintenance of water quality were of extreme importance and also cleaning and harvesting were found to be extremely difficult. The major constraints facing the fish farmers were capital, <b>security,</b> <b>feed,</b> fingerlings procurement.

40|$|Feed <b>security,</b> <b>feed</b> {{quality and}} issues {{surrounding}} {{the safety of}} raw materials are always of interest to all livestock farmers, feed manufacturers and competent authorities. These concerns are even more important when alternative feed ingredients, new product developments and innovative feeding trends, like insect-meals, are considered. The black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) is considered a good candidate {{to be used as}} feed ingredient for aquaculture and other farm animals, mainly as an alternative protein source. Data on transfer of contaminants from different substrates to the insects, as well as the possible occurrence of toxin-producing fungi in the gut of non-processed insects are very limited. Accordingly, we investigated the impact of the substrate/diet on the intestinal mycobiota of H. illucens larvae using culture-dependent approaches (microbiological analyses, molecular identification through the typing of isolates and the sequencing of the 26 S rRNA D 1 /D 2 domain) and amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (454 pyrosequencing). We fed five groups of H. illucens larvae at the third growing stage on two substrates: chicken feed and/or vegetable waste, provided at different timings. The obtained results indicated that Pichia was the most abundant genus associated with the larvae fed on vegetable waste, whereas Trichosporon, Rhodotorula and Geotrichum were the most abundant genera in the larvae fed on chicken feed only. Differences in the fungal communities were highlighted, suggesting that the type of substrate selects diverse yeast and mold genera, in particular vegetable waste is associated with a greater diversity of fungal species compared to chicken feed only. A further confirmation of the significant influence of diet on the mycobiota is the fact that no operational taxonomic unit common to all groups of larvae was detected. Finally, the killer phenotype of isolated yeasts was tested, showing the inhibitory activity of just one species against sensitive strains, out of the 11 tested species...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} nutritional status and feeding practices of < 5 year children among the pastoral communities of Simanjiro district, northern Tanzania [...] Face-to-face interviews with the sampled mothers were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements using weight-for-age criterion were employed to assess the nutritional status. The study showed that 31 % {{of the children were}} undernourished, some (6 %) of them severely. Children 2 - 3 years old were the most affected. Breastfeeding duration of more than one year was common among the mothers. Fifty-four percent of the mothers weaned their children as early as two months after birth. The most common type of weaning food was maize porridge (gruel) mixed with cow’s milk (46 %). Generally, 87 % of households were facing some degree of food insecurity where some of them either experienced food shortage for 3 - 4 months (40 %) or reported to eat less than three meals per day (75 %). An educated mother was less likely to have an undernourished child, while a child from a teenage mother was more likely to be undernourished. Small size of a household was in favour of nutrition status. There is a great need to undertake interventions through community education to rescue the situation in Simanjiro district. Efforts should also be undertaken to mobilize the community members to adopt practices that favour good nutrition of children.

40|$|About the book: Two of the {{greatest}} current challenges are climate change (and variability) and food <b>security.</b> <b>Feeding</b> nine billion people by 2050 will require major efforts aimed at climate change adaptation and mitigation. One approach to agriculture has recently been captured by the widely adopted term of "Climate Smart Agriculture" (CSA). This book not only explains what this entails, but also presents practical on-the-ground studies of practices and innovations in agriculture across a broader spectrum, including agroecology and conservation agriculture, in less developed countries. It is shown that CSA is not a completely new science {{and a number of}} its recommended technologies have been used for some time by local farmers all over the world. What is relevant and new is ‘the approach’ to exploit their adaptation and mitigation potential. However, a major limitation is the lack of evidence-based knowledge that is necessary for policy makers to prepare strategies for adaptation and mitigation. This book assembles knowledge of CSA, agroecology and conservation agriculture, and perspectives from different regions of the world, to build resilient food systems. The first part analyzes the concept, opportunities and challenges, and provides a global perspective, drawing particularly on studies from Africa and Asia. The second part of the book showcases results from various studies linked to soil, water and crop management measures from an ongoing program in India as well as experiences from other regions. The third section assesses the needs for an enabling policy environment, mainstreaming gender and sime final recommendations for up-scaling and/or out-scaling innovations...|$|R

To accomplish this task, a fundamental understanding of the biology of plant infection by disease-causing agents, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi will be necessary [1, 2].

Aim: This study aimed to evaluate mothers' knowledge and attitude towards food <b>security</b> in complementary <b>feeding</b> of 1 - 2 year-old offspring. Method: Using a cross-sectional study, 400 mothers of children 1 - 2 years old were selected from comprehensive health service centers in Bushehr, in 2016. The data collection instrument included a self-made questionnaire with 20 knowledge questions with CVR= 0. 95, CVI= 0. 95, and reliability 0. 7 as well as a questionnaire with 26 questions on the attitude with CVI= 0. 94, CVR= 0. 91 and reliability 0. 76 which were completed by the mothers and analysis with Spearman correlation, logistic regression and descriptive statistics.

30|$|The {{other common}} crop {{grown in the}} three villages is alfalfa. In Karchick and Star Ikan, alfalfa is grown to meet basic feed {{requirement}} of their livestock and {{a small portion of}} it is sold in the local market. Alfalfa is often harvested three to four times a year depending on water availability and hence offers farmers year-round <b>security</b> to <b>feed</b> their livestock and whenever possible generate some income. In Bugun, where water is readily available, alfalfa is grown as the main cash crop to meet the growing demand in Shymkent—one of the most densely populated cities in Kazakhstan, and is also as an ideal crop that can grow under saline conditions. Most farmers grow alfalfa based on contractual agreements with suppliers in the city, though {{a small percentage of the}} produce is also kept as feed for own livestock. By diversifying their crops that have different water requirements and harvesting periods, farmers in all three villages meet different household needs and minimize production risks associated especially with those that have higher water demand.|$|R

Revisiting the debates in legal and political theory in which he participated supports the view that security policy, in this case responses to terrorism cannot be evaluated only on the basis of how effective they are in dealing with a threat. In addition, a more political evaluation that looks at how <b>security</b> policies <b>feed</b> back into society is needed. Security responses can intensify the institutionalization of exceptionalism based on fear of the enemy. In that case security policy becomes paradoxical. It risks undermining liberal democracy through the very means by which it intends to save it. ...|$|R
