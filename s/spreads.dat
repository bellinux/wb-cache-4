40|$|A MIMO-CDMA {{system with}} Nt {{transmit}} antennas can transmit Nt symbols {{on a given}} signaling interval, and those N t symbols {{are referred to as}} a message vector. In conventional MIMO-CDMA systems, a message group is <b>spread</b> by using orthogonal direct sequence <b>spreading</b> codes. In this thesis, less known and recently introduced the parity-bit-selected <b>spreading</b> and the permutation <b>spreading</b> techniques are used for MIMO-CDMA system. This thesis develops the closed form theoretical expressions for parity-bit-selected <b>spreading</b> and permutation <b>spreading</b> techniques. We also introduce new design strategies for permutation <b>spreading</b> technique. In the MIMO-CDMA system employing parity bit selected <b>spreading,</b> rather than assigning each transmit antenna with different <b>spreading</b> sequences, the message vector is input to a systematic block encoder whose output parity bits select the <b>spreading</b> sequence to be used. In other words, with a given message vector, all the transmit antennas would use the same <b>spreading</b> sequence. In the MIMO-CDMA system using permutation <b>spreading,</b> rather than using the parity bits to select one <b>spreading</b> sequence, the parity bits are used to select Nt different <b>spreading</b> sequences from a set of <b>spreading</b> sequences. A unique permutation of <b>spreading</b> sequences is assigned for different parity bits. Compared to MIMO-CDMA systems employing conventional <b>spreading</b> method, the simulation results show that, in frequency-nonselective Rayleigh fading channel, parity bit selected <b>spreading</b> improves the system performance, while permutation <b>spreading</b> can further improve the system performance in both single-user and multi-user environments...|$|R

30|$|Application of parity bits in {{selecting}} the <b>spreading</b> codes in direct-sequence <b>spread</b> spectrum (DS-SS) systems is first introduced in [2]. In <b>spread</b> spectrum systems employing parity bits selected <b>spreading</b> codes (SS-PB), instead of appending the parity bits generated from a linear block encoder, {{they are used}} to select a <b>spreading</b> code from a set of mutually orthogonal <b>spreading</b> sequences [2]. The extension of this work in MIMO-CDMA systems is discussed in [3], where two main techniques to select <b>spreading</b> waveforms are explained. In a MIMO-CDMA system employing parity bit selected <b>spreading</b> code, the calculated parity bits are used to choose a <b>spreading</b> waveform from a set of mutually orthogonal <b>spreading</b> codes to be used in all transmit antenna during that signaling interval. In contrast, in a system employing permutation <b>spreading,</b> each block of information bits assigns a different permutation of <b>spreading</b> waveforms to transmit antennas.|$|R

The axial gravity of the trough is similar to the gravity found at other extinct slow-intermediate <b>spreading</b> rate ridges.

50|$|Seafloor <b>spreading</b> is {{a process}} that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through {{volcanic}} activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge. Seafloor <b>spreading</b> helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere.The motivating force for seafloor <b>spreading</b> ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at <b>spreading</b> ridges. At a <b>spreading</b> center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at <b>spreading</b> centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the <b>spreading</b> zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the <b>spreading</b> zone. Additionally <b>spreading</b> rates determine if the ridge is a fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges see <b>spreading</b> rate of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a <b>spreading</b> rate of 4-9 cm/year while slow <b>spreading</b> ridges have a rate less than 4 cm/year.|$|R
