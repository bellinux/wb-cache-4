40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{specific cases}} in financial regulation, competition law and legal rules in procurement, {{in light of}} the economic concept of the efficiency of mixed bundling as derived in our theoretical models. We assess the appropriateness of the existing rules, and also discuss whether {{there is a need to}} reform specific legal or regulatory rules {{in light of the}} efficiency discussion. We examine the U. S. legal and regulatory framework in government procurement, the offsets case, and finally we look into financial regulation in the case of bundled brokerage and <b>soft</b> <b>commission</b> arrangements on both sides of the Atlantic. The novelty of our models is that we analyze transactions mixed bundling in the cases of monopoly, monopsony and exchange. Additionally, for the cases of monopsony and exchange we consider goods of varying degrees of quality certainty. The common result is the local optimality of the bundling of transactions in terms of expected profits for the price-setting firm, and an overall increase in the level of trade in the goods bundled. In the real-life cases examined, we found that in most instances the authorities have decided that if the practice of pure bundling is present, to replace it with mixed bundling, rather than ban bundling altogether. This practice is correct, as according to our models mixed bundling is efficiency-enhancing (both in profits and in trade volumes). On the other hand, the policy implications derived from our models based on the presence of quality uncertainty suggest that allowing the bundling of dissimilar tasks is beneficial rather than damaging to trade, especially if the goods bundled are of diverse degrees of quality certainty. This is at odds with the current legal and regulation approach to bundling practices. ...|$|E

30|$|In modern day, euphemisms {{are often}} used {{intentionally}} to deceive or manipulate others. Rather than speaking of economic recessions, politicians speak of minus growth; rather than speaking of military attacks, they speak of missions (Burkhardt, 2010); rather than bribes, they speak of <b>soft</b> <b>commissions</b> (Rittenberg, Gladney, & Stephenson, 2016). Such Orwellian double-speak lives {{not only in the}} lexicons of politicians, but also the everyman. If we cannot afford to buy a new car, we buy a pre-owned car rather than a used car; if we cannot afford to fly first class, we fly coach rather than second class (Burkhardt, 2010).|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of rule making by {{regulators}} operating under the Financial Services Act 1986. It examines the formation of one set of rules, the conduct of business rules, which regulate firms authorised under the Act to conduct investment business. The thesis focuses on rule making by the core regulators, the Securities and Investments Board and the self-regulatory agencies which authorise and regulate investment firms. The thesis considers firstly from a theoretical stance what rule making consists of, what issues fall to be decided when a rule is being formed, what the implications of different rule making decisions might be, and what factors would influence that decision. In order to discuss rules and rule making {{with some degree of}} analytical rigour, the thesis develops a framework for analysing rules which identifies four dimensions to rules, substance, status, character and structure. The thesis then studies the rule making of these agencies empirically in an attempt to develop a more sophisticated and conceptual understanding of this regulatory function. It first explores the reasons why the regulation was instituted, and why the institutional structure combining statutory and "self regulation was created. It then examines the formation of the initial rules and the reasons for the change to the new rule system which was introduced shortly after the initial rules were introduced. It analyses the formation and nature of the principles, core rules and self-regulatory rules made under the new powers. Finally it studies the formation of rules in particular substantive areas, the <b>soft</b> <b>commissions</b> rule and the rules regulating the retailing of some investment products. Throughout this study, the thesis examines the use which has been made of different types of rules within this system. It considers the different functions of the rules and identifies several factors which have influenced their formation. These include the substantive area in which the rules operate, the institutional framework and the dynamics {{of the relationship between the}} regulators, the political context, and the norms and perceptions of the regulators, regulated and the wider community. It also examines the manner in which rule makers have considered the implications of using rules of different types. These include the use of rule type to confer discretion or decisional jurisdiction between both the different regulators and the regulators and the regulated, to affect interpretation and compliance, and to achieve predictability and flexibility of the rule system. The thesis concludes that although rule making by regulatory agencies is a relatively unexplored aspect of their functions, its study can be profitable for both those interested in regulatory agencies in general, and in financial services regulation in particular. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mutual fund {{providers}} serve two principals with opposing interests: their owners, {{who want}} them to maximize profits, and their fund shareholders, who {{want them to}} maximize fund returns. I investigate what role is played by customer power and information, {{as well as by}} competition among fund providers in influencing the balance of power between these two opposing principals. Using a data set of essentially all U. S. mutual funds between 1992 – 2002, I find that customer power and information play a more important role than competition among fund providers to alleviate the agency problem between fund shareholders and fund providers. In particular, I find that fund providers shift advertising expenses via 12 b- 1 fees and research expenses via <b>soft</b> dollars (excess <b>commissions</b> paid by fund providers) onto fund shareholders. Expense shifting is much more pronounced for retail funds than for institutional funds, while it is much less affected by competition among fund provider...|$|R
5000|$|The mascot which fronts the Children in Need {{appeal is}} called Pudsey Bear. He was created and named in 1985 by BBC graphic {{designer}} Joanna Lane, {{who worked in}} the BBC's design department. Asked to revamp the logo, with a brief to improve the charity's image, Lane said [...] "It was like a lightbulb moment for me, We were bouncing ideas off each other and I latched on to this idea of a teddy bear. I immediately realised there was a huge potential for a mascot beyond the 2D logo". The bear was named after her hometown of Pudsey, West Yorkshire, where her grandfather was mayor. A reproduction of the bear mascot (made of vegetation) is in Pudsey park, near the town centre. Originally introduced for the 1985 appeal, Pudsey Bear was created as a triangular shaped logo, depicting a yellow-orange teddy bear with a red bandana tied over one eye. The bandana had a pattern of small black triangles. The mouth of the bear depicted a sad expression. The lettering [...] "BBC" [...] appeared as 3 circular black buttons running vertically down the front of the bear, one capital letter on each, in white. Perpendicular to the buttons, the words [...] "children-in-need" [...] appeared in all lower case letters along the base of the trianglar outline. Accessibility for young readers, and people with disabilities including speech and reading challenges, were factors weighed by the designer Joanna Ball, specifically the [...] "P" [...] sound in [...] "Pudsey" [...] name, and the choice of all lower case sans serif letters for the logotype.The original design was adapted for various applications for use in the 1985 appeal, both 2D graphics and three-dimensional objects. Items using the original 1985 design included a filmed opening title sequence, using cartoon cell animation, a postage stamp, and a prototype <b>soft</b> toy, <b>commissioned</b> from a film and TV prop maker (citation). The original prototype soft toy was orange and reflected the design of the logo, which was then adapted for approximately 12 identical bears, one for each regional BBC Television Studio. These bears were numbered and tagged with the official logo and auctioned off as part of the appeal. The number 1 Pudsey Bear was allocated to the Leeds region. Joanna Lumley appeared with one of the soft toys during the opening of Blackpool Illuminations and named Pudsey Bear as the official mascot of the BBC Children in Need appeal.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The AUV 62 -MR is {{a system}} for Mine Reconnaissance, based upon the AUV 62 family of 21 ”-diameter vehicles, which is today in {{operation}} with the Swedish Armed Forces. Each MR-vehicle {{is equipped with a}} pair of Flank Array Sonars, suitable for high-resolution bottom imaging using Synthetic Aperture Processing. Including dual receiver arrays, each of the sonars is also able to produce interferometric data, which enables simultaneous bathymetry. This has shown to be very valuable in areas with large water depth variations, in order to project the image correctly at the true height. After extensive evaluation together with the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, a large number of different operations have been performed by the Mine Clearance Units as well as the Amphibious and Submarine Units of the Royal Swedish Navy. During these operations, a lot of high-resolution data have been delivered to the Mine Warfare Data Center (MWDC) for further evaluation. In parallel, the basic capabilities of the AUV 62 -MR have been demonstrated during an intensive exercise on the Australian East-Coast in May 2007. During 2008, a lot of valuable experiences have been achieved – including finding new underwater objects in harsh areas, where conventional ship-based missions have failed. The high-resolution sonar of AUV 62 -MR has also been found very effective in surveying dump sites, where objects are spread over large areas. The low operating frequency, as compared to conventional Side Scan Sonars, also enables semi-buried objects to be easily detected in soft bottom areas. This has also been proven effective during searches for drowned persons in <b>soft</b> bottom lakes, <b>commissioned</b> by the Swedish Police Service and the Swedish Coast Guard, where divers experience great problems with bad visual conditions...|$|R
