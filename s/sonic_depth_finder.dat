5000|$|In 1922 a {{historic}} moment in cartography and oceanography occurred. The USS Stewart used a Navy <b>Sonic</b> <b>Depth</b> <b>Finder</b> {{to draw a}} continuous map across {{the bed of the}} Atlantic. This involved little guesswork because the idea of sonar is straight forward with pulses being sent from the vessel, which bounce off the ocean floor, then return to the vessel. [...] The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, abyssal plains, trenches, seamounts, basins, plateaus, canyons, and some guyots. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.|$|E

50|$|Hull {{technology}} is the innovation and R&D that the manufacturers put into their boats to ensure the best stock wake possible. Many boarders use aftermarket ballast and lead to further weigh down their boats for very large wakes or for sports such as wake surfing. Most wakeboat manufacturers have installed factory ballast but sometimes more weight is needed. Ballast can {{take the form of}} hard tanks or soft bags which are filled with water from the body of water the boat is being operated on. Wakeboard boats have a certain type of hull to allow for bigger wakes. The bigger the wake the more the stern is sitting in the water. These boats are not good for shallow waters considering their draft is roughly over 3 feet. There is a rudder propeller and shaft drive along with three fins directly under the boat. Shallow waters with that much instruments under the boat will call for disaster. These boats are not good substitutes for fishing boats for that reason. Most fishing boats have a flat bottom hull and an outboard motor which is completely retractable. They also have a plastic trolling motor in case they ever get into sticky situations. Wakeboard boats offer <b>depth</b> <b>finders</b> to keep out of the shallow stuff. People often think that if they ruin a prop on an inboard that it will be an easy fix. Inboard props do not come off without a special tool that can be costly.|$|R

5000|$|The {{editorial}} reviewer on Filmtracks {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "an important piece of late-80's film music history." [...] Knopfler's style, across all of his film scores, is such a distinctive extension of the instrumental backing of his pop songs that it's nearly impossible to compare it to any other film score, despite the fact that a handful have attempted to imitate it through the years. ... Performed by only two individuals (Knopfler and Guy Fletcher), the score won't blow you away with <b>sonic</b> <b>depth.</b> Instead, it steals your heart with two opening cues of sweet and romantic acoustic guitar performances. These delicately plucked cues are quite lovely, with the kind of friendly personality that renders them a regular accompaniment to wedding receptions. The wishy-washy, echoing recording of the guitar, with its soothing synthesized accompaniment, appropriately puts the listener into almost a dreamy state in these two cues (as well as [...] "A Happy Ending"). The same phenomenon occurs with the airy keyboarding in [...] "Morning Ride", [...] "Friend's Song," [...] and [...] "Guide my Sword," [...] which often overwhelm the soundscape with their gleaming, major-key goodness.

40|$|Characterization is a {{critical}} step in the remediation of contaminated materials and facilities. Severe physical- and radiological-access restrictions made the task of characterizing the World War II-era underground radioactive storage tanks at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) particularly challenging. The innovative and inexpensive tank characterization system (TCS) developed to meet this challenge at ORNL is worthy of consideration for use in similar remediation projects. The TCS is a floating system that uses the existing water in the tank as a platform that supports instruments and samplers mounted on a floating boom. TCS operators feed the unit into an existing port of the tank to be characterized. Once inserted, the system`s position is controlled by rotation and by insertion and withdrawal of the boom. The major components of the TCS system include the following: (1) boom support system that consists of a boom support structure and a floating boom, (2) video camera and lights, (3) sludge grab sampler, (4) wall chip sampler, and (5) sonar <b>depth</b> <b>finder.</b> This simple design allows access to all parts of a tank. Moreover, the use of off-the-shelf components keeps the system inexpensive and minimizes maintenance costs. The TCS proved invaluable in negotiating the hazards of ORNL`s Gunite and Associated Tanks, which typically contain a layer of radioactive sludge, have only one to three access ports that are usually only 12 - or 24 -in. in diameter, and range from 12 to 50 ft in diameter. This paper reviews both the successes and the difficulties encountered in using the TCS for treatability studies at ORNL and discusses the prospects for its wider application in remediation activities...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Snow {{cover is}} {{spatially}} heterogeneous {{at the local}} scale because of microclimatic, topographic and vegetative effects on snow accumulation, redistribution and ablation – processes which vary between different environments. Automated, fixed point snow depth measurements are the norm at research as well as operational sites, {{and the ability of}} these single point measurements to characterize snow depth for the surrounding area is an important issue. In this study, data for three winter seasons (2002 – 03, 2003 – 04, 2004 – 05) from ten Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS) in northern Saskatchewan were used to assess the relation-ships between local scale snow depth variability, ascertained from snow survey transects, and single point mea-surements made with <b>sonic</b> <b>depth</b> sensors. Analysis of the snow surveys showed a wide range of depths at each site, with increased variability as winter progressed. Single, fixed-point measures of snow depth did not statistically represent the average snow depth at a site, even for relatively uniform snow covers. Consistent over- or under-representation of the landscape mean allowed the development of a “scaling equation ” for each point measurement, improving confidence in the use of these data for modelling and climate variability studies. Where manual snow surveys may not be practical, the use of multiple automated point depth measurements may be adopted, and for the BERMS sites {{it was found that the}} minimum number of point measurements required to represent the landscape mean within 25 % ranged fro...|$|R
