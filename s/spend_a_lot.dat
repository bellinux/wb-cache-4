5|$|In 1994, {{when he was}} 10 years old, Samaras {{joined his}} boyhood heroes, OFI Crete. His father was playing for {{them at the time}} and then retired in 1996. Six months later, he became Academy chief manager, a {{position}} he retained until 2000, when he became manager. Samaras credits his father highly with helping start his football career. His influence meant that Samaras trained every day of his childhood and he also got to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time behind the scenes at OFI. Samaras left for Eredivisie club Heerenveen in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Morton {{interviewed about}} 70 {{people who had}} known Madonna since her youth. He had to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of evenings in bars and clubs in New York chatting to people—including artists, musicians, and directors—who had an {{interesting}} perspective on Madonna and the world. After its release, Madonna received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who pointed out Morton's poor writing skills and felt that the book did not present anything new about the singer. The book was a commercial disappointment. In the United States, the book reached eight on The New York Times Best Seller list, and sold half of its initial print.|$|E
5|$|Sir Bobby Robson {{was raised}} {{a few miles}} away from Tow Law, in the village of Langley Park. He had held the title of life {{president}} at the club, and had helped them out when they hit financial difficulties after the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, which devastated the local area. He was known to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time on the club, attending fund raisers and giving talks. On 1 August 2009, the club held a minute's silence before their game with Workington, following his death the day before.|$|E

5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible and easy to use, so that players would not have to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is designed to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E
25|$|All {{the cousins}} {{live in the}} {{countryside}} around Boston and <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time together. The first encounter with them corresponds to the first visit of Felix to his family. Mr Wentworth's family is a puritanical one, far from the Europeans' habits. Felix is fascinated by the patriarchal Mr Wentworth, his son, Clifford, and two daughters, Gertrude and Charlotte. They <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time together with Mr. Robert Acton and his sister Lizzie, their neighbours.|$|E

25|$|Book and {{magazine}} publishers <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of their time}} buying or commissioning copy; newspaper publishers, by contrast, usually hire their staff to produce copy, although they may also employ freelance journalists, called stringers. At a small press, {{it is possible to}} survive by relying entirely on commissioned material. But as activity increases, the need for works may outstrip the publisher's established circle of writers.|$|E

There are many bowing techniques {{that allow for}} every range of playing style and many teachers, players, and orchestras <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time developing techniques and creating a unified technique within the group. These techniques include legato-style bowing (a smooth, connected, sustained sound suitable for melodies), collé, {{and a variety of}} bowings which produce shorter notes, including ricochet, sautillé, martelé, spiccato, and staccato.|$|E
25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder (NPD) is a {{personality disorder}} {{in which there}} is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive need for admiration, and a lack of understanding of others' feelings. People affected by it often <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time thinking about achieving power or success, or about their appearance. They often take advantage of the people around them. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of situations.|$|E
25|$|With a steep orbital {{inclination}} of 74.2° this comet does not <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time near the ecliptic.

At that point it passed within 1.6AU of the giant planet's influence; even this approach had negligible effect. The comet's orbit appears to be stable between 1740 and 2167, with no strong perturbations {{by any of the}} planets.|$|E

25|$|Several weeks earlier, Irgun {{had learned}} about a Jewish refugee from Vienna named Aaron Weinberg, who had fled to Palestine and {{was working as a}} clerk at a British {{military}} resort camp in north Netanya. This information was already known to the local SHAI (the intelligence arm of the Haganah) commander, Yehoshua Bar-Ziv. Weinberg, who was a SHAI agent, was entrusted by Bar-Ziv with striking up a relationship with two sergeants from the British Army Intelligence Corps, Clifford Martin and Mervyn Paice, who used to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time in the camp.|$|E
25|$|Ball {{proceeded}} to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of money on}} new players who subsequently {{failed to live up}} to the reputations they had earned in the past. He also introduced a large batch of youngsters who were unable to cope with League football. At the end of the 1980–81 season, Blackpool were in the Fourth Division, the League's basement, for the first time. Ball had departed three months earlier, replaced by Allan Brown for his second stint in the Bloomfield Road hotseat. On 21 March 1981, Blackpool played their 3,000th match in the Football League. It occurred against Chesterfield at Saltergate.|$|E
25|$|The shallowness of orca tanks forces orcas to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of time at}} the surface. So {{much time}} at the surface leads to {{prolonged}} exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. Prolonged exposure {{to the surface and}} UV rays is attributed to sunburns and the development of cataracts in orcas in captivity. Orcas in the wild would live at higher latitudes, meaning less intense sun, and spend more time in deeper, darker waters. While it is uncertain the effects of prolonged UV exposure to orcas' skin, since captive orca necropsies are extremely secretive, it seems logical that prolonged exposure to UV rays on unprotected skin would have the same negative effects such as melanoma (skin cancer) on orcas as it does on humans.|$|E

25|$|In March, {{three models}} with the world's first {{electric}} power steering (CGPF/CGPL/CGPJ) {{were added to the}} lineup, at a juicy ¥150,000 surcharge. Actress and pop idol Yuka Ōnishi (大西結花) was the spokesperson for the ad campaign, while an all female motorcycle racing team (Team Angela) raced a Turbocharged Cervo in the Safari Rally. However, it was all to no avail: The rivals, Daihatsu's new Leeza and Mazda's Autozam Carol both sold much better. Combined with the removal of certain tax breaks for small cargo vehicles, this meant that the Cervo's already narrow slot in the market had essentially disappeared. When the new 660cc Kei regulations were introduced, Suzuki decided to call it quits rather than <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money to update such a slow-selling vehicle and Cervo production ended in May 1990.|$|E
25|$|Fafhrd is a {{very tall}} (nearly seven feet) and strong {{northern}} barbarian, skilled at both swordsmanship and singing; the Mouser is a small (not much more than five feet) mercurial thief, gifted and deadly at swordsmanship (often using a sword {{in one hand and}} a long dagger—technically a main-gauche—in the other), and a former wizard's apprentice who retains some skill at magic. Fafhrd talks like a romantic, but his strong practicality usually wins through, while the cynical-sounding Mouser is prone to showing strains of sentiment at unexpected times. Both are rogues, living in a decadent world where to be so is a requirement of survival. They <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time drinking, feasting, wenching, brawling, stealing, and gambling, and are seldom fussy about who hires their swords. But they are humane and—most of all—relish true adventure.|$|E
25|$|Jordan was now {{torn between}} his school {{business}} and {{his desire to}} be elected to an honorary surgeon's position at the Manchester Infirmary. He failed in an election of 1828 and again in 1833, although Turner had been successful in 1830. Among those opposing him were his former staff. Competition for the posts was tough and required influence with, and influencing of, both existing staff and people who subscribed the funds that financed the infirmary's work. Jordan determined to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of money in the}} next elections and to have the public support of Turner and his contacts. Jordan was successful in this effort, which arose upon the death of another surgeon in 1835, but it cost him, among other things, his Mount Street school. The school was closed and its students and library were transferred to Pine Street in 1834 as the price for Turner's future support.|$|E
