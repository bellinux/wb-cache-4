A total of twelve screens were chosen for this thesis; including four screen rulings (65, 85, 100 and 150) and three dot structures (round, square, and elliptical).

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} screening on dot gain and variability. Essentially two hypotheses are examined: first that as <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> is increased, the level of dot gain is increased; and second that as <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> is increased the level of variability is increased. These predictions are also applied to stochastic or frequency modulated screens which are presumed to behave as very screens due to their fine dot structure. A mathematical model {{referred to as the}} border zone is proposed to describe the nature of the gain and the variability for each of the screening systems. The hypotheses were tested by printing tint patches from a variety of screening systems (various screen rulings in addition to a FM screen) on a web press. The tint patches were then measured for gain characteristics. This data were statistically ana lyzed in relation to average gain and variability. The study determined that a correlation does exist between <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> and dot gain, but little evidence was developed to support the idea that screening relates to variability...|$|E

The results show that the higher mesh count and more smooth printing material can induce the better dot, tone reproduction and higher printing precision.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the two current systems which are presently industry standards for judging test exposures which are used to determine an optimum exposure value for the Hell DC 300 B/L electronic dot generating scanner: 1. The Hell System 2. The Kodak System The Hell System uses aim density measurements of specific percent dot area 2 ̆ 7 s or integral dot densities to obtain an optimum exposure value. The Kodak System compares the dot shape and size of complementary 95 percent and 5 percent dots to obtain an optimum exposure value. The Hell computer program test tape number 149 is used to expose a variety of test patterns onto the film which is used to evaluate the dot structure and scanner calibration. Depending on the Kodak or Hell system for evaluation, the dot shape and size of a 95 percent and 5 percent dot or an integral dot density value is used to determine the correct light on film value for the correct exposure from the scanner. Light on film (LOF) is a relative value used to read the intensity or exposure of the laser light source. Six different film and developer combinations were evaluated using both systems {{to determine the effects of}} exposure on different films, developers, and at different <b>screen</b> <b>rulings.</b> An evaluation experiment was completed to determine whether the Kodak System or the Hell System is more precise for determining an optimum exposure value. Thirty viewers were asked to evaluate test exposures from a particlar film and developer combination (Kodak ES Scanner Film, Kodak Rapid Scanner Developer). Statistical analysis was used to find the variability of each system for determining the correct exposure value. The results from the testing concluded that different film, developer, and <b>screen</b> <b>rulings</b> have an affect on the optimum exposure value determined by the Hell and Kodak Systems. Secondly, the Hell System is more precise for determining an individual exposure value than the Kodak System. The Kodak System, however, was judged more versatile because it can also be used to evaluate changes in dot sharpness. A complete set of separations were also made. Kodak ES Scanner Film and Kodak Rapid Scanner Developer was used to make three separations with different exposure values to determine the effects of exposure on the printed separations. An evaluation experiment was completed to determine which separation gave the best results. Thirty viewers used a paired comparison evaluation procedure to determine which LOF value gave the preferred results. However, neither the Kodak or the Hell methods were valid according to the results. The printed separations indicated that exposure causes detectable differences between the printed separations. Based upon the results of the separations, neither the Kodak System or the Hell System to determine the correct LOF produced the optimum results on the Hell DC 300 B/L Scanner as determined by the control group of observers...|$|R
40|$|Reproduction {{of pastel}} colors by offset {{lithography}} produces images that have less color saturation than their continuous tone counterparts. This problem is primarily {{attributable to the}} halftone structure which approximates continuous tone pastels with large amounts of white paper and small amounts of chromatic ink. This thesis investigates the effect of screen frequency upon pastel color saturation. Single and two color overprint tints of nominal five, 10, and 15 percent printing dot areas were printed in 85, 100, 120, 133, 150, and 200 lines screen rulings. The reflectances of these colors were measured with a colorimeter and converted to CIEL*a*b* color notation to provide metric lightness and the chromatic co-ordinates from which chroma was calculated. Physical dot area was calculated by the Yule- Nielson equation for each single color patch. A more complicated graphical technique was used to find this data for the overprint colors of the same physical dot areas. For both single and overprint colors, as <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> becomes progressively finer, pastel saturation increased with physical dot area held constant. For this experiment, the average chroma difference at the 10 percent physical dot area between the coarsest and finest line <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> is 2 chroma units. This difference could also be achieved by changing physical dot area by one percent. The amount of saturation increase is dot area and hue dependent. The yellow printer showed the greatest saturation increase. The saturation increase increased with dot area for a given screen frequency. 2 Lightness decreased whenever saturation increased. When the saturation associated with the different screen rulings were compared at equal darknesses, an increase in saturation could not be statistically determined. The saturation increase from increased <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> at equal physical dot areas occurs because of the increased ink/light/paper interaction. Optical dot area is calculated by the Murray·Davies equation which does not compensate for this change in optical interaction. The experiment shows that at equal optical dot areas, chroma {{will be the same}} regardless of <b>screen</b> <b>ruling...</b>|$|E

The final image quality was subjectively evaluated based on the appearance of otherwise identical reproductions with the only difference being the <b>screen</b> <b>ruling.</b> The results of this research indicated that the relationship between the image quality and the screen rulings was not linear in the color printing process and the difference in image quality of reproductions made by using screen rulings of 133, 150, and 200 lines per inch was not significant...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the feasibility of using a high-addressability inkjet printer {{as an alternative to}} the traditional proofing systems, such as Kodak Approval, was completed. The inkjet proofs must match the press sheet in terms of color, screening, screen angle, <b>screen</b> <b>ruling,</b> and screen dot size. The relatively low cost per print and the ability to incorporate color management makes inkjet technology a potential candidate also for use as a proofer for these requirements. Existing software and patents on halftone inkjet proofing were analyzed. A test form was designed to test the proofing models for screening, screen angle, and <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> observed in the proofs. Several workflow models were developed to generate proofs that matched the press sheet in color and moiré.

40|$|Through the {{evolution}} of technology both print and process have become more predictable and reliable. As a result, innovations {{in the press and}} plate coating technologies along with imaging software technologies have challenged the way we view print. With lithography being the predominant printing process, printers now have to find ways to differentiate themselves from others especially in the color reproduction arena. For years, traditional halftoning methods have reproduced original continuous tone images with success. Today, however, the once accepted rosette is now being challenged by a new technology that does away with conventional <b>screen</b> <b>rulings</b> and dot patterns. This new technology called Stochastic Screening, offers many benefits and is loudly touted by its champions. Tone reproduction whether it be through conventional screening methods or stochastic screening methods is influenced by all parameters in the printing process. In this study, the effects of inking on dot gain and print contrast were studied. A test form was developed to test the prediction that stochastically screened images will perform equally or better than conventionally screened images under normal and increased inking conditions. Evaluation of the test results shows that conventionally screened images actually performed better than stochastically screened images. Stochastic images actually experienced increased dot gain and loss of print contrast in the 48 % and 70 % tint areas under normal and increased inking conditions. Although stochastic images had less of a performance, the images appeared to have less variation throughout the run. At the height of implementation, it is not likely that stochastic screening will become the standard for industry because there are many unanswered questions that still surround this new technology. It is also obvious that implementation of this new technology is bound to be limited by the challenges of controlling a wide variety of equipment across industry, as well as the need to control the plating and printing processes themselves...|$|R
40|$|The {{multi-angle}} screening configuration {{is by far}} {{the most}} widely used screening configuration for process color printing, but there are alternative screening configurations which may be preferable in certain situations. Color separations made using the Staggered Position One-Angle screening configuration are reported to provide printed reproductions on newsprint which appear sharper, offer improved color reproduction, produce smoother color reproduction, and preserve color better in the shadows. The staggered position technique can be generated with high-end scanners and prepress equipment, as well as with desktop publishing workstations using the 2 ̆ 2 Flamenco 2 ̆ 2 screening algorithm. However, the staggered position method may be subject to greater color variation than the multi-angle method due to random misregistration which can occur during a newspaper press run. This study investigated printed process color reproductions produced by the staggered position screening technique in comparison to reproductions produced by the multi-angle screening technique at two commonly used <b>screen</b> <b>rulings,</b> 85 and 100 lpi, on newsprint. During a press run, one printing plate at a time was laterally misregistered in eight increments. A total of 32 sample press sheets and an OK standard press sheet were taken during the press run. A series of printed color patches on each press sheet were measured with a computerized spectrophotometer to determine if the color difference (AE) between the sample and the OK standard press sheet was significant or not. The two screening methods were also evaluated for consistency of color reproduction. Using a two sample t-test, it was determined that color misregistration resulted in a significant statistical difference between the staggered position test target and the multi- angle test target for the same screen frequency. On an individual patch-by-patch comparison, there were certain patches which did not exhibit a significant statistical difference between the two screen configurations. It was also determined that the multiangle screening method produced consistent, acceptable color variation with every increment of misregistration. The staggered position technique produced unpredictable and often unacceptable amounts of color variation which varied with misregistration and the number of overprinting inks...|$|R
40|$|The {{halftone}} {{process has been}} the conventional means of reproducing photographic artwork on newsprint. The use of relatively coarse <b>screen</b> <b>rulings,</b> dictated by the paper characteristics, produces an image with a noticeable dot pattern. Furthermore, the printing process is susceptible to extreme dot gain variation, which affects tone reproduction and the pictorial communication of the image. There were good reasons to suspect that a random dot screen could give more consistent tone rendition than a conventional halftone screen. A comparative study of the consistency of perception of conventional and randomly screened images when printed on newsprint {{has not yet been}} reported. The present study is an attempt to determine which screen can reproduce more consistently perceptible images when extreme dot gain occurs. To test this comparison, an original black and white photographic image, composed of geometric shapes of varying densities superimposed on backgrounds of varying densities, was reproduced from a computer generated slide. This test target, designed to encourage objective answers from observers, was photographed through 65 -and 85 -line conventional halftone screens, and 75 -and 150 - line mezzotint (random dot) screens. The production of film, plate, and the press run were the same for the four screened images. The pressman purposely varied the ink film thickness to simulate dot gain. Selected samples of minimum, average, and maximum dot gain were presented to observers, who were asked to identify geometric shapes on 12 printed images. The recorded responses were averaged, and the collected data was represented in graphs. In this manner it was possible to determine which screens can reproduce more consistent tonal distinctions. The results of the experiment proved that the random dot screens are not capable of reproducing more consistently perceptible images. The 65 -line conventional halftone screen produces more consistent perceptual responses in the highlights, while the 85 -line conventional halftone screen produces more consistent responses in the midtones...|$|R

40|$|Contract {{proofing}} {{for printing}} has been traditionally done by press proofing. This is costly and wasteful, {{not just in}} terms of equipment and labor but also in terms of expendables. The advent of off-press proofing was greeted with some degree of uncertainty by the printing industry. With press proofing, the proof was literally a preview of what would happen on a press. The press proof, although often printed on a different press, generally used the same type of inks, plates and substrate that would characterize the final print. With offpress proofing, printers were comparing apples to oranges; instead of comparing a press sheet to a press sheet they were comparing a press sheet to an approximation of a press sheet. However, over time as printers learned to read off-press proofs, they became accepted as contract proofs. The same situation has now befallen digital proofs. In the particular case of flexography, the proofing problem is a bit different. Off-press analog proofs were designed with lithography in mind, they were characterized to simulate lithographic dot gain. In order to make a proof that looks like a flexographic press sheet, two sets of films are required; one which compensates for flexographic dot gain (this is the set from which the job would be printed) and one which has extra dot gain built into the highlight and quarter- tones (this is the set that the proof would be made from). This extra set of films is wasteful and time consuming to generate. Digital proofing seems to be well suited for flexography, because the dot gain can be built into the proofing system and no extra film is required to create the proof. At the most basic level {{there are two types of}} digital proofers available; those which simulate halftone dots and those that do not. Whether or not the dots are necessary is open to discussion, however, in the case of flexography the dots appear to be crucial. For this research document it was decided that the halftone dots were preferred. The reason for this is that at about 133 lpi the rosette patterns formed by halftone dots are at the threshold of resolution by the human eye. For more course <b>screen</b> <b>rulings</b> this is even more critical. Much of flexography is printed at <b>screen</b> <b>rulings</b> of 133 lpi or lower, so very often the dots can be resolved by the eye. Therefore, the mindset at the beginning of the research was that if the dots can be resolved on the press sheet then the dots should be resolved on the proof. The major thrust of this research was to observe whether or not a halftone-based digital proofer can simulate the appearance of a flexographic press sheet. A flexographic test form was created and printed on a film based substrate. A press sheet was sent to two vendors who manufacture halftone proofers. The proofing systems are not mentioned by name; they are instead referred to as Digital Proof A and B. They then attempted to match the press sheet as closely as possible. Thus, through reverse engineering, the vendors created a device profile for this set of printing conditions. Upon receipt of the proofs, they were compared to the press sheet in terms of optical density, hue (AE) and halftone dot size. Later, a visual assessment was executed to observe how closely the digital proofs matched the press sheet using a 3 M Matchprint, that had been altered to approximate flexography, as the reference or control proof. The results showed that there were significant differences between proof and press sheet in some instances and insignificant differences in others. In terms of the physical structure of the halftone dots, the 3 M Matchprint had the closest match to the press sheet dot structure. In terms of physical dot size; digital proof A best matched the 50 and 75 % dots and the Matchprint matched the 5 % dots the best. In terms of optical density; digital proof A best matched the density of the 25 % dots, digital proof B best matched the density of the 5 % dots and the Matchprint best matched the 50 and 75 % dot patches. In terms of AE values (color or hue difference); the Matchprint most closely matched the press sheet, digital proof B was next, and digital proof A was last. In terms of a visual match, the three proofs were found to be statistically equal in their ability to visually match the press sheet. The visual match being the most powerful of the criteria; shows that the measurable differences in the proofs did not directly affect their ability to match the press sheet. The results show that either of the two halftone digital proofs could have been used in place of the 3 M Matchprint. The results also question the need for halftone dots in a proof. This is primarily because the two halftone digital proofs utilized a different RIP than the Agfa generated films for the 3 M Matchprint and flexographic press sheet. Yet the visual observations made by the judges could not, at a normal viewing distance, discern this difference. The conclusion is that there is no visual difference between the halftone digital proofs and the 3 M Matchprint proof in terms of visually matching the press sheet...|$|R
40|$|Digital halftones as output on {{plain paper}} {{are the focus}} of this study. A new {{terminology}} is suggested to allow proper description of digital halftones. The most important of these terms is the use of 2 ̆ 2 addressability 2 ̆ 2 to replace the often misused term 2 ̆ 2 resolution. 2 ̆ 2 Also important is {{the use of the term}} 2 ̆ 2 spot 2 ̆ 2 rather than 2 ̆ 2 dot 2 ̆ 2 to describe addressability. A means of properly describing digital halftones is suggested to avoid confusion with analog (ie., conventional photographic) halftones. Halftone patterns were created to test the efficiency of different designs at 300 spot per inch addressability on a laser printer. The page description language PostScript was used to create the halftone patterns which were modeled on three basic designs. It has been established that two halftone dot patterns constructed on the same matrix and containing the same number of spots will produce different densities if the configuration of the spots within the matrix is different This has been tested by comparing the results of the tone production curves of the condensed and open halftone dot designs. These patterns were output on a laser printer and measured for density. Tone production curves were drawn and compared. Even though each matrix contains the same number of spots, it has been shown that different densities result. This is solely a consequence of the dot design. Microscopic studies were conducted to illustrate the nature of the filling-in in the non-image area. Microscopic measurements were also made to ascertain the size of an individual spot at various <b>screen</b> <b>rulings.</b> It was found that the spot, which was very irregular to begin with, actually began to break up as the linescreen approached 150 lines per inch. Paper tests were run to gauge the maximum density and the tone production capabilities of various papers. Although the results were inconclusive, they point out another flaw of digital halftones which are output on plain paper. The number of grays predictable, given a matrix size, is greater than what is achievable in practice. These results mean the following for designers of digital halftones. First, purely due to the nature of digital halftones, the highlight and shadow areas will be most difficult to control. Secondly, use of a screen angle can limit the filling-in in the tone production curve. Thirdly, the variability of the spot size on paper, and its irregularities must be closely observed to assure that these dot forms will be reproducible in the lithographic process if this is desired. And finally, careful planning in the design of a halftone dot may allow an improved tone production curve...|$|R

As the cutoff point used to define an abnormal result is made less extreme, test sensitivity improves and specificity deteriorates. Similarly, if the cutoff point is made more extreme, test sensitivity worsens but specificity improves. • Serial (multiple) tests with results that are all normal tend to rule out dis-ease convincingly, and serial tests with results that are all abnormal tend to confirm disease convincingly. • Unexpectedly abnormal laboratory results that demand prompt evalua-tion or prompt treatment should be repeated for confirmation. Spurious factors and human or equipment error probably account for a higher pro-portion of unexpected significantly abnormal results than do unsuspected disorders. 1...|$|R
40|$|Flexography is a {{printing}} technique {{widely used in}} the packaging production. The main feature of flexography {{is the use of}} {{a printing}} plate elastically deformed during the reproduction process. The printing plate is made of an elastic material, rubber or nowadays of mainly different types of photopolymer. The elasticity of the plate enables the printing {{on a wide range of}} printing substrates, which is one of its advantages compared to other printing techniques. On the other hand, deformations of the printing plate in the printing process caused by the pressure between the printing plate and the substrate present a major limitation of flexography. Apart from the functional properties of the printing plate in the printing process, the plate making process, including photo polymerization, considerably influences the value of halftones on the printing plate, and consequently on the final product. The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> on the formation of printing elements and the adjustment of the printing plate making process in order to achieve optimal quality of the printing plate and, therefore, the final product. The results have shown that the use of different screen rulings is of great significance in the processes of printing plate curve adjustment. It was proven that the use of different <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> has a considerable influence upon relief depth and a cross-section of the printing elements (3 D analysis), which again have a significant impact on the quality of the final product, but cannot be detected in 2 D analysis...|$|E
40|$|If {{practical}} colorants {{could be}} found to meet theoretical requirements {{then there would be}} no need for color correction in multi-color printing. Color correction is necessary because the available yellow, magenta, and cyan inks absorb and transmit {{in all parts of the}} visible spectrum. It is possible to measure how much these colorants deviate from the ideal with the use of a reflection densitometer. The red, green, and blue filter positions on a densitometer will read the cyan, magenta, and yellow densities respectively. From these densities the amount of color correction necessary to compensate for the inks deficiencies is expressed in terms of percent masking. This is usually computed by the formula: percent mask = highest unwanted density/wanted density. The percent mask is often computed from the densities found when measuring a solid area of a particular colorant. The ratio of unwanted densities to wanted densities is often assumed to remain constant for solids and tints. This is the proportionality rule and is assumed to hold true in what are known as the masking equations (which are the basis for photographic masking for color correction.) The problem is that when a graduated scale of a single color is printed from a light tint to a solid, the proportions of the wanted and unwanted densities do not remain the same for varying tint values and solids. This is known as proportionality failure. This paper deals with the statistical evaluation of the three factors (and the interactions between them) which have been suspected of being the primary causes of this phenomenon. The three factors being tested are solid ink density (ink film thickness), type of paper, and half tone <b>screen</b> <b>ruling.</b> The results indicated that <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> was the most important factor for all colors with solid ink density being the next in importance. But the type of paper used was not found to influence proportionality failure, except with magenta ink. This, along with the fact that there was very little proportionality failure in yellow ink, may indicate a certain degree of confusion between proportionality failure and the influence of various factors (including paper) on the 2 ̆ 7 purity 2 ̆ 7 of a color. It was shown in this experiment that the optimum printing levels which produce the least amount of proportionality failure were at the lowest solid ink density practical, the finest <b>screen</b> <b>ruling,</b> and on uncoated paper (yellow notwithstanding since it displayed comparatively no proportionality failure.) The implications of these results indicate that certain modifications in color correction methods may be necessary if printing conditions deviate widely from these optimum levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to measure the amount of image quality loss due to the effect of screening an image with halftone screens. This was done by using screens of different line number and images with differing amounts of image quality. Six black and white continuous tone positive originals were used to scale the image quality. These prints had been produced so as to have equal steps of image quality from the sharpest and ranging to some lower image quality which was at or slightly below a just acceptable level of image quality. Each of these images was then screened by contact screens with rulings of 85, 100, 133, 150, and 200 lines per inch. Each image was viewed by a panel of judges using the method of categories. This was the method by which the relationship between <b>screen</b> <b>ruling</b> number and image quality was determined. The conclusions were that image quality of the original was {{the most important factor in}} the quality reproduction. The relation between input and output image quality was linear in terms of overall image quality of black and white halftone prints. Next important factor in the quality reproduction was the ink density in shadow areas, The 133 line screen prints had better quality than that of the 200 line screen on the average because of this factor. <b>Screen</b> <b>ruling</b> was a minor important factor in the quality reproduction. The screen rulings from 100 to 200 lines per inch did not have so much effect toward image quality. In contrast, the screen rulings below 100 lines per inch made the quality drop noticeably...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic performance of medical {{history in the}} diagnosis of tubal pathology among subfertile patients. Patients and Methods. Prospective cross-sectional study was performed. Prior to tubal evaluation, medical history data were collected. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) for predicting tubal pathology as determined by laparoscopy and dye test were calculated for each issue of medical history. Results. 39. 6 % (59 / 149) were diagnosed with tubal pathology. The sensitivity for the different issues ranged between 1. 7 and 54. 2 % and the specificity between 75. 6 and 97. 8 %. The estimated highest value of positive LR is attributed {{to the history of}} ectopic pregnancy and lowest of negative LR to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and abdominal surgery. Conclusion. The positive history of PID, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), abdominal and laparoscopic surgery, and ectopic pregnancy are satisfactory <b>screening</b> tests for <b>ruling</b> the tubal pathology in. The negative history of evaluated issues is inappropriate for ruling the tubal damage out...|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} in 1994, and released the next year. It won two national awards and multiple international awards {{in the years that}} followed. In 2004, the European DOX magazine listed it as one of the 50 most memorable documentaries of all time. As with previous films produced by Patwardhan, the national television channel Doordarshan initially refused to screen the film. Patwardhan challenged this decision in the Bombay High Court, which ruled in his favor in 2001, ordering Doordarshan to telecast the film. The carrier challenged this decision in the Indian Supreme Court, which ruled in Patwardhan's favor in 2006, ordering that the film be screened without any cuts within eight weeks. The judges observed that [...] "This documentary film ... showcases a real picture of crime and violence against women and members of various religious groups perpetrated by politically motivated leaders for political, social and personal gains." [...] The film was eventually <b>screened</b> following the <b>ruling.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The Composite International Diagnostic Interview- Short Form (CIDI-SF) {{is a short}} disorder-specific {{diagnostic}} {{interview for}} the common mental disorders. Many researchers have been attracted to the CIDI-SF because of its brevity and cost-effectiveness. As a result the CIDI-SF {{has been used in}} multiple epidemiological studies and clinical trials. Despite the widespread use, a search of the literature has revealed relatively few validation studies. This investigation aims to provide estimates of concordance and discordance between the CIDI-SF disorder modules and the full CIDI as well as providing evidence regarding the potential screening utility of the CIDI-SF. Methods: The sample comprised of 83 patients attending a tertiary referral clinic for the anxiety disorders. Patients were administered the CIDI-SF and the full CIDI-Auto and estimates of agreement between the two measures were calculated. Interview transcripts were examined for cases that disagreed on a diagnosis to elicit a likely reason for the lack of agreement between the two measures. Finally, the screening properties of the dimensionally scored CIDI-SF were calculated and compared with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Results: The CIDI-SF tended to over-estimate the rate of diagnoses as evidenced by a high degree of false positives. However, the CIDI-SF exhibited favorable <b>screening</b> properties (<b>ruling</b> out non-disordered cases). Conclusions: These results suggest that caution must be taken when using the CIDI-SF as the sole diagnostic instrument in epidemiological research to estimate prevalence and incidence. The CIDI-SF may be more useful for screening out potential candidates in clinical research and psychopharmacological trials...|$|R
