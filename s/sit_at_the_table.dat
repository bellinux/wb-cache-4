500|$|Bishop's {{undergraduate}} {{work with}} Hickson {{was her first}} major research effort, concerning the reproduction of Spirostomum ambiguum, a large ciliate that {{has been described as}} [...] "wormlike". In 1923, while working at Manchester University, Bishop was appointed an honorary research fellow. In 1924, she became a part-time instructor for the Department of Zoology at Cambridge, one of only two women, both of whom were sometimes marginalised. For example, she was not allowed to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with the men of the department at tea: instead, she sat on a first-aid kit. There, Bishop continued her work with Spirostomum as the only protozoologist on the faculty.|$|E
500|$|Determined {{to improve}} his family's behavior, Homer {{attempts}} {{to get them to}} <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> properly, which goes awry as the family prefers to eat while watching TV. When Marge, Bart and Lisa claim there's nothing wrong with them, he decides to prove to them that there is something wrong. He takes them {{on a tour of the}} neighborhood, peeking through living room windows to observe how happy families spend time together. The rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homer's sudden rash behavior along with unnecessarily spying on their neighbors and retreat quickly back to the safety of their own home. Depressed by the outing, he stops by Moe's Tavern for a drink. After getting into a fight with Barney, Homer later sees a commercial for Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. Dr. Monroe guarantees [...] "family bliss or double your money back." [...] This gives Homer an idea {{to improve his}} family's behavior.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's {{decision}} {{to release the}} album on a Friday {{as opposed to the}} traditional Tuesday to resounding success was also an influencing point in the industry's {{decision to}} change the global release date. As wirrten by Billboard, [...] "After seven months of semi-public back-and-forth, a conversation instigated in part by Aussie piracy and Beyonce's surprise release in December 2013 has resulted in the global recording industry accepting Friday as the release date for new albums. As reported in August, the shift will take place this summer." [...] Time named Beyoncé {{as one of the most}} influential people of 2014 due to the album release and wrote: [...] "Beyoncé doesn't just <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> She builds a better one. Today she sits at the head of the boardroom table at Parkwood Entertainment. In December, she took the world by surprise when she released a new album, complete with videos, and announced it on Facebook and Instagram. Beyoncé shattered music-industry rules – and sales records".|$|E

2500|$|On March 15 and 16, SNCC led {{several hundred}} demonstrators, {{including}} Alabama students, Northern students, and local adults, in protests near the capitol complex. The Montgomery County sheriff's posse met them on horseback and drove them back, whipping them. Against {{the objections of}} James Bevel, some protesters threw bricks and bottles at police. At a mass meeting {{on the night of}} the 16th, Forman “whipped the crowd into a frenzy” demanding that the President act to protect demonstrators, and warned, “If we can’t <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> of democracy, we’ll knock the fucking legs off.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} begins in color, and follows Ichiro Yamaguchi {{as he walks}} along a road at night. He enters a {{building}} where he sees his [...] "past self" [...] in monochrome. Inside the room are multiple versions of Yamaguchi repeating actions on loop, such as throwing an apple, and drinking a coffee. In addition to Yamaguchi, the room depicts a [...] "warped world" [...] of the past, where various items are shown in short reversed animation loops, such as clocks, a coat and an inkwell spilling onto paper where Yamaguchi had written the song's lyrics. In the final scenes, Yamaguchi is joined by {{the other members of}} Sakanaction, who <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and drink coffee in a repeating loop. The final part of the movie shows Yamaguchi exiting the room, once again in color.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} this trend, Raekwon later {{clarified}} [...] "We {{was the first to}} be talking that Cristal shit. I know that for a fact. Back then we would go do dinners and sit with Loud Records president Steve Rifkind and them up at the label. And our mission would be like, when we <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> we want the best fuckin' wine they got in the building. We might have asked for some Mo or something and they didn't have it. So we was like [...] "What the fuck is the next best thing, Steve?" [...] And Steve's like 'Give 'em the next best thing.' They came out with Cristal. Me and Ghost liked the bottle, and the name on the bottle was Louie Roederer. I was like, I'm Lou Diamond, Louie Roederer. Me and Ghost is loving how the bottle looked. It cost more than the muthafuckin' other, so we was like, Cristal, nigga! That's our new shit!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{especially}} celebrated {{aspect of}} the production was the set, designed by John Bury, who used the work of Karl von Appen and Caspar Neher as his primary visual inspiration. Bury constructed the set primarily from plated steel, even the walls and floors were covered in textured metal, giving the entire stage a cold, metallic appearance. At {{the back of the}} stage was a steel trellis and movable walls of triangular shape covered with riveted plates. T.C. Worlsey commented of the set that [...] "we seem to be claustrophobically caught between two swinging metal wings that crush us from one side then from the other." [...] According to Bury, [...] "this was a period of armour and a period of the sword; they were plays about warfare, about power, about danger [...] This was the image of the plays. We wanted an image rather than a naturalistic setting. We were trying to make a world, a dangerous world, a terrible world, in which all these happenings fit." [...] Bury employed the notion of [...] "selective realism"; using one or two realistic props to emphasise the social dimensions of the narrative. In this case, such realism was manifested by a massive oval shaped iron council table which took up {{a large portion of the}} stage - the constantly changing group of figures who <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> visually emphasising the turbulence and political instability of the period. Peter Hall himself wrote of the set, [...] "on the flagged floor of sheet steel tables are daggers, staircases are axe-heads, and doors the traps on scaffolds. Nothing yields: stone walls have lost their seduction and now loom dangerously - steel-clad - to enclose and to imprison. The countryside offers no escape, the danger is still there in the iron foliage of the cruel trees, and, surrounding all, the great steel cage of war." ...|$|E
