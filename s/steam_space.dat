25|$|The {{capacity}} of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser.|$|E
25|$|The first boilers {{suffered}} {{problems with}} the superheaters and with poor circulation for the tube rows in {{the centre of the}} bank, leading to overheating and tube failure. The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the feedwater pipes and by placing baffles inside the steam drum, so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation augmenter, a steel trough, was placed over the tops of the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging steam bubbles to escape and acting as a steam separator before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of top feed for steam locomotives, the feedwater was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> as droplets. The cold feedwater was thus heated to the same temperature as the boiler water before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the circulation path.|$|E

50|$|The kenotometer is a {{particular}} type of hydrostatic gauge, typically used in power plants using steam turbines. The kenotometer measures the vacuum in the <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> of the condenser, that is, the exhaust of the last stage of the turbine.|$|E
50|$|In {{designing}} the boiler, special emphasis {{had been laid}} on a large <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> and a low-lying firebox crown so that banking could be achieved with refilling with water, {{which led to a}} reduction in boiler pressure and a resultant drop in performance.|$|E
50|$|The boiler was {{rivetted}} {{from several}} sections. The outer firebox {{was equipped with}} a semi-circular dome that extended forward over the boiler barrel and acted as a <b>steam</b> collection <b>space.</b> The two spring balance safety valves were located on {{the dome of the}} outer firebox.|$|R

50|$|The boiler was of {{rivetted}} {{construction and}} comprised several sections. The outer firebox was {{topped with a}} semi-circular dome that extended forward over the boiler barrel and acted as a <b>steam</b> collection <b>space.</b> In addition there was a steam dome on the front section of the boiler. The two spring balance safety valves were located on the outer firebox.|$|R
50|$|An {{advantageous}} {{feature of}} the boiler was that the fire-tubes were entirely submerged. Competing vertical boilers of the period had semi-submerged tubes with their upper ends in the <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> above the water level, leading to erosion and rapid tube wear around the level.|$|E
50|$|Most {{designs of}} {{stationary}} boilers did not generally require a steam dome, {{as they were}} built large enough to allow adequate <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> within their main drum. Water-tube designs had a suitable steam drum mounted high above their evaporating surface and this performed a similar function.|$|E
50|$|One {{drawback}} of {{the boiler}} was the large {{diameter of the}} furnace relative to the boiler shell, and thus the small <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> above the crown of the furnace. This made the boilers prone to priming, particularly on a rough sea, where water could be carried over into the steam pipe.|$|E
50|$|The boiler was {{rivetted}} {{from several}} sections. The outer firebox was furnished with a dome that projected {{a long way}} forward over the boiler barrel and acted as the <b>steam</b> collection <b>space.</b> The two spring balance safety valves were located on the outer firebox. Two piston pumps provided boiler feedwater; they were driven via an eccentric cam {{from one of the}} axles.|$|R
50|$|The {{front wall}} of the {{combustion}} chamber is supported against steam pressure by the tubes themselves. The rear face is stayed by rod stays through the rear shell of the boiler. Above the combustion chamber and tubes is an open <b>steam</b> collecting <b>space.</b> Larger long rod stays run {{the length of the}} boiler through this space, supporting the ends of the boiler shell.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{before the}} space {{on one side}} of the piston starts to contract, the valve starts to release <b>steam</b> from that <b>space</b> to the atmosphere, so as not to impede the {{movement}} of the piston.|$|R
50|$|As built, the {{locomotive}} had an open cab {{area with a}} spectacle-type weatherboard as only protection for the crew against the elements. It is not known whether the engine was equipped with an enclosed cab post-delivery. It had a domeless boiler which took steam from the <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> above the firebox, with a sandbox mounted atop the boiler.|$|E
50|$|On this locomotive, the {{arrangement}} of the saddle-tank precluded the use of the usual steam dome on the boiler barrel. Instead, steam for the cylinders was collected by a perforated pipe, fitted to the combined regulator and steam collector box, which was arranged at the highest point in the <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> above the crown of the firebox.|$|E
50|$|The Hunslet Engine Company {{delivered}} three 0-4-0 saddle-tank locomotives to the Eastern System of the Cape Government Railways (CGR) in 1876 and 1877. They {{were similar}} to the 1st Class 0-4-0ST of 1875 in most respects, but instead of domeless boilers which took steam from the <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> above the firebox, they had steam domes with large polished brass covers.|$|E
50|$|The term {{combustion}} chamber {{is also used}} to refer to an additional space between the firebox and boiler in a <b>steam</b> locomotive. This <b>space</b> is used to allow further combustion of the fuel, providing greater heat to the boiler.|$|R
40|$|BWX Technologies, Naval Nuclear Fuel Division (NNFD) is a {{manufacturing}} {{company with a}} steam system consisting of two Babcock & Wilcox boilers and approximately 350 steam traps. The steam system is used to produce and distribute <b>steam</b> for <b>space</b> heating and manufacturing process use. NNFD had made no improvements in its steam generation and distribution system in its over 40 years of existence. In 1996, NNFD embarked on a program to improve boiler combustion controls and replace its steam traps. The Company realized substantial savings in fuel, water, and boiler chemical cost in the following year, as well as, improvements in the reliability of its equipment...|$|R

Furthermore, the response of a thermal system to predicted periodic and transient loads and the resulting interactions between system components may be assessed. A thermal energy system simulation code is utilized and expanded to predict the performance of an industrial Rankine cycle (steam turbine) cogeneration plant having mutually varying electrical, process <b>steam</b> and <b>space</b> heating loads. Results are presented to show the effect of variation in the electricity-to-steam ratio and extraction pressure for process steam requirements on system performance...|$|R
50|$|Maintaining {{a vacuum}} in the Condenser is an {{important}} aspect of the efficient operation of steam turbines. A steam jet ejector or liquid ring vacuum pump is used for this purpose. The typical vacuum maintained in the Condenser <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> at the exhaust of the turbine (also called Condenser Backpressure) is in the range 5 to 15 kPa (absolute), {{depending on the type of}} condenser and the ambient conditions.|$|E
50|$|The rebuild did {{not just}} involve the {{installation}} of a new boiler; the entire locomotive underwent modification. The most obvious external change was the <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> cover running {{the length of the}} boiler barrel and copied from the ÄŒSD Class 477.0, which lent the locomotives a sleek, modern appearance. The large smoke deflectors too were replaced by smaller ones with the upper front corners clipped off at an angle.|$|E
5000|$|Fairbairn's {{innovation}} {{was to use}} three cylindrical {{shells of}} small diameter, stacked vertically. The central drum was a mixed steam and water space with the water level midway through it. A typical size would be 5 or 6 feet in diameter and 20 feet long. A smaller drum above this acted as a <b>steam</b> <b>space,</b> the narrow communicating pipes between them also helping to stop carryover with steam.|$|E
6000|$|... "The secondary, or the {{terrestrial}} consequences, were as follows:--By the suddenness and force with which so much <b>steam</b> rushed into <b>space,</b> finding its outlet several {{degrees from the}} pole, the earth was canted from its perpendicular attitude, and remained fixed, with its axis having an inclination of 23 degrees 27' to the plane of its orbit.

40|$|A {{suite of}} one- and {{two-dimensional}} solid-state NMR methods {{was used to}} follow the complex structural changes in different types of phosphorus species in P-ZSM- 5 zeolites that were generated upon treatment of H-ZSM 5 zeolites with 0 - 15 % P 2 O 5, followed by calcination or calcination and <b>steaming.</b> Through <b>space</b> and through bond 27 Al- 31 P correlations {{were used for the}} first time to study the interaction of phosphorus with the aluminum species. Homogeneous impregnation of phosphorus inside the zeolite channels was obsd. even at low concns. In the calcined samples, the 31 P resonances were assigned mainly to orthophosphates, short chain polyphosphates and condensed phosphates. These species were converted into various types of aluminum phosphates with steaming and with the increase in P content. The mechanisms of formation of phosphates and aluminum phosphates are proposed...|$|R
30|$|Injecting <b>steam</b> {{into the}} <b>space</b> between the tubing and the casing is another heating {{technique}} used {{to dissolve the}} paraffinic waxes. The steam should be applied to a depth below the lowest point of accumulation, to heat the crude oil between 55 and 65 Â Â°C. Moreover, the amount of heat and the duration required will depend upon the well conditions and this can only be determined by testing in site. Nevertheless, {{it is common to}} leave the steam produce effect for 3 â€“ 6 Â h.|$|R
50|$|The {{boiler barrel}} was {{built up in}} three rings, {{arranged}} telescopically, with the smallest diameter at the firebox end. The rings were lap-jointed and double riveted on longitudinal seams. These boilers had a long life and required little expense in repairs. Five cross-stays were fitted in the <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> above the firebox. The safety valves were arranged above the firebox inside the cab, while a steam escape pipe was fitted above the valves and passed through the roof.|$|E
50|$|Fairbairn's {{work had}} shown the {{benefits}} of reducing the diameter of a boiler's external shell {{as a means of}} reducing the forces upon it. The overall vertical height of the boiler could not be reduced, as this represented the clear <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> above the water level which is important to avoid the risk of priming. Oval boilers had already been tried to achieve this vertical extension, but pressure within them tended to force them into a more cylindrical shape; repeated cycling like this led to increased corrosion along the riveted joints and fatigue failures.|$|E
50|$|In 1840, Stephenson {{produced}} their 2-2-2 design which {{avoided the}} dome altogether, {{in favour of}} a raised firebox in the Bury style of ten years earlier. Boiler power had increased considerably over the decade, now requiring a larger fire grate area. The inner and outer fireboxes were square in plan, with flat sides that required staying. At the top these four sides were vaulted inwards to a point, having a profile approximating a then-fashionable Gothic arch. These provided a large <b>steam</b> <b>space</b> above the waterline, but their flat surfaces limited working pressure.|$|E
50|$|A steam {{clock is}} a clock which is fully or {{partially}} {{powered by a}} steam engine.

While her representation of the figure is often almost perfectly photographic in its depiction, she blurs and fuses layers of space to create immersive abstraction that feels uniquely intimate and provocative; she often includes the use of glass, clear vinyl, water, <b>steam,</b> and shallow <b>spaces</b> to distinguish a nearly invisible line between the foreground and backgrounds of her pieces. Monksâ€™ most famous pieces come from her decade long water series, where the aforementioned elements are the most prevalent and recognizable.|$|R
40|$|Waste heat boilers or Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) as {{they are}} often called are used to recover energy from waste gas streams in {{chemical}} plants, refineries, kilns, incineration systems and cogeneration and combined cycle plants, to mention a few applications.
