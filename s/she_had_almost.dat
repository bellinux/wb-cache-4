5|$|Dresden saw {{action in}} the Battle of Coronel in November, where she engaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December, where {{she was the only}} German warship to escape destruction. She eluded her British pursuers for several more months, until she put into Robinson Crusoe Island in March 1915. Her engines were worn out and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> no coal left for her boilers, so the ship's captain {{contacted}} the local Chilean authorities to have Dresden interned. She was trapped by British cruisers, including her old opponent Glasgow. The British violated Chilean neutrality and opened fire on the ship in the Battle of Más a Tierra. The Germans scuttled Dresden and the majority of the crew escaped to be interned in Chile {{for the duration of the}} war. The wreck remains in the harbor; several artifacts, including her bell and compass, have been returned to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's {{father taught}} her to play the piano, which she {{mastered}} well {{enough for him to}} believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> ceased contact with her family.|$|E

5|$|Torres, {{who was in}} a coma {{the entire}} time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> died from the {{accident}} in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her near-death experience, but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain Kathryn Janeway permits Torres to put herself in an induced coma, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether or not she has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on Sto-vo-kor (a version of the afterlife similar to the Norse Valhalla) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that Voyager is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} {{living with the}} Riglers, Genie's {{behavior}} and social skills improved {{to the point that}} she started going to first a nursery school and then a public school for mentally retarded children her age. The Riglers also taught her some basic self-help skills, including simple chores such as ironing, using a sewing machine, and preparing simple meals for herself. She made substantial progress with controlling herself both at home and in public, and although it was extremely hard to prevent her socially inappropriate masturbation <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> entirely ceased it by the end of her stay. In February 1973 Curtiss recorded the first time Genie shared something with her, and while she continued to take things from other people her responses clearly indicated that she knew she was not supposed to.|$|E

She began the performance walking out in a white silk robe, {{standing in front of}} a backdrop of electric blue screens. She descenced into the aisle and took off the robe to reveal the bodysuit. After being lifted from the tank of water, Pink kept twirling and spreading water into all directions, before finally descending to the main stage. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation. The performance was deemed by various media outlets as the best of the ceremony. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday commented, [...] "With her stunning Grammy performance of 'Glitter in the Air,' Pink proved that you don’t have to be shocking or over-the-top to be the best or the most-talked-about. You just have to be amazing." [...] It was also voted on a readers' poll in MTV.com as the best performance of the night. Staff reporter Kyle Anderson said [...] "It's easy to see why, as her acrobatic performance of 'Glitter in the Air' was not only visually gorgeous, but also technically impressive — she was able to keep singing even as she was spinning around in the air". Pink later explained <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> fallen during the song, saying, [...] "When I do it on tour, I don't have lights above me. There were lights above me, so it almost went into a strobe thing, and I actually did get a little turned around. I thought... I was going to fall on my nude butt. But I worked it out." [...] In 2013, Brad Wete for Billboard ranked the performance as the best performance at the Grammy Awards from 2000 to 2012, commenting it [...] "graceful, show-stopping performance of aerial, acrobatic and vocal brilliance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around this time, Alice {{caused a}} new {{sensation}} {{when it was}} revealed she had resumed her love affair with de Trafford, the man <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> killed. A rumor that the couple would soon have a quiet wedding in Paris was first circulated in May 1927, then in September of that same year and later in January 1928. Alice's lawyer denied any such plans, and no wedding took place. The rumor surfaced again in April 1930. Ultimately, the couple married on 22 February 1932 in Neuilly-sur-Seine and spoke of buying a house in London. Alice commented on her affair with de Trafford: [...] "We were deeply in love. It was arranged that we should marry"., {{although it has been}} suggested that Alice literally pursued de Trafford for three years before she finally got him to marry her.|$|E
