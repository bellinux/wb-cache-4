25|$|Long {{before the}} No. 4 Mk I, Britain had {{obviously}} {{settled on the}} rear aperture sight prior to WWI, with modifications to the SMLE being tested as early as 1911, as well as later on the No. 1 Mk III pattern rifle. These unusual rifles have something of a mysterious service history, but represent a missing link in SMLE development. The primary distinguishing feature of the No. 1 Mk V is the rear aperture sight. Like the No. 1 Mk III* it lacked a volley sight and had the wire loop {{in place of the}} <b>sling</b> <b>swivel</b> at the front of magazine well along with the simplified cocking piece. The Mk V did retain a magazine cut-off, but without a spotting hole, the piling swivel was kept attached to a forward barrel band, which was wrapped over and attached {{to the rear of the}} nose cap to reinforce the rifle for use with the standard Pattern 1907 bayonet. Other distinctive features include a nose cap screw was slotted for the width of a coin for easy removal, a safety lever on the left side of the receiver was slightly modified with a unique angular groove pattern, and the two-piece hand guard being extended from the nose cap to the receiver, omitting the barrel mounted leaf sight. No. 1 Mk V rifles were manufactured solely by R.S.A.F. Enfield from 1922–1924, with a total production of roughly 20,000 rifles, all of which marked with a “V”.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, Stevens began {{producing}} {{both the}} Model 520A (renamed the Model 520-30) and the Model 620A (labeled as the Model 620) as trench guns, riot guns, and long-barreled training guns for the US military. [...] Trench guns were produced with 20 inch barrels (cylinder bore) {{and had a}} heat shield with a unique pinkish anodized bayonet lug attached {{to the front of}} the barrel (late war examples had a small [...] "S" [...] stamped on the left side). [...] The receivers of both models were stamped on the left side (from front to back) with a small [...] "P" [...] and ordnance bomb, [...] "Model 520-30" [...] or [...] "Model 620", and a small [...] "U.S." [...] over the trigger. [...] Model 520-30 trench gun barrels are marked [...] "Proof Tested--12 Gauge --2 3/4 Inch Chamber--" [...] on the left side and have another small [...] "P" [...] and ordnance bomb and the [...] "J Stevens Arms Company" [...] address on the right side of the barrel. [...] This was done so that all the markings could be read with the heat shield installed. [...] Some Model 620 trench gun barrels were marked in the same manner as the Model 520-30 trench guns and some had all the barrel markings on the left side. [...] Trench guns were also fitted with a <b>sling</b> <b>swivel</b> in the stock. [...] Riot guns also had 20 inch barrels (cylinder bore) and had all the same martial markings, except that all the barrel markings were on the left side. [...] The long barreled training guns were marked in the same manner as riot guns and were mainly used for aerial gunnery training. [...] Total wartime production of all Model 520-30 shotguns was 33,306 and all Model 620 shotguns was 12,174. [...] After the war the US military standardized both the Model 520-30 and the Model 620 and kept them in the inventory. [...] They were used in the Korean War and as late as the Vietnam War.|$|E
60|$|Then {{there was}} another space of waiting before the dust that had {{commenced}} to sift down grew thicker again {{as the head of}} the company swung round the bend. They were also marching easily with gaps between the files, and the jingle of <b>sling,</b> <b>swivel,</b> scabbard, and canteen rang through their trampling, while the rifles twinkled as the fours swung across the breadths of moonlight between the shadows of the palms. They were young men, most of them, and some little more than boys; while here and there one or two, still unprovided with tropical outfit, wore the kepi and the cazadores, green; but Appleby had seen the men of the Peninsula fight before, and checked a groan. He was one of the Sin Verguenza, and knew what awaited him if Morales was successful, but the work on hand seemed horrible to him just then.|$|E
