The body for this model is very well finished and proportioned, but thickly molded {{and not at all}} delicate (a contrast to the thin light skin of the real car!). The 'Birdcage' tubing protruded (like the real car) back into the cockpit and the seats were simply pressed into place on plastic pegs on the chassis. Realistic side pipes on the passenger <b>side,</b> <b>roll</b> bar, and gas cap adorn the body. Headlights were mercifully made of clear plastic, so they have a very authentic look (no 'jewels' here). Some of the body vent detail is done with decals and could look better. The tires on earlier models were nicely made out of rubber and the 'wire' wheels had deeper shaded indentations around the wires that was satisfying.|$|E
40|$|A {{square steel}} pipe is {{reshaped}} from a welded round pipe by roll forming. The effect of ellipse preforming on the cross-sectional {{size of the}} square steel pipe was investigated by experiment and three-dimensional finite element simulation. When designing a roll-forming machine for a square steel pipe, {{the diameter of the}} paired top and bottom rolls is usually set larger than that of the <b>side</b> <b>roll</b> pair, thereby avoiding interference between the roll axes driven by electric motors. When the diameter of the top roll is larger than that of the <b>side</b> <b>roll,</b> the width of a corner part of the formed pipe is larger than the height. A square pipe was formed from a preformed elliptical pipe to make the width and height of the corner part equal. As a result of ellipse preforming, the peripheral length of a square product increases {{and the size of the}} corner part of that product decreases. Therefore, elliptical preforming is effective in forming square pipe with a sharp corner. However, excessive preforming causes a hollow at the flat surface of a square product.

40|$|This {{research}} initiates a {{study of}} the mechanics of four roll plate bending and provides a methodology to investigate the process experimentally. To carry out the research a suitable model bender was designed and constructed. The model bender was comprehensively instrumented with ten load cells, three torquemeters and a tachometer. A rudimentary analysis of the four roll pre-bending mode considered the three critical bending operations. The analysis also gave an assessment of the model bender capacity for the design stage. The analysis indicated that an increase in the coefficient of friction in the contact region of the pinch rolls and the plate would reduce the pinch resultant force required to end a plate to a particular bend radius. The mechanisms involved in the four roll plate bending process were investigated and a mathematical model evolved to determine the mechanics of four roll thin plate bending. A theoretical and experimental investigation was conducted for the bending of HP 30 aluminium plates in both single and multipass bending modes. The study indicated that the multipass plate bending mechanics of the process varied according to the number of bending passes executed and the step decrement of the anticipated finished bend radius in any two successive passes (i. e. the bending route). Experimental results for single pass bending indicated that the rollers normally exert a higher bending load for the steady-continous bending with the pre-inactive <b>side</b> <b>roll</b> oper?tive. For the pre-bending mode and the steady-continous bending mode with the pre-active <b>side</b> <b>roll</b> operative, the former exerted the higher loads. The single pass results also indicated that the force on the <b>side</b> <b>roll,</b> the torque and power steadily increased as the anticipated bend radius decreased. Theoretical predictions for the plate internal resistance to accomplish finished bend radii of between 2500 mm and 500 mm for multipass bending HP 30 aluminium plates, suggested that there was a certain bending route which would effectively optimise the bender capacity...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A cross {{sectional}} study {{conducted during the}} annual festival at Nallur temple in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, in 2010, showed that the prevalence of cutaneous larva migrants (CLM) among the devotees who performed the <b>side</b> <b>roll</b> ritual was 58. 2 % (95 %CI: 51. 2 %- 65. 0 %). OBJECTIVE: To test {{the hypothesis that the}} deworming stray dogs around the temple premises effectively reduces the prevalence of CLM among devotees. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All stray dogs (8) {{in the vicinity of the}} temple were treated, with mebendazole (100 mg) crushed and filled into sausages, 10 days before the commencement of festival in 2011. The same procedure was repeated a week later to ensure complete coverage. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 systematically selected devotees in August 2011 using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and the clinical examination of the skin. Baermann's technique was used for the recovery of nematode larvae from 40 soil samples collected from the temple premises. Ten samples of dog faeces collected from the same premises were also examined for nematode eggs. Prevalence of CLM among devotees in 2010 (Pre intervention) and 2011 (Post intervention) were compared to test the hypothesis. Prevalence of CLM declined from 58 % to 8 % (Chi-square = 112. 90, p< 0. 001) following the intervention. None of the subjects practiced new precautionary measures compared to the previous year. Soil and fecal samples were negative for parasites. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Regular dog deworming is an important and effective method for the prevention of CLM among the devotees doing <b>side</b> <b>roll</b> ritual and represents a pragmatic intervention that municipal authorities could perform on annual basis...|$|E
