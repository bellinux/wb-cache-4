Converting the {{viscosity}} of an incompressible nonlinear {{viscous fluid}} to the proportional constant {{of the flow}} rule of Mises material, the melt, the mushy state, and the solidified in twin-roll casting were able {{to be regarded as}} an incompressible nonlinear thermo-viscous material.

40|$|International audienceAmongst many {{processes}} existing {{today for}} the assembly of two cylindrical parts, the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>fit</b> is commonly used. However, in the calculation methods, the contact surfaces {{are assumed to be}} perfect. Therefore, in order to apply these, the standards necessitate very small geometrical tolerances. The objective of the present paper is to show {{that it is possible to}} take into account form defects by closely conformed contact modelling and to have a good representation of reality: form defects always exist to an increasing extent and are inherent in all kinds of manufacturing processes. Finally, it is shown that the presence of defects can be beneficial, allowing optimization from both a mechanical and an economical point of view...|$|E
40|$|Detecting faults in a {{propulsion}} system in time can make great savings in maintenance and in avoiding succession errors. The object of this thesis is {{to design a}} fault detection system for three typical errors occurring with a squirrel cage induction motor. The errors in question are phase-shifted motors, motors with broken <b>shrinkage</b> <b>fits</b> and motors with a locked rotor. Appropriate methods were initially evaluated theoretically in open loop. Simulations extended the theory to include closed loop. A real-time simulation environment was then used to verify the method of choice. Finally the algorithm was verified in an experimental set-up. The resulting algorithm {{of the study is}} based on the estimation error of the stator current. Lab verifications show that with slight modifications the algorithm should work for all three faults in question. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

The HAM membrane (1  cm 2, in distilled water) {{was placed on}} the wet surface (distilled water) of micro slide and the temperature of the slide was raised slowly (1  °C/min).

40|$|Attribute non-attendance in choice {{experiments}} affects WTP {{estimates and}} therefore {{the validity of the}} method. A recent strand of literature uses attenuated estimates of marginal utilities of ignored attributes. Following this approach, we propose a generalisation of the mixed logit model whereby the distribution of marginal utility coefficients of a stated non-attender has a potentially lower mean and lower variance than those of a stated attender. Model comparison shows that our <b>shrinkage</b> approach <b>fits</b> the data better and produces more reliable WTP estimates. We further find that while reliability of stated attribute non-attendance increases in successive choice experiments, it does not increase when respondents report having ignored the same attribute twice...|$|R
40|$|The {{assembly}} of the existing components, which are built of several adjacent components (wheel, hub, bearings, bolts etc.), can change greatly the properties, above all due {{to the influence of}} neighbouring components with differing levels of rigidity, changing pre-tension ratios of the bolt and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>fit</b> connections, different thicknesses of the layers of paint and different temperatures. The complex, coincidental, multi-axial loads negatively affect the durability, which can lead to various failure mechanisms. With the help of standardised, accelerated load programmes and incorporating special event loads, the experimental simulation in 2 and 4 axial wheel-hub test rigs (Biaxial Wheel Test Rig) is performed in order to find an optimum solution in the early development phases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For buliding the mathmatical {{model of}} elastic {{deformation}} for rolls {{system with a}} composite back-up roll assemblled by the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>fit,</b> the roll sleeve and roll mandrel was studied individually, the bending force was acted on the working roll and the load acted on the contact zone was discreted segment by segment, then the deflection model of the working roll and the roll sleeve and roll mandrel was put forward based on the influence function method. According to the force equilibrim function and the deformation compatibility function between the roll sleeve, the roll mandrel and working roll, the solution matrix was listed and the solving programe was compiled to solve the deflection of working roll and composite back-up roll, the pressure between the working roll and the roll sleeve and the cross-section thickness of rolled strip. Therefore, {{it is an important}} theoretical foundation to improve the manufacturing technology and practical application of the composite back-up roll. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceToday, {{manufacturing}} products must meet {{more and more}} severe specifications. The different parts composing the product often necessitate high dimensional precision, which increases the difficulties for a large series production. Then it it necessary to optimize dimensioning of the different components in an economic context. In the case of small dimensional fits, there is an influence of the micro-geometry (form of defect, roughness) and time of the process on the geometrical characteristics of the assembly. At the time of conception, {{it is necessary to}} obtain a good specification that relates the product functionalities with the best cost. The objective study of this is to simulate a <b>shrinkage</b> <b>fit</b> process and provide the fit characteristics according to the microgeometrical defects. Only the form of the defects are taken into account. In the first part, a method a solution of a three dimensional contact involving two cylindrical bodies is presented. The contact is closely conformed (non-Hertzian). The stress field and the strain field, in both bodies, are calculated with the hypothesis that the interface pressure is a sum of different concentrated loads superposing and depending locally on the defects after rendering the contact area discrete. The different basis loads are formulated by Fourier series and modified Bessel functions. Several cases are simualated for different types of defects that can show the influence of the microgeometry on the cylindrical characteristics fit. Finally, an experiment is presented which shows a good correspondence with theory and predicts the extract strength. ...|$|E
40|$|Variable {{selection}} for structured covariates lying on an underlying known graph {{is a problem}} motivated by practical applications, {{and has been a}} topic of increasing interest. However, most of the existing methods may not be scalable to high dimensional settings involving tens of thousands of variables lying on known pathways such as the case in genomics studies. We propose an adaptive Bayesian shrinkage approach which incorporates prior network information by smoothing the shrinkage parameters for connected variables in the graph, so that the corresponding coefficients have a similar degree of <b>shrinkage.</b> We <b>fit</b> our model via a computationally efficient expectation maximization algorithm which scalable to high dimensional settings (p~ 100, 000). Theoretical properties for fixed as well as increasing dimensions are established, even when the number of variables increases faster than the sample size. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in terms of variable selection, prediction, and computational scalability via a simulation study, and apply the method to a cancer genomics study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} obtain {{shrinkage}} and creep of HPC used in Sutong continuous rigid-frame bridge, shrinkage and creep of plain concrete and RC are investigated under natural environment over two years. Reinforcement ratio 0. 76 % is close {{to that of the}} middle span. Loading stress of creep test is about 15 MPa, which is near the maximum stress of the bridge. Four loading ages, 7 d, 14 d, 21 d and 28 d, were used to simulate different loading ages in construction. The curves of creep and <b>shrinkage</b> were <b>fitted</b> from test values. The results show the test values of creep and shrinkage were less than the current Chinese bridge code JTG D 62 - 2004, and the creep and shrinkage of RC is less than plain concrete. If the reinforcement ratio is low, reinforcement exerts less influence on creep and shrinkage, and the influence of reinforcement can be neglected in engineering application. Reinforcement can effectively reduce creep and shrinkage if the reinforcement ratio is high. 1...|$|R
40|$|Description Shrinkage of {{regression}} coefficients in prognostic models {{is required to}} correct the optimism in such a model caused by variable selection. While global shrinkage modifies all {{regression coefficients}} by the same factor, parameterwise shrinkage factors differ between regression coefficients, their values depending on each variable’s prognostic relevance. With highly correlated or semantically related variables, such as several columns of a design matrix describing a non-linear effect, a compromise between global, and parameterwise shrinkage, termed ’joint shrinkage’, is a useful extension. A computational shortcut to resampling-based shrinkage factor estimation based on DFBETA residuals is applied.

40|$|Measuring and {{modelling}} {{the soil}} shrinkage curve (ShC) has generated increased interest, but uncertainty in shrinkage curve parameters {{has not been}} documented, {{and the most recent}} models have not been compared. This study was performed on 11 core samples collected in the same horizon of a vertisol. The objectives of the study were to (i) characterize the anisotropy of soil samples shrinkage by comparison of vertical, horizontal and volume shrinkage, (ii) analyse the impact of <b>shrinkage</b> anisotropy on <b>fitted</b> <b>shrinkage</b> parameters, (iii) determine uncertainty in shrinkage parameters, and (iv) compare the plasma pore volume as modelled by the clay-paste model (CP) to the plasma pore volume as estimated with the soil shrinkage XP model. The coefficients of variation of the different ShC parameters were smaller than 12 % and 3 % for water contents and volumes, respectively. Crackin led us to exclude some vertical ShC for XP model fitting, as the ShC departed strongly from the S-Shape model. The vertical geometry factor was smaller than 3 and the horizontal geometry factor was larger than 3 in average. The geometry factor values were changing with water content; they deviated widely from 3 at water saturation, but remained constant and close to 3 in between air entry (AE) and maximum swelling (MS). Cracking and anisotropy had no impact on the XP <b>fitted</b> <b>shrinkage</b> parameters. They were not significantly different between one-dimensional (1 -D) and volume measurements. The results of our study suggest that parameters from 1 -D shrinkage might be adequate to describe three-dimensional shrinkage. The XP plasma pore volumes at shrinkage limit (SL) were in the range of mercury porosimetry values, the average fitted plasma volume was only 1. 7 % larger than the median measured value. Direct calibration of CP model from independently measured parameters gave water contents at SL and AE one order of magnitude smaller and two times larger than the fitted values, respectively. But when the AE point water content was set equal in the CP and the XP model, the two modelled plasma ShC were almost identical, with differences depending only on the small difference between fitted and measured plasma volume at SL. Thus, the CP model could be used instead of XP-plasma model to describe the plasma ShC, provided that AE points were identical. This is, however, contradictory with the proposed independent calibration method. The present results are encouraging regarding ShC determination and the comparability of shrinkage modelling approaches. Further comparison of the models requires additional experimental information on the soil plasma shrinkage, especially on MS point...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} hot-air drying (50, 60 °C) on the physical properties of cylindrical eggplant samples. Drying kinetics, water profiles along longitudinal and transversal sample sections through nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and volumetric shrinkage were determined. During the drying process at 50 °C, the volume of removed water was found lower than the reduction in sample volume, while at 60 °C it was higher. MRI showed that the water migration mainly occurs transversally than longitudinally. The curves of mass water loss obtained by both the standard weighting method and MRI showed conformity. Experimental data of moisture ratio and of <b>shrinkage</b> volume were <b>fitted</b> using empirical models available in the literature. This preliminary study showed that the nondestructive MRI technique offers the possibility to study water distribution in food during drying processes. The quantitative moisture distribution maps allow future development and verification of models for prediction of mass transport phenomena in foods during drying. © 2014 Institute of Food Science and Technology...|$|R
40|$|A large {{series of}} dala on carefu/ly COnlrolled {{shrinkage}} tests of con-crete involving groups {{of large numbers}} of identical specimens is re-porttd. The data are used to compare existing shrinkage formulas in ACI, CEB-FIP, and BP models. By far the besl agreement is ob-tained for the BP model. Assuming that only the measured data for a certain initial period are known, predictions are made for long times and are compared with the subsequently observed shrinkage strains. In this manner, various possible statisllca / regression modeis are ex-amined and compared. Best predictions are obtained when the <b>shrinkage</b> formula is <b>fitted</b> to lest data using nonlinear optimi;,ation, then linear regression in transformed variables is used to obtain the confidence limits for long-time predictions. It is concluded that good long-time predictions of shrinkage can be obtained on the basis of shrinkage lest results on 80 mm diameter cylinders for a 3 -week duration. These predictions involve only the intrinsic uncertainty of the material, on which the uncertainly due to random enVironment, curing history, and differences in concrete composition must be superimposed for practical application...|$|R
40|$|Dimensional instability, more {{particularly}} its component hygroexpansivity, may cause problems in process or end-use {{situations in which}} paper or board is in contact with water or subject to changes in ambient relative humidity. Misregistration in printing, curl during copying and calender wrinkles are examples of such defects. In this paper, the in-plane hygroexpansivity of oriented laboratory sheets with different pulps and dried both freely and under restraint is studied. A linear relationship between the drying shrinkage and hygroexpansion coefficient of freely dried laboratory sheets having different fiber orientation anisotropies, was observed. Regardless of both the measurement direction (MD or CD) and the drying options (freely or restraint) all hygroexpansion coefficient values of each pulp type fell quite well on one single power curve {{as a function of}} the elastic modulus. Fiber orientation is considered via two different approaches: using fiber orientation anisotropy and using directional variable named as anisotropy index. When the anisotropy index is used, the MD and CD hygroexpansivity or the MD and CD drying <b>shrinkage</b> can be <b>fit</b> on a single curve, while the freely dried and restraint-dried sheets evidently need two different fitting curves. Between the hygroexpansion coefficient and the anisotropy index, a simple power law relationship, with two fitting parameters depending on pulp and drying restraints, is introduced...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{need for}} a {{conceptual}} and analytical model to describe and interpret the common shrinkage curves of structured soil samples. In this work, we propose a new device for direct shrinkage measurements of unconfined structured soil samples and discuss the relevance of parametric models of the <b>shrinkage</b> curve to <b>fit</b> the experimental data. The experimental procedure consists of simultaneous and continuous measurements of the diameter, height, and weight of an initially saturated soil sample as it dries. The shrinkage measurement can be completed for the full moisture range in a short time (2 - 3 d), and all shrinkage phases can be established easily and accurately identified. The points of transition between the different shrinkage zones of the shrinkage curve are considered as characteristics of the shrinkage process. They are used as parameters to model the experimental shrinkage curves by linear shrinkage zones separated by curvilinear transition ones. The efficiency of two parametric models to fit the experimental data and to provide the characteristic points of the curve are compared and discussed. A new procedure for fitting the shrinkage curves of structured soil samples and for determining the best position of the characteristic points on the curves is proposed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent studies {{underlined}} {{the likeness}} of soil water retention (WRC) and shrinkage curves (ShC) {{with respect to their}} shapes. This paper aims at experimentally discussing the possible use of the same equations to fit them. The WRC (on the tensiometric range) and ShC were simultaneously determined on a series made of 28 undisturbed soil cores collected in surface horizons {{from a wide variety of}} soil types, with clay content ranging from 8. 5 to 65 % and of 30 repacked soil samples of various clay contents and mineralogies. The van Genuchten (VG) closed-form equation of WRC and the VG modified equation of ShC, with five and three parameters, respectively, were found to fit well to both curves, but they did not properly reproduce the observed linear parts and sloping ends of both curves, and the dissymmetric shapes of the ShC as well. The exponential <b>shrinkage</b> model XP <b>fitted</b> significantly better to both the WRC with five parameters and the ShC with eight parameters. It is shown that the transition points of the XP equations independently fitted on the ShC and WRC curves occur at the same gravimetric water content, thus illustrating {{the likeness of}} the curves with respect to their shape. The WRC was estimated with a reasonable accuracy from the water content of the ShC transition points plus some measured suction values...|$|R
