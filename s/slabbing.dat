40|$|Flat <b>slab</b> – column {{connection}} {{has received}} much attention {{in recent years}} due to its simplicity of construction where beam {{is not required to}} support the <b>slab.</b> Flat <b>slab</b> has many usages in the construction field and has been investigated as a potential building material.

60|$|This, at all events--I {{thought is}} as far as I dare go in {{defining}} what Art is. But let me try to make plain to myself what is the essential quality that gives to Art the power of exciting this unconscious vibration, this impersonal emotion. It has been called Beauty! An awkward word--a perpetual begging of the question; too current in use, too ambiguous altogether; now too narrow, now too wide--a word, in fact, too glib to know at all what it means. And how dangerous a word--often misleading us into <b>slabbing</b> with extraneous floridities what would otherwise, on its own plane, be Art! To be decorative where decoration is not suitable, to be lyrical where lyricism is out of place, is assuredly to spoil Art, not to achieve it. But this essential quality of Art has also, and more happily, been called Rhythm. And, what is Rhythm if not that mysterious harmony between part and part, and part and whole, which gives what is called life; that exact proportion, the mystery of which is best grasped in observing how life leaves an animate creature when the essential relation of part to whole has been sufficiently disturbed. And I agree that this rhythmic relation of part to part, and part to whole--in short, vitality--is the one quality inseparable from a work of Art. For nothing which does not seem to a man possessed of this rhythmic vitality, can ever steal him out of himself.|$|E

Recently, {{various types of}} <b>slab</b> systems which can reduce self-weight of <b>slabs</b> have been studied as {{the height and width}} of building structures rapidly increase.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} reinforcement ductility on the strength and ductility of reinforced concrete <b>slabs.</b> An extensive experimental program examining the ultimate strength, ductility and failure mode of one-way and two-way reinforced concrete <b>slabs</b> is described {{and the results are}} presented and analysed. A numerical finite element model is developed and calibrated using the experimental data. The model is described and shown to accurately simulate the collapse load behaviour of reinforced concrete <b>slabs</b> containing reinforcement of any ductility class, including Class L welded wire fabric. Parametric studies using the numerical model to assess the effects of reinforcement ductility on structural behaviour are also presented and recommendations are made on the minimum reinforcement ductility levels appropriate for use in suspended <b>slabs.</b> The experimental and numerical tests investigated <b>slabs</b> with different types of boundary conditions (simply supported and continuous one-way <b>slabs,</b> corner-supported single panel two <b>slabs</b> and edge-supported two-way <b>slabs),</b> support settlement, steel reinforcement ratio, steel uniform elongation (&# 61541;su), steel ultimate to yield stress ratio (fsu/fsy) and rectangularity aspect ratio in the two-way <b>slabs.</b> In total, thirty one <b>slabs</b> were tested. The one-way <b>slabs</b> included four simply supported <b>slabs,</b> seven continuous <b>slabs,</b> and five continuous <b>slabs</b> with support settlement. The two-way <b>slabs</b> included eleven square and rectangular corner-supported <b>slabs</b> and four rectangular edge-supported <b>slabs.</b> The one-way simply-supported <b>slabs</b> were 850 mm in width, 100 mm in depth and 2, 500 mm in length.

40|$|Conditions and {{dynamics}} of subduction-collision and subsequent 3 -D <b>slab</b> break-off and <b>slab</b> tear propagation are quantified, {{for the first}} time, using fully dynamic numerical models. Model results indicate that collision after the subduction of old, strong subducting oceanic <b>slab</b> leads to <b>slab</b> break-off at 20 – 25 Myr after the onset of continental collision, and subsequently a <b>slab</b> tear migrates more or less horizontally through the <b>slab</b> with a propagation speed of 100 – 150 mm/yr. In contrast, young, weak oceanic <b>slabs</b> show the first break-off already 10 Myr after continental collision, and can experience tear migration rates up to 800 mm/yr. <b>Slab</b> strength plays a more {{important role in the}} timing of <b>slab</b> break-off and the speed of a propagating <b>slab</b> tear than (negative) <b>slab</b> buoyancy does. <b>Slab</b> break-off is viable even for <b>slabs</b> that are supported by the viscosity jump and phase change between the upper and lower mantle. The density of the oceanic <b>slab</b> and the subducting continental block is important for the amount of continental subduction and the depth of <b>slab</b> break-off. A 40 -km thick continental crust can be buried to depths greater than 200 km, although this maximum depth is significantly less for younger or very weak <b>slabs,</b> or thicker continental crust. <b>Slab</b> break-off typically starts at a depth of 300 km, mostly independent of mantle rheology, but, like continental crustal burial, can be shallower for young or buoyant plates. Our 3 -D models illustrate how, due to the difference in necking in 2 -D and 3 -D, break-off has an intrinsic small preference to start as a <b>slab</b> window within the <b>slab's</b> interior, rather than as a <b>slab</b> tear at the <b>slab</b> edge. However, any significant asymmetry in the collision setting, e. g. earlier collision {{at one end of the}} subduction zone, would override this, and leads to <b>slab</b> tearing starting near one edge of the <b>slab.</b> These results put important new constraints on the dynamics of the collision and subsequent <b>slab</b> break-off for modern collision belts. For a proposed timing of the initial Arabia–Eurasia collision at 35 Ma, break-off of the 200 -Myr-old Neo-Tethys <b>slab</b> is unlikely to have occurred before 15 – 10 Ma. Furthermore, our results illustrate that shallow, early break-off of weak <b>slabs</b> provides a viable explanation for the absence of blueschists and ultra-high pressure metamorphism in the Precambrian geological record...|$|R

25|$|Interactions {{with the}} mantle {{discontinuities}} {{play a significant}} role in <b>slab</b> rollback.

30|$|This {{indicates}} that the temperature differentials of the ICC <b>slab</b> are {{higher than that of}} the standard mix <b>slab.</b> It can be explained that the addition of LWA as an internal curing agent increase the degree of hydration which results in a more dense microstructure and the more dense microstructure results in a decrease in the thermal conductivity of the concrete (Schlitter et al. 2010). This low thermal conductivity of the ICC <b>slab</b> prevents the ICC <b>slab</b> from the fast temperature change inside the concrete <b>slab</b> that may lead to the higher temperature differentials in ICC <b>slabs.</b> In addition, the hourly temperature variation at the middle of AC layer under the standard mix <b>slab</b> is higher than that under the ICC <b>slab</b> as shown in Fig.  2. The low thermal conductivity of ICC <b>slab</b> may also influence the smaller temperature variation in AC layer under the ICC <b>slab</b> compared to that under the standard mix <b>slab.</b>|$|R
