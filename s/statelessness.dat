25|$|<b>Statelessness,</b> or {{the lack}} of {{effective}} nationality, impacts the daily lives of some 11-12 million people around the world. Perhaps those who suffer most are stateless infants, children, and youth. Though born and raised in their parents’ country of habitual residence, they lack formal recognition of their existence.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November 2017, {{questions}} {{were raised by}} the Australian concerning the possibility that Liberal MP and Minister Josh Frydenberg could be a citizen of Hungary under a Hungarian law designed to prevent <b>statelessness</b> caused during World War II. The retrospective law provided that anyone who had been born within Hungary in the period 1941 to 1945 automatically became a Hungarian citizen, and citizenship in Hungary is passed down by birth right. As his mother was born in Hungary in 1943, an argument was raised that this meant Frydenberg held Hungarian citizenship. Frydenberg {{said that it was}} absurd to suggest he had involuntarily acquired Hungarian citizenship as, when his mother and other family members entered Australia in 1950, they were stateless survivors of the Holocaust. Prime Minister Turnbull and Attorney-General Brandis condemned the calls as witch hunts.|$|E
500|$|Benjamin Powell {{argued that}} <b>statelessness</b> {{led to more}} order and less chaos than had the {{previous}} state, and economist Alex Tabarrok claimed that Somalia in its stateless period provided a [...] "unique test {{of the theory of}} anarchy", in some aspects near of that espoused by anarcho-capitalists David D. Friedman and Murray Rothbard, although this is disputed by various anarchists, of both the capitalist and anti-capitalist varieties, who contend it is not anarchy, but merely chaos, perhaps resulting from unequal distribution of power and meddling by neighbors and developed nations like the United States. The Somali experience since the collapse of the state, and especially the failure of international intervention, has offered a clear challenge to elements of conventional economic, political and social order theory and the very premises under which Western diplomacy and development agencies operate, and in particular, in the words of anthropologist Peter D. Little, [...] "assumptions about the role of states in maintaining order and services".|$|E
2500|$|Obama's speech {{called for}} {{improved}} mutual understanding and {{relations between the}} Islamic world and the West and said both should do more to confront violent extremism. However, it was Obama's call for peace between Israel and Palestinians that cut the highest profile. Obama reaffirmed America's alliance with Israel, calling their mutual bond [...] "unbreakable", but also described Palestinian <b>statelessness</b> as [...] "intolerable" [...] and recognizing their aspirations for statehood and dignity as legitimate—just as legitimate as Israel's desire for a Jewish homeland.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{changes to}} India's Citizenship Act, 1955 (see Indian {{nationality}} law) provide that Indian citizenship by descent {{can no longer}} be acquired automatically at the time of birth. This amendment will also allow some children of Indian origin born in Hong Kong after 3 December 2004 who have a BN(O) or BOC parent to automatically acquire BOC status at birth under the provisions for reducing <b>statelessness</b> in [...] If they have acquired no other nationality after birth, they will be entitled to [...]|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{generally}} recognized principle {{of international law}} that when sovereignty … over an area changes hands, there is a concurrent transfer {{of responsibility for the}} population of that territory. Therefore it cannot be argued that Palestinians … no longer had any rights with regard to the country in which they had lived simply because of a change {{in the nature of the}} … government in that territory. Moreover, where expulsion or prevention from return results in … <b>statelessness,</b> Article 15 of the Declaration, which stipulates that [...] "veryone has the right to a nationality," [...] becomes a further relevant protection of the right of return.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} October 2017, the UN {{estimated}} that some 603,000 Rohingya refugees had fled to Bangladesh since armed clashes resumed two months earlier. The Bangladeshi ambassador to the UN described the situation as [...] "untenable" [...] for his country, which planned to sterilise Rohingya women {{in order to avoid}} a population explosion and which also planned on seeking, in cooperation with the Burmese authorities, to repatriate some of the Rohingya refugees in Rakhine State. However, much of the agricultural land abandoned by Rohingya refugees have been seized by the government, and a vast majority of them do not have any official documents certifying that they have lived in the Rakhine State prior to the violence, due to their <b>statelessness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1961 while {{covering}} {{the trial of}} [...] in Jerusalem, Arendt wrote to [...] a letter that Kirsch described as reflecting [...] "pure racism" [...] towards Sephardic Jews from the Middle East and Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe. She wrote: [...] "On top, the judges, the best of German Jewry. Below them, the prosecuting attorneys, Galicians, but still Europeans. Everything is organized by a police force that gives me the creeps, speaks only Hebrew, and looks Arabic. Some downright brutal types among them. They would obey any order. And outside the doors, the oriental mob, as if one were in Istanbul or some other half-Asiatic country." [...] Though Arendt remained a Zionist activist both during and after World War II, she {{made it clear that}} she favored the creation of a Jewish-Arab federated state in Palestine, rather than a purely Jewish state. She believed that this was a way to address Jewish <b>statelessness</b> and to avoid the pitfalls of nationalism.|$|E
2500|$|The late {{cultural}} and political theorist Richard Iton suggested that diaspora {{be understood as a}} [...] "culture of dislocation." [...] For Iton, the traditional approach to the African diaspora focuses on the ruptures associated with the Atlantic slave trade and Middle Passage, notions of dispersal, and [...] "the cycle of retaining, redeeming, refusing, and retrieving 'Africa.'" [...] This conventional framework for analyzing the diaspora is dangerous, according to Iton, because it presumes that diaspora exists outside of Africa, thus simultaneously disowning and desiring Africa. Further, Iton suggests a new starting principle for the use of diaspora: [...] "the impossibility of settlement that correlates throughout the modern period with the cluster of disturbances that trouble not only the physically dispersed but those moved without traveling." [...] Iton adds that this impossibility of settlement—this [...] "modern matrix of strange spaces—outside the state but within the empire,"—renders notions of black citizenship fanciful, and in fact, [...] "undesirable." [...] Iton argues that we [...] citizenship, a state of <b>statelessness</b> thereby deconstructing colonial sites and narratives in an effort to [...] "de-link geography and power," [...] putting [...] "all space into play" [...] (emphasis added) For Iton, diaspora's potential is represented by a [...] "rediscursive albeit agonistic field of play that might denaturalize the hegemonic representations of modernity as unencumbered and self-generating and bring into clear view its repressed, colonial subscript".|$|E
50|$|The Institute on <b>Statelessness</b> and Inclusion is an {{independent}} non-profit organisation dedicated to leading an integrated, interdisciplinary response to <b>statelessness.</b> It works on research, analysis, empowerment, advocacy, and awareness globally.

50|$|In 2004, ExCom {{instructed}} UNHCR to pay {{particular attention}} to situations of protracted <b>statelessness</b> and to explore, in cooperation with states, measures that would ameliorate and end these situations. In 2006, it provided UNHCR with more specific guidance on how to implement its mandate. The Conclusion on Identification, Prevention and Reduction of <b>Statelessness</b> and Protection of Stateless Persons requires UNHCR to work with governments, other UN agencies, and civil society to address <b>statelessness.</b> UNHCR's activities are currently categorized as identification, prevention, reduction, and protection.|$|E
5000|$|This case {{is unique}} and has {{attracted}} international attention.

50|$|While the two UN {{conventions}} on <b>statelessness</b> {{constitute the}} primary international {{framework for the}} protection of stateless persons and the reduction of <b>statelessness,</b> there are also regional instruments of great importance. The 1997 European Convention on Nationality, for example, has contributed to protecting the rights of stateless persons and provides standards for reducing <b>statelessness</b> in the Council of Europe region. That document emphasizes the need of every person to have a nationality, and seeks to clarify the rights and responsibilities of states in ensuring individual access to a nationality.|$|E
