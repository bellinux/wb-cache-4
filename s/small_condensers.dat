40|$|The paper {{gives the}} design {{details of a}} new type of {{capacitance}} meter by which the capacitances and power factors of <b>small</b> <b>condensers</b> (maximum value 0. 02 uF) can be directly measured on two calibrated meters, no adjustment or calculation being necessary. The design is based on the principle that when a small condenser (the test capacitor) is connected across the tuned circuit of an oscillator, both its frequency and magnification factor change. The change in frequency is indicated by a frequency discriminator. This gives the value of the added capacitance. The change in magnification factor gives the power factor. By suitable discriminator and computer circuits, the meter readings arc made proportional to capacitances and power factors...|$|E
50|$|Alternately, a {{new breed}} of cooling system is being developed, {{inserting}} a pump into the thermo siphon loop. This adds another degree of flexibility for the design engineer, as the heat can now be effectively transported away from the heat source and either reclaimed or dissipated to ambient. Junction temperature can be tuned by adjusting the system pressure; higher pressure equals higher fluid saturation temperatures. This allows for <b>smaller</b> <b>condensers,</b> <b>smaller</b> fans, and/or the effective dissipation of heat in a high ambient temperature environment. These systems are, in essence, the next generation fluid cooling paradigm, as they are approximately 10 times more efficient than single phase water. Since the system uses a dielectric as the heat transport medium, leaks do not cause a catastrophic failure of the electric system.|$|R
40|$|A current {{integrator}} {{is described}} for {{the integration of}} currents from 0. 01 to 500 μA with an accuracy of 0. 1 %. The principle used {{is essentially the same}} as that of the excellent circuit described earlier by Helmer and Hemmendinger. The modifications effected result in a considerable reduction in expense, as well as a lower input impedance. Due to increased high frequency gain much <b>smaller</b> <b>condensers</b> are necessary in order to maintain the input voltage within some hundredths of a volt of ground, at all times. The integrated current is measured as the number of output pulses, each pulse representing a fixed amount of change. Except for the condensers, no special components are used. A low-impedance electronic galvanometer for operation in series with this integra or is also described.

40|$|Industrial and {{military}} vehicles, including trucks, tanks and others, employ cooling systems that address passenger cooling and auxiliary cooling loads {{ranging from a}} few Watts to 50 kW or more. Such systems are typically powered using vapor-compression cooling systems that either directly supply cold air to the various locations, or cool an intermediate single-phase coolant closed loop, which in turn serves as the coolant for the passenger cabins and auxiliary loads such as electronics modules. Efforts are underway to enhance the performance of such systems, and also to develop more light weight and compact systems that would remove high heat fluxes. The distributed cooling configuration offers {{the advantage of a}} smaller refrigerant system package. The heat transfer between the intermediate fluid and air or with the auxiliary heat loads can be fine tuned through the control of flow rates and component sizes and controls to maintain tight tolerances on the cooling performance. Because of the additional loop involved in such a configuration, there is a temperature penalty between the refrigerant and the ultimate heat sink or source, but in some configurations, this may be counteracted through judicious design of the phase change-to-liquid coupled heat exchangers. Such heat exchangers are inherently smaller due to the high heat transfer coefficients in phase change and single-phase liquid flow compared to air flow. The additional loop also requires a pump to circulate the fluid, which adds pumping power requirements. However, a direct refrigerant-to-heat load coupling system might in fact be suboptimal if the heat loads are distributed across large distances. This is because of the significantly higher pressure drops (and saturation temperature drops) incurred in transporting vapor or two-phase fluids through refrigerant lines across long plumbing elements. An optimal system can be developed for any candidate application by assessing the tradeoffs in cooling capacity, heat exchanger sizes and configurations, and compression, pumping and fan power. In this study, a versatile simulation platform {{for a wide variety of}} direct and indirectly coupled cooling systems was developed to enable comparison of different component geometries and system configurations based on operating requirements and applicable design constraints. Components are modeled at increasing levels of complexity ranging from specified closest approach temperatures for key components to models based on detailed heat transfer and pressure drop models. These components of varying complexity can be incorporated into the system model as desired and trade-off analyses on system configurations performed. Employing this platform as a screening, comparison, and optimization tool, a number of conventional vapor-compression and distributed cooling systems were analyzed to determine the efficacy of the distributed cooling scheme in mobile cooling applications. Four systems serving approximately a 6 kW cooling duty, two with air-coupled evaporators and two with liquid-coupled evaporators, were analyzed for ambient conditions of 37. 78 °C and 40 % relative humidity. Though the condensers and evaporators are smaller in liquid-coupled systems, the total mass of the heat exchangers in the liquid-coupled systems is larger due to the additional air-to-liquid heat exchangers that the configuration requires. Additionally, for the cooling applications considered, the additional compressor power necessitated by the liquid-coupled configuration and the additional power consumed by the liquid-loop pumps result in the coefficient of performance being lower for liquid-coupled systems than for air-coupled systems. However, the use of liquid-coupling in a system does meet the primary goal of decreasing the system refrigerant inventory by enabling the use of <b>smaller</b> <b>condensers</b> and evaporators and by eliminating long refrigerant carrying hoses.

The model is based on a finite volume approach that divides each tube into small elemental volumes where mass, momentum and energy conservation equations are solved using the effectiveness-NTU method and with appropriate correlations for void fraction, friction factor and heat transfer coefficient calculation. The model is validated against experimental data on two <b>small</b> <b>condensers</b> finding that the calculated heat transfer rate and refrigerant-side pressure drop agree within ± 5 % and ± 21 % respectively to the experimental values.

40|$|A major {{blackout}} affecting 50 {{million people}} in the Northeast United States, where insufficient reactive power supply was an issue, and an increased number of filings made to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by generators for reactive power has led to a closer look at reactive power supply and compensation. The Northeastern Massachusetts region is one such area where there is an insufficiency in reactive power compensation. Distributed energy due to its close proximity to loads seems to be a viable option for solving any present or future reactive power shortage problems. Industry experts believe that supplying reactive power from synchronized distributed energy sources can be 2 to 3 times more effective than providing reactive support in bulk from longer distances at the transmission or generation level. Several technology options are available to supply reactive power from distributed energy sources such as <b>small</b> generators, synchronous <b>condensers,</b> fuel cells or microturbines. In addition, simple payback analysis indicates that investments in DG to provide reactive power can be recouped in less than 5 years when capacity payments for providing reactive power are larger than $ 5, 000 /kVAR and the DG capital and installation costs are lower than $ 30 /kVAR. However, the current institutional arrangements for reactive power compensation present a significant barrier to wider adoption of distributed energy as a source of reactive power. Furthermore, there is a significant difference between how generators and transmission owners/providers are compensated for reactive power supplied. The situation for distributed energy sources is even more difficult, as there are no arrangements to compensate independent DE owners interested in supplying reactive power to the grid other than those for very large IPPs. There are comparable functionality barriers as well, as these smaller devices do not have the control and communications requirements necessary for automatic operation in response to local or system operators. There are no known distributed energy asset owners currently receiving compensation for reactive power supply or capability. However, there are some cases where small generators on the generation and transmission side of electricity supply have been tested and have installed the capability to be dispatched for reactive power support. Several concerns need to be met for distributed energy to become widely integrated as a reactive power resource. The overall costs of retrofitting distributed energy devices to absorb or produce reactive power need to be reduced. There needs to be a mechanism in place for ISOs/RTOs to procure reactive power from the customer side of the meter where distributed energy resides. Novel compensation methods should be introduced to encourage the dispatch of dynamic resources close to areas with critical voltage issues. The next phase of this research will investigate in detail how different options of reactive power producing DE can compare both economically and functionally with shunt capacitor banks. Shunt capacitor banks, which are typically used for compensating reactive power consumption of loads on distribution systems, are very commonly used because they are very cost effective in terms of capital costs. However, capacitor banks can require extensive maintenance especially due to their exposure to lightning at the top of utility poles. Also, it can be problematic to find failed capacitor banks and their maintenance can be expensive, requiring crews and bucket trucks which often requires total replacement. Another shortcoming of capacitor banks is the fact that they usually have one size at a location (typically sized as 300, 600, 900 or 1200 kVAr) and thus don't have variable range as do reactive power producing DE, and cannot respond to dynamic reactive power needs. Additional future work is to find a detailed methodology to identify the hidden benefit of DE for providing reactive power {{and the best way to}} allocate the benefit among customers, utilities, transmission companies or RTOs. With the hidden benefits discovered, it will be easier for the policy maker to re-assess the value of reactive power and to form a sound competitive market for this service. Along with the capability of DE to provide local reactive power, a market needs to exist to promote the operation of DE to regulate voltage and net power factor. There are a number of potential benefits that have been identified including capacity relief, loss reduction, improved system reliability, extended equipment life, reduced transport of reactive power from the G&T, and improved local voltage regulation and power factor. An attempt has been made using very simple data and cases to quantify these benefits. Only the model of a larger and more detailed distribution system with DE can truly give a full picture of the benefits that reactive power from local DE can provide...|$|R
