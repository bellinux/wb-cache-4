25|$|Endemol USA created Midnight Money Madness for cable's TBS network, {{in which}} viewers can call in {{to play games}} and win money prizes. It is based on Endemol's {{successful}} Participation TV format. On 13 October 2006, Endemol USA launched another game show for NBC, 1 vs. 100 with Bob Saget, and debuted as another ratings winner. And on 14 November 2006, ABC premiered <b>Show</b> <b>Me</b> <b>the</b> Money, with William Shatner as its host. Midnight Money Madness was canceled in October 2006 after 32 episodes, in which its successor, Take the Cake, premiered 9 July 2007, and <b>Show</b> <b>Me</b> <b>the</b> Money was canceled in December 2006 after only five episodes aired. Currently, a syndicated five-day-a-week version of Deal or No Deal airs in over 90% of the USA, while Wipeout will begin its third season on ABC in summer 2010, and 20Q debuted on GSN in June 2009. In October 2008, Tokyo Broadcasting System {{filed a lawsuit against}} ABC (with a separate suit against Endemol pending) for claims that Wipeout copied elements from two of their popular shows, Takeshi's Castle (known as MXC in the USA) and Sasuke (better known in the USA as Ninja Warrior). Endemol USA also produces the Style Network hour-long reality series Jerseylicious, which debuted in 2010.|$|E

25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

500|$|The debate {{highlighted}} disagreements between {{openly gay}} lawmakers and some black lawmakers on whether same-sex {{marriage is a}} matter of civil rights. Delegate Emmett C. Burns, Jr. said: [...] "If you want to compare same-sex marriage to civil rights as I know it, <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> Ku Klux Klan that invaded your home." [...] Delegate Keiffer J. Mitchell, Jr., grandson of NAACP chief lobbyist Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr., said [...] "It is a civil rights issue when we as a state and a government deny equal protection under the law." [...] Several delegates who originally co-sponsored the bill began to express doubts after being lobbied by church-going constituents, including Sam Arora and Tiffany Alston, who delayed the bill's vote in the House committee by skipping the voting session. The bill passed through the committee after its chairman, who rarely votes in committee, voted in favor. The House majority whip opposed the bill. Despite pleas from gay lawmakers, the House of Delegates voted to send the bill back to committee on March 11, 2011 and would not reconsider it before January 2012.|$|E
