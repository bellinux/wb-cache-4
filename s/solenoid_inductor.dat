To avoid very large models, the foil-coiled inductor has been studied by using two small and complementary models.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{improvement in}} CMOS transistor speed has prompted many {{to look into}} the possibility of building fully integrated RF front-end circuits using the low-cost and commercially available standard CMOS process. Direct conversion architecture offers the potential benefit of low-cost and low-power consumption for the transceiver circuit. It requires minimum components operating at the RF frequency. The circuit design is much simpler due to the absence of the image rejection requirement. However, since the received signal is only processed at two frequencies: RF and baseband, its sensitivity and dynamic range will be limited by the insufficient signal amplification, noise and interference suppression at the RF stage, and the large DC-offset and flicker noise at the baseband stage. Furthermore, for fully integrated transceiver circuits, their performance are still limited by the missing on-chip high-quality band- or channel-selection filter at the RF stage which is used to replace the bulky and expensive off-chip SAW filter. In this thesis, low-power high-performance RF front-end circuits were implemented using a 0. 18 μm 6 -metal layer CMOS process to address the limitation of the direct conversion receiver. A 5 GHz, 56 dB voltage-gain Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) with built-in tunable 30 MHz channel-selection filter was designed which helps to minimize the impact of the DC-offset and flicker noise on the sensitivity of the direct conversion receiver. The LNA drains 0. 9 mA current from the 1. 5 V power supply and has 6. 5 dB noise figure. A very low power-consumption 5 GHz Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) was also designed which has 10 % tuning range. The phase noise is - 106 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset while the VCO core drains 0. 5 mA current from the 1 V power supply.

40|$|Integrated r-f passive {{components}} such as inductors, transmission lines, transformers etc, form the basic building blocks in r-f integrated circuits (RFICs) such as matching networks, low noise amplifiers (LNAs), synthesizers and r-f mixers. One main challenge faced by current technology developers in integrating r-f components on integrated chip (IC) {{are related to}} operation and size. Tremendous efforts were made for overcoming challenges of r-f integrated circuits to meet growing technology demands. In general, r-f devices utilize magnetic materials such as ferrites for their operation for improving device performance and scaling. However, due to material properties and size ferrite materials are poor choices when attempting to scale r-f components. The main focus of this work has been to explore new material properties and investigate applications of ferromagnetic (FM) films as potential solution for device scaling. One attractive property of ferromagnetic materials is low processing temperature and high magnetic saturation which {{eliminates the need for}} continuous application of magnetic (d-c) field and are compatible with CMOS technology. The disadvantage of ferromagnetic films is high conductivity which induces ohmic losses and affects r-f device performance. In this work a novel concept of low-loss conductor has been introduced whose conductivity can be modeled by utilizing multilayered superlattice structure. The low-loss conductor is made of artificial layered metamaterial (ARLYM) consisting Ni 80 Fe 20 /Cu superlattice. By modeling thickness ratio between superlattice layers the skin effect has been suppressed by increasing skin depth at r-f frequencies. The experimental results presented in this work indicates significant improvement in r-f device characteristics such as inductance, quality factor (85 %), loss reduction ratio (70 %) etc, operating at r-f frequencies. In addition, application of continuous magnetic field was not required in this work due to magnetic anisotropy property in ferromagnetic materials.

40|$|Several {{fabrication}} {{techniques for}} surface micromachined 3 -D structures {{have been developed}} for RF components. The fabrication techniques all have in common the use of epoxy patterning and subsequent metallization. Techniques and structures such as embedded conductors, epoxy-core conductors, a reverse-side exposure technique, a multi-exposure scheme, and inclined patterning are presented. The epoxy-core conductor technique makes it easy to fabricate high-aspect-ratio (10 - 20 : 1), tall (~ 1 mm) RF subelements as well as potentially very complex structures by taking advantage of advanced epoxy processes. To demonstrate feasibility and usefulness of the developed fabrication techniques for RF applications, two test vehicles are employed. One is a <b>solenoid</b> type RF <b>inductor,</b> and the other is a millimeter wave radiating structure such as a W-band quarter-wavelength monopole antenna. The embedded inductor approach provides mechanical robustness and package compatibility as well as good electrical performance. An inductor with a peak Q-factor of 21 and an inductance of 2. 6 nH at 4. 5 GHz has been fabricated on a silicon substrate. In addition, successful integration with a CMOS power amplifier has been demonstrated. A high-aspect-ratio inductor fabricated using epoxy core conductors shows a maximum Q-factor of 84 and an inductance of 1. 17 nH at 2. 6 GHz on a glass substrate with a height of 900 um and a single turn. Successful W-band monopole antenna fabrication is demonstrated. A monopole with a height of 800 um shows its radiating resonance at 85 GHz with a return loss of 16 dB. In addition to the epoxy-based devices, an advanced tunable ferroelectric device architecture is introduced. This architecture enables a low-loss conductor device; a reduced intermodulation distortion (IMD) device; and a compact tunable LC module. A single-finger capacitor having a low-loss conductor with an electrode gap of 1. 2 um and an electrode thickness of 2. 2 um has been fabricated using a reverse-side exposure technique, showing a tunability of 33 % at 10 V. It shows an improved Q-factor of 21. 5. Reduced IMD capacitors consist of wide RF gaps and narrowly spaced high resistivity electrodes with a gap of 2 um and a width of 2 um within the wide gap. A 14 um gap and a 20 um gap capacitor show improved IMD performance compared to a 4 um gap capacitor by 6 dB and 15 dB, respectively, while the tunability is approximately 21 % at 30 V for all three devices due to the narrowly spaced multi-pair high resistivity DC electrodes within the gap. Finally, a compact tunable LC module is implemented by forming the narrow gap capacitor in an inductor shape. The resonance frequency of this device is variable as a function of DC bias and a frequency tunability of 1. 1 %/V is achieved. The RF components developed in this thesis illustrate the usefulness of the application of micromachining technology to this application area, especially as frequencies of operation of RF systems continue to increase (and therefore wavelengths continue to shrink).

The VCO circuit phase noise is improved by 6 dB and exhibits an improved immunity to coupling from adjacent digital clock lines routed on the bottom tier of the 3 D stack. An efficient hardware implementation is presented for an LTE uplink channel. The proposed design processes input data for cellular transmission. The core of the computation includes a variable-length, high-order, mixed-radix FFT and IFFT blocks. The use of energy efficient circuits and algorithms enables achieving an energy efficiency of up to 95 pJ/Sample and additional power savings of up to 24 % for different operation modes. Both designs are combined along with digital-to-analog conversion to create a partial cellular transmitter in 3 D-IC. Highly flexible and configurable design allows for various partitioning of the system.

Size-dependent magnetic permeability is observed in maghemite nanocrystals, while as-synthesized, magnetite-rich, iron oxide nanocrystals do not show size dependence due to the inhomogeneous crystal structure of the as-synthesized nanocrystals.
