50|$|The lattice stool was {{the most}} popular type of stool in ancient Egypt. It is {{rectangular}} in form with a combination of features. These features would include: square section legs connected by a perimeter stretcher, a single cove, double cove or flat seat, vertical and diagonal struts joining the stretcher with the seat rail, and a seat surface material that consisted of woven reeds, wooden slats or various natural fibers. Holes were drilled into the <b>seat</b> <b>rails</b> in order to pass the woven material through the holes during the weaving process for a stronger integrity of the seat. Stools were one of the earliest types of seating and were used by all levels of society.|$|E
50|$|Delahaye 175 was an {{automobile}} manufactured by Delahaye between 1947 and 1951. The {{last of the}} large Delahayes, the type 175 was essentially a brand new chassis and engine. The chassis bore {{little resemblance to the}} preceding Type 135, other than the cockpit area with its welded driveshaft tunnel and welded stamped-steel floor. The assembly formed a rigid stressed-steel semi-monocoque structure. This allowed the <b>seat</b> <b>rails</b> to be mounted on the plane of the bottom of the chassis, instead of on top of it, as competitors were doing, since their chassis had X-braced cruciforms instead of Delahaye's semi-monocoque cockpit. This made the completed Coachbuilt Delahaye body lower in profile than its competition. The rigid chassis structure also delighted the coachbuilders.|$|E

40|$|A vehicle start/stop {{engine system}} is {{investigated}} with focus on human perception of discomfort. The FRF between engine rotational acceleration around the neutral torque axis (NTA) and <b>seat</b> <b>rail</b> acceleration {{with the specific}} interest in start up and shut down events is estimated from measurements, using a shaker torque excitation. The inverted torque sensitivity formulates a frequency dependent target of powertrain torque related to <b>seat</b> <b>rail</b> acceleration. The main rotation direction for the transversally mounted engine is the pitch-direction, yielding high acceleration levels in both longitudinal x-, and vertical z-direction compared to the lateral y-direction. Specific weighting functions are used to normalize these accelerations to human perception. Acceleration levels in x-, and z-direction at the <b>seat</b> <b>rail</b> are similar after weighting curves have been applied. The amount of discomfort experienced by a person depends on vibration amplitude, frequency, direction and time duration. However, {{there is no evidence}} on in what way a specific time dependence affects the perceived comfort. The NTA around which the engine as a rigid body rotates is experimentally estimated and verified by comparing to the reference CAD NTA. The powertrain mounting system center of gravity is assumed to be known from the CAD model. The <b>seat</b> <b>rail</b> is found to be a more convenient measurement position to use in order to achieve reproducible results rather than the seat cushion. This, since the acceleration at the cushion also depends on several other factors such as person size, weight and body posture and also on the non-linear properties of the seat foam padding...|$|R

The LX was developed in America to supersede the previous Chrysler LH platform, which had been designed to allow it to be easily upgraded to rear and all-wheel drive. Mercedes parts were used to save costs, including some shared with the Mercedes-Benz W220 S-class, and the Mercedes-Benz W211 E-Class 5-link rear suspension, <b>seat</b> <b>rails,</b> steering column, the W5A580 5-speed automatic, the rear differential, and the ESP system.

40|$|A 25 -fps {{vertical}} drop {{test of a}} 1 / 5 -scale model composite fuselage section was conducted to replicate a previous test of a full-scale fuselage section. The purpose of the test was to obtain experimental data characterizing the impact response of the 1 / 5 -scale model fuselage section for comparison with the corresponding full-scale data. This comparison is performed to assess the scaling procedures and to determine if scaling effects are present. For the drop test, the 1 / 5 -scale model fuselage section was configured {{in a similar manner}} as the full-scale section, with lead masses attached to the floor through simulated <b>seat</b> <b>rails.</b> Scaled acceleration and velocity responses are compared and a general assessment of structural damage is made. To further quantify the data correlation, comparisons of the average acceleration data are made as a function of floor location and longitudinal position. Also, the percentage differences in the velocity change (area under the acceleration curve) and the velocity change squared (proportional to kinetic energy) are compared as a function of floor location. Finally, correlation coefficients are calculated for corresponding 1 / 5 - and full-scale data channels and these values are plotted versus floor location. From a scaling perspective, the differences between the 1 / 5 - and full-scale tests are relatively small, indicating that appropriate scaling procedures were used in fabricating the test specimens and in conducting the experiments. The small differences in the scaled test data are attributed to minor scaling anomalies in mass, potential energy, and impact attitude...|$|E

40|$|The {{finite element}} model of the <b>seat</b> <b>rail</b> is {{established}} with a spring-damping element to simulate {{the ball in the}} rail joint part. The stiffness and damping parameters of the joint part are determined by the combination of finite element method and experiment. Firstly, the natural frequencies and modes of the guide rail are obtained by modal experiment. The stiffness of the spring-damping element is optimized in the finite element software to make the natural frequencies and modes of the system consistent with the experimental ones. Secondly, the dynamic response curve of the key nodes is obtained through sweeping experiment, and the damping of the spring-damping element is optimized in the finite element software to make the nodal response of the system output consistent with the experiment. Then, the gap of the joint part of the car <b>seat</b> <b>rail</b> is studied considering the factors of load and structure randomness. The influence factors of the gap are selected by Hammersley experimental design method. The results show that the gap is normally distributed, and therefore the confidence interval of the gap is obtained. Finally, the joint probability distribution of the gap is obtained under the condition that the load and the structure are all random, which provides the theoretical guidance for determining the reasonable gap of the joint...|$|R

40|$|In Greece, {{during the}} 1980 's, 60 % of the twin-block {{concrete}} ties designed for 200 km/h, which were laid {{on a track}} with maximum operational speed of 140 km/h, presented serious cracks. The existing theories, in the French, German and American bibliographies, could not justify the appearance of these cracks since the calculated actions on the <b>rail</b> <b>seat</b> of the ties were {{much lower than the}} limit values of the regulations. This paper presents a model for the determination of the load acting on the <b>rail</b> <b>seat</b> of the ties in relation to the fluctuation of the substructure stiffness coefficient. The basic parameters influencing the estimation of the <b>rail</b> <b>seat</b> load -considering the most adverse conditions of a railway network-are investigated, and a methodology for calculating the load undertaken by each <b>rail</b> <b>seat</b> is presented. Numerical applications on twin-block and monoblock ties are presented, including the use of strain attenuating tie pads with high resilient fastenings. Finally, an application for the heavy-haul rail transport is presented, for the case of a track equipped with W 24 fastening, Zw 700 WIC pad, rail 140 RE type and concrete sleepers. © 2010 by ASME...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>seat</b> {{deterioration}} (RSD) {{is considered}} the most critical problem with concrete-tie performance on North American freight railroads. RSD is {{the deterioration of the}} concrete underneath the rail that results in problems such as wide gauge, insufficient rail cant, and loss of fastening toe load. Currently, the problem is not sufficiently understood to enable development of effective solutions. The primary causes of RSD appear to be high stresses at the <b>rail</b> <b>seat,</b> a loosened fastening system, the presence of moisture, and the presence of abrasive fines. RSD is considered to have up to six potential mechanisms, and this research investigates three of them: hydraulic pressure cracking, hydro-abrasive erosion, and cavitation erosion. A laboratory test apparatus and procedure were devised to measure the surface water pressure in a laboratory <b>rail</b> <b>seat</b> using tie pads of differing material composition and surface geometry. To evaluate hydraulic pressure cracking, a model of the effective stress in a concrete-tie <b>rail</b> <b>seat</b> was developed to estimate the water pressures on the <b>rail</b> <b>seat</b> surface and whether they could lead to damaging pore pressures in the concrete. Comparing the effective stress model and the measured surface water pressures, hydraulic pressure cracking appears to be a feasible mechanism for RSD given the correct combination of high <b>rail</b> <b>seat</b> loads, sufficient moisture, and a tie pad surface that develops high pressure. The measured surface water pressures were used to estimate the potential water velocity. By comparing these estimates with critical velocities for concrete erosion, it appears feasible that hydro-abrasive erosion contributes to RSD. The uplift action of the rail was simulated in the test apparatus, and the resulting suction was at or near the vapor pressure of water for most of the tie pads considered, suggesting that cavitation occurs in a concrete-tie <b>rail</b> <b>seat.</b> However, considering the size of the cavitation bubbles that could fit underneath the tie pad, and the observation that no high collapse pressures were measured, cavitation erosion is not a feasible mechanism for RSD. Mitigation options for preventing hydraulic pressure cracking are using a tie pad or pad assembly that does not seal water, reducing the occurrence of high impact loads, and using high-strength, air-entrained, low-permeability concrete. Care should be exercised when using pads that do not seal water, as this could contribute to hydro-abrasive erosion or abrasion...|$|R
