25|$|Though too {{numerous}} to list, the city has a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> architecturally significant late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century buildings and skyscrapers. Daniel Burnham, Louis Kamper, and the Smith Hinchman & Grylls firm are among the architects who designed some of the city's other important skyscrapers {{at the turn of}} the century which endure today. Burnham's three remaining Detroit skyscraper designs are the Neo-Classical styled Chrysler House (1912) — renovated in 2002, and the Neo-Renaissance Whitney (1915) and Ford (1909) buildings. Among their early projects Smith Hinchman & Grylls designed the Neo-Gothic R.H. Fyfe Building (1919) at Woodward and Adams, now a residential high-rise.|$|E
25|$|Three {{engines and}} four {{transmissions}} {{were available for}} every 1977 Chevrolet Nova, including Concours. Buyers could choose from a 110-horsepower 250-cubic-inch inline six, a 145-horsepower 305 cubic-inch two-barrel V-8, or 170-horsepower 350 cubic-inch four-barrel V-8. Shifting was accomplished by three-speed (column or floor shift) and four-speed manuals or Turbo Hydra-Matic. Novas might also be equipped with a heavy-duty suspension or the F41 sport suspension. A <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> police departments ordered Novas with either a 305- or 350-cubic-inch V-8 engine, {{following the lead of}} the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, which had given the compacts an exhaustive evaluation.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{specimens}} sold by Bristow were <b>surprising</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> birds which, though {{purported to}} have been shot locally, were considered either rare vagrants to the area or were new to the British List. Although some ornithologists held doubts about the provenance of such specimens, {{it was not until}} 1962, well after Bristow’s death, that an article by the statistician John Nelder in British Birds, looking at the statistics of ornithological records from the Hastings area, publicly cast doubt on many records, with the implication of extensive serial fraud. The resulting scandal was known as the Hastings Rarities affair, with Bristow the central figure as the presumed perpetrator of the fraud. Nelder estimated that specimens to the value of £7000 had been sold between 1892 and 1930.|$|R
5000|$|The figures, called mingqui in Chinese, {{were most}} often of servants, {{soldiers}} (in male tombs) and attendants such as dancers and musicians, with many no doubt representing courtesans. In burials {{of people of}} high rank there may be soldiers and officials as well. The animals are most often horses, but there are <b>surprising</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> both Bactrian camels and their Central Asian drivers, distinguished by thick beards and hair, and their facial features. The depictions are realistic to a degree unprecedented in Chinese art, and the figures give archaeologists much useful information about life under the Tang. [...] There are also figures of the imaginary monster [...] "earth spirits" [...] and the fearsome human Lokapala (or tian wang), both usually in pairs and acting as tomb guardians to repel attacks by both spirits and humans. [...] Sets of the twelve imaginary beasts of the Chinese Zodiac are also found, usually unglazed.|$|R

There are a <b>surprising</b> large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> entries and biographies, but disappointingly most of the songs/poetry are in the form of extracts, and some biographies are quite short.|$|R
25|$|Through the 1970s, Alpine {{continued}} to campaign the A110, {{and later the}} Alpine A310 replacement car. However, to compete with Alpine's success, other manufacturers developed increasingly special cars, notably the Lancia Stratos which was based closely on the A110's size and rear-engined concept, though incorporating a Ferrari engine. Alpine's own cars, still based on the 1962 design and using a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> production parts, became increasingly uncompetitive. In 1974 Alpine built a series of factory racing Renault 17 Gordinis (one driven by Jean-Luc Thérier) that won the Press on Regardless World Rally Championship round in Michigan, US.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{developed}} successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell {{fighters and}} scored a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> aerial victories over {{a variety of}} German aircraft. Low ceilings, short missions, good radios, a sealed and warm cockpit and ruggedness contributed to their effectiveness. To pilots who had once flown the tricky Polikarpov I-16, the aerodynamic quirks of the mid-engined aircraft were unimportant. In the Far East, P-63 and P-39 aircraft {{were used in the}} Soviet invasion of Manchukuo and northern Korea. In the Pacific theatre, the Kingcobras flew escort, close air support and ground attack missions. The Soviet P-63s achieved their first air victory on 15 August 1945, when Lejtenant I. F. Miroshnichenko from 17th IAP/190 IAD, shot down a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa IJAAS fighter off the coast of North Korea.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} {{received}} some criticism from some music critics for {{the similarities between}} the lead single, [...] "Speed of Sound", and [...] "Clocks", one of the band's most popular songs to date. Kelefa Sanneh of Rolling Stone magazine was less contented with X, writing it [...] "is something less exciting" [...] compared to A Rush of Blood to the Head that [...] "was a nervy bid for bigness". Sanneh notes that the album is [...] "the sound of a blown-up band trying not to deflate" [...] and [...] "a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> songs here just never take flight". Despite such, he compliments the album for featuring [...] "lovely ballads that sound, well, Coldplay-ish".|$|E

500|$|Many {{prominent}} and successful women cite Nancy Drew {{as an early}} formative influence whose character encouraged them to take on unconventional roles, including U.S. Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor; TV personalities Oprah Winfrey and Barbara Walters; singers Barbra Streisand and Beverly Sills; mystery authors Sara Paretsky and Nancy Pickard; scholar Carolyn Heilbrun; actresses Ellen Barkin and Emma Roberts; former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; former First Lady Laura Bush; {{and former president of}} the National Organization for Women Karen DeCrow. Less prominent women also credit the character of Nancy Drew with helping them to become stronger women; when the first Nancy Drew conference was held, at the University of Iowa, in 1993, conference organizers received a flood of calls from women who [...] "all had stories to tell about how instrumental Nancy had been in their lives, and about how she had inspired, comforted, entertained them through their childhoods, and, for a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> women, well into adulthood." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "this excellent episode includes a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> concurrent plots. Homer also {{works in the}} casino and tries {{to care for the}} family without Marge. It balances them deftly and provides great laughs along the way." [...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the third best episode of the season. He also praised the episode's cultural references. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "There's a lovely nod to the earlier episodes in which Marge protests the citizenry's hare-brained ideas at council meetings. A series of bizarre moments rather than a story—we're especially fond of Homer's photographic memory and Mr Burns' descent into insanity—but great fun." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5. The episode is Sarah Culp of The Quindecims eleventh-favorite episode of the show, and one of Les Winan of Box Office Prophets's favorite episodes. A scene from the episode where former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger meets Burns was included in the 2002 documentary film The Trials of Henry Kissinger.|$|E

40|$|Obscured active galactic nuclei, {{which are}} {{classified}} optically as type 2 (narrow-line) Seyfert {{galaxies in the}} local universe, {{are by far the}} most promising candidates for the origin of the hard (2 - 10 keV) X-ray background radiation. However, optical follow-up observations of faint X-ray sources in deep Chandra images have revealed <b>surprising</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> apparently normal galaxies at modest redshift. Such objects represent ~ 40 - 60 % of the sources classified in deep Chandra surveys, raising the possibility that the X-ray galaxy population has evolved with cosmic time. Alternatively, most of the faint X-ray galaxies in question are so distant that their angular diameters are comparable to the slit widths used in ground-based spectroscopic observations; thus, their nuclear spectral features may be overwhelmed (``hidden'') by host-galaxy light. To test this hypothesis, we have obtained integrated spectra of a sample of nearby, well-studied Seyfert 2 galaxies. The data, which accurately simulate observations of distant Chandra sources, demonstrate convincingly that the defining spectral signatures of Seyfert 2 s can be hidden by light from their host galaxies. In fact, 60 % of the observed objects would not be classified as Seyfert 2 s {{on the basis of their}} integrated spectra, similar to the fraction of faint X-ray sources identified with ``normal'' galaxies. Thus, the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> narrow-line active galaxies in deep Chandra surveys (and perhaps all ground-based spectroscopic surveys of distant galaxies) are likely to have been underestimated.
