40|$|Cells of Methanothrix concilii do {{not possess}} rigid, shape-forming cell walls; they obtain their {{cellular}} form from the portions of the sheath and spacer plugs which enclose them. Electron microscopy has shown that cell division proceeds by the ingrowth of spacer plugs, like the closing of a camera iris, from select regions of the sheath; this process forces the cells to split in two. Therefore, each spacer plug which traverses the filament of cells is a completed division annulus. Spacer plugs are two-layered structures; one layer is an assembly of fine concentric rings and {{is the first to}} be laid down during the division ingrowth. The second layer consists of larger, raised, concentric ribbons which progressively follow the advance of the first layer during division. Although cells within the filament are typically 2. 52 ̆ 0023 ̆bcm long, new daughter cells are ca. 1. 02 ̆ 0023 ̆bcm and can grow to ca. 4. 02 ̆ 0023 ̆bcm before division begins. Frequently, a developing spacer plug partitions a cell so that one daughter is a small, nonreplicating unit of protoplasm sandwiched between two completed plugs; eventually, this protoplasmic unit dies leaving a void in the chain of cells. The filament is susceptible to breakage at this juncture. In this instance, each of the two "void" plugs becomes a new terminal plug for the new ends of the <b>split</b> <b>filament.</b> This type of replication requires both cell division and filament splitting, and the series of structural events which are involved present a new form of prokaryotic division.

40|$|Force-free equilibria {{containing}} two vertically arranged {{magnetic flux}} ropes of like chirality and current direction are {{considered as a}} model for split filaments/prominences and filament-sigmoid systems. Such equilibria are constructed analytically through an extension of the methods developed in Titov & Démoulin (1999) and numerically through an evolutionary sequence including shear flows, flux emergence, and flux cancellation in the photospheric boundary. It is demonstrated that the analytical equilibria are stable if an external toroidal (shear) field component exceeding a threshold value is included. If this component decreases sufficiently, then both flux ropes turn unstable for conditions typical of solar active regions, with the lower rope typically being unstable first. Either both flux ropes erupt upward, or only the upper rope erupts while the lower rope reconnects with the ambient flux low in the corona and is destroyed. However, for shear field strengths staying somewhat above the threshold value, the configuration also admits evolutions which lead to partial eruptions with only the upper flux rope becoming unstable and the lower one remaining in place. This can be triggered by a transfer of flux and current from the lower to the upper rope, as suggested by the observations of a <b>split</b> <b>filament</b> in Paper I (Liu et al. 2012). It can also result from tether-cutting reconnection with the ambient flux at the X-type structure between the flux ropes, which similarly influences their stability properties in opposite ways. This is demonstrated for the numerically constructed equilibrium. Comment: To appear in the Astrophys. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for producing boron filaments {{with an average}} tensile strength of 6. 89 GPa has been developed which involves longitudinal <b>splitting</b> of the <b>filament</b> and core (substrate) removal by etching. Splitting is accomplished by a pinch wheel device which continuously <b>splits</b> <b>filaments</b> in lengths of 3. 0 m by applying a force {{to the side of}} the filament to create a crack which is then propagated along the axis by a gentle sliding action. To facilitate the splitting, a single 10 mil tungsten substrate is used instead of the usual 0. 5 mil substrate. A solution of hot 30 % hydrogen peroxide is used to remove the core without attacking the boron. An alternative technique is to alter the residual stress by heavily etching the filament. Average strengths in the 4. 83 - 5. 52 GPa range have been obtained by etching an 8 mil filament to 4 mil...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our recent}} {{progress toward a}} fully automated system for cryo-electron microscopy that integrates instrument control, computer vision algorithms and machine learning techniques. It describes our image analysis strategies for detection and selection of filaments in highly noisy images using multi-level perceptual organization. At the signal level, we use the Canny edge detector to detect weak boundaries. Collinearity at the primitive level is employed to organize discontinuous edges into line segments with a complete description, by using the Hough transform followed by an algorithm to detect end points of line segments. At the structural level, line segments are grouped into filamentous structures by seeking parallelism and employing high-level knowledge. In addition, statistical methods are used to <b>split</b> two <b>filaments</b> if they are joined together end-to-end. The performance of the proposed approach has been tested and evaluated by applying it to high magnification images of tobacco mosaic virus. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{streaming}} instability is {{a promising}} mechanism {{to overcome the}} barriers in direct dust growth and lead {{to the formation of}} planetesimals. Most previous studies of the streaming instability, however, were focused on a local region of a protoplanetary disk with a limited simulation domain such that only one filamentary concentration of solids has been observed. The characteristic separation between filaments is therefore not known. To address this, we conduct the largest-scale simulations of the streaming instability to date, with computational domains up to 1. 6 gas scale heights both horizontally and vertically. The large dynamical range allows the effect of vertical gas stratification to become prominent. We observe more frequent merging and <b>splitting</b> of <b>filaments</b> in simulation boxes of high vertical extent. We find multiple filamentary concentrations of solids with an average separation of about 0. 2 local gas scale heights, much higher than the most unstable wavelength from linear stability analysis. This measures the characteristic separation of planetesimal forming events driven by the streaming instability and thus the initial feeding zone of planetesimals.

40|$|The fine {{structure}} of desmosomes and intercalated discs in the toad heart is discussed. A definite {{relationship between the}} dense components of these structures and the dense region of the Z band is demonstrated. The dense region of the Z band characteristically widens at its approach to the plasma membrane, and often terminates beneath it in a distinct discoidal plaque. Cardiac desmosomes appear to be structures which result from the intimate apposition of plaques of Z band material. These desmosomes retain the Z band function as sites of attachment for myofilaments. The suggestion is made that rotation of a desmosome through 90 ° and <b>splitting</b> of <b>filaments</b> from the adjacent sarcomere {{could result in the}} formation of a simple step-like intercalated disc. Intermediate stages in this process are illustrated. Complex discs present in the toad probably represent the alignment of groups of simple discs produced by contractile forces. Possible physiologic functions of the disc and desmosome are discussed. Other morphologic features of toad cardiac cells include a distinct amorphous outer coat to the sarcolemma, a prominent N band, and a granular sarcoplasm with poorly developed reticulum...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the multiple filaments formed by prefocused and freely propagating femtosecond laser pulses are investigated and compared. It is shown in our experiments that the diameter, length, stability, and interaction for the two cases can be quite different. The filaments formed by prefocused beam indicate dynamic spatial evolution with higher laser intensity and electron density. They have a typical diameter of 100 mu m are of shorter length. In the free propagation case, the filaments exhibit interesting properties such as hundred-meter propagation distance and mm-size diameter. Moreover, only {{the interaction of the}} filaments with the energy background affects the evolution of the filaments.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a filament in an old supernova remnant is investigated in two dimensions using analytical methods to determine its structure and stability and to show whether it collapses into a sheet or a cylinder. All parameters are assumed constant {{along the length of}} the feature. The cross section of the filament is found to flatten as it cools, and to degenerate into a thin sheet which is unstable to asymmetric warping disturbances. This probably leads to a number of parallel striations as the <b>filament</b> <b>splits</b> up, consistent with observations in the Cygnus Loop. The ratio of depth to width is typically 10 : 1, and so the feature may appear to be tubelike or a sheet, depending on perspective.

40|$|Bico fibers include {{bicomponent}} and biconstituent fibers. Bicomponent fibers are synthetic fibers {{made from}} two polymers of different chemical and physical structure. They {{are produced by}} common melt-drawing processes similar to conventional synthetic fibers. [1]. The biconstituent fiber consists of a continuous matrix of one polymer in which a different fiber-forming polymer is dispersed as a second distinct discontinuous phase; it as mix-polymer fiber or fascicular microfiber because the microfibers are connected {{to each other and}} can’t function independently from each other. [2]. Among bicomponent fibers, the bicomponent microfiber is different from the core-sheath type of bicomponent fiber. In theory bico fibers can be made from many polymers but in fact, they are made frequently from CoPET/PA because of cost factors. The core-sheath bico fiber, including such varieties as PE/PP, PE/PET and CoPET/PET are used as bonding fibers for hygiene and medical nonwovens. A cross-sectional morphology of bicomponent fibers can be classified into four main types:”core-sheath”,”side-by-side”,”pie-wedge” and “islands in the sea”. The core-sheath and side-by-side bicomponent fibres are the basic structures of bicomponent fibres. Methods for the preparation of more complex bicomponent nanofibres such as island-in-the-sea and pie-wedges have yet to be developed. This four basic configurations can be adapted in function of the desired fibre or yarn properties. It is for exemple possible {{to limit the number of}} islands to produce conductive yarns. On the other hand it is possible to provide a hole in the pie-wedge configuration to <b>split</b> the <b>filaments</b> even more easily. The newly created bicomponent fibre have new properties and can be applied in many new applications. Bicomponent fibres are actually being applied in the production of : microfibres (hygiene), non-wovens, antimicrobial textiles, elastic fibres, conductive fibres and composites...|$|R
40|$|When rabbit {{skeletal}} muscle myofibrils {{were treated with}} a solution containing 0. 1 mM Ca 2 + and 30 fig of leupeptin/ml, a-connectin, which forms very thin filaments in myofibrils, was split into /?-connectin and a 1, 200 -kDa subfragment. A part of ^-connectin located near the junction between ^-connectin and the subfragment seems to have an affinity for calcium ions and to be susceptible to the binding of large amounts of calcium ions. The calcium-binding site on / 9 -connectin is localized near the N 2 line in the I band, and the subfragment is localized adjacent to the Z disk. It is possible that connectin filaments change their elasticity during the contraction-relaxation cycle of {{skeletal muscle}} at the physiological concentration of calcium ions. Because postmortem skeletal muscles lose their elasticity and become plastic {{in association with the}} calcium-specific <b>splitting</b> of connectin <b>filaments,</b> the <b>splitting</b> {{is considered to be a}} factor in meat tenderization during postrigor ageing.

40|$|Abstract. Melt {{spinning}} of {{the fibers}} by supersonic air jet in the Laval nozzle is a novel, efficient and energy saving method of formation of super-thin fibers. In the process, polymer melt is extruded from {{a row of}} orifices and fast drawn by the pneumatic forces. In the modelling, air velocity, temperature and pressure distributions are computed from the k-ω aerodynamic model. Computations of the polymer air-drawing dynamics {{are based on the}} mathematical model of melt spinning in a single-, thin-filament approximation and Phan-Thien/Tanner non-linear viscoelasticity of the polymer melt. Axial profiles of the polymer velocity, temperature, tensile stress and rheological extra-pressure are computed. Influence of the Laval nozzle geometry, initial air compression, an initial melt temperature, a polymer mass output and the diameter of the melt extrusion die is discussed. The role of the polymer molecular weight, melt viscosity and relaxation time is considered. Example computations show the influence of important processing and material parameters. In the supersonic process, a high negative internal extra-pressure is predicted in the polymer melt under high elongation rates which may lead to cavitation and longitudinal burst <b>splitting</b> of the <b>filament</b> into a high number of sub-filaments. A hypothetical number of sub-filaments at the splitting is estimated from an energetic criterion. The diameter of the sub-filaments may reach the range of nano-fibers. A substantial influence of the Laval nozzle geometry is also predicted...|$|R
40|$|Helium {{bubble flow}} {{visualizations}} {{have been performed}} to study perpendicular interaction of a turbulent trailing vortex and a rectangular wing in the Virginia Tech Stability Tunnel. Many combinations of vortex strength, vortex-blade separation (Z(sub s)) and blade angle of attack were studied. Photographs of representative cases are presented. A range of phenomena were observed. For Z(sub s) greater than a few percent chord the vortex is deflected as it passes the blade {{under the influence of}} the local streamline curvature and its image in the blade. Initially the interaction appears to have no influence on the core. Downstream, however, the vortex core begins to diffuse and grow, presumably as a consequence of its interaction with the blade wake. The magnitude of these effects increases with reduction in Z(sub s). For Z(sub s) near zero the form of the interaction changes and becomes dependent on the vortex strength. For lower strengths the vortex appears to <b>split</b> into two <b>filaments</b> on the leading edge of the blade, one passing on the pressure and one passing on the suction side. At higher strengths the vortex bursts in the vicinity of the leading edge. In either case the core of its remnants then rapidly diffuse with distance downstream. Increase in Reynolds number did not qualitatively affect the flow apart from decreasing the amplitude of the small low-frequency wandering motions of the vortex. Changes in wing tip geometry and boundary layer trip had very little effect...|$|R
50|$|Streaming instabilities, first {{described}} by Andrew Youdin and Jeremy Goodman, {{are driven by}} differences in the motions of the gas and solid particles in the protoplanetary disk. The gas is hotter and denser closer to the star, creating a pressure gradient that partially offsets gravity from the star. The partial support of the pressure gradient allows the gas to orbit at roughly 50 m/s below the Keplerian velocity at its distance. The solid particles, however, are {{not supported by the}} pressure gradient and would orbit at Keplerian velocities {{in the absence of the}} gas. The difference in velocities results in a headwind that causes the solid particles to spiral toward the central star as they lose momentum to aerodynamic drag. The drag also produces a back reaction on the gas, increasing its velocity. When solid particles cluster in the gas, the reaction reduces the headwind locally, allowing the cluster to orbit faster and undergo less inward drift. The slower drifting clusters are overtaken and joined by isolated particles, increasing the local density and further reducing radial drift, fueling an exponential growth of the initial clusters. In simulations the clusters form massive filaments that can grow or dissipate, and that can collide and merge or <b>split</b> into multiple <b>filaments.</b> The separation of filaments averages 0.2 gas scale heights, roughly 0.02 AU at the distance of the asteroid belt. The densities of the filaments can exceed a thousand times the gas density, sufficient to trigger the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of the filaments into bound clusters.|$|R
60|$|As {{the goose}} has proved so little {{flexible}} in its organisation under long- continued domestication, {{the amount of}} variation which it has undergone may be worth giving. It has increased in size and in productiveness (8/25. L. Lloyd 'Scandinavian Adventures' 1854 volume 2 page 413, says that the wild goose lays from five to eight eggs, which is a much fewer number than that laid by our domestic goose.); and varies from white to a dusky colour. Several observers (8/26. The Rev. L. Jenyns (Blomefield) seems first to have made this observation in his 'British Animals.' See also Yarrell, and Dixon in his 'Ornamental Poultry' (page 139), and 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1857 page 45.) have stated that the gander is more frequently white than the goose, and that when old it almost invariably becomes white; {{but this is not}} the case with the parent-form, the A. ferus. Here, again, the law of analogous variation may have come into play, as the almost snow-white male of the Rock goose (Bernicla antarctica) standing on the sea-shore by his dusky partner is a sight well known to those who have traversed the sounds of Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. Some geese have top-knots; and the skull beneath, as before stated, is perforated. A sub-breed has lately been formed with the feathers reversed at the back of the head and neck. (8/27. Mr. Bartlet exhibited the head and neck of a bird thus characterised before the Zoological Soc. February 1860.) The beak varies a little in size, and is of a yellower tint than in the wild species; but its colour and that of the legs are both slightly variable. (8/28. W. Thompson 'Natural Hist. of Ireland' 1851 volume 3 page 31. The Rev. E.S. Dixon gave me some information on the varying colour of the beak and legs.) This latter fact deserves attention, because the colour of the legs and beak is highly serviceable in discriminating the several closely allied wild forms. (8/29. Mr. A. Strickland in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 3rd series volume 3 1859 page 122.) At our Shows two breeds are exhibited; viz., the Embden and Toulouse; but they differ in nothing except colour. (8/30. 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 1 1854 page 498; volume 3 page 210.) Recently a smaller and singular variety has been imported from Sebastopol (8/31. 'The Cottage Gardener' September 4, 1860 page 348.), with the scapular feathers (as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, who sent me specimens) greatly elongated, curled, and even spirally twisted. The margins of these feathers are rendered plumose by the divergence of the barbs and barbules, so that they resemble in some degree those on the back of the black Australian swan. These feathers are likewise remarkable from the central shaft, which is excessively thin and transparent, being <b>split</b> into fine <b>filaments,</b> which, after running for a space free, sometimes coalesce again. It is a curious fact that these filaments are regularly clothed on each side with fine down or barbules, precisely like those on the proper barbs of the feather. This structure of the feathers is transmitted to half-bred birds. In Gallus sonneratii the barbs and barbules blend together, and form thin horny plates of the same nature with the shaft: in this variety of the goose, the shaft divides into filaments which acquire barbules, and thus resemble true barbs.|$|R
60|$|Peduncle.--The {{membrane}} of the peduncle is thin; {{the whole}} surface is sparingly and quite irregularly studded with minute, much-branched filaments (Pl. IV, fig. 3, highly magnified); these are occasionally {{as much as}} l/5th of an inch in length; the degree of branching varies much, but is generally highly complex; the ordinary diameter of the branches is about 1/200th of an inch; their tips are rounded, and even a little enlarged, and frequently torn off, {{as if they had}} been attached to or buried in the flesh of the shark, in which the whole peduncle is imbedded. These filaments are formed of, and are continuous with the external transparent membrane of the peduncle, and they contain, up to the tips of every sub-branch, a hollow thread of corium, prolonged from the layer internally coating the whole peduncle. In all other Lepadidæ, the peduncle increases in length, chiefly at the summit where joined to the capitulum, and in diameter, throughout nearly its whole length, except close to the base; but, owing to the constant disintegration of the outer surface, the old outside coat does not split in defined lines, like the membrane of the capitulum. In Anelasma, however, owing to the imbedded position of the peduncle, the old outer coats are preserved, the lines in which they have split during continued growth being thus exhibited: those in the uppermost part almost symmetrically surround the peduncle, showing that here, as in other Lepadidæ, has been one regular line of growth; but in the lower part the lines are extremely irregular; and what is almost unique, it appears that the blunt basal end is constantly increasing in length and breadth, and, apparently, at a greater rate than any other part. I judge of this latter fact, from the whole bottom of the peduncle being covered with numerous curved, or nearly circular, lines of natural splitting, the nature of which can be best understood by examining the much-enlarged drawing (Pl. IV, fig. 3) of a small portion (taken by chance) of the membrane of the base, seen from the outside, and bearing some of the simplest branched filaments: other branches, as may be seen, have been cut off. This manner of growth explains the broad, blunt basal termination of the peduncle, so unlike that in other Lepadidæ. New membrane is formed, not continuously as in other cases, under the whole surface of the old membrane, but in irregular patches; thus the portion marked (a) runs under (b), but not under the little circles (c, c), for these are the last-formed portions and underlie the membrane (a) and (b). I do not understand how the splitting of the old membrane is effected; but no doubt it is by the same process by which the membrane of the capitulum in other genera, as in Scalpellum, splits symmetrically between the several valves. In the branched filaments it is particularly difficult to understand their growth, for it is not possible, after examining them, to doubt that they continue to increase, and send off sub-branches, which it would appear probable, penetrate the shark's flesh like roots. I may remark that one, or more commonly two or three branched filaments stand nearly in the centre of each circular line of exuviation or <b>splitting.</b> The branched <b>filaments</b> first commence as mere little pustules, and these appear to be most numerous at the bottom of the peduncle.|$|R
