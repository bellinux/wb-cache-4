5|$|Birds {{can act as}} vectors for {{spreading}} {{diseases such}} as psittacosis, <b>salmonellosis,</b> campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (avian tuberculosis), avian influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances. Some of these are zoonotic diseases that can also be transmitted to humans.|$|E
5|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} test on a blood sample from affected animals will confirm a suspected case by identifying the viral DNA, though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case. Prior {{to the development of}} the test, or in circumstances where it is not available, the disease may be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions which have a quick onset leading to rapid death, including encephalomyocarditis and <b>salmonellosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{forty percent}} of homes {{have at least one}} cat. Some {{contagious}} infections such as campylobacteriosis and <b>salmonellosis</b> cause visible symptoms of the disease in cats. Other infections, such as cat scratch disease and toxoplasmosis, have no visible symptoms and are carried by apparently healthy cats.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salmonellosis</b> {{has also}} been proven to be {{transmitted}} by the blow fly through saliva, feces and direct contact by the flies' tarsi. Adult flies {{may be able to}} spread pathogens via their sponging mouthparts, vomit, intestinal tract, sticky pads of their feet, or even their body or leg hairs.|$|E
25|$|During an {{outbreak}} of shigellosis in 1917, German professor Alfred Nissle isolated a strain of Escherichia coli from the feces of a soldier who was not affected by the disease. Methods of treating infectious diseases were needed at that time when antibiotics were not yet available, and Nissle used the E. coli Nissle 1917 strain in acute gastrointestinal infectious <b>salmonellosis</b> and shigellosis.|$|E
25|$|Zoonoses are of {{interest}} because they are often previously unrecognized diseases or have increased virulence in populations lacking immunity. The West Nile virus appeared in the United States in 1999 in the New York City area, and moved through {{the country in the}} summer of 2002, causing much distress. Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease, as are <b>salmonellosis,</b> Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme disease.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise, both commercially {{processed}} and home-made, {{has been associated}} with illnesses from Salmonella globally. The source of the Salmonella has been confirmed to be raw eggs. Several outbreaks with fatal cases have been recorded, with a few major incidents. In 1955 there was an outbreak in Denmark in which 10,000 people were affected by Salmonella from contaminated mayonnaise made by a large kitchen. The pH of the mayonnaise was found to be 5.1, with Salmonella count of 180,000 per gram. The second outbreak, also in Denmark, caused 41 infections with two fatalities. The pH of the contaminated mayonnaise was 6.0, with 6 million counts per gram. In 1976 there were serious <b>salmonellosis</b> outbreaks on four flights to and from Spain which caused 500 cases and 6 fatalities. In the US, 404 people became ill and nine died in a New York City hospital due to hospital-prepared mayonnaise. In all <b>Salmonellosis</b> cases, the major reason was improper acidification of the mayonnaise, with a pH level higher than the recommended upper limit of 4.1, with acetic acid as the main acidifying agent.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{collected}} or {{stored in}} unsanitary conditions may harbor {{a host of}} disease-causing organisms (pathogens), such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), the bacteria Campylobacter (Campylobacteriosis), Escherichia E. coli O157:H7), Listeria (Listeriosis), Salmonella (<b>Salmonellosis),</b> Yersinia (Yersinia enterocolitica), and Brucella (Brucellosis). Pasteurization consistently removes all of these pathogens, though they can be reintroduced if the product is handled carelessly. Thus dairy farms that pasteurize their milk can have unsanitary facilities without the attendant outbreaks of disease that would occur if a raw milk dairy kept its herds in similar unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|Major modern {{diseases}} such as Ebola virus disease and <b>salmonellosis</b> are zoonoses. HIV was a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, though it has now evolved to a separate human-only disease. Most strains of influenza that infect humans are human diseases, although many strains of swine and bird flu are zoonoses; these viruses occasionally recombine with human strains of the flu and can cause pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu or the 2009 swine flu. Taenia solium infection is one of the neglected tropical diseases with public health and veterinary concern in endemic regions. Zoonoses can be caused by a range of disease pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites; of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were zoonotic. Most human diseases originated in animals; however, only diseases that routinely involve animal to human transmission, like rabies, are considered direct zoonosis.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, 751 people {{contracted}} <b>salmonellosis,</b> 45of whom were hospitalized. There were no fatalities. Although an initial investigation by the Oregon Public Health Division and the Centers for Disease Control did not rule out deliberate contamination, the agents and fact of contamination were only discovered a year later. On February 28, 1985, Congressman James H. Weaver gave a speech in the United States House of Representatives in which he [...] "accused the Rajneeshees of sprinkling Salmonella culture on salad bar ingredients in eight restaurants".|$|E
500|$|The media {{revisited}} {{the incident}} during the 2001 anthrax {{attacks in the}} United States. The 2001 publication of Judith Miller's Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War, which contained an analysis and {{detailed description of the}} events, also brought discussion of the incident back into the news. Residents of The Dalles commented that they have an understanding of how bioterrorism can occur in the United States. The incident had spread fear in the community, and drained the local economy. All but one of the restaurants affected went out of business. In 2005, the Oregon State Land Board agreed to sell [...] of Wasco County, including Rajneeshpuram, to the Colorado-based youth ministry Young Life. On February 18, 2005, Court TV aired an episode of Forensic Files about the incident, entitled: [...] "'Bio-Attack' â€“ Oregon Cult Poisonings". The <b>salmonellosis</b> outbreak was also discussed in the media {{within the context of the}} 2006 North American E. coli outbreak.|$|E
500|$|Months later, {{starting}} on September 16, 1985, Rajneesh, {{who had recently}} emerged from a four-year period of public silence and self-imposed isolation (although he had continued to meet with his assistant) at the commune, convened press conferences: he stated that Sheela and 19 other commune leaders, including Puja, had left Rajneeshpuram {{over the weekend and}} gone to Europe. He said that he had received information from commune residents that Sheela and her team had committed a number of serious crimes. Calling them a [...] "gang of fascists", he said they had tried to poison his doctor and Rajneesh's female companion, as well as the Jefferson County district attorney and the water system in The Dalles. He said that he believed they had poisoned a county commissioner and Judge William Hulse, and that they may have been responsible for the <b>salmonellosis</b> outbreak in The Dalles. He invited state and federal law enforcement officials to the Ranch to investigate. His allegations were initially greeted with skepticism by outside observers.|$|E

2500|$|Raw feeders [...] {{claim that}} the stomach enzymes and short {{intestinal}} tracts of dogs and cats allow them to handle harmful bacteria. There has been a reported case where two cats fed a raw diet developed <b>salmonellosis</b> and died as a result. A veterinarian from the National Animal Poison Control Center suggests that the diarrhea in animals that raw feeders attribute to detoxing could be caused by pathogens such as Salmonella, E. coli, Clostridium and Campylobacter. Bacteria proliferation in any meat can be reduced by following proper food safety practices such as defrosting meat in the refrigerator; harmful bacteria can be largely eliminated from meat by cooking.|$|E
2500|$|Pasteurization is a {{sanitation}} {{process in}} which milk is heated briefly to a temperature high enough to kill pathogens, followed by rapid cooling. While different times and temperatures may be used by different processors, pasteurization is most commonly achieved with heating to 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.7 degrees Celsius) for 15 seconds. Milk is tested following pasteurization to confirm that bacteria have been killed to an acceptable level. Pasteurization kills pathogenic bacteria which occasionally may be present in milk, including those causing tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), listeriosis (Listeria monocytogenes), Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), brucellosis (Brucella), campylobacteriosis (Campylobacter), <b>salmonellosis</b> (Salmonella), and several other foodborne illnesses (e.g., [...] ). Pasteurization may not kill some resistant bacteria, which can eventually cause souring and spoilage of fresh milk. UHT pasteurization (Ultra High Temperature) is a more extreme form of pasteurization heating milk to a temperature high enough to kill spoilage organisms also.|$|E
50|$|<b>Salmonellosis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of {{diarrhea}} globally. In 2015, 90,300 deaths occurred from non-typhoidal and 178,000 deaths from typhoidal <b>salmonellosis.</b> In the United States about 1.2 million cases and 450 deaths occur from non-typhoidal <b>salmonellosis</b> a year. In Europe it is the second most common foodborne disease after campylobacteriosis.|$|E

5000|$|The 2008 United States <b>salmonellosis</b> {{outbreak}} was {{an outbreak}} of <b>salmonellosis</b> across multiple [...] U.S. states due to Salmonella enterica serovar Saintpaul. Over {{the course of the}} outbreak, 1442 cases were identified across 43 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Canada. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigation determined that jalapeÃ±o peppers imported from Mexico as well as Serrano peppers were major sources of the outbreak. Tomatoes may have been a source as well. The outbreak lasted from April to August, 2008.|$|E
50|$|Salmonella {{bacteria}} {{can be found}} in almost any product or animal that has been exposed to fecal matter. These exposures can occur from crops grown from waste-based fertilizers or from food items handled by infected humans. <b>Salmonellosis</b> is an intestinal disease, meaning that the bacteria must be ingested and processed through the intestines in order for infection to occur. Thus, <b>salmonellosis</b> is commonly spread to humans through ingestion of contaminated food items. It can also be spread through contact with reptiles and birds, usually after the person handles the animal or its environment (without hand-washing immediately) and then touches their mouth or food items. Those infected usually develop symptoms anywhere from 12-72 hours after first contact with Salmonella bacteria, and most do not require serious medical attention. This <b>salmonellosis</b> displays itself in humans with fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and, most commonly, diarrhea for a period of up to 7 days. Those requiring hospitalization usually are dehydrated or have extreme diarrhea, which can turn deadly, especially if the salmonella bacteria reaches the bloodstream. The elderly, young children, and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk for developing <b>salmonellosis</b> and suffering severe reactions. The most common serotypes of Salmonella in the United States and Europe are Enteritidis and Typhimurium.|$|E
