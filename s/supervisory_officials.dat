40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{standard for}} supervisory liability in Section 1983 cases {{has been a}} source of considerable disagreement among federal courts of appeals. In the absence of established Supreme Court authority on the subject, courts have rejected vicarious and negligence liability in favor of a higher culpability requirement, but they have not agreed on precisely what form this higher standard should take. In this article, the Author addresses the need for a uniform standard consistent with the statute 2 ̆ 7 s twin goals of compensating the victims of constitutional violations and deterring constitutional infractions. The author notes at the outset that lower courts have unjustifiably relied on Supreme Court opinions discussing state-of-mind requirements for particular constitutional violations and cases addressing municipal liability in Section 1983 suits in formulating the requirements for supervisory liability. She then identifies five factors considered by courts in determining whether supervisory liability should be imposed on the facts of particular cases: (1) the existence of prior similar incidents; (2) the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s response to such incidents; (3) the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s response to the specific incident involved in the suit; (4) the extent to which the supervisor caused the violation; and (5) the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s awareness of the constitutional wrongdoing. Application of these factors has led to inconsistent results in similar cases, the author argues. She further contends that the courts in general have to readily ruled in favor of <b>supervisory</b> <b>officials.</b> As a substantive matter, the author asserts, the standard of supervisory liability should be a national one. In addition, the author advocates a meaningful standard of culpability, which she concludes is best satisfied by a negligence standard. Liability for supervisory negligence is consistent with Supreme Court precedent as well as Section 19832 ̆ 7 s causation requirement, and concerns about protecting blameless supervisors are already assuaged by the qualified immunity defense available to executive branch officials, which the author suggests should shield supervisors if a reasonable public official in their position would not have realized that the actions taken by their subordinates violated the Constitution. The author thus concludes that it makes sense to hold <b>supervisory</b> <b>officials</b> accountable for constitutional violations caused by their negligence in supervising, training, or disciplining their subordinates...|$|E

40|$|Prior to the Supreme Court’s 2009 {{decision}} in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, {{the federal courts}} generally acknowledged that high-ranking government officials could {{be held liable for}} the constitutional injuries inflicted by their subordinates, though they differed on the appropriate standard of supervisory liability. In Iqbal, the Supreme Court called this case law into question, holding that constitutional tort liability hinges on proof that each defendant, “through the official’s own individual actions, has violated the Constitution. ” The Court’s cursory treatment of this issue, without the benefit of briefing or oral argument, was based entirely on the misguided assumption that the doctrine of supervisory liability is indistinguishable from respondent superior. This article critiques Iqbal’s discussion of supervisory liability, responding to the Court and those who have defended its ruling. The article then turns to the qualified immunity defense and the federal courts’ analysis of immunity issues in litigation involving <b>supervisory</b> <b>officials.</b> It is tempting to criticize Iqbal’s analysis of supervisory liability on the grounds that qualified immunity sufficiently addresses the relevant governmental interests and protects high-ranking public officials. But that objection is itself subject to challenge given the complications that arise in applying the qualified immunity defense to supervisors. The article explores those difficulties and criticizes the bifurcated approach to qualified immunity adopted by some courts, which immunizes a supervisor unless both the subordinate’s constitutional violation and the supervisor’s liability for that violation are clearly established. The interests underlying the immunity defense are adequately accommodated, the article concludes, if qualified immunity is denied to a supervisor who is deliberately indifferent to a subordinate’s violation of clearly established constitutional law. Finally, the article assesses Iqbal’s impact on efforts to hold supervisors accountable for constitutional wrongdoing, explaining that, stripped to its essential holding, the opinion need not inexorably lead to a wholesale reworking of the doctrine of supervisory liability. The Court’s attention was directed to the mental state required to impose liability on a high-ranking government official, and its references to discriminatory purpose and supervisory policy-making were linked to the specific allegations contained in Iqbal’s complaint. Moreover, following the lead of some federal appellate courts, the Court may have assumed that <b>supervisory</b> <b>officials</b> do violate constitutional norms when they act with the state of mind required to violate a particular constitutional provision and fail to adequately supervise the subordinate who inflicted constitutional injury. Such a failure to act {{in the face of a}} legal duty would suffice to establish criminal culpability on an accomplice liability theory, and public officials should at the very least be expected to live up to that standard. The record in the federal courts of appeals since Iqbal is somewhat sparse and inconclusive, and does not yet reliably indicate how expansively the courts will interpret the Supreme Court’s ruling. But absent further clarification from the Supreme Court, the decision need not be interpreted as working a sea change in the rules governing supervisory accountability for constitutional torts...|$|E
40|$|The current {{trend towards}} the {{adoption}} of retreat longwall mining methods and the associated rapid development of the access drivages has exacerbated the environmental conditions experienced within these workings. The combined use of roof bolt and continuous miner systems has improved the face advance rate within rapid development drivages. In order to maintain adequate dust and gas control {{it is essential that}} the auxiliary ventilation and monitoring systems are correctly installed and maintained. The causes of many potential environmental hazards experienced within auxiliary ventilated rapid development drivages, are often attributed to a failure by the workforce and <b>supervisory</b> <b>officials</b> to maintain the correct installation, maintenance and operational standards of the ventilation and mining systems. The potential ventilation hazards encountered may include: the failure to deliver the required fresh air quantity and velocity to rapidly dilute and disperse methane gas liberated {{in the vicinity of the}} cutting face, or the failure to maintain sufficient exhaust air quantity in the vicinity of the cut to adequately capture dust produced on cutting and loading of the extracted mineral. Results of recent research studies have demonstrated that validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models can adequately replicate examples of good and bad ventilation. CFD models may be constructed and solved to examine the relative ventilation benefits produced by alternative mining and auxiliary ventilation configurations. These models enable the practitioner to predict and visualise the velocity, pressure and contaminant fields within an auxiliary ventilated drivage. This research project has developed a prototype educational aid, which animates and visualises these airflow and pollutant dispersion patterns within a Virtual Reality (VR) model. By introducing a pollutant such as methane into the CFD models, the VR simulation highlights regions of potential methane concentration build-up to the trainee.

NIOSH developed this prospective roster with the following objectives: (1) to create a record of those who participated in the Deepwater Horizon response cleanup activities, (2) to collect information on the nature of their projected work assignments and training received, and (3) to create a mechanism for contacting them about possible work-related symptoms of illness or injury, as needed.

40|$|My {{study of}} {{undercover}} policing explores {{the ways in}} which democratic legal systems change when they legalize highly contested police practices that have long been quietly tolerated and accorded minimal scrutiny. Undercover policing is a prime of example of such a practice. It has long been subject to remarkably little legislative oversight and systematic regulation in the United States and Western Europe. It exists in a twilight of legality—a necessary evil, but one inviting anxieties about its legitimacy and consonance with the rule of law. Under pressure from the European Court of Human Rights, Germany (along with other Western European countries) has attempted to regulate covert operations in a more systematic fashion. The German experience examined in my article suggests {{how difficult it is to}} tame and legitimate a constantly changing and normatively contested practice such as undercover policing. The article contrasts German attempts to create an explicit legal basis for this power –and a comprehensive regulatory system – with American willingness to leave covert practices largely unregulated. The article focuses on the consequences of these divergent approaches for the legitimacy of covert practices. German legal and administrative reforms succeeded in improving legitimacy along some dimensions while undermining it along others, and, indeed, introducing new bases on which the legitimacy of undercover police work is subject to challenge. In the United States, by contrast, law enforcement agencies have succeeded in defusing a variety of reform initiatives through internal reforms, with little legislative or judicial supervision. As a result, many problems of legitimacy persist – with little visibility. American challenges to the legitimacy of covert tactics now focus less on criminal cases than on the use of such tactics in domestic intelligence investigation. My analysis of German covert policing rests on 89 field interviews that I conducted between 2002 and 2004 with state and federal police officials, undercover agents, training and <b>supervisory</b> <b>officials,</b> control officers, prosecutors, and judges in fifteen of the sixteen German states. I also compared evidence from interviews with a variety of written sources, including ministry guidelines, training materials, prosecutors’ memoranda, judicial opinions, scholarly criticism, and news stories. The open-ended, qualitative field interviews are at the heart of the project. They help to uncover the principles animating otherwise shadowy German covert operations. And they illustrate the dilemmas inherent in the practices; the obstacles to reform; and the different tradeoffs which the American and German regulatory systems have made in securing the legitimacy of these practices...|$|E
