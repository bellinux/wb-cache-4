Even when students stated they belonged in STEM they sometimes expressed feeling others did not feel they belonged due to not fitting a stereotype. For example, a white female biology major stated “I think sometimes you have to work a little harder to be taken seriously as a blonde female.” Additionally, having commonalities with others privileges white males in forming interpersonal relationships, which are shown to be important for persistence. Students from underrepresented groups sometimes described difficulties engaging in group work where {{the rest of the group}} was entirely white men.|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} review, {{we argue that}} the {{cognitive}} science literature has much to glean from future studies considering how the <b>STEM</b> pedagogy <b>benefits</b> from hands-on activities, designed to bolster the conceptual knowledge underlying scientific learning. We begin this discussion by clarifying the definition of grounded cognition, a controversial term than {{has been applied to}} several distinct theories, and then direct the discussion to grounded theories of abstract (e.g., lacking a real-world referent) conceptual processing and representation in the human brain. Finally, we explore possible ways that learning interventions based on theories of GC can <b>benefit</b> students in <b>STEM</b> fields by proposing new empirical directions, bolstering the field’s current understanding of the benefits of tactile learning in both live and virtual environments.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Cardiac {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} cause of death and reach epidemic proportions with aging. Advanced heart disease results from an abrupt or progressive loss of contractile cardiomyocytes. Following percutaneous coronary intervention and revascularization regenerative medicine aims at effectively repair damaged tissue and replacement of lost cardiomyocytes. However, mixed results were obtained from trials using bone marrow-derived <b>stem</b> cells. <b>Benefits</b> were rather attributed to paracrine effects leading to inhibition or reverse of negative remodeling processes than to regeneration of viable cardiomyocytes. Thus the aim of regenerative medicine, in particular stem cell research, to generate viable cardiac muscle has so far not been achieved in humans, reflecting our incomplete understanding of underlying bio-logical mechanisms. Moreover, there is growing evidence that substantial person-to-person differences in the outcome of stem cell therapy exists. We here review our present knowledge in evolving stem cell based cardiovascular medicine and highlight personalized aspects of stem cell interventions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{offers a}} "best evidence" {{approach}} to summarizing recent benefit-cost analyses of international agricultural research in Africa. First, from an extensive literature review {{and the resulting}} global inventory of impact studies, 23 studies are identified that calculate aggregate rates of return for Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and partner investments in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). These studies are then appraised against a review framework consisting of principles, criteria, and indicators for study rigor. Subsequently, the economic benefits reported by studies grouped {{on the basis of}} its analytical rigor are aggregated and set against total investment by the CGIAR and national agricultural research systems to determine if the total investment to date can be justified by documented benefits under a range of assumptions. As a result, the study finds that aggregate investment is justified under a fairly wide range of suppositions. Under all scenarios, the vast majority of documented <b>benefits</b> <b>stem</b> from a relatively limited array of activities with a majority of <b>benefits</b> <b>stemming</b> from biological control (80 %). Close to 20 % of total benefits result from crop genetic improvement, and less than 1 % result from all other activities. The implications of these results for research investment strategies in SSA and impact assessment are discussed. Copyright (c) 2010 International Association of Agricultural Economists. ...|$|R
