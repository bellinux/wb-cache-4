40|$|In {{addition}} to global warming, {{the frequency and}} the intensity of droughts will probably increase in central and southern Europe. Resulting climate changes and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> could alter tree growth, according to sensitivity of each species. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the growth response of three European species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea and Pinus sylvestris) to climatic variations and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> in the same temperate forest. Three mature stands per species were sampled to obtain earlywood, latewood and total ring chronologies from 1960 to 2007. Climate-growth relationships were established by bootstrapped correlations and response function analysis. Monthly bioclimatic regressors were simulated by a physiological water balance model that used daily climatic data and stand parameters to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits.</b> Our results highlighted a common sensitivity to precipitation from May to July for the dominant tree growth of the three species but also differences in the species vulnerability to climate and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits.</b> Beech was the most sensitive species to the climatic conditions of the current growing season. Beech growth was positively correlated with precipitation from May to July and negatively with maximal temperatures in June and July. Oak growth was negatively correlated with minimal temperatures in the previous August and September and positively with precipitation in the previous October and December during pointer years. This led to long-term consequences for growth, probably due to carbon reserve depletion. Pine growth was positively influenced by warm December but was also vulnerable to maximal temperatures and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> from June to August. The climate in August only influenced the pine growth probably because the growing season of pine was longer than that of the deciduous species. For both oak and pine, latewood was the component that was most sensitive to climatic variations and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits.</b> According to the study findings, an increase in the frequency {{and the intensity of}} droughts could affect the three species. Maximum summer temperatures could have negative impacts for beech and pine growth. Dry and warm autumns could lead to long-term consequences and decrease the oak growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Water is {{the most}} crucial factor in {{affecting}} plant growth and production. In order to assess the complex relationship between plant and water,a dynamic model of crop growth was constructed by interlinking plant growth and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> models. The growth model mainly consists of physiological processes, i. e. photosynthesis, respiration, partitioning, leaf growth and phenological development. The photosynthesis and partitioning models are based on SUCROS, extended in two ways, the calculation of light use efficiency {{as a function of}} air temperature and extinction coefficient as a function of LAI. The development model was calculated based on thermal time concept. Water balance model comprises evaporation and transpiration as water losses, and rainfall and irrigation as water sources at 1 m - depth. Evaporation was based on Penmann Monteith formula. Both models were linked by relating the degree of growth reduction to <b>water</b> <b>deficits.</b> Simulation results showed a good agreement with observed data in predicting <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> and crop <b>water</b> use for all of the treatments, i. e. irrigated, irrigated just after flowering, dry and rainfed.

40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} was to elucidate the physiological causes {{of the influence of}} <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> on grain-filling and rice (Oryza sativa) yield by evaluating enzyme activities involved in sucrose-starch synthesis during the grain-filling period. Methods Two rice cultivars (‘Shanyou 63 ’ and ‘Pc 311 /Zaoxiandang’) were grown in cement containers. Controlled <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> was imposed at 9 th day after flowering because the division of endosperm cells is sensitive to water deficit. The activities of key enzymes involved in the metabolism of sucrose to starch during grain-filling were evaluated. Important findings The 1000 -grain weight and rice yield under <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> were significantly decreased. The key enzyme activities, including sucrose synthase, adenine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase, soluble starch synthase and starch branching enzyme, involved in the metabolism of sucrose to starch were significantly increased under <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> during 10 – 20 days after anthesis. However, the activities of these enzymes under soil water-deficit were decreased rapidly 20 – 30 days after flowering compared to well-watered treatments. Active grain-filling periods of the water-deficit treatments were shortened {{as a result of the}} decrease of starch accumulation. Therefore, the rapid decline of the key enzyme activities involved in sucrose to starch metabolism andthe shortage of assimilation supply at 20 – 30 days after anthesis are reasons for decreases in grain weight and yield under <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> conditions...|$|E
40|$|Tolerance to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> is a {{priority}} of many maize breeding programs. Its genetic analysis requires estimators that characterize each genotype in a reproducible way. For that, we have tested and compared the abilities of hybrids to maintain leaf growth in a large range of soil water potentials (i) in a phenotyping platform that measured leaf elongation rate and (ii) in a network of field experiments via an estimator of the sensitivity of grain number to water deficit. Tolerance to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> was estimated in a network of 14 field experiments via the regression between yield components and soil water potential measured with tensiometers. A drought index was obtained by averaging soil water potential, measured with tensiometers, for the phenological phase during which grain number was determined (evaluated for each individual hybrid in each site). It closely correlated with grain number {{in each of the}} 19 hybrids that were analyzed over 14 environmental situations in France, Hungary and Chile. The slope of the regression line between drought index and grain number, established for each hybrid, was taken as an estimate of the sensitivity to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> of that hybrid. Sensitivity estimated in this way varied 2 -fold in the set of studied hybrids, and correlated with that of leaf growth to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> in short-term experiments in the phenotyping platform.

40|$|Growth {{and carbon}} (C) fluxes are {{severely}} altered in plants exposed to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit.</b> Correspondingly, {{it has been}} suggested that plants under water deficit suffer from C shortage. In this study, we test this hypothesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) by providing an overview of the responses of growth, C balance, metabolites, enzymes of the central metabolism, and a set of sugar-responsive genes to a sustained <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit.</b> The results show that under drought, rosette relative expansion rate is decreased more than photosynthesis, leading to a more positive C balance, while root growth is promoted. Several soluble metabolites accumulate in response to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit,</b> with K+ and organic acids as the main contributors to osmotic adjustment. Osmotic adjustment costs only a small percentage of the daily photosynthetic C fixation. All C metabolites measured (not only starch and sugars but also organic acids and amino acids) show a diurnal turnover that often increased under water deficit, suggesting that these metabolites are readily available for being metabolized in situ or exported to roots. On the basis of 30 enzyme activities, no in-depth reprogramming of C metabolism was observed. Water deficit induces a shift of the expression level of a set of sugar-responsive genes that is indicative of increased, rather than decreased, C availability. These results converge to show that the differential impact of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> on photosynthesis and rosette expansion results in an increased availability of C for the roots, an increased turnover of C metabolites, and a low-cost C-based osmotic adjustment, and these responses are performed without major reformatting of the primary metabolism machinery...|$|E
40|$|Summary Effects of flurprimidol on plant water {{relations}} and leaf gas exchange were investigated in one-year-old white ash (Fraxinus americana L.) seedlings subjected to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits.</b> Flurprimidol (20 mg kg- 1 of soil equivalent) {{was applied to}} the soil surface of pot-grown seedlings after shoot growth was completed. Two months after flurprimidol appli-cation, water was withheld from one-half of the seedlings. Leaf water {{relations and}} gas exchange parameters were measured 5, 7, 10, 14, 18 and 22 days after withholding water. Under both irrigated and nonirrigated conditions, flurprimidol treatment resulted in reduced net CO 2 assimilation rate and transpira-tional water loss of seedlings as a result of decreased stomatal conductance. Consequently, flurprimidol-treated seedlings had higher leaf water potential and relative water content than untreated seedlings. Nonirrigated flurprimidol-treated seed-lings also had greater turgor and sap osmolality and lower osmotic potential at full turgor than seedlings in the other treatments, indicating that flurprimidol increased osmotic ad-justment. Under water-stress conditions, water use efficiency was lower and gas exchange efficiency was higher in flurprimi-dol-treated seedlings than in untreated seedlings, suggesting that flurprimidol treatment enhances survival of plants sub-jected to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits...</b>|$|R

Continuous sap flow measurements were performed on six trees to monitor changes in tree transpiration rates. A reduction in sap flow velocity was observed in the period between late-September and late-October 2003. Precipitation amounts for this period were limited resulting in a corresponding low soil matric potential. A clear reduction in sap flow velocity occurred when soil matric potential at a 10 cm depth was ＜ － 70 (kPa). Sap flow velocity scaled for 1. 0 kPa vapor pressure deficit declined by 42 ％ when soil matric potential at a 10 cm depth was ＜ － 70 (kPa) compared to － 70 (kPa). In addition, intensive leaf- scale physiological measurements were performed on two days that had contrasting soil matric potentials. The intensive measurements showed lower leaf transpiration rates and stomatal conductance on the day with the lower soil matric potential. This finding suggests <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> caused stomatal closure and therefore reduction in tree transpiration.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> on the seed yield and the yield components of safflower plants. Four plants were grown in a 1 / 200 O a Wagner pot containing soil, chemical fertilizer and compost. Ample amount of water was supplied before the completion of differentiation of an lateral buds (May 27). After this stage, water was supplied to reach a level of 90 %, 60 % or 40 % of the maximum water-holding capacity of the soil, twice a day. The results obtained were as follows. 1. Water deficit treatments inhibited the internode elongation of the main stem, resulting in a short main stem, and inhibited strongly the growth of lateral buds at the lower nodes (Table 1). 2. The number of leaves, number of bracts and total number of leaves and bracts in the main stem were not affected by <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit.</b> In the uppermost branch, reduction in the soil water content did not affect the total number of leaves and bracts, but the number of leaves decreased, though not significantly, and the number of bracts increased in the 40 % plot (Table 2). 3. <b>Soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> decreased significantly the mean area of leaf and bract and the total area of leaves and bracts of the plant (Table 3). 4. <b>Soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> at a level of 40 % of the maximum water-holding capacity of the soil delayed the flowering of the heads of the uppermost branches, while no effects were observed on the flowering of the head of the main stem (Table 4). 5. The number of seeds and seed yield (dry weight) per plant were considerably decreased by <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit,</b> whereas the number of florets, percentage of ripened seeds, number of seeds and seed dry weight per head were not affected (Table 6). It was evident that the decrease in seed yield per plant was caused by the decrease in the number of heads per plant, which resulted from the decrease in the number of branches.

As compared with what is usually observed at this site the ecosystem dissipated less energy via latent heat flux and more via sensible heat flux. The understorey canopy was responsible for a variable, significant component of the whole canopy fluxes of water vapour and carbon dioxide. The annual contribution of the understorey was 38 % (154 mm) of the overall evaporation (399 mm) and 32 % (89 mm) of the overall sensible heat flux (274 mm). The participation of the understorey reached 45 % of the overall evaporation and 30 % of the daytime overall assimilation during significant <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> periods in summertime.

The irrigated block received scheduled irrigation from planting until maturity, while the rain fed block received irrigation prior to germination only. Agronomic traits measured were plant height, stem diameter, biomass, flowering date, panicle exertion, panicle length, leaf area, grain yield, and thousand seed mass at Potchefstroom and Taung experiments. Drought susceptibility index (DSI) was quantified using the formula: DSI = [1 - (Ydi/ Ypi) ]/ [1 - (YD/YP) ] and %yield reduction (%YR) was calculated using the formula: %YR = (Ypi –Ydi) / Ypi x 100. Significant variations among genotypes with regard to grain yield (GYLD), plant height (PH), panicle length (PL), biomass (BM), stem diameter (SD), panicle exertion (PEx), and 1000 seed mass (TSM) were observed at Potchefstroom under rain fed conditions, while under irrigated conditions significant variations were only observed for GYLD, PH, PL, BM, days to 50 % flowering (DF), SD, leaf area (LA), PEx and TSM. At Potchefstroom genotypes varied significantly with regard to PH, PL, BM, DF, SD, LA, PEx and TSM under rain fed conditions, while under irrigated conditions genotypes varied with all traits measured with exception of harvest index (HI) and relative water content (RWC). At Potchefstroom, <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> significantly affected GYLD, PH, HI, PEx and RWC, while at Potchefstroom <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> significantly affected GYLD, PH, SD, LA, PEx, TSM and RWC. Genotypes varied with their level of resistance/ susceptibility to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> at both Potchefstroom and Taung. Some remarkable correlations among traits measured were observed under rain fed and irrigated conditions and across the treatments at both Potchefstroom and Taung. At Potchefstroom, significant correlation was only observed between drought susceptibility index (DSI) and PH under rain fed conditions, while at Potchefstroom negative and significant correlation was only observed between DSI and GYLD under rain fed conditions. At Potchefstroom, GYLD under rain fed significantly related to GYLD under irrigated conditions and across the treatments. However, GYLD under irrigated conditions significantly related to GYLD across the treatments. At Potchefstroom, GYLD under rain fed conditions significantly correlated with GYLD across <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> regimes, while GYLD under irrigated conditions significantly correlated with GYLD across the treatments. Genotypes that exhibited the combination of high yield potential and resistant traits were recommended. Genotypes that exhibited high resistant traits with low yield potential were recommended for breeders to incorporate those traits into susceptible genotypes with high yield potential.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} on three field trials of wheat cv. Kopara to investigate the lack of compensation by later determined components of yield because of early disease constraints. The investigation {{was based on the}} hypothesis that early disease reduces root development and thus causes the plants to be water constrained at later growth stages when <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> usually occur. The reduced root development and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> may reduce the ability of the plant to compensate for reductions in early determined components. The hypothesis was tested by the application of irrigation to alleviate water stress. In a disease free crop, the possible phytotonic effects of the fungicides benomyl and triadimefon on wheat were investigated. These fungicides had no phytotonic effects on shoot, root growth, or yield under the prevailing conditions. The effect of disease on root development was analysed by root length measurements. Disease present in the crop at any stage of growth affected root development. Root development in the upper zones of the soil profile was reduced more by disease compared to those zones below 35 cm. A full disease epidemic reduced root development more than an early or late disease epidemic. The early and late disease epidemics had similar effects on root length. Alleviation of early disease constraints enabled greater development of roots to offset any earlier reductions. <b>Soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> increased root development in the lower zones of the nil disease plants. The presence of adequate <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> from irrigation reduced the requirement for further root growth in all treatments. In the 1981 - 1982 field trial a full disease epidemic reduced yield by 14 % whereas an early disease epidemic reduced yield by 7 %. The reduction in yield was attributed to a lower grain number. With irrigation the yield reduction in the full disease plants was 12 % whereas in the early disease plants the reduction was only 2. 4 %. This indicated that plants affected by the early disease epidemic were water constrained. In this study, the results suggested that, for conditions prevailing in Canterbury, the supply of water at later growth stages increased grain weight in plants which were subject to early disease epidemics. This suggests that reduced root development caused by early disease and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> may prevent compensation by grain weight. Water use was similar in all disease treatments. After irrigation the irrigated plants of all treatments used more water. Disease affected water use in relation to yield production however, and was better expressed by water use efficiency. Water use efficiency was reduced in the full disease plants. A stepwise regression analysis suggested that water use efficiency was affected directly by disease at later growth stages, and indirectly via an effect on total green leaf area at early growth stages. This study partially proves the hypothesis that reductions in root development caused by an early disease epidemic may constrain the plants at later growth stages when <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> usually occur. It was shown that the reduction in root development caused by disease could be counteracted by irrigation. In this respect, water served as a tool to study the effect of disease constraints on the yield of wheat. A knowledge of cereal crop physiology, root growth and function is used to explain and discuss the observations made in this research programme. The results are discussed in relation {{to the way in which}} disease affects yield through its effect on root development. The possible reasons for the continued effects of disease even after the control of disease at later growth stages are discussed. The economic use of fungicides and water in diseased crops are also outlined. Suggestions for future studies on disease-yield loss relationships are provided. The repetition of these experiments in different sites and climatic regions could provide information which may be incorporated in disease-yield loss simulation models. This could then be used to predict root development and water requirements of diseased plants, and provide a basis for economic use of fungicides and water, and for better disease management programmes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of controlled <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> on sprouting and shoot growth of Canada thistle, coltsfoots and quackgrass. A gradient of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> contents was created by establishing different densities of barley. The plants were harvested 14 days after watering was stopped. On Canada thistle and coltsfoots, relative water content (RWC) in leaves was measured prior to harvest and biomass of all weed shoots were recorded at harvest. In terms of shoot biomass and leaf RWC quackgrass was drought tolerant while coltsfoot was drought sensitive and Canada thistle was between the two. The barley cover crop could have had a competitive effect upon the growth of the weeds; the effect, however, was not detrimental compared to the drought effect, because relationships between initial height and the final height of coltsfoot and Canada thistle were not different among barley densities. The results suggest that the shooting from subterranean parts of broadleaf perennial weeds can to some extent be impeded by reducing <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> availability. However, the use of reduced <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content can be challenging in fields in humid temperate regions...|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} drought on the physiology of 41 -year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in central Scotland. Measurements were made of the seasonal course of transpiration, canopy stomatal conductance, needle water potential, xylem water content, soil-to-needle hydraulic resistance, and growth. Comparison was made between drought-treated plots and those receiving average precipitation. In response to drought, transpiration rate declined once volu-metric water content (VWC) over the top 20 cm of soil reached a threshold value of 12 %. Thereafter, transpiration was a near linear function of soil water content. As the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> developed, the hydraulic resistance between soil and needles increased {{by a factor of}} three as predawn needle water potential declined from- 0. 54 to- 0. 71 MPa. A small but significant increase in xylem embolism was detected in 1 -year-old shoots. Stomatal control of transpiration prevented needle water po-tential from declining below- 1. 5 MPa. Basal area, and shoot and needle growth were significantly reduced in the drought treatment. In the year following the drought, canopy stomatal conductance and soil-to-needle hydraulic resistance recovered. Current-year needle extension recovered, but a significant re-duction in basal area increment was evident one year after the drought. The results suggest that, in response to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit,</b> mature Scots pine closes its stomata sufficiently to prevent the development of substantial xylem embolism. Re-duced growth in the year after a severe <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> is most likely {{to be the result of}} reduced assimilation in the year of the drought, rather than to any residual embolism carried over from one year to the next...|$|E
40|$|Soil water {{resulting}} from episodic growing season rain-fall evaporates rapidly in semi-arid regions. Plants may {{not benefit from}} such water additions if near-surface roots are unable to resume water uptake rapidly fol-lowing periods of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit.</b> Our objectives were to develop a means of quantifying root uptake responses in the upper soil layer following rewetting after <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit,</b> and to evaluate the existence of genotypic differences among four diverse barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes in this regard. Plants were grown in replicate soil columns having hydraulically isolated surface and subsoil layers, and instrumented with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) waveguides. The upper 0. 05 m soil layer was allowed to dry to — 1. 8 to — 3. 0 MPa for 10 - 14 d, during which time subsoil wetness was maintained at about — 0. 6 to — 0. 7 MPa. The time-course of soil water uptake was monitored at 0. 5 h intervals following rewetting of the surface layer. Substantial water uptake began 1 d after rewetting following 10 d, and 2 - 3 d after rewet-ting following 14 d of water deficit. Rate of water uptake was more rapid {{in response to a}} second rewet-ting 5 - 7 d later. Consistent genotypic responses in terms of cumulative water uptake on a whole plant and leaf area-specific basis were observed during each trial. These results have application to evaluating drought hardiness and interspecific competitive ability under semi-arid conditions, and to investigations of root physiological and morphological changes that contribute to recovery from water deficit.

40|$|Thermal imaging {{has been}} used in the past for remote {{detection}} of regions of canopy showing symptoms of stress, including water deficit stress. Stress indices derived from thermal images have been used as an indicator of canopy water status, but these depend on the choice of reference surfaces and environmental conditions and can be confounded by variations in complex canopy structure. Therefore, in this work, instead of using stress indices, information from thermal and visible light imagery was combined along with machine learning techniques to identify regions of canopy showing a response to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit.</b> Thermal and visible light images of a spinach canopy with different levels of soil moisture were captured. Statistical measurements from these images were extracted and used to classify between canopies growing in well-watered soil or under soil moisture deficit using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gaussian Processes Classifier (GPC) and a combination of both the classifiers. The classification results show a high correlation with soil moisture. We demonstrate that regions of a spinach crop responding to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> can be identified by using machine learnin...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{texture and}} {{evaporative}} demand {{have been reported}} to be the main factors which influence the transpirational response to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits.</b> However, experimental evidences are not enough. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the transpirational response to <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> availability in <b>soils</b> of different textures under different evaporative demand levels. The three main soils of the Loess Plateau of China (loamy clay, clay loam and sandy loam) were selected and six constant <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> treatments were applied for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) grown in pots. In order to reduce the influence of environmental conditions and plant factors, a normalized daily transpiration rate was used to develop the relationships with volumetric <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> suction. Results showed that, under various levels of evaporative demand, a linear-plateau function with a critical value could be used to describe the dynamic change of the normalized transpiration rate with soil drying. Soil texture significantly influenced both the critical and the slope values of the linear-plateau equations, however, evaporative demand significantly affected the critical values of volumetric <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> content and <b>soil</b> suction for the loamy clay and clay loam only. Therefore, for saving water, different strategies are needed for these three soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} overstorey, site, seedbed, {{seedling}} density, application of fertilizer and grazing on mortality of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) seedlings were studied experimentally {{in the northern}} jarrah forest of Western Australia. Rainfall, <b>soil</b> temperature, <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>deficits,</b> leaf <b>water</b> potentials and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were monitored. Seedlings on sites with the overstorey removed experienced significantly higher soil temperatures for 9 {{months of the year}} (of up to 6 °C), smaller <b>soil</b> and leaf <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> during the dry season (minimum predawn leaf water potentials of - 0. 5 MPa compared to - 1. 6 MPa) and higher intensities of PAR (maximum values of 1900 umol m− 2 s 1 compared to 900 umol m− 2 s− 1), compared to seedlings on sites with the overstorey retained. Mortality off. marginata seedlings was greater on sites where the overstorey was retained compared to where the overstorey was removed, on low quality sites than high quality sites, and on undisturbed and lightly disturbed seedbeds compared to heavily disturbed seedbeds. Seedling density, application of fertilizer and grazing by vertebrates did not {{have a significant effect on}} percentage mortality. Most of the mortality occurred as <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> developed in late spring and summer and was attributed to these <b>water</b> <b>deficits.</b> Some mortality that occurred prior to the development of substantial <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> was probably caused by pathogenic fungi, We conclude that mortality of E. marginata seedlings in the northern jarrah forest of Western Australia can be minimized by reducing the density of the overstorey and by seeding into a seedbed that has had litter and groundcover removed and the soil disturbed...|$|R

For this purpose, furrow and border irrigation trials were carried out and evaluated under different <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> depletion rates, furrow spacing and unitary inlet discharges.
