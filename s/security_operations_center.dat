40|$|A <b>Security</b> <b>Operation</b> <b>Center</b> (SOC) {{is made up}} of five {{distinct}} modules: event generators, event collectors, message database, analysis {{engines and}} reaction management software. The main problem encountered when building a SOC is the integration of all these modules, usually built as autonomous parts, while matching availability, integrity and security of data and their transmission channels. In this paper we will discuss the functional architecture needed to integrate those modules. Chapter one will introduce the concepts behind each module and briefly describe common problems encountered with each of them. In chapter two we will design the global architecture of the SOC. We will then focus on collection & analysis of data generated by sensors in chapters three and four. A short conclusion will describe further research & analysis to be performed in the field of SOC design. 1 SOC Modules <b>Security</b> <b>Operation</b> <b>Center</b> is a generic term describing part or all of a platform whose purpose is to provide detection and reaction services to security incidents. According to this definition we can distinguish five operations to be performed by a SOC: security event generation, collection, storage, analysis and reaction. For ease we will start with the revolutionary definition of “boxes ” given in [1]...|$|R
30|$|The {{existing}} security protection {{technologies and}} devices in CPPS are isolated from each other; therefore, {{it is difficult}} for them to cooperate. Traditional detection technologies, such as intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), and <b>security</b> <b>operation</b> <b>center</b> (SOC) and other traditional cybersecurity technologies focus on the security of cyberspace and cannot make judgments about the cyberthreats to power systems [31, 32]; besides, the three-defense-lines and fault diagnosis technologies in power systems focus on post-failure protection, making it difficult to trace the fault from the cyberspace and acquire early warning in advance.|$|R
