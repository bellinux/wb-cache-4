5000|$|A {{prominent}} {{example of}} a celebrity with Peter Pan syndrome was Michael Jackson, who said, [...] "I am Peter Pan in my heart." [...] Jackson named the 2,700-acre Los Olivos, California property, where he lived from 1988 to 2005, Neverland Ranch after Neverland, the fantasy island on which Peter Pan lives. He {{said that it was}} his way of claiming a childhood he never had, having started early as a performing artist with his family. He had built there numerous statues of children, a floral clock, a petting zoo, a movie theater, and a private amusement park containing cotton candy stands, two railroads, a Ferris wheel, carousel, Zipper, Octopus, Pirate Ship, Wave Swinger, Super <b>Slide,</b> <b>roller</b> coaster, go-karts, bumper cars, a tipi village, and an amusement arcade. As The New York Daily News staff writer, Carrie Milago, reported on 26 June 2009: [...] "On Jackson's dime, thousands of schoolchildren visited over the years, from local kids to sick youngsters from far away." [...] Visitors [...] "often recalled it as dreamlike," [...] she observed. A preschool teacher visiting the site told USA Today in 2003, Neverland [...] "smells like cinnamon rolls, vanilla and candy and sounds like children laughing." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{entertainer}} Michael Jackson {{purchased the}} estate from Bone in 1988. for a sum variously {{reported to be}} 16.5 to 30 million US dollars. The property was initially purchased by a trust with Jackson's lawyer, John Branca, and his accountant, Marshall Gelfand, as trustees, for reasons of privacy. The arrangement was later rescinded by Jackson in April 1988 and he became the ultimate owner of the property. It was Jackson's home {{as well as his}} private amusement park and it contained a floral clock, numerous artistic garden statues featuring children, and a petting zoo. The amusement park included two railroads: one [...] narrow gauge named [...] "Neverland Valley Railroad" [...] with a steam locomotive named Katherine after his mother (Crown 4-4-0 (2B); built 1973 with two coaches), and the other a [...] narrow gauge with a locomotive named C. P. Huntington made by Chance Rides. There was also a Ferris wheel, Carousel, Zipper, Octopus, Pirate Ship, Wave Swinger, Super <b>Slide,</b> <b>roller</b> coaster, bumper cars, and an amusement arcade. The master closet also contained a secret safe room for security. Jackson was also an avid art collector.Neverland Ranch was searched extensively by police officers in connection with the People v. Jackson trial after he was charged with multiple counts of molesting a minor in 2003. Jackson was acquitted of all charges. However, Jackson stated he would never live at the property again as he no longer considered the ranch a home. He stated he felt the 70 police officers had [...] "violated" [...] the property in their searches. Jackson's sister, La Toya, wrote of her experience staying at the ranch during her brothers trial in her 2012 memoir Starting Over. In 2006, the facilities were closed and most of the staff were dismissed, with a spokesperson stating that this was the reflection of the fact that Jackson no longer lived there.|$|E
50|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{are manufactured}} in two forms: ball bearing <b>slides</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>slides.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although <b>roller</b> <b>slides</b> are not self-cleaning, {{they are}} {{suitable}} for environments {{with low levels of}} airborne contaminants such as dirt and dust. As one of the more expensive types of linear <b>slides,</b> <b>roller</b> <b>slides</b> are capable of providing linear motion on more than one axis through stackable slides and double carriages. <b>Roller</b> <b>slides</b> offers line contact versus point contact as with ball bearings, creating a broader contact surface due to the consistency of contact between the carriage and the base and resulting in less erosion.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} crossed <b>roller</b> <b>slides,</b> <b>roller</b> <b>slides</b> are non-motorized linear slides that provide low-friction linear {{movement}} for equipment powered by inertia or by hand. <b>Roller</b> <b>slides</b> {{are based on}} linear roller bearings, which are frequently criss-crossed to provide heavier load capabilities and better movement control. Serving industries such as manufacturing, photonics, medical and telecommunications, <b>roller</b> <b>slides</b> are versatile and can be adjusted to meet numerous applications which typically include clean rooms, vacuum environments, material handling and automation machinery.|$|R

Not all linear slides are motorized, and non-motorized dovetail slides, ball bearing <b>slides</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>slides</b> provide low-friction linear movement for equipment powered by inertia or by hand. All linear slides provide linear motion based on bearings, {{whether they are}} ball bearings, dovetail bearings, linear roller bearings, magnetic or fluid bearings. XY Tables, linear stages, machine slides and other advanced slides use linear motion bearings to provide movement along both X and Y multiple axis.|$|R

50|$|Most older or {{inexpensive}} {{pieces of}} furniture and cabinets use wooden sliders, upon which the drawer slides as it is opened or closed. Wood slides can be lubricated with paraffin wax. Newer furniture and cabinets may use plastic friction slides, or more elaborate bearings slide, which will provide smoother operation with less binding. There are different types of bearing slides, such as linear ball-bearing <b>slides,</b> <b>roller</b> bearing <b>slides,</b> progressive action slides. Modern drawer slides are usually categorized in how they are mounted, including center mount, side mount, bottom mount and European mount drawer slides. Drawer slides are intended for use varying from light to heavy drawers and thus contain load ratings ranging from 75 - 450 lb. A load rating of 100 lb is considered typical.|$|R
50|$|Exterior {{shutters}} in France, {{notably in}} Paris, are frequently {{made of steel}} and are configured in multiple narrow full-length panels, allowing them to fold open and fit inconspicuously against the recesses {{at the sides of}} the window.

5000|$|XY {{tables are}} flat {{surfaces}} mounted on ball bearing <b>slides</b> or <b>roller</b> <b>slides</b> with multiple linear bases and {{are composed of}} forcers and platens. The forcer glides over the platen on frictionless air bearings and moves continuously in a linear motion across the platen. To create multiple axis, linear bases are often stacked {{on top of one}} another, with the top [...] "Y" [...] axis acting both as a carriage to the bottom base and as the base which holds the table. Adjustable gibs can be attached on both axis. These types of XY tables, used frequently for the movement of robotic, are often called [...] "positioning tables". Materials used to construct XY tables include stainless steel and cast iron as well as bronze for bearings and aluminum for frames.|$|R

40|$|The {{magnitude}} of load capacity {{is shown in}} Fig. 2 with dashed lines. Both load capacity and frictional moment in this case de-crease by 33 per cent of theoretical values considering no sliding. Conclusions The analysis of the fluid lubrication for roller bearings leads to the following conclusions. (1) The character of non-Newtonian lubricant such as Bing-ham plastic is distinguished from Newtonian lubricant at low speed, especially for starting friction due to its yield stress. At high speed, load capacity and friction for non-Newtonian lubri-cant are almost equal to those of Newtonian lubricant which has {{the same amount of}} viscosity as the plastic viscosity of non-Newtonian lubricant. (2) Under unsteady load condition, the effect of squeeze film is remarkable. Then, the load capacity tends to increase, while the variation of friction with its average value is nearly equal to that under the constant basic load which is the average value of vibrating load. (3) The <b>sliding</b> between <b>rollers</b> and raceways cannot be avoided in the case of fluid lubrication. Considering the <b>sliding</b> of <b>rollers,</b> the frictional moment and load capacity in complete fluid lubrication of roller bearings show a decrease by 33 per cent of those in the case of assumed no sliding...|$|R
