40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1988 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaA {{detailed}} {{review of}} spaceborne {{magnetic tape recorder}} technology from the late 1970 s to the Space Station era is presented. Background information indicates the oft maligned space tape recorder has continued to demonstrate improving reliability since the marginal performances throughout the 1960 s. Specifically, the <b>SPOT</b> <b>recorder</b> is reviewed in technical detail to show evolution through LANDSAT 6 and 7 versions, JERS- 1, and finally the proposed ultimate version for Space Station/EOS. Enabling technologies include active tape tracking, magnetic recording head advances, and extensive use of ASIC devices to reduce the EEE piece part count. Suitability of the proposed Space Station/EOS recorder technologies for even more advanced future applications are discussed with data rates to 1 Gbps and storage capacities to 1 X 10 ¹² bits...|$|E
50|$|The Royal Recorder told King Clode Tocko’s {{story of}} the white deer, while adding a few liberties of his own in the storytelling. In {{response}} to the story, Clode said, “Pray God our deer is different from Tocko’s father’s deer (Thurber, 41).” Clode asked for the History of Sorcery book, in which the Royal <b>Recorder</b> <b>spotted</b> a report of maidens transforming into deer and back. Only in this record, every maiden could remember her name (Thurber, 43). The Recorder found another record of nine occasions where a deer would change into a woman because she rescued a wizard’s life. Plus the wizard wanted to play a trick on men through the deer‘s enchantment (Thurber, 44). None of the deer on those nine occasions remembered their names. The spell would not be broken if the deer were loved. “But if love should fail them thrice, they would vanish in a trice (Thurber, 45-46),” the Recorder said.|$|R
