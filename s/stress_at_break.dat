Degradation when monitored with mechanical properties at both macroscopic and microscopic scale led to a large increase of the modulus coupled with a strong decrease of strain and <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> Data from tensile tests were used for lifetime prediction with an Arrhenius extrapolation for modulus, strain and <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> The validity of this lifetime prediction was evaluated using a 23 year-old sample aged in natural conditions. Strain at break could be predicted using an Arrhenius extrapolation with an activation energy of 50 kJ/mol. However, an extrapolation based on linear Arrhenius behaviour did not apply for modulus and <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> due {{to the presence of}} a degradation profile across the sample.

The elastomers exhibited only a mild inflammatory response that subsided after the first week; the response was greater for the stiffer D,L-lactide-containing elastomers. The elastomers exhibited weight loss and sol content changes consistent with a bulk degradation mechanism.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the influence of composition drift and copolymer microstructure on the mechanical bulk properties of styrene methyl acrylate copolymers, several copolymers were produced by emulsion copolymerizalion. Three different average compositions were used. By perforrming the copolymerizations under batch and semicontinuous conditions with two different monomor addition strategies (starved conditions and optimal addition) it was possible to control composition drift and to produce copolymers with different microstructures (chemical composition distributions). All these copolymers were processed in a way that ensured that the original particle structure was lost before the polymers were tested. It was found that composition drift had an influence on the mechanical properties (Young's modulus, maximum <b>stress,</b> elongation <b>at</b> <b>break).</b> This influence could be understood very well on the basis of present knowledge about structure-mechanical properties relationships. In the case of homogeneous copolymers maximum <b>stress</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> arc dependent on the molecular weight, and only weakly dependent on the chemical composition, and Young's modulus is independent of chemical composition and molecular weight in the range of compositions investigated, as expected. ln the case of heterogeneous copolymers, the influence of copolymer microstructure on Young's modulus, maximum <b>stress</b> and elongation <b>at</b> <b>break</b> is very large. Depending on the extent of control of composition drift during the polymerizations, phase separation was observed in the processed polymers, and the presence of a rubber phase affected the properties profoundly...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{polymerization}} conditions on thermal and mechanical properties of ethylene/ 1 -butene copolymers synthesized through titanium-magnesium-supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts was studied. The increase in hydrogen pressure {{leads to a}} decrease in molecular weight (MW), storage modulus, and melting temperature. However, it yields an increase in molecular weight distribution (MWD), tan⁡δ, % crystallinity, tensile modulus, yield <b>stress,</b> and strain <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> The effects of ethylene pressure and polymerization temperature on the copolymer MW, MWD and thermal and mechanical properties have been investigated. However, the impacts of ethylene pressure and polymerization temperature on copolymer modulus, tensile strength, % crystallinity, crystallization peak temperature, yield <b>stress,</b> strain <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> and yield strain are marginal. The hydrogen pressure {{plays a major role}} in controlling the copolymer properties because it acts as an efficient chain transfer agent during polymerization reaction.

40|$|Abstract — Packaged {{tomatoes}} are highly perishable and tender, and are highly susceptible to mechanical damage during road transportation {{due to their}} low resistance to externally applied forces. This contributes greatly to the transit deformation leading {{to the breaking point}} under compression force. The study related mode of mechanical damage in the fruit to the strength parameters measured at break point, using compression tests. Experimental measurements of strength parameters of packaged Roma tomatoes were made to study the effects of ripeness stage, level of vibration and container type on load, deformation and <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of the fruit. Tomatoes harvested at three stages of ripeness: unripe (5. 6 Brix %),), half-ripe (3. 9 Brix %) and full-ripe (3. 2 Brix %), were packed in plastic crate and raffia basket. The packaged tomatoes were subjected to three levels of vibration: non-vibrated, low-vibration (frequency 3. 7 Hz) and highvibration (frequency 6. 7 Hz). These were compressed at a loading rate of 2. 50 mm/min- 1 in a Universal Testing Machine. Data obtained were statistically analyzed using the SPSS 110 software package. Load and <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> decreased significantly (P= 0. 05) with advancing ripeness stage of the fruit. Vibration level significantly (P= 0. 001) lowered deformation at break.

40|$|Although poly(lactic acid) (PLA) {{is among}} widely used {{biodegradable}} polymers, it has limited applications {{due to its}} inherent brittleness, low elongation at break and toughness. Blending with natural rubber (NR) and epoxidised natural rubber (ENR) {{seems to be a}} promising alternative, as both materials are derived from renewable resources. Natural rubber was melt-blended with poly(lactic acid) in an internal mixer, Haake Rheomix, with a rotor speed of 50 r. p. m. at 180 ºC. Liquid epoxidised natural rubber (LENR) was used as a compatibiliser in the binary blending system of thermoplastic natural rubber (TPNR). Results indicate that the mixing torque value and stabilisation torque value in LENR blends are lower than in blends without the compatibiliser. Various compositions of natural rubber, epoxidised natural rubber and compatibiliser were investigated with respect to the stress-strain behaviour. It was found that the addition of LENR compatibiliser improved the <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> and Young’s modulus in the blend system of 40 / 60 PLA/rubber compositions.

40|$|Electrically and {{thermally}} conductive composites made using {{high density polyethylene}} (HDPE) matrix blended with a special grade of branch-structured nickel particles were studied. Composites with high filler content were highly electrically and {{thermally conductive}}. The electrical conductivity of composites reached a value of 8. 3 × 103 Sm− 1 when filled with 30 vol. % of the filler, and the thermal conductivity obtained using this filler content {{was found to be}} 1. 99 Wm− 1 K− 1. The percolation concentration of the filler within the HDPE matrix, which was determined from electrical conductivity measurements, was determined to be 8 vol. %. Young’s modulus of composites significantly increased from 606 MPa to 1057 MPa when composites were filled with 20 vol. % of the filler. Further increasing the filler content caused no further increase in Young’s modulus, probably due to high aggregation of the filler. The <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of the composites behaved nonlinearly; the low filler content suppressed necking, resulting in a decrease in <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> whereas higher filler content (higher than 10 vol. %) led to reinforcement of the composites and therefore increased the <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> The presence of nickel particles throughout the HDPE matrix increased the hydrophilicity of the composites. The contact angle of water on the neat HDPE decreased from 93 ° to 80 ° as the nickel content of the matrix was increased to 13 vol. % of nickel. Further increases in the filler content did not alter the contact angle. Similarly, the strength of the adhesive joint formed by the composite and aluminum foil increased from a value of 16 Nm− 1 for the neat HDPE to 27 Nm− 1 when the HDPE matrix was filled with 13 vol. % of the filler.

40|$|Abstract. Fracture {{behaviour}} transitions due {{to change}} in the strain rate in steels with various Si content ranging from 2 % to 5 wt % were studied. Room-temperature tensile tests were conducted over wide range of strain rates ranging from 10 - 3 s- 1 to 103 s- 1. Concerning of the steels with low Si content (no more than 3 %), the nominal stress- nominal strain curves represented both uniform and local elongations at all strain rates. On the other hand, in 4 % Si steel at a strain rate higher than 101 s- 1, the tensile sample broke down without local elongation (necking). The <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>breaking</b> was found to be nearly equal to its work hardening rate. The strain rate at which fracture behaviour transition took place in 5 % Si steel (10 - 1 s- 1) was lower than that in 4 % Si steel.

These results indicated that Si addition is subject to the brittle fractures and that the fracture mechanism transition is closely related with the deformation twinning behaviour...|$|R

The polymers were polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and a blend of PVA-HPMC polymers. In the aqueous dispersions, the polymer-silica interactions were studied through adsorption isotherms. These experiments indicated that HPMC has a high affinity for silica surfaces, and can adsorb at high coverage; conversely, low afinity and low coverage {{were found in the}} case of PVA. In the films, the organization of silica particles was investigated through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Both methods showed that the silica particles were well dispersed in the HPMC films and aggregated in the PVA films. The mechanical properties of the composite films were evaluated using tensile strength measurements. Both polymers were solid materials, with a high elastic modulus and a low maximum elongation at break. In HPMC films, the presence of silica particles led to an increase in the modulus and a decrease in the <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> In PVA films, the modulus decreased but the <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> increased upon adding silica.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of single fibre stress-strain properties to variations in staple strength induced by both selective breeding for staple strength and nutritional manipulation. Merino weaners (n = 40), selected from ‘sound’ and ‘tender’ lines of staple strength selection flocks, were allocated to feeding regimes designed to induce liveweight changes simulating typical Mediterranean seasonal changes. Average staple strength differed by 5 N/ktex between ‘sound’ and ‘tender’ selection flocks and 18 N/ktex between extreme nutritional treatments. The force-extension properties of individual wool fibres (n = 100 per sheep) were measured using a single fibre strength meter. After normalising for differences in fibre cross-sectional area {{at the point of}} break, the key parameters used to describe the stress-strain curve for each fibre were: Young’s modulus (GPa), yield stress (MPa), stress at 15 % strain (MPa), <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> (MPa), strain at break (%) and work to break (MPa). The average stress-strain properties of single fibres differed widely between individual sheep. <b>Stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> ranged from 163 to 235 MPa (44 % range), strain at break ranged from 21 to 44 % (103 % range) and work to break from 43 to 71 MPa (65 % range). There {{were no significant differences in}} any of the single fibre properties between the staple strength selection flocks, nor was there any significant interaction (P > 0. 05) between staple strength selection flock and nutritional regimes. Nutritional regime had a significant effect on <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> strain at break and work to break, but none of the single fibre stress-strain properties removed any appreciable variance in staple strength over and above that accounted for by differences in along- and between-fibre diameter variation. There appears to be little scope for improvement of single fibre stress-strain properties as a means of increasing staple strength in normal production environments. Selection directly for staple strength or indirectly using the fibre diameter variability traits is an effective method to improve staple strength. A. N. Thompson and P. I. Hyn...|$|E

40|$|Resuming our {{comprehensive}} study, present Part II directs attention {{towards the}} effects of mould temperature and holding pressure on the tensile properties of neat and beta-nucleated isotactic polypropylenes. A commercial-grade of isotactic polypropylene was modified with a beta-specific nucleator. From both the original material (alpha-iPP) and the beta-nucleated material (beta-iPP), tensile test specimens were injection-moulded. Stress-strain measurements performed at room temperature revealed a positive influence of higher mould temperatures but negligible effect of holding pressure on the elastic modulus of injection-moulded specimens. It was suggested that at optimum processing conditions the elastic modulus of both alpha- and beta-iPP may be comparable. The softening effect of beta-form manifested itself in systematically lower yield stress values of beta-iPP as compared to alpha-iPP. The yield strain of both alpha- and beta-iPP decreased {{with the increase of}} mould temperature and the decrease of holding pressure. Prolonged solidification times at higher mould temperatures negatively influenced the strain at break of the specimens; the values of beta-iPP exceeded by several folds those of alpha-iPP.

The X-ray diffraction measurement is of supportive for the improved mechanical properties and the complex melt viscosity is as well. Upon applying a certain level of strain on the composites, the dewetting, the air hole formation and its growth are characterized. The dewetting originates around the filler particles at low strain and induces elliptical micropores upon further stretching. The microporosity such as the aspect ratio, the number and the total area of the air holes is also characterized. Thus, the composites loaded 40 % zeolite and 300 % elongation may be applicable for breathable microporous films with improved modulus, impact and yield <b>stress,</b> elongation <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> microporosity and air hole properties...|$|R
30|$|This focused {{biomechanics}} {{study provides}} a comprehensive set of both porcine and human bowel tissue tensile mechanical properties, encompassing testing of tissues segregated by both harvest location and testing orientation. This study provides valuable {{knowledge about the}} mechanical properties of bowel tissue from hogs and humans which could aid the broader scientific community {{in the design of}} next generation rectal catheters as well as improvements to colorectal tissue mathematical or physical models. Importantly, this study shows through comparison of porcine to human data, that porcine tissue does not provide an accurate approximation to human tissue when considering ultimate <b>stress,</b> elongation <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> or modulus. As a goal for future work, it may be important to know how the mechanical properties vary within the human population as a result of patient age, weight, and sex. Future studies, investigating the affect of these parameters on bowel tissue mechanical properties could reveal subtle differences between patient groups that would help further guide the development of colorectal models or medical devices.|$|R
40|$|Polyurethanes (PUs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} classes of materials today and their demand as a high thermal insulator material continues to grow. The widespread application of PUs necessitates understanding the chemistry elements that improve the thermal stability and mechanical strength as these are crucial prerequisites to obtain the high performance of thermal insulator material for the structures and buildings. The first part of the experiment focuses on the modification of pristine clay with Transition Metal Ions (TMIs), Copper and Ferum using methanol solvent. The objectives of surface modification of pristine clay is due to the incompatibility between hydrophilic clay and hydrophobic polymer. After these modifications, the samples of organoclay are characterized using some sophisticated methods like Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). FTIR and FESEM results illustrated modified nanoclays had smoother surfaces of pristine clay or montmorillonite (MMT) which proved that modification has taken place successfully. The samples then tested by Thermal Gravimetry Analysis (TGA) and Tensile Test to measure their thermal and mechanical properties respectively. Both the thermal stability and mechanical strength showed positive improvements. Thermal stability is hypothesized to have increased significantly, due to the transition metal ions hindering the pristine clay within the polymer matrices from decomposing easily. The stronger interfacial interaction causes to the increasing of <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> and the weak interfacial forces may lead to some decreasing of <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> for nanocomposite.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the thermal and {{mechanical}} characterization f poly[bis(4 -benzylphenoxy) -phosphazene] (PBPP). Glass transition and melting temperatures of 13. 8 and 88. 2 °C respectively, and {{heat of fusion}} of 7. 0 J g i were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (d. s. c.) for the as-synthesized polymer. Crystallization studies from the melt, in both isothermal and dynamic regimes, showed a low crystallizability of PBPP, due to the high mobility and steric hindrance of lateral substituents, with a heat of fusion no higher than 9 J g- 1. Activation energies of about 70 kJ mol- 1 were calculated both for the crystallization process and for the rubber-glass transition i the amorphous state. The highest crystallization rate in isothermal experiments occurred at a temperature of 45 °C. Thermodegradation of PBPP in air was found {{to start with the}} probable formation of the hydroperoxide group on the methylene site at about 233 °C, as demonstrated from both thermogravimetric and d. s. c, analyses. PBPP film behaved as an elastomeric polymer with a strain at break higher than 350 %. A tensile modulus of 1. 2 MPa and a <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> of 4. 8 MPa for the amorphous polymer were measured, whereas crystalline polymers exhibited higher tensile modulus and <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break,</b> ranging from 34 to 48 MPa and from 7 to 12 MPa, respectively.

40|$|Polypropylene {{with special}} {{properties}} {{can be obtained}} by metallocenic catalysts. These catalytic systems represent {{the beginning of a new}} age in polyolefins technology. In this work, the influence of the addition of a syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP) on the processability and mechanical properties of a commercial isotactic polypropylene (i-PP) obtained by metallocenic catalysts was evaluated. Increasing addition of s-PP promoted better processability, with an increase in the impact strength and a decrease in the <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>break.</b> A reduction of the crystallinity in the polymeric blends was verified. The more significant influence of the s-PP addition was observed for the mi-PP, compared to the ZNi-PP...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Perspective {{applications}} of nanocomposites {{in biomedical applications}} are investigated in this work by producing intercalated dispersions of clays into a biodegradable polymer matrix.
