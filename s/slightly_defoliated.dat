40|$|Detection {{of forest}} damage {{is one of}} the various remote sens-ing {{applications}} complicated by topographic effects. Different vegetation types are known to respond differently to slope and illumination effects. This paper describes the response of Landsat Thematic Mapper data to the topography in Nor-way spruce forest, and the possibility to assess forest damage in rugged t e m n. The effect at the examined medium and low solar elevations was non-Lambertian. Minnaert correc-tions and other empirical functions proposed for different cover types were found to be inadequate. Two new models were developed; one based on Minnaert constants changing with the cosine of the incidence angle, and the other based on an empirical relationship. Both models gave satisfactory results although the empirical model pe$ormed better for nearly shadowed northern slopes. With a model accounting for terrain and canopy inhomogeneity effects using digitized stand data and digital elevation models, healthy to <b>slightly</b> <b>defoliated</b> spruce forest could be separated from moderately defoliated forest. The method enables an improvement of the earlier documented Landsat TM capability to detect severely damaged forest...|$|E
40|$|The {{separate}} and combined effects of velvetleaf competition and simulated green cloverworm (SGCW) defoliation were evaluated in a 3 -year field study (1979 through 1981). Statistical documentation of velvetleaf competition stress (3 duration intervals x 2 weed densities plus a weed-free soybean control) {{was limited to}} soybeans in weed-proximate locations at the tested densities. Pre-harvest weed-induced reductions in nodes with unrolled leaves (1981 only) and certain component and total dry weight (DWT), mean crop growth rate (CGR),(2 ̆ 7) and mean relative growth rate (RGR) fractions were determined from samples collected 6 or more weeks after emergence. The SGCW defoliation procedure (4 or 5 densities were simulated through a temperature-dependent defoliation-developmental model by hole-punching) reduced soybean leaf area, height, lodging, certain component and total DWTs, CGRs,(2 ̆ 7) and RGRs. Nodal development lagged <b>slightly</b> in 1980 <b>defoliated</b> plots. Little evidence of compensatory growth has noted in plots where stresses were terminated by weed removal or SGCW pupation. None of the 28 or 35 treatment combinations altered soybean stand counts, branching, reproductive development, or gravimetric soil moisture determinations significantly. Statistical confirmation of velvetleaf and green cloverworm treatment interactions was not realized through the analysis of soybean growth and development;A standardized system of describing velvetleaf vegetative and reproductive development was proposed. An undescribed beetle of the family Bruchidae (Abutiloneus new species) emerged from velvetleaf seed. Monocropped velvetleaf eventually exceeded velvetleaf intercropped with soybeans in most growth characteristics. Soybeans began stressing intercropped weeds within 4 weeks of emergence. Few velvetleaf growth characteristics increased in response to linear increases in SGCW defoliation of adjacent full-blown soybeans. Simulated green cloverworm defoliation of adjacent soybeans did not alter weed heights significantly, but did affect the development of weed soybean/canopy height differentials (by stunting the crop). Furthermore, an analysis of weed/soybean canopy height differentials indicated that the temporal feasibility of certain late-season weed control devices (rope-wick applicators and recirculating sprayers) may vary, depending {{on the level of}} insect defoliation previously tolerated...|$|R
40|$|Some {{disturbances}} {{can drive}} ecological systems to abrupt shifts between alternative stages (tipping points) when critical transitions occur. Drought-induced tree death {{can be considered}} as a nonlinear shift in tree vigour and growth. However, at what point do trees become predisposed to drought-related dieback and which factors determine this (tipping) point? We investigated these questions by characterizing the responses of three tree species, silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), to a severe drought event. We compared basal area increment (BAI) trends and responses to climate and drought in declining (very defoliated and dying) vs. non-declining (<b>slightly</b> or not <b>defoliated)</b> trees by using generalized additive mixed models. Defoliation, BAI and sapwood production were related to functional proxies of tree vigour measured at the onset and end of the drought (non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, needle N content and C isotopic discrimination, presence of wood-inhabiting fungi). We evaluated whether early warning signals (increases in synchronicity among trees or in autocorrelation and standard deviation) could be extracted from the BAI series prior to tree death. Declining silver fir and Scots pine trees showed less growth than non-declining trees one to three decades, respectively, before the drought event, whereas Aleppo pines showed growth decline irrespective of tree defoliation. At the end of the drought period, all species showed increased defoliation and a related reduction in the concentration of sapwood soluble sugars. Defoliation was constrained by the BAI of the previous 5 years and sapwood production. No specific wood-inhabiting fungi were found in post-drought declining trees apart from blue-stain fungi, which extensively affected damaged Scots pines. Declining silver firs showed increases in BAI autocorrelation and variability prior to tree death. Synthesis. Early warning signals of drought-triggered mortality seem to be species specific and reflect how different tree species cope with drought stress. Highly correlated declining growth patterns during drought can serve as a signal in silver fir, whereas changes in the content of sapwood soluble sugars are suitable vigour proxies for Scots and Aleppo pines. Longer growth and defoliation series, additional vigour parameters and multi-species comparisons are required to understand and predict drought-induced tree death.

40|$|Pojava propadanja i odumiranja stabala hrasta lužnjaka jedan je od najznačajnijih gospodarskih i ekoloških problema u šumarstvu Hrvatske. Gospodarski problemi odnose se na smanjenje kakvoće drva, poremećaje u potrajnom gospodarenju te povećanje troškova gospodarenja i smanjenje prihoda. Ekološki problemi odnose se na stalne promjene stanišnih uvjeta i smanjenje stabilnosti šumskih ekosustava. Cilj istraživanja bio je analizirati iskorištenje drvnog obujma različito oštećenih stabala hrasta lužnjaka. Prosječna osutost stabala uz cestu Županja - Lipovac iznosila je 57 %, a na području spačvanskih šuma 24 %. Utvrđeno je intenzivno odumiranje sta bala hrasta lužnjaka uz cestu Županja-Lipovac u 2003. godini, koje je iznosilo 30 %. U svim stupnjevima osutosti utvrđena su stabla s biotskim oštećenjima. Kod stabala sa značajnom osutošću krošanja (> 25 %) utvrđeno je smanjenje udjela tehničkog drva za oko 10 %, odnosno isto toliko povećanje otpada. Udio furnirskih trupaca kod stabala male i srednje osutosti bio je 50 % veći u odnosu na jako osuta i odumrla stabla. U radu je raspravljena problematika ukupnog iskorištenja drva pri sječi i izradbi te vrijednost drvnih sortimenata vitalnih stabala u odnosu na oštećena i odumrla stabla hrasta lužnjaka. Management with {{forests of}} pedunculate oak, the {{principal}} commercial tree species in Croatia, is burdened with increasing instances of tree decline and dieback. A combination of factors, such as decreased height and diameter increment, lower value of wood assortments, disturbances {{in planning and}} management and rising management costs, have made this the most important management and ecological problem in Croatian forestry. Tree decline is a gradual, continuous, or in some cases, rapid loss of tree vita lity. In forestry, tree decline is assessed {{on the basis of}} the exterior appearance of a tree, i. e. on the basis of tree damage assessment. Tree damage relates to crown, stem and root damage. Crown damage assessment is based on crown defoliation and changes in leaf colour. Tree dieback is sudden death of trees due to diseases or a complex action of adverse factors. It can often stem from a continuous decline of trees and a disturbed stability of forest ecosystems. In Croatia, the most severely affected tree species are the two principal ones: pe dunculate oak and silver fir. Tree decline and dieback incur high financial los ses, amounting to as much as 40 % of the potential market value of forest assortments. However, a decrease in non-market forest functions is much more serious. The economic consequences of tree decline are reflected on the quality and lower value of wood assortments. Dieback of pedunculate oak trees leads to sapwood degradation and a decrease in assortment diameter, which may amount to as much as 33 % of the diameter. The goal of research was to determine the impact of pedunculate oak da mage on the structure and volume of wood assortments. Research was con ducted on tree samples from four management units in Vinkovci ForestAdministration, along the Županja - Lipovac road. Wood volume utilization of dead and differently damaged trees of pedunculate oak was analyzed. Tree crowns along the Županja - Lipovac road were found to be more defo liated compared to those in the “Spačva basin” area. Crown defoliation of pe­dunculate oak was about 60 %, which indicates decreased tree vitality. Severely defoliated and dead trees manifested significantly higher biotic da mage in relation to <b>slightly</b> and moderately <b>defoliated</b> trees. The percentage share of veneer logs and class I logs, as well as stacked wood, was higher in trees with the first and second defoliation class. The share of lower class logs (II and III class), as well as the percentage share of waste was higher in trees with higher defoliation classes. Of the total wood volume, there were 20 % of veneer logs in defoliation classes 1 and 2 (slight and moderate defoliation), and 10 % of veneer logs in defoliation classes 3 and 4 (severe defoliation). Ac cording to the percentage share of assortments in the total technical roun dwood, there were 37 % of veneer logs in trees with defoliation classes 1 and 2, and 18 % of veneer logs in defoliation classes 3 and 4. The proportion of lower-class technical assortments was higher in higher classes of crown defo liation. The proportion of second class logs in defoliation classes 1 and 2 was 11 %, and in defoliation classes 3 and 4 it was 19 %. The proportion of third class logs in defoliation classes 1 and 2 was 15 %, while in defoliation classes 3 and 4 it reached 19 %. There was more waste in defoliation classes 3 and 4 (30 %), and slightly less in defoliation classes 1 and 2 (27 %). Tree damage lowers the quality of logs and lessens the income from pedun culate oak management. Tree damage assessment may reduce the amount of snags and increase management yields. Timely and appropriate tree damage assessments have a positive effect on overall management with pedunculate oak. The selection of damaged trees for felling is a key factor that ensures the quality of the wood matter in disturbed and unstable forest ecosystems...|$|R
