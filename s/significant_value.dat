5|$|Other {{theories}} {{of foul play}} have suggested an attack by Riffian pirates, who were active {{off the coast of}} Morocco in the 1870s. Charles Edey Fay, in his 1942 account, observes that pirates would have looted the ship, yet the personal possessions of captain and crew, some of <b>significant</b> <b>value,</b> were left undisturbed. In 1925, the historian John Gilbert Lockhart surmised that Briggs, in a fit of a religious mania, had slaughtered all on board and then killed himself. In a later edition of his book Lockhart, who had by then spoken to Briggs's descendants, apologized and withdrew this theory.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson also {{advocated}} {{careful study}} of the state's finances to deal with increasing expenditures. He insisted that the state stop covering its short-term indebtedness using bonds. However, Stevenson was willing to tax to benefit segregation in schools, and helped create the state bureau of education in 1870. Because most blacks possessed little property of <b>significant</b> <b>value,</b> the new tax yielded little revenue to support their educational institutions. State legislators rejected his 1870 proposal to create a state bureau of immigration and statistics to spur interest in and migration to the state. He did persuade the legislators to make some improvements in the state's penal and eleemosynary institutions, including establishing a House of Reform for juvenile offenders.|$|E

25|$|Rubber {{produced}} as a fiber, sometimes called 'elastic', had <b>significant</b> <b>value</b> to the textile industry {{because of its}} excellent elongation and recovery properties. For these purposes, manufactured rubber fiber was made as either an extruded round fiber or rectangular fibers cut into strips from extruded film.

Rubber yarns were used in foundation garments.|$|E

25|$|Coast Guard Air Station Salem was {{established}} on February 15, 1935 when the U.S. Coast Guard established a new seaplane facility in Salem {{because there was}} no space to expand the Gloucester Air Station at Ten Pound Island. Coast Guard Air Station Salem was located on Winter Island, an extension of Salem Neck which juts out into Salem Harbor. Search and rescue, hunting for derelicts, and medical evacuations were the station's primary areas of responsibility. During its first year of operation, Salem crews performed 26 medical evacuations.

25|$|A simulational {{study by}} Hayashi and Stuchebrukhov further {{identified}} the electron tunneling pathways in atomic resolution {{based on the}} tunneling current theory. The distinct pathways between neighboring Fe/S clusters primarily consist of two cysteine ligands and one additional key residue, which was supported by sensitivity of simulated electron transfer rates to their mutations and their conservation among various complex I homologues from simple bacteria to human beings. This result shows that the crucial part of complex I developed for optimal efficiency with specific key residues during {{early stages of the}} biological evolution and has been conserved since then. Internal water between protein subunits was identified as an essential mediator enhancing the overall electron transfer rate to achieve physiologically <b>significant</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

25|$|At 06:00 on 30 April the 150th Rifle Division {{had still}} not {{captured}} {{the upper floors}} of the Ministry of the Interior, but while the fighting was still going on, the 150th launched an attack from there across the 400 metres of Königsplatz towards the Reichstag. For the Soviets, the Reichstag was {{the symbol of the}} Third Reich (ironically, it was never restored by the Nazis after the fire); but it was of such <b>significant</b> <b>value</b> that the Soviets wanted to capture it before the May Day parade in Moscow. The assault was not an easy one. The Germans had dug a complicated network of trenches around the building and a collapsed tunnel had filled with water from the Spree forming a moat across Königsplatz. The initial infantry assault was decimated by cross fire from the Reichstag and the Kroll Opera House on the western side of Königsplatz. By now the Spree had been bridged and the Soviets were able to bring up tanks and artillery to support fresh assaults by the infantry, some of which were tasked with out-flanking the Opera House and attacking it from the north-west. By 10:00 the soldiers of the 150th had reached the moat, but accurate fire from 12.8cm guns, two kilometres away on the Berlin Zoo flak tower, prevented any further successful advance across the moat during daylight. Throughout the rest of the day, as ninety artillery pieces, some as large as the 203mm howitzer, as well as Katyusha rocket launchers, bombarded the Reichstag and its defensive trenches. Colonel Negoda's 171st Rifle Division, on the left flank of the 150th, continued to capture the buildings of the diplomatic quarter to the north of Königsplatz.|$|E

500|$|Eventually the {{derivative}} contracts worth $2.1 billion lost <b>significant</b> <b>value.</b> Swaps {{were established}} {{at the time the}} stock price achieved its maximum. During the ensuing year, the value of the portfolio under the swaps fell by $1.1 billion as the stock prices decreased (the loss of value meant that the special purpose entities technically now owed Enron $1.1 billion by the contracts). Enron, which used a [...] "mark-to-market" [...] accounting method, claimed a $500 million gain on the swap contracts in its 2000 annual report. The gain was responsible for offsetting its stock portfolio losses and was attributed to nearly a third of Enron's earnings for 2000 (before it was properly restated in 2001).|$|E
500|$|Salt Lake City police placed Bundy on 24-hour surveillance, and Thompson flew to Seattle {{with two}} other detectives to {{interview}} Kloepfer. She told them that in the year prior to Bundy's move to Utah she had discovered objects she [...] "couldn't understand" [...] in her house and in Bundy's apartment: a set of crutches; a bag of plaster of Paris that he admitted stealing from a medical supply house; a meat cleaver, never used for cooking, that he packed {{when he moved to}} Utah; surgical gloves; an Oriental knife in a wooden case that he kept in his glove compartment; and a sack full of women's clothing. Bundy was perpetually in debt, and Kloepfer suspected he had stolen almost everything of <b>significant</b> <b>value</b> that he owned. Once, when she confronted him over a new TV and stereo, he warned her, [...] "If you tell anyone, I'll break your fucking neck." [...] She said Bundy became [...] "very upset" [...] whenever she considered cutting her hair, which was long and parted in the middle. She would sometimes awaken {{in the middle of the}} night to find him under the bed covers with a flashlight, examining her body. He kept a lug wrench, taped halfway up the handle, in the trunk of her car—another Volkswagen Beetle, which he often borrowed—"for protection". The detectives confirmed that Bundy had not been with Kloepfer on any of the nights during which the Pacific Northwest victims had vanished, nor on the day Ott and Naslund were abducted. Shortly thereafter, Kloepfer was interviewed by Seattle homicide detective Kathy McChesney, and learned of the existence of Stephanie Brooks and her brief engagement to Bundy around Christmas 1973.|$|E
