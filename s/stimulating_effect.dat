40|$|BACKGROUND: Although antihistamines {{are known}} for their {{sedative}} adverse effects, fexofenadine was previously shown to have <b>stimulating</b> <b>effects.</b> These stimulant effects were rather mild in magnitude and were only demonstrated in tasks with a high workload. AIM: The present study was set up to compare the magnitude of the stimulant effect of fexofenadine with those of 2 psychostimulants, modafinil and methylphenidate. METHOD: Sixteen healthy volunteers (5 males and 11 females; mean age, 21. 8 years) participated in a 4 -way, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The effects of fexofenadine (360 mg), modafinil (200 mg), methylphenidate (20 mg), and placebo were compared in a critical tracking, divided attention, motor impulsivity, and vigilance task. RESULTS: In this study, no significant stimulant effects of fexofenadine were found in any of the tasks. Modafinil only improved reaction time in the vigilance task, whereas methylphenidate improved performance in the divided attention and vigilance tasks. In addition, performance after methylphenidate treatment was also better than after fexofenadine in the divided attention and vigilance tasks. CONCLUSION: From the results, it can be concluded that the <b>stimulating</b> <b>effects</b> of methylphenidate are confirmed, whereas the <b>stimulating</b> <b>effects</b> of fexofenadine were not demonstrated in this study. It is evident that the <b>stimulating</b> <b>effects</b> of fexofenadine, which were apparent in previous studies, are not of the same magnitude as the effects of known psychostimulants such as methylphenidate...|$|R
25|$|Coffee is {{slightly}} acidic and {{can have a}} <b>stimulating</b> <b>effect</b> on humans because of its caffeine content. Coffee {{is one of the}} most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, cafe latte, etc.). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is also served. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption inhibits cognitive decline during aging or lowers the risk of some forms of cancer.|$|E
25|$|When a {{cigarette}} is smoked, nicotine-rich blood passes from the lungs {{to the brain}} within seven seconds and immediately stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; this indirectly promotes the release of many chemical messengers such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, arginine vasopressin, serotonin, dopamine, and beta-endorphin {{in parts of the}} brain. Nicotine also extends the duration of positive effects of dopamine and increases the sensitivity of the brain's reward system to rewarding stimuli. Most cigarettes contain 1–3 milligrams of inhalable nicotine. Studies suggest that when smokers wish to achieve a <b>stimulating</b> <b>effect,</b> they take short quick puffs, which produce a low level of blood nicotine.|$|E

25|$|The {{rationale}} for IORT is {{to deliver a}} high dose of radiation precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumor have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal of the tumor and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumor cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is that wound fluid has a <b>stimulating</b> <b>effect</b> on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.|$|E
25|$|Coffee beans {{were first}} {{exported}} from Karachi to Yemen. Yemeni traders brought coffee {{back to their}} homeland and began to cultivate the bean. The word qahwa originally meant wine, and Sufis in Yemen used the beverage {{as an aid to}} concentration and as a kind of spiritual intoxication when they chanted the name of God. Sufis used it to keep themselves alert during their nighttime devotions. A translation of Al-Jaziri's manuscript traces the spread of coffee from Arabia Felix (the present day Yemen) northward to Mecca and Medina, and then to the larger cities of Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad, and Constantinople. By 1414, the beverage was known in Mecca, and in the early 1500s was spreading to the Mameluke Sultanate of Egypt and North Africa from the Yemeni port of Mocha. Associated with Sufism, a myriad of coffee houses grew up in Cairo (Egypt) around the religious University of the Azhar. These coffee houses also opened in Syria, especially in the cosmopolitan city of Aleppo, and then in Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, in 1554. In 1511, it was forbidden for its <b>stimulating</b> <b>effect</b> by conservative, orthodox imams at a theological court in Mecca. However, these bans were to be overturned in 1524 by an order of the Ottoman Turkish Sultan Suleiman I, with Grand Mufti Mehmet Ebussuud el-İmadi issuing a fatwa allowing the consumption of coffee. In Cairo, Egypt, a similar ban was instituted in 1532, and the coffeehouses and warehouses containing coffee beans were sacked. During the 16th century, it had already reached the rest of the Middle East, the Safavid Empire and the Ottoman Empire. From the Middle East, coffee drinking spread to Italy, then to the rest of Europe, and coffee plants were transported by the Dutch to the East Indies and to the Americas.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to probe the {{relationship}} between the subjective effects of alcohol and impulsive behavior in social drinkers. Methods: Fifty social drinkers performed a response-inhibition task before consuming alcohol. A 0. 8 -g/kg dose of alcohol was administered in a binge-like fashion (0. 2  g/kg every 30  min) to the participants over a 2 -h time period. Participants then completed questionnaires measuring stimulation, sedation and mood following consumption of alcohol. Linear regression analyses were performed by examining the relationship between performance on the response inhibition impulsivity task and subjective responses to alcohol (i. e. stimulation, sedation and arousal). Results: There was a significant positive relationship found between impulsive responding and self-reported sedation following alcohol consumption. Additionally, there was a significant negative relationship between behavioral impulsivity and self-reported stimulation and arousal following alcohol consumption. Conclusion: These results suggest that higher levels of impulsivity are associated with experiencing greater sedating than <b>stimulating</b> <b>effects</b> of alcohol. Individuals with high levels of impulsivity may be less sensitive to the <b>stimulating</b> <b>effects</b> of a specified dose of alcohol, which could lead to these individuals consuming more alcohol to experience the <b>stimulating</b> <b>effects</b> of alcohol...|$|R
