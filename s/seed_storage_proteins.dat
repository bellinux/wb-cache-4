25|$|Triticeae is a botanical tribe {{within the}} {{subfamily}} Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera {{found in this}} tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe {{has some of the}} most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat Triticum species. <b>Seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances.|$|E
2500|$|Wheat allergy is {{an allergy}} which {{typically}} presents {{itself as a}} food allergy, but {{can also be a}} contact allergy resulting from occupational exposure to wheat. Like all allergies, wheat allergy involves immunoglobulin E and mast cell response. [...] Typically the allergy is limited to the <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> of wheat, some reactions are restricted to wheat proteins, while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues. Wheat allergy may be a misnomer since there are many allergenic components in wheat, for example serine protease inhibitors, glutelins and prolamins and different responses are often attributed to different proteins. Twenty-seven potential wheat allergens have been successfully identified. The most severe response is exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis attributed to one omega gliadin that is a relative of the protein that causes celiac disease. Other more common symptoms include nausea, urticaria, atopy. Gluten sensitivity is not usually classified as a wheat allergy.|$|E

40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of 60 accessions {{of the genus}} Hordeum (29 Mediterranean and 20 middle-Asian wild accessions, together with nine American accessions and two of unknown origin), representing together nine species, were investigated by AFLP markers. Three hundred sixty six AFLP fragments were used for studying the molecular genetic diversity among the studied species, 339 out of them were polymorphic. Forty seven protein bands {{were obtained from the}} water soluble and the water insoluble <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of 18 accessions representing nine species (two accessions/species). One band was common to all species and the other 46 bands were polymorphic.

50|$|The cupin {{superfamily}} is {{a diverse}} superfamily of proteins named after its conserved barrel domain (cupa being the Latin {{term for a}} small barrel). The superfamily includes {{a wide variety of}} enzymes as well as non-enzymatic <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|E
50|$|Members of the {{superfamily}} {{play a role}} in allergy, {{specifically the}} 11 S globulins (found in legumins) and the 7S members (found in vicilins). These can be found as <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> and may be a component of normal human diet.|$|E
5000|$|Germin of the [...] "true cereals" [...] {{is known}} as the 'archetypal' member of the cupin superfamily, however it is not to be {{considered}} an empty cask or barrel but a 'jellyroll' jelly roll fold in which six monomer subunits are wrapped in three dimensions to form a barrel shape. This structure accounts for its astonishing 'refractory' nature toward various 'denaturing' agents: all germins share a remarkable stability when subjected to heat, detergents, extreme pH and resistance to broad specificity proteolytic (digestive) enzymes. Ironically, <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> of grasses and cereals belong to the eponymous prolamin superfamily which also includes plant albumins(2S). Prolamin <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> so characteristic of cereals and grasses is not considered very nutritious because of its high content of the amino acid proline which it shares with gelatin and its low content of lysine, a vital amino acid.|$|E
40|$|Among {{the three}} {{subunits}} of [beta]-conglycinin, the 7 S <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> of soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.), {{expression of the}} [beta] subunit gene is unique. Accumulation of the [beta] subunit is enhanced in sulfate-deficient soybean plants, and its mRNA levels increase when abscisic acid (ABA) {{is added to the}} in vitro cotyledon culture medium. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines carrying a gene encoding the [beta] subunit was constructed and grown under sulfate deficiency. Accumulation of both [beta] subunit mRNA and protein were enhanced in developing A. thaliana seeds. Accumulation of one of the A. thaliana <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> mRNAs was also enhanced by sulfate deficiency, although the response was weaker than that observed for the soybean [beta] subunit mRNA. When the aba 1 - 1 or abi 3 - 1 mutations were crossed into the transgenic A. thaliana line, accumulation of the [beta] subunit was significantly reduced, whereas accumulation of the A. thaliana <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> was not greatly affected. These results indicate that soybean and A. thaliana share a common mechanism for response to sulfate deficiency and to ABA, although the sensitivity is different between the species. The transgenic A. thaliana carrying the [beta] subunit gene of [beta]-conglycinin will be a good system to analyze these responses...|$|R
40|$|Seeds {{represent}} {{a major source}} of nutrients for human and animal livestock diets. The nutritive value of seeds is largely due to storage products which accumulate during a key phase of seed development, seed filling. In recent years, our understanding of the mechanisms regulating seed filling has advanced significantly due to the diversity of experimental approaches used. This review summarizes recent findings related to transcription factors that regulate <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> accumulation. A framework for the regulation of <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis is established which incorporates the events before, during and after <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis. The transcriptional control of <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis is accompanied by physiological and environmental controls, notably through the action of plant hormones and other intermediary metabolites. Finally, recent post-genomics ana-lyses on different model plants have established the existence of a conserved seed filling process involving the master regulators (LEC 1, LEC 2, ABI 3 and FUS 3) but also revealed certain differences in fine regulation between plant families...|$|R

50|$|Alpha-prolamins are {{the major}} <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> of species of the grass tribe Andropogonea. They are unusually rich in glutamine, proline, alanine, and leucine {{residues}} and their sequences show a series of tandem repeats presumed {{to be the result}} of multiple intragenic duplication. In Zea mays (Maize), the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are encoded by a large multigene family and {{are the major}} <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> accounting for 70% of the total zein fraction. Structurally the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are composed of nine adjacent, topologically antiparallel helices clustered within a distorted cylinder. The 22 kDa alpha-zeins are encoded by 23 genes; twenty-two of the members are found in a roughly tandem array forming a dense gene cluster. The expressed genes in the cluster are interspersed with nonexpressed genes. Interestingly, some of the expressed genes differ in their transcriptional regulation. Gene amplification appears to be in blocks of genes explaining the rapid and compact expansion of the cluster during the evolution of maize.|$|E
50|$|Both {{cysteine}} and methionine are sulfur-containing {{amino acids}} and are of great {{significance in the}} structure, conformation and function of proteins and enzymes, but high levels of these amino acids may also be present in <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>proteins.</b> The thiol groups of the cysteine residues in proteins can be oxidized resulting in disulfide bridges with other cysteine side chains (and form cystine) and/or linkage of polypeptides.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of somatic embryogenesis procedures {{has given rise}} to research on <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>proteins</b> (SSPs) of woody plants for tree species of commercial importance, i.e., mainly gymnosperms, including white spruce.

40|$|In Brassica napus, seed {{yield and}} quality {{are related to}} sulfate availability, but the seed {{metabolic}} changes in response to sulfate limitation remain largely unknown. To address this question, proteomics and biochemical stud-ies were carried out on mature seeds obtained from plants grown under low sulfate applied at the bolting (LS 32), early flowering (LS 53), or start of pod filling (LS 70) stage. The protein quality of all low-sulfate seeds was reduced and associated with a reduction of S-rich <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> accumulation (as Cruciferin Cru 4) and an increase of S-poor <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> (as Cruciferin BnC 1).

50|$|Oat {{sensitivity}} {{represents a}} {{sensitivity to the}} proteins found in oats, Avena sativa.

A more complex condition affects individuals who have gluten-sensitive enteropathy in which there is also a response to avenin, the glutinous protein in oats similar to the gluten within wheat. Sensitivity to oat foods can also result from their frequent contamination by wheat, barley, or rye particles.|$|E
50|$|Individuals {{who suffer}} from gluten-sensitive enteropathy/coeliac disease have an adverse {{reaction}} to the gluten in cultivars of Triticeae when eaten. In addition to bread wheat, rye and barley (which have similar glutens) are known to cause symptoms in coeliacs. Between 2 and 10% of gluten sensitive individuals are also sensitive to oats, {{but it is not}} clear how much of this is due to contamination of triticeae seeds in oats or allergic responses (versus intolerance).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the construction and}} characterisation of a cDNA library from wheat endosperm tissue {{during the early stages}} of grain filling. Developing wheat endosperm tissue was characterised with respect to standard measures including dry weight, cytological appearance and timing of expression of major sources of mRNA such as the <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> genes. In addition, the full complement of proteins present at mid-endosperm development was examined using 2 D-electrophoretic techniques. Based on this characterisation, endosperm from the developing grain 8 - 12 days post-anthesis was chosen for isolating mRNA and preparing cDNA. At this stage in development the mRNA population is not yet dominated by the accumulation of mRNA from <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> genes. A cDNA library, not normalised, containing a high percentage of full length cDNA clones was constructed and 4, 319 clones sequenced ("single-pass"). Partitioning of the cDNA sequences into gene families and singletons provided the basis for quantifying the accumulation of sequence classes relative to the total number of sequences determined. The accumulation of gene families/singletons was not linear. However, mathematical modeling of the data suggested that the maximum number of different genes expressed is within the range of 4, 500 - 8, 000 (detailed in the Appendix). If an average is taken of these extremes, approximately 27 % of the gene products were visible as proteins in the 2 D-electrophoretic analysis. Analysis of a functional class of genes relevant to wheat grain end-use, namely the glutenin/gliadin <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> class of genes, revealed a new category of gene characterised by a distinctive N-terminal domain and a reduced central repetitive domain. 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|We have {{identified}} a number of genes of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana that are abundantly expressed during embryogenesis. In this paper we discuss four of these genes, which comprise a gene family: complete genomic nucleotide sequence of two of the genes and partial sequence of the other two shows that they are all homologous to the 12 S globulin <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> genes of other angiosperms. The four genes fall into three subfamilies, as defined by cross-hybridization. One subfamily contains two genes in the Landsberg erecta strain, but only a single gene in the Columbia strain of Arabidopsis.

Thus, the <b>seed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>protein</b> gene family in Arabidopsis appears much simpler than that in other higher plants.
