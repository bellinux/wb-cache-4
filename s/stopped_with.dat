5|$|As the goalkeeper has {{the choice}} of how many hands they want to use, the {{decision}} should be made {{of what they want}} to do. A shot should be <b>stopped</b> <b>with</b> two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally <b>stopped</b> <b>with</b> one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves can go to the ball faster.|$|E
5|$|At 01:00 on 25 April the British ships {{stopped at}} sea, and thirty-six rowing boats towed by twelve steamers {{embarked}} {{the first six}} companies, two each from the 9th, 10th and 11th Battalions. At 02:00 a Turkish sentry reported seeing ships moving at sea, and at 02:30 the report was sent to 9th Division's headquarters. At 02:53 the ships headed towards the peninsula, continuing until 03:30 when the larger ships <b>stopped.</b> <b>With</b> 50 yards (46m) to go, the rowing boats continued using only their oars.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August Ohio was <b>stopped</b> <b>with</b> no hope {{of getting}} her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} 25 laps of the race, {{a number of}} lead changes occurred. Kevin Harvick made his final <b>stop</b> <b>with</b> 24 laps to go and handed the lead to Jeff Gordon. Gordon made his final <b>stop</b> <b>with</b> 23 laps to go and handed the lead to Kurt Busch, who in turn made his final <b>stop</b> <b>with</b> 22 laps to go, handing the lead to Austin Dillon. Dillon made his final <b>stop</b> <b>with</b> 21 laps to go, with Ryan Newman {{assuming}} the lead. Newman made his final <b>stop</b> <b>with</b> 20 laps to go and Carl Edwards took the lead. Edwards made his final <b>stop</b> <b>with</b> 19 laps to go and handed the lead to Justin Allgaier. Allgaier made his final <b>stop</b> <b>with</b> 18 laps to go and the lead cycled back to Kevin Harvick.|$|R

5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be <b>stopped</b> <b>with</b> anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|When the British and Arab forces {{marched on}} Damascus {{in the final}} year of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in World War I, the Ottoman {{authorities}} fled and left Damascus in the control of a committee of citizens. The newly appointed Ottoman military governor released 4,000 prisoners from the citadel, who subsequently started pillaging and killing sick and disabled Ottoman soldiers who had been left behind in the city. These riots only <b>stopped</b> <b>with</b> the entrance into the city of the Australian Light Horse troops on 1 October 1918.|$|E
5|$|All {{attempts}} {{to land on}} the southern side of the Meuse failed. Fortunately for Guderian, the 1st Panzer Division succeeded in crossing the Meuse in the centre (see above). Once completed, it headed into the right (eastern) flank of the French at Donchery. Some of its units cleared the Meuse bend. Assault Engineers and 1st Panzer Division neutralised the guns at Bellevue Castle, and cleared the bunker positions along the Meuse River from the rear. The artillery falling on the 2nd Panzer Division's eastern flank was <b>stopped.</b> <b>With</b> the threat of artillery fire on its right flank removed, the units on the 2nd Panzer's left flank crossed the river and infiltrated the French positions opposite Donchery at 20:00. Heavy French fire continued from the bunkers in front of Donchery {{on the south side of}} the Meuse. It was not until 22:20, in darkness, that regular ferrying missions enabled the reinforcement of the German bridgehead.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} with 88 laps to go. Jimmie Johnson {{was running}} in the top-five when his engine blew up on the backstretch with 77 laps to go. With 65 laps remaining, Kevin Harvick began reeling in Joey Logano. Martin Truex, Jr. kicked off {{the final round of}} green flag <b>stops</b> <b>with</b> 52 laps to go. Joey Logano made his final <b>stop</b> <b>with</b> 50 laps to go and handed the lead to Sam Hornish, Jr. He made his final <b>stop</b> <b>with</b> 34 laps to go and the lead cycled back to Logano.|$|R

She competed in the Juno Cup hockey game, in which, at , she was considerably shorter than most of the other players. Playing for the Rockers team of Juno nominees against the Greats team of former National Hockey League players, she was awarded a penalty shot after a fight with Troy Crowder. The Greats threw their sticks in her way as she took the shot, which was <b>stopped</b> <b>with</b> ease by goaltender David Francey, a Juno nominee who had been traded to the Greats.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{developed}} during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now <b>stopped.</b> <b>With</b> its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|By 1854, {{when it was}} incorporated, Crescent City had a {{population}} of 800 but no road leading inland. The Crescent City and Yreka Plank and Turnpike Company was incorporated at a meeting on June 10, and a survey was completed in October, but work <b>stopped</b> <b>with</b> the Panic of 1855. The corporation was revived in December 1856 as the Crescent City Plank Road and Turnpike Company, began construction of a plank road in 1857, and opened the road in May 1858. This road, shown on USGS topographic maps as Wimer Road, led northeast from Crescent City to the Smith River, {{where there was a}} toll booth, and then took a generally northerly route to near the state line, where it turned east, crossing {{back and forth between the}} states, to Oregon Mountain. There it turned northeast, following the Illinois River and branches past O'Brien and Waldo to north of Kerby. The final stretch ran easterly to Jacksonville via Wilderville, along the present US 199, Fish Hatchery Road, and OR 238.|$|E

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. However, all three sessions were disrupted and little running took place. During {{the first session}} on Friday morning, a spillage of diesel on track prevented the cars from going out on until very late in the session. Eventually, Nico HÃ¼lkenberg topped the session for Force India, ahead of his compatriots Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Since water was used to clear the surface, the first laps were run on intermediate tyres by most drivers, with both Williams cars being equipped with full wet tyres, but Valtteri Bottas spun on them entering the pit lane. Later, the track dried enough to use slick tyres, Fernando Alonso being the first to do so. Due to the limited running, the last minutes were busy with most cars out on track. Marcus Ericsson however was confined to the sidelines as he <b>stopped</b> <b>with</b> an engine problem. As Lewis Hamilton spun on his last timed lap, he needed to settle for seventh fastest.|$|E
5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum {{counter-terrorism}} consultant, contacts {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on the planet, {{in a bid to}} become a kind of god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is <b>stopped.</b> <b>With</b> information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virusâthe same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E
5|$|The 1978 season saw a {{succession}} of retirements for Villeneuve, often after problems with the new Michelin radial tyres. Early in the season, he started on the front row at the United States Grand Prix West, but crashed out of the lead on lap39. Despite calls in the Italian press {{for him to be}} replaced, Ferrari persisted with him. Towards the end of the season, Villeneuve's results improved. He finished second on the road at the Italian Grand Prix, although he was penalised a minute for jumping the start, and ran second at the United States Grand Prix before his engine failed. Finally at the season-ending Canadian Grand Prix, this time at the Circuit Notre Dame Island in Montreal (a circuit that was eventually named after him) Villeneuve scored his first Grand Prix win after Jean-Pierre Jarier's Lotus <b>stopped</b> <b>with</b> engine trouble. To date, he remains the only Canadian to win his home race.|$|E

5|$|The Namib Desert Horses were {{originally}} forced {{to compete with}} domesticated livestock turned loose by farmers onto the same ground where the horses grazed. Due in part to this competition for limited forage, the horses nearly became extinct. However, they were saved {{in part due to}} the efforts of Jan Coetzer, employee of Consolidated Diamond Mine (CDM or DBCM), mining in part of Sperrgebiet. Garub was a station for the re-filling of steam locomotives until 1977, when diesel locomotives took over the route. The horses, who had previously survived on water pumped for the locomotives, were placed in danger when the pumping <b>stopped,</b> <b>with</b> several horses dying of dehydration. Coetzer petitioned CDM to supply the horses with water, which they did in 1980, installing holding tanks and a water trough. Between 1964 and 1984, population estimates ranged between 50 and 200 horses, but generally averaged 140 to 160. In 1984, an aerial count was made that distinguished 168 horses, while ground-based observations in 1988 estimated between 150 and 200 animals.|$|E
5|$|By the 38th lap, {{drivers who}} made their stops during the safety car period entered into their {{electrical}} energy conservation phase. Andretti chose {{to allow their}} drivers {{to remain on the}} circuit {{for as long as possible}} and their strategy allowed FÃ©lix da Costa and Frijns to catch and overtake d'Ambrosio and Turvey for the fifth and sixth positions in the event's closing period. FÃ©lix da Costa then attempted to catch the fourth-placed Prost but was unable to get close to him. As the field began the final lap, di Grassi, Heidfeld and Prost had five percent of usage electrical energy remaining and Buemi was unchallenged for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. Di Grassi finished second, ahead of Heidfeld in third. Prost was fourth and FÃ©lix da Costa fifth. Frijns, d'Ambrosio, Turvey, Engel and Sarrazin rounded out the top ten points-scoring positions. Piquet, Carroll filled the next two positions. Bird was fast enough to unlap himself by passing the race leaders, despite spinning his tyres at the circuit's low-speed exit turns, and finished in 13th. Duval and Rosenqvist were the last of the classified finishers. It was Buemi's first victory of the season and the seventh of his career. There were three lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Buemi led once for a total of 20 laps, more than any other competitor. Of the two other retirements, Vergne <b>stopped</b> <b>with</b> an overheating battery, and Abt lost all electrical energy in his car after 34 laps.|$|E
5|$|Citadel was {{the last}} German {{strategic}} offensive on the Eastern Front, {{and one of the}} largest battles in history, involving more than four million men. By the time the Wehrmacht launched their initial assault on 5 July 1943, the Soviet forces outnumbered them by nearly three to one. Walther Model was in command of the northern pincer, with the Ninth Army, while Manstein's Army Group South formed the southern pincer. Both armies were slowed as the tanks were blown up in minefields and caught up in combat on a series of prepared Soviet defensive lines. After five days of fighting Model's advance was <b>stopped,</b> <b>with</b> the Ninth Panzers suffering 25,000 casualties. By 13 July Model's forces were being drawn away towards Orel, where the Soviet army had launched Operation Kutuzov. Manstein's forces were able to penetrate the Soviet lines, causing heavy casualties. He reached, but did not enter or capture, Prokhorovka, his first major objective, on 11 July, inflicting serious Soviet losses in the resulting Battle of Prokhorovka. However, on 13 July Hitler called off the failed Kursk offensive; the Allies had landed in Sicily, so he issued the order for a withdrawal. Manstein protested; he felt that the Soviet forces had exhausted all their reserves in the area, and {{he did not want to}} stop until all his own reserves had been committed. Hitler, however, insisted on calling off the operation. Although Soviet casualties were indeed heavy, modern historians discount the possibility of a successful German continuation of the offensive.|$|E
