In early 2006, Ahtisaari opened the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo (...) in Vienna, Austria, from where he conducted the Kosovo status negotiations. Those opposed to Ahtisaari's <b>settlement</b> <b>proposal,</b> which involved an internationally monitored independence for Kosovo, sought to discredit him. Allegations made by Balkan media sources of corruption and improper conduct by Ahtisaari were described by US State Department spokesman Tom Casey as [...] "spurious", adding that Ahtisaari's plan is the [...] "best solution possible" [...] and has the [...] "full endorsement of the United States". The New York Times suggested that this criticism of Ahtisaari {{on the part of the}} Serbs had led to the [...] "bogging down" [...] of the Kosovo status talks. In November 2008, Serbian media reported Pierre Mirel, director of the EU enlargement commission's western Balkans division as saying: [...] "The EU has accepted that the deployment of EULEX has to be approved by the United Nations Security Council, and that the mission has to be neutral and will not be related to the Ahtisaari plan," [...] Mirel said, following his meeting with Serbia's vice-president Bozidar Djelic.|$|E
2500|$|UN-backed {{talks on}} the status of Kosovo, led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, began in February 2006 with the aim of {{completing}} them {{by the end of that}} year. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both Kosovo and Serbia remain diametrically opposed on the question of status itself. Prime Minister of Kosovo's Provisional Institutions, Agim Çeku stated that his government would accept nothing less than independence and would not contemplate partition. On the part of Serbia, Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica stated Serbia would give Kosovo full autonomy but could not accept independence. The position of the Contact Group of leading nations is that Kosovo [...] "must remain multi-ethnic and the settlement must be acceptable to the people of Kosovo. Additionally, there will be no return of Kosovo to the pre-1999 situation, no partition of Kosovo and no union of Kosovo with any other, or part of another, country." [...] While not yet mentioning the word [...] "independence," [...] the draft Settlement included several provisions that were widely interpreted as implying statehood for Kosovo. For example, the draft Settlement would give Kosovo the right to apply for membership in international organizations, create a Kosovo Security Force and adopt national symbols. [...] Ahtisaari said that after a period of consultations with the parties he would finalize his <b>Settlement</b> <b>proposal</b> for submission to the UN Security Council and at that stage he would also elaborate on the status issue itself.|$|E

When the Pearce Commission reported that the European, Asian and Coloured (mixed race) populations of Rhodesia were in support but the African population were opposed, the agreement was ditched.

40|$|Most {{lawsuits}} settle, {{but some}} settle later than they should. Too many compromises occur only after protracted discovery and expensive motion practice. Sometimes the delay precludes settlement altogether. Why does this happen? Several possibilities—such as the alleged greed of lawyers paid on an hourly basis—have been suggested, {{but they are}} insufficient to explain why so many cases do not settle until the eve of trial. We offer a novel account of the phenomenon of settling on the courthouse steps that is based upon empirical research concerning judgment and choice. Several cognitive illusions—the framing effect, the confirmation bias, nonconsequentialist reasoning, and the sunk-cost fallacy—produce intuitions in lawyers that can induce them to postpone serious settlement negotiations or to reject <b>settlement</b> <b>proposals</b> that should be accepted. Lawyers’ tendencies to rely excessively on intuition exacerbate the impact of those cognitive illusions. The experiments presented in this Article indicate that the vulnerability of experienced lawyers to these cognitive errors can prolong litigation...|$|R

5000|$|The Koevoet {{issue was}} one of the most {{difficult}} the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) had to face. Because the unit was formed after the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 of 1978 (calling for South Africa's immediate withdrawal from Namibia), it was not mentioned in the eventual <b>settlement</b> <b>proposal</b> or related documents. Once Koevoet's role became clear, the UN Secretary-General took the position that it was a paramilitary unit and, as such, should be disbanded as soon as the <b>settlement</b> <b>proposal</b> took effect. About 2,000 of its members had been absorbed into SWAPOL before the implementation date of 1 April 1989 but they reverted to their former role against the SWAPO insurgents in the [...] "events" [...] of early April 1989. Although ostensibly re-incorporated into SWAPOL in mid-May, the ex-Koevoet personnel continued to operate as a counter-insurgency unit travelling around the north in armoured and heavily armed convoys. In June 1989, the UN Special Representative in Namibia and head of UNTAG, Martti Ahtisaari, told the Administrator-General (South African appointee Louis Pienaar) that this behaviour was inconsistent with the <b>settlement</b> <b>proposal,</b> which required the police to be lightly armed. Some Koevoet operators later maintained that where the SWAPOL-COIN police forces were weakened in order to meet the demand set by the proposal document, SWAPO had not yet relinquished its position and capabilities as an armed insurgent force, thus necessitating their cautious defiance.|$|E

40|$|Any {{meaningful}} {{consideration of}} guarantee options requires some {{assumptions about the}} nature of the underlying settlement. With this in mind, the following discussion draws on comparative experience in two ways. First, it considers the nature of the conflict over Transnistria in a broader context of similar conflicts elsewhere in order to establish the likely dimensions of a settlement. Second, it analyses a range of previous <b>settlement</b> <b>proposals</b> to identify any consensus in these dimensions in order to determine the possible parameters of a settlement in somewhat greater detail. While not detached from the reality of the conflict over Transnistria, this discussion is in equal measure speculative and hypothetical. It is not meant to commit either side in the conflict or any other party to anything, but to illustrate how different settlement options might be appropriately guaranteed.

While {{it is impossible to}} know what the terms of the final settlement will be, it is already clear that one of the settlement’s most important consequences will be how it changes the orphan works debate, both in the United States and in Europe. This Article argues that the Google Books case offers an unprecedented occasion to address the orphan works problem and to adopt a legislative solution that will promote desperately needed international harmonization of the law on this issue. The Article analyzes the framework that the Google Books settlement proposes as well as proposed legislative solutions in the United States and the European Union. It suggests a legislative solution which would be as effective as the one envisioned by the settlement but which would avoid the monopoly the settlement would create if approved. The most important element of that solution foresees the introduction of extended collective licenses...|$|R
40|$|The {{settlement}} of the external debt of insolvent sovereign borrowers {{has become one of}} the most important issues in relations between the north and south since the outbreak of the global debt crisis in the early 1980 s. For the past eight years representatives of governments and international organizations, bankers, and scientists have suggested several proposals and plans to solve the present debt crisis. The most prominent schemes in this respect are the Baker Plan of 1985, which suggested massive new credits for the most highly indebted developing countries, and the recently adopted Brady Plan, which proposes partial debt discounts and reductions in interest rates. Both of these debt <b>settlement</b> <b>proposals</b> were initiated by the United States and are supported by the other principal creditor countries. However, despite the ten years of crisis management, world leaders have not yet agreed upon a longterm solution to the current debt problems. In the history of the capitalist world economy, the current problems of coping with a global debt crisis do not represent a unique event. Rather, recent empirical studies demonstrate that sovereign borrowers have experienced many instances of debt-servicing difficulties during the past 150 years (Eichengreen and Portes 1986; White 1986; Eichengreen and Lindert 1989; Marichal 1989; Suter 1989...|$|R
