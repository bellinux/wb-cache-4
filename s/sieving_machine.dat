To {{be able to do}} this, an electromagnetic <b>sieving</b> <b>machine</b> which transforms electromagnetic energy to mechanical energy was designed and constructed. The Choice of Electromagnetic <b>Sieving</b> <b>Machine</b> was to increase the amplitude of oscillation and thereby reducing the time of sieving. With the aid of the machine, sieving was carried out three times at different voltage settings. The tests conducted show that with increase in voltage, the amplitude of oscillation also increased, thereby reducing the sieving time. Optimal output (from 1 kg of Garri) was obtained in 120 seconds at a voltage setting of 255 volts which generated 5 mm amplitude. The different particle sizes were evaluated by the use of an electronic microscope. The efficiency of the machine was evaluated to be 98 %...|$|E

In 2001 a <b>sieving</b> <b>machine</b> (so-called beach sand cleaner or drift sand cleaner) was applied in order to regain the lichen-rich pioneer communities with Corynephorus canescens (grey hair grass). For that purpose the vegetation and the upper soil layer were scraped off from five plots drift sand, encroached with Deschampsia flexuosa and Agrostis vinealis. The subsequent changes in vegetation and soil were monitored until June 2008. In those seven years, the short grassland with Corynephorus canescens has been restored, however it had a high moss cover. In some plots the main moss cover consisted of Polytrichum piliferum, in others it was Campylopus introflexus. On the mats of the latter species the more common lichen species appeared, the more rare species occurred on the mats of the former species.

The grain size of martian airfall dust comes from the 1.6 μm radius particle peak of the distribution of dust observed in the martian atmosphere from landed spacecraft, as determined by studies of the martian atmosphere [31 – 33]. This material was produced by taking raw JSC Mars- 1 and crushing it using a mortar and pestle before pouring the resulting detritus into a 10 cm deep water settling tank for 30 minutes. Those particles still in suspension were poured off along with the water and were desiccated and collected as chips. Microscopy confirmed the expected grain size distribution of particles up to 10 μm in diameter. However, the composition of this material was not assayed following collection and may be slightly different from the proportions for bulk JSC Mars- 1 shown above.|$|E
50|$|Air jet <b>sieving</b> <b>machines</b> are {{ideally suited}} for very fine powders {{which tend to}} {{agglomerate}} and cannot be separated by vibrational sieving.The reason for {{the effectiveness of this}} sieving method is based on two components:A rotating slotted nozzle inside the sieving chamber and a powerful industrial vacuum cleaner which is connected to the chamber. The vacuum cleaner generates a vacuum inside the sieving chamber and sucks in fresh air through the slotted nozzle. When passing the narrow slit of the nozzle the air stream is accelerated and blown against the sieve mesh, dispersing the particles. Above the mesh, the air jet is distributed over the complete sieve surface and is sucked in with low speed through the sieve mesh. Thus the finer particles are transported through the mesh openings into the vacuum cleaner.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Quantitative {{measurements}} of mould enrichment of indoor air or house dust might be suitable surrogates to evaluate present but hidden moisture damage. Our {{intent was to}} develop a house-dust monitoring method to detect hidden moisture damage excluding the influence of outdoor air, accumulated old dust, and dust swirled up from room surfaces. Methods Based on standardized measurement of mould spores in the 63 -μm fraction of house dust yielded by carpets, the background concentrations were determined and compared to simultaneously obtained colony numbers and total spore numbers of the indoor air in 80 non-mouldy living areas during summer and winter periods. Additionally, sampling with a vacuum-cleaner or manual sieve was compared to sampling with a filter holder or <b>sieving</b> <b>machine,</b> and the evaluative power of an established two-step assessment model (lower and upper limits) was compared to that of a one-step model (one limit) in order to derive concentration limits for mould load in house dust. Results Comparison with existing evaluation procedures proved the developed method to be the most reliable means of evaluating hidden moisture damage, yielding the lowest false-positive results (specificity 98. 7 %). Background measurements and measurements in 14 mouldy rooms show that even by evaluating just the indicator genera in summer and winter, a relatively certain assessment of mould infestation is possible. Conclusion A one-step evaluation is finally possible for house dust. The house-dust evaluation method is based on analysis of the indicator genera Aspergillus, Eurotium and Penicillium spp., which depend on the total fungal count. Inclusion of further moisture indicators currently appears questionable, because of outdoor air influence and the paucity of measurements. </p...|$|E

Sieving operation, occupy an important position in the effective transformation of dewatered cassava mash into gari. However, traditionally, it consumes time and energy. Three versions of the sieve were considered, namely: traditional sieve, improved traditional sieve and mechanized sieve. Their constructions, use and associated problems were highlighted. The need to consider sieve aperture size in both traditional and mechanized sieve design and construction was emphasized. This was necessary as the speed of sieve and the strain on the operator has an inverse relation to this. From the expression derived for effective sieving technology, {{it was discovered that}} sieve aperture is directly proportional to sieving speed but inversely proportional to operators strain. This mean that as the aperture size is increased to the optimum, the speed of sieve will increase remarkably whereas on the other hand, the operators reciprocating shearing and compressive force and hence associated strain will reduce. For mechanized <b>sieving</b> <b>machines</b> utilizing shearing and compressive force principle, using an optimum aperture, while increasing sieving speed will reduce compressive impact and friction in the interacting surfaces which will prolong the machine life...|$|R

Raw iron mill scale received from the industries was in the form of chip with the average size of 10 mm across and 1. 5 mm thickness. Three different samples from three different steel mill companies have been used for this study. Rolling ball mill has been used to mill the iron mill scale with two different milling periods, which were two hours and six hours.

40|$|In firing {{systems of}} cement {{production}} plants and coal-fired power plants, regular fossil fuels are increasingly substituted by alternative fuels. Rising energy prices and ambitious CO 2 -reduction goals promote {{the use of}} alternative fuels as {{a significant contribution to}} efficient energy recovery. One possibility to protect energy resources are refuse-derived fuels (RDF), which are produced during the treatment of municipal solid, commercial and industrial waste. The waste fractions suitable for RDF have a high calorific value and are often not suitable for material recycling. With current treatment processes, RDF still contains components which impede the utilization in firing systems or limit the degree of substitution. The content of these undesired components may amount to 4 wt%. These, in most cases incombustible particles which consist of mineral, ceramic and metallic materials can cause damages in the conveying systems (e. g. rotary feeder) or result in contaminations of the products (e. g. cement, chalk). Up-to-date separation processes (<b>sieve</b> <b>machine,</b> magnet separator or air classifier) have individual weaknesses that could hamper a secure separation of these particles. This article describes a new technology for the separation of impurities from refuse derived fuels based on a rotating fluidized bed. In this concept a rotating motion of the particle bed is obtained by the tangential injection of the fluidization gas in a static geometry. The RDF-particles experience a centrifugal force which fluidized the bed radially. The technical principle allows tearing up of particle clusters to single particles. Radially inwards the vertical velocity is much lower thus particles of every description can fall down there. For the subsequent separation of the particles by form and density an additionally cone shaped plate was installed in the centre. Impurities have a higher density and a compact form compared to combustible particles and can be separated with a high efficiency. The new technology was experimentally investigated and proven using model-RDF, actual-RDF and impurities of different densities. In addition, numerical simulations were also done. The fluidization chamber was operated in batch mode. The article describes experiences and difficulties in using rotating fluidized bed systems...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{report is}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2014. Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) mainly implements river bank protection, flood control, drainage and irrigation projects. BWDB has completed many water management related projects and it has around 54 ongoing ADP included projects in this year 2014 - 15 where there are many suppliers/contractors performing in those projects. Supplier performance management will {{play a vital role}} to complete those projects successfully within time frame and budget allocation. This dissertation focuses on the supplier performance management in BWDB. The objective of this dissertation is to identify the current practices of supplier performance management and performance shortfalls as well as to suggest ways of improvement in supplier performance. This is an exploratory research that uses case study method. Primary data (qualitative) has been collected from respondents both engineers and suppliers of BWDB working in selected projects through questionnaire survey and interviews. Secondary data (quantitative) has been collected from BWDB website. From the analysis of the both qualitative and quantitative data the major reasons behind the shortfalls in supplier’s performance have been identified and suggestions about improving supplier performance have been congregated. It has been found that only 13 % projects are completed in due time and 67 % projects need two to three years extension to be accomplished. This is happening due to mainly insufficient budget allocation in the projects by the government. Two to three years delay occurs in 66 % projects to get budget allocated in the original DPP. Due to financial insolvency of suppliers they can’t start project in due time or even can’t accomplish project within given time period. Again suppliers have technical shortfalls like lack of machinery, equipment and manpower. Sometimes it is found that there are no weight measuring scale, <b>sieve,</b> sufficient sewing <b>machine,</b> generator, cc block formwork and labor. Although suppliers show graduate engineers in their manpower list while contracting but practically even no diploma engineers are found in the work site. Moreover, due to lack of supervision by concerned official, contractors often take the chance to deteriorate quality of work. They change the concrete mixture ratio in cc block manufacturing and change thickness of filter material above which cc blocks are laid down in the slope of the river bank. To improve suppliers’ performance sufficient yearly budget allocation as well as quarterly fund release according to original DPP should be done by BWDB. If it is impossible to allocate sufficient yearly budget, suppliers should be allowed to take loan from state owned bank against their work/supply order at low interest rate in compared with private bank. Moreover, the existence of equipment, machinery and manpower according to suppliers’ submitted list should be specially checked and verified through visiting suppliers’ premises to ensure the technical capability of suppliers while selecting them. Finally, the concerned engineer may motivate supplier through the both approach of motivation i. e. the carrot approach (e. g giving recognition and rewards: inclusion on the preferred supplier list, certificate of excellence which will increase the goodwill of the supplier in the market) and the stick approach (e. g publicizing debarred/black list for unsuccessful supplier, giving exemplary punishment, including penalty clauses in contract) ...|$|R
