5000|$|DALI wires can be {{connected}} to a device without regard for polarity. Signal level are defined as [...] for [...] "0" [...] and [...] for [...] "1".

5000|$|The EGA uses {{a female}} nine-pin D-subminiature (DE-9) {{connector}} which looks {{identical to the}} CGA connector. The hardware <b>signal</b> <b>interface,</b> including the pin configuration, is largely compatible with CGA. The differences are in the re-purposing of three pins for the EGA's secondary RGB signals: the CGA [...] "Intensity" [...] pin (pin six) has been changed to [...] "Secondary Green (Intensity)"; the second ground of CGA (pin two) has been changed to [...] "Secondary Red (Intensity)", and pin seven (Reserved on the CGA) is now used for [...] "Secondary Blue (Intensity)". If the EGA is operated in modes having the same scan rates as CGA, a connected CGA monitor should operate correctly, though if the monitor connects pin two to ground, the shorting of the EGA's secondary red output to ground could conceivably damage the EGA adapter. Similarly, if the CGA monitor is wired with pin two as its sole ground (which is poor design), it will not work with the EGA, though it will work with a CGA. Finally, because {{of the use of}} the CGA's intensity pin as secondary green, on a CGA monitor connected to an EGA, all CGA colors will display correctly, but all other EGA colors will incorrectly display as the standard CGA color which has the same values for the g, R, G, and B bits (ignoring the r and b bits.) Conversely, an EGA monitor should work with a CGA adapter, but the secondary red signal will be grounded (always zero) and the secondary blue will be floating (unconnected), causing all high-intensity CGA colors except brown to display incorrectly, and all colors to potentially have a variable blue tint due to the indeterminate state of the unconnected secondary blue.|$|E

40|$|Rearrangement of the {{cytoskeleton}} in T cells plays {{a critical}} role in the organization of a complex <b>signaling</b> <b>interface</b> referred to as immunologic synapse (IS). Surprisingly, the contribution of antigen presenting cells, in particular dendritic cells (DCs), to the structure and function of the IS has not been investigated in as much detail. We have used a natural model of cytoskeletal dysfunction caused by deficiency of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) to explore the contribution of the DC cytoskeleton to IS formation and to T-cell priming. In an antigen-specific system, T-DC contacts were found to be less stable when DCs alone lacked WASp, and associated with multiple defects of IS structure. As a consequence, DCs were unable to support normal IL- 12 secretion, and events downstream of TCR signaling were abrogated, including increased calcium flux, microtubule organizing center (MTOC) polarization, phosphorylation of ZAP- 70, andT-cell proliferation. Formation of an effective <b>signaling</b> <b>interface</b> is therefore dependent on active cytoskeletal rearrangements in DCs even when T cells are functionally competent. Deficiency of DC-mediated activities may contribute significantly to the varied immunodysregulation observed in patients with WAS, and also in those with limited myeloid reconstitution after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
