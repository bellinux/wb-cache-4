40|$|The paper {{shows that}} during the global {{economic}} crisis the urgency of industrial substantiated estimation of production costs and services (collectively, the product) of each type and the total for a given period {{in the framework of}} accounting and tax accounting has increased. So, for flexible management of prices and range of products the company has to determine with sufficient accuracy the cost of each product. Profitable enterprises in the tax records have the opportunity due to extensive use in Ukraine and other countries the <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> during the first years or all over the amortization period to inflate artificially the amount of depreciation compared with the actual rate of deterioration of labour. This causes allowed by the law overstating in tax accounting (compared with the balance one) the cost of sales of all types in a given period, and therefore understating taxable income and income taxes. However, there are problems in theoretical and methodological support. The changes in the regulatory assessment of the cost of industrial enterprises production of Ukraine for a long-term period are analyzed. Recommendations as for improving the scientific and methodological approach to assessing the cost of industrial and engineering products in terms of determining depreciation are substantiated. The author gives reasons for the necessity to exclude "method to reduce the residual value" both from Accounting Standard 7 and the Tax Code, and introduce a method of the same name, but in the interpretation of IFRS (IAS) 16, which is completely different. It not only replaces the "rapid method for reducing the residual value", but provides ample additional features <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation.</b> On a digital sample it is shown that as for the liquidation value of the Tax Code does not have any restrictions, one can choose a value at which the annual rate of depreciation will be higher by 20 and 50 %, than the method of rapid reduction of the residual value can give at the same value of the minimal term object usage or amortization period. This method is not available in the IFRS (IAS) 16, and entirely different in effect but the same-name method is used in it. This method does not provide any advantages in terms of Accounting Standard 7. And the need of further improvement of the regulatory framework for accounting the production costs of industrial enterprises {{in the context of the}} range is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|The Government of Pakistan, {{like many}} other {{developing}} countries, has opted for tax holidays as an important fiscal measure to encourage rapid industrialisation in the backward areas. This concession is also supplemented by several other economic and non-economic measures including import duty, and depreciation allowances. Mintz (1990) discusses the efficacy of tax holidays in the presence <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowances concludes that tax holidays which are designed to increase capital formation may end up penalising capital formation. Mintz’s (1990) conclusion {{is based on the}} assumption that if the assets are long-lived, and the income tax <b>system</b> allows deductibility <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> but cannot be deferred, then the tax holidays, by preventing depreciation deduction in the early period may actually penalise investment during the tax holiday period. If on the other hand the depreciation allowance is deferred till the end of tax holiday period, the tax system is genuinely generous and provides a real incentive for capital formation. In Pakistan the tax code are such that the firms in the tax holidays region are not allowed to claim or defer <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowance but can claim normal depreciation allowance only after the expiry of tax holidays period. Whereas the firms in developed areas can claim both accelerated (25 percent) and normal depreciation allowances (10 percent) annually. Import duty concession is given for most of the underdeveloped areas and few of the developed areas. These different sets of incentives affects the cost of capital and hence investment differently. The purpose of the present paper is to see these effects by computing the cost of capital for developed and under developed areas. This will help us to examine whether the tax holidays as an incentive is effective or act as a barrier to claim other generous concession like the depreciation allowance. ...|$|R

40|$|This study extends {{previous}} work which attempted to describe why different managers use different accounting techniques (for financial reporting purposes only). The focus is accounting changes, specifically depreciation changes, both {{to and from}} accelerated methods. Seven hypotheses are proposed. Three of them predict a negative relationship between a manager's use <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> and (1) the firm's debt/equity ratio, (2) {{the existence of a}} bonus plan based on accounting income and (3) the potential impact of a depreciation change on earnings. These three hypotheses are referred to as H(D/E), H(BONUS) and H(IMPACT), respectively. The other four hypotheses predict a positive relationship between a manager's use <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> and (1) firm size, (2) the degree of voting control exercised by insiders, (3) the strength of current earnings relative to the preceding year's, and (4) industry-wide barriers to entry. These are referred to as H(SIZE), H(CTRL), H(EPS) and H(BTE), respectively. Designating accelerated as A and straight-line as S, the (tax/book) depreciation changes studied are the switch from S/S to A/A in 1954 and the switches from A/A to A/S in 1968 and 1969. All seven hypotheses were jointly tested with respect to the A/A to A/S changes in 1968 and 1969. The 1968 multivariate results indicate varying degrees of support for all the hypotheses except H(BTE), while the 1969 multivariate results support only H(D/E), H(BONUS) and H(SIZE). Only five hypotheses were jointly tested with respect to the change from S/S in 1954 (not H BONUS or H BTE). Support is offered for H(SIZE), H(D/E) and H(CTRL), but not for H(EPS) or H(IMPACT). Further, the 1954 support is strongest when the 1968 / 1969 "switchback" firms are excluded from the analysis; that is, when the sample includes only firms which consistently used S as opposed to A for book purposes both before and after 1968 - 1969. Additional analyses used 1968 data for firms which switched from A/A to A/S in 1969.

40|$|The {{aggregate}} homeownership {{rate in the}} United States {{has continued}} to rise throughout the 1970 s despite rising inflation and {{the rapid growth of}} young and primary individual households with relatively low homeownership rates. This appears to be a result of a decline in the cost of homeownership relative to renting. The post 1965 decline in the real after-tax interest rate has acted to reduce the costs of both types of housing. However, inflation, and legislation induced increases in taxation of rental housing have largely offset the decline in the net real financing rate. Depreciation is based on historic cost and nominal capital gains are taxed. Moreover, this taxation was increased in 1969 and 1976 with the introduction and expansion of the minimum tax, the increased recapture <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation,</b> and the amortization, rather than expensing, of construction period interest and property taxes. The decline in the cost of owner-occupied housing relative to rental housing is estimated to have sharply increased homeownership. In the absence of this decline 4. 5 to 5 million fewer households would have been homeowners at the end of 1978. That is, the homeownership rate would have been 60 percent, rather than 65 percent. ...|$|R

40|$|Rising {{energy prices}} {{combined}} with technological developments mean that {{renewable energy sources}} are becoming increasingly competitive with fossil fuel sources of energy. Mandatory renewable energy targets provide an added incentive to invest in renewable energy sources and the expectation of a modest price for carbon emissions helps encourage new investment in renewables even further. That said, in Australia the investment in renewables has, to date, been relatively small. At the same time, policy makers assert {{that there is some}} urgency for Australia and the world to reduce carbon emissions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the treatment of capital expenses in the renewable energy sector with particular emphasis on the need to introduce <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> provisions to help encourage new investment in alternative sources <b>of</b> power. <b>Accelerated</b> <b>depreciation,</b> which is described in greater detail below, refers to the capacity for selected industries to claim bigger tax deductions for the cost of their investments in new equipment in the early years of a project.

I use the variation provided by recent reforms to the Mexican corporate tax system, including the elimination and reintroduction <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowances applicable to investment undertaken outside the three main Mexican metropolitan areas. I show that investment is very sensitive to changes in tax variables and interest rates, with an estimated elasticity of investment {{with respect to the}} user cost around - 2. 0. The results are robust to different specifications and instrumental variables approaches. The large elasticity is shown {{to be the result of}} the large cross sectional variation in the user cost of capital and also a product of the small open economy nature of the Mexican economy. In particular, large investment responses of plants owned by multinational firms and a elasticity of imported assets considerably larger than that of domestically purchased goods. Furthermore, the use of panel data at the establishment level allows me to identify the discrete nature of investment decisions and to show that the capital accumulation pattern is consistent with nonconvex adjustment costs and irreversibilities, similar to those found for the US. Thus, the large elasticity compared to US estimates cannot be attributed to differences in adjustment costs. Finally, I provide evidence that the large investment response is not an artifact of misreporting or tax evasion since the elasticity of investment in other assets such as transportation equipment and land, which is harder to misreport, is also high. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{regulation}} for emissions, pollution, etc., {{is becoming}} stricter, the Australian rail freight industry is still locked in to using {{large numbers of}} existing rolling stock, e. g., locomotives and wagons. Much of this rolling stock is no longer efficient. Largely {{as a result of}} infrastructure constraints, it is not feasible for operators to dispense with their old technology at regular intervals, even though they will need to pay more to use older technology if a carbon price eventuates. This thesis seeks to ascertain the viability of promoting investment incentives for newly acquired locomotives, wagons and other equipment. It analyses the impact <b>of</b> an <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> scheme on the investment behaviour of above-rail operators and offers a comparison with alternative incentives or mechanisms. These schemes, if their efficacy is demonstrated, could potentially provide tools to encourage re-equipment of the aging rail fleet and facilitate the provision of sustainable rail freight growth in Australia. A three-stage sequential mixed methods approach was designed to investigate the investment implications <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> in the rail freight sector. In the first stage, an in-depth interview technique was employed to contextualise the rolling stock replacement decisions among rail freight firms. In the second stage, an extended asset replacement model exclusively was developed to examine whether <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> and other tax concessions could significantly reduce the optimal time to replace rolling stock in the Australian rail freight industry. In the final stage, a focus group technique was applied to examine the findings from the first two stages and provide in-depth expert assessments of their implications. This thesis concludes that <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> alone is unlikely to be sufficient to assure a desired level of investment in cleaner technologies. The scheme should be part of a whole suite of initiatives to stimulate investment, and should not be the primary mechanism. The main obstacle is the incompatibility between the existing below-rail infrastructure in Australia and the modernised above-rail equipments. This implies that even though <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> successfully offers them the incentive to replace their old fleets with newly acquired rolling stock, it is impossible, for example, to run the new train on the existing track. Improving the below-rail infrastructure therefore has been identified as the only way to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the rail freight sector in terms of overall energy efficiency. Nevertheless, upgrading the infrastructure is a difficult task. To encourage greater energy efficiency within the rail freight sector in the short term, some other instantaneous initiatives should be provided. A two-pronged approach to energy efficiency in the rail freight sector has been proposed. In particular, some incentives to buy new equipment combined with a ‘cash for clunkers’ scheme with a refurbishment option to make existing assets more energy efficient are needed to deliver appropriate outcomes in the short term. Incentives aimed at buying new equipment are particularly crucial for regions where the rail networks have already been upgraded to suit modern energy-efficient equipment, whereas programs targeting the refurbishing of older assets are necessary for track that is not suitable for modern equipment, which is generally heavier than the older equipment. Apart from its implications for managerial practices within the rail freight sector and implications for policies pertaining to rail freight operation, another major highlight of this thesis is the derivation of the extended asset replacement model under taxation, inflation, and technological progress environment. The novelty of this model is its comprehensiveness. The effects of technological advancement, taxes, and inflation have been analysed by previous replacement studies. The literature, however, indicates that these three factors have not been incorporated into the replacement model simultaneously. This thesis also makes a significant contribution to the research methodology in finance. Combining a qualitative method and a quantitative approach, or in other words, using mixed methods in finance has not proved to be very popular. This thesis shows that it is justifiable in instances where the likelihood of a policy being useful to stakeholders is being assessed, and where the context of the policy and the context of the area in which it is applied are important...|$|R
40|$|Simulation {{was used}} to analyze the {{distribution}} of benefits from the 1981 and 1982 federal income tax legislation for farm types that exhibit various tax characteristics. The results indicate that distributional effects are largely attributable to the reduced progressivity of the tax rate schedule. The largest farms benefited relative to the smaller farms of all farm types. Intensive livestock farms and producers of perennial crops experience additional benefits relative to other farm types primarily because of the large reduction in useful life for tax purposes of specialized livestock facilities, orchards, and vineyards. Almost all farmers could benefit from the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA), but not all farmers could benefit equally. Dif-ferences in benefits depended on the farm en-terprise mix, and the type and quantity of as-sets used in production, For example, the im-pact <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> on farm in-come and growth was likely to differ between an intensive hog operation with large amounts of depreciable property and a cattle ranch with relatively little depreciable property, Other differences depended on the farmer’s total in-come. Tax rates were cut in all tax brackets, but the reduction in tax liabilities was greatest for the higher income taxpayers. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) of 1982, modified some ERTA pro-visions, but did not alter the basic thrust of the legislation. This study quantifies the distribution of ben-efits from the 1981 and 1982 income tax re-form among farmers by farm size and major enterprise. The benefits of the tax reform came primarily through reduced tax liabilities, which create higher after-tax income and per-mit greater farm business growth. The dis-tribution of tax reform benefits is important for reasons of fairness and because previous re-search has shown that one force driving stmc-tural change in U. S. agriculture is the incom...|$|R
5000|$|After a {{referendum}} {{about the future}} status of the region, Saarland was incorporated into the Federal Republic of Germany as a Bundesland on 1 January 1957. The economic integration into Germany was completed with the withdrawal of all Saar-Franken two years later. On 29 June 1959 the federal ordinance [...] "Verordnung zur Einführung der Deutschen Mark im Saarland" [...] stipulated that - with effect from 6 July (§ 1) - all debts, credits, deposits, wages, rents, fees, interest servicing, or amortisation payments, and other obligations, as well as cash reserves and prices denominated in francs were to be converted {{at the rate of}} 100 francs = 0.8507 Deutsche Mark (§ 2). The conversion had been brought forward by half a year because <b>of</b> the <b>accelerating</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>of</b> the French franc. The date was kept secret (called [...] "day X") to avoid currency speculation, and only published two days in advance. The freedom to fix new prices was maintained, but especially temporarily or permanently fixed obligations, not to be altered at any time, were not to be renegotiated but converted at the rate fixed.|$|R

A <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accelerated</b> charges results in electromagnetic radiation when the geometric symmetry of the electric field in free space is explicitly broken by the associated electrodynamic structure under time varying excitation <b>of</b> the given <b>system.</b> This is quite evident in an antenna where the electric lines of field curl around or have rotational geometry around the radiating terminals in contrast to linear geometric orientation within a pair of transmission lines which does not radiate even under time varying excitation.|$|R
40|$|We report our {{observation}} that radiation from a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accelerating</b> charges {{is possible only}} when there is explicit breaking of symmetry in the electric field in space within the spatial configuration <b>of</b> the radiating <b>system.</b> Under symmetry breaking, current within an enclosed area around the radiating structure is not conserved at a certain instant of time resulting in radiation in free space. Electromagnetic radiation from dielectric and piezoelectric material based resonators are discussed in this context. Finally, {{it is argued that}} symmetry of a resonator of any form can be explicitly broken to create a radiating antenna...|$|R
