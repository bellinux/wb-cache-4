5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the semi-circular wall towers. Work also appears to have begun on some <b>stone</b> <b>walling</b> to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would suggest that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E

25|$|Only {{several hundred}} yards from the site of the Merry Maidens lies a Bronze age burial chamber, Cruk Tregyffian, that was {{discovered}} (and unfortunately damaged) during widening of the adjacent B3315 road. The circular barrow is composed of stone uprights decorated with cupmarks, dry <b>stone</b> <b>walling</b> and four capstones. Although the original decorated stone has been removed to Truro museum to protect it against weathering, a replica now sits in its place. Further east along the B3315 road, and only a mile from Lamorna, lies the Boleigh Fogou, considered {{to be one of the}} best remaining monuments of its kind in Cornwall. Built in the Iron age, the purpose of fogous (derived from the Cornish word for cave) is not known. It has been speculated, however, that they could have been used for food storage or for religious ceremonies. The fogou at Boleigh is extensive and has a large entranceway that leads to a long passage with classic dry stone wall and lintel construction. A low doorway just inside the entrance leads to a much narrower and lower passage that turns ninety degrees left after a few metres. After the turn the passage continues for a metre or two before ending; there is a modern metal support grille set into the roof above this section.|$|E

500|$|The timber-framed western barn was {{constructed}} in the 15th or early 16th century with an extension or alternations made {{at the north end}} in the late 18th or early 19th century. The walls are constructed in a combination of methods [...] <b>stone</b> <b>walling,</b> weatherboarding or brick infill between timber studs. The steeply pitched plain tiled roof contains six dormers on the west side and one on the east side and is hipped with a gablet to the south end and half-hipped to the north end. A carriage entry passes through the centre of the barn. A single-storey extension runs at a right angle to {{the south end of the}} east side, probably built in the 16th century. The two-storey extension to the east side of the north end is lower than the main barn with a half-hipped roof.|$|E
500|$|Radiocarbon dating {{indicates}} that the ramparts defending Maiden Castle were built in around 600BC. Built from earth and timber, the inner rampart was originally [...] wide, with a revetment of dry <b>stone</b> <b>walling</b> behind the bank, and at least [...] high. The outer bank was originally [...] wide and about [...] high. It was built from sand and had a dry stone facing at the front and no revetment behind. The outer bank was later enlarged: the outer face was extended [...] away from the fort and the revetment moved. Its height was probably increased to [...] The defences cover about [...] out of the entire [...] of the Maiden Castle site. According to archaeologist James Forde-Johnston, who conducted {{a study of the}} hill forts of Lancashire and Cheshire in 1962, this was an unusually strong defence for such a small site. Few artefacts have been recovered from the site; they include a piece of Iron Age pottery. Maiden Castle was probably occupied until the Roman conquest of Britain in 1st centuryAD, and the outer bank may have been reconstructed around this time.|$|E
2500|$|His industrious nature {{assisted}} by his background in dry <b>stone</b> <b>walling</b> saw him clear {{the site and}} create massive stone galleries, pathways, cliff side gardens, and floral painted rock walls.

[...] During this time he lived off the land - no doubt by scavenging from the tip, as well as the vegetable and fruit gardens nearby.|$|E

[...] Unfortunately, the original contractor had left much of the material ordered unused, and had done a subpar job in building the new wall from cinderblocks meant for {{the foundation of a}} house— which was completely inappropriate given the size of the wall needed. [...] As the original contractor stopped showing up at the home and became difficult to reach, the concerned homeowners even inquired as to whether the contractor had been injured at another site, and only realized that they had been victimized when a bill for the unused material had shown up at their door.|$|R

2500|$|The main {{rocks and}} {{minerals}} {{to be found}} in the valley are green slate and granite. There has been some record of opal being found too though it has never been mined. Much of the local stone has been used since pre-history as the raw material for field boundaries using a local technique known as dry <b>stone</b> <b>walling.</b> Just below the reservoir is a Geological Conservation Review site known as Jumb Quarry. The site is significant due to its volcanic rock which displays [...] "bird's-eye tuffs", which contain lapilli (fragments of lava that erupted from a volcanic centre and probably fell into standing bodies of water). The lapilli are believed to have been spherical originally, but were squashed into elliptical shapes as a result of intense pressure during the formation of the Caledonian Mountains.|$|E

40|$|New {{technologies}} are continuously being developed that can aid us in archaeological research. The {{purpose of this}} project is to revisit an area containing Late Iron Age (LIA) <b>Stone</b> <b>Walled</b> Structures (SWS) that have received sporadic archaeological research over time, and employ new techniques and technologies to test/re-evaluate previous findings. This involves developing new mapping techniques, which involve the use of Geographical Positioning Systems (GPS), which allowed for a wide survey/mapping exercise in a time effective and budget conscious manner. From these data, a new typology was created in order to reflect new types as well as further segregate exiting types. The resulting data was analysed in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment, allowing us to tackle issues such as spatial distribution and landscape patterns in a digital environment. This analysis allowed us to re-evaluate the original spatial distribution, looking at possible reasons for the inaccuracies in the original study. We then explore {{the implications of these}} new data. We tested the results of these analyses based on proposed scenarios for the location of these sites, in order to try better understand the positioning, as we as identify possible diagnostic sites that can undergo further examination...|$|R
