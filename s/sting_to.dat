5|$|Cage {{made his}} first {{appearance}} on TNA Impact! during the November 19, 2005 episode by engaging in a verbal sparring bout with Monty Brown. This led to a match against Brown to become number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 11, 2005 at TNA's Turning Point PPV event, which Cage won. At TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 15, 2006, Cage participated in his first TNA PPV main event by teaming with <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> defeat the team of Monty Brown and Jeff Jarrett. Cage went on to defeat then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jarrett for the title on February 12, 2006 at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event.|$|E
5|$|In November, Hardy {{entered the}} World Title Tournament to crown a new champion, after A.J. Styles {{left the company}} with the championship. Hardy {{defeated}} Chris Sabin and Bobby Roode {{in the first two}} rounds of the tournament, to reach the finals at Final Resolution. In the championship match, Hardy was defeated by Magnus after interference from Ethan Carter III and Rockstar Spud. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Hardy teamed up with <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> face The BroMans, Ethan Carter III and Rockstar Spud, which they lost. Afterwards, a frustrated Hardy announced he could no longer work in TNA with Dixie Carter's backstage politics, and quit TNA.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Sting, and the challenger, A.J. Styles. During the 15 minutes the match lasted, Styles {{executed}} his aerial technique the Spiral Tap, in which he jumps {{off one of the}} top padded turnbuckles, spins and flips in mid-air before landing on his opponent. He then ascended the turnbuckle to perform the maneuver once again, but was distracted by Angle and Booker T. Later, Styles missed a pele kick on Sting, which allowed <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> counter with a small package pin on Styles to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Turning Point, Styles and Sting {{argued over}} Sting assaulting Styles at Hard Justice. On the October30 episode of Impact!, newly made {{co-owner}} of TNA Mick Foley advertised Sting defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Styles at Turning Point. Sting retained the title at the event. Sting and Styles fought again at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on December7, {{this time in}} an Eight Man Tag Team Match pitting The Main Event Mafia (Sting, Nash, Steiner, and Booker T) against The TNA Front Line (Styles, Joe, Brother Devon, and Brother Ray) for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The Main Event Mafia won the match, thus Sting retained the championship {{for a second time}} against Styles. Sting and Styles fought one last time for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but not for several months. They clashed one final time at the 2009 Bound for Glory event on October18. At that event, Styles headed into the bout as the TNA World Heavyweight Champion. Styles defeated <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> retain the championship at the show.|$|E
5|$|Once the British {{became aware}} {{that there was a}} spy {{operating}} within the Turkish Embassy, they investigated Bazna, installed a new alarm system, and initiated an unsuccessful <b>sting</b> <b>to</b> catch him selling intelligence. He stopped selling information to the Germans by the end of February 1944 and left the embassy within a month or so. After the war, Bazna was questioned for war crimes, but he was never charged with espionage. He attempted to buy and operate a hotel in Ankara with the proceeds of his spying career, but it was discovered that much of the money was counterfeit. He served a brief prison sentence for circulating forged notes. Bazna lived in Ankara with his family for many years and obtained work doing odd jobs. He moved to Munich in 1960 and worked as a night watchman before dying in 1970 of kidney disease. Bazna published a memoir of the Cicero affair in 1962.|$|E

5|$|The primary storyline {{heading into}} Genesis {{involved}} the TNA World Heavyweight Championship held by then-champion Kurt Angle. On the October 25 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette {{announced that the}} title would be defended in a tag team match with Angle and Kevin Nash against Sting and a partner of his choosing. The lead-up to this decision began at TNA's previous PPV event Bound for Glory on October 12. There, Sting defeated Angle to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the October 25 episode of Impact!, with help from Nash, Angle defeated <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> win back the title. Due to the controversial circumstances, Cornette announced that Angle would defend the title in a tag team match, in which the person that got the pinfall or submission would win the title.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{created a}} {{company-wide}} narrative {{that led to}} an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines {{that led to the}} event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker T to the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused to listen and continued his assault, causing <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a reason as to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent in their current rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end that type of behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from <b>sting</b> <b>to</b> cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E

25|$|In late 2002, Luger {{joined the}} European tour of WWA. He debuted in November in Dublin, Ireland, teaming with <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> defeat Buff Bagwell and Malice. At Retribution, Luger {{defeated}} <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> win the vacant WWA World Heavyweight Championship after Jeff Jarrett interfered on his behalf. In Manchester, England on December 7, Luger and Sting faced Bagwell and Jarrett in a match {{in which both}} Luger's WWA World Heavyweight Championship and Jarrett's NWA World Heavyweight Championship were on the line, though neither title changed hands, as Sting pinned Bagwell. Luger made his final appearance with WWA on December 13, in Zürich, Switzerland, when he lost the WWA World Heavyweight Championship to Sting in a three-way dance that also featured Malice.|$|E
25|$|Personnel issues {{also played}} {{their part in}} a poor season. Head Coach Willy Roy, who had led the <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> two NASL titles, was {{replaced}} by his assistant Eric Geyer in late December, and Karl-Heinz Granitza, the club's all-time leading goalscorer, who {{at the beginning of}} the season had seen his annual salary cut by $100,000 to $65,000, was suspended indefinitely on March 21 after an argument with owner Lee Stern.|$|E

50|$|Chalcid wasps are {{the primary}} parasites of M. rotundata. Some species include Pteromalus venustus, Monodontomerus obscurus, Melittobia chalybii, Diachys confusus, and Sapyga pumila.

Sting pinned Steiner to win, and Steiner resumed his role as Jarrett's bodyguard. He then faced Christian Cage on the August 10 Impact, and was in Jarrett's corner at Hard Justice before disappearing from TNA.|$|E
25|$|Rhodes {{continued}} to book Sting in title matches {{throughout the year}} against both NWA United States Champion Barry Windham and NWA Television Champion Mike Rotunda. In the fall of 1988, Sting was attacked by Hawk and Animal of The Road Warriors after a televised match. Rhodes, as booker, identified Sting as the face who was most over with the fans, despite knowing that turning the Road Warriors heel would be no easy task. Rhodes himself teamed with <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> challenge the Road Warriors for the tag team championship at Starrcade '88 that December. Rhodes and Sting got the win by disqualification, allowing the Road Warriors to retain the titles.|$|E
25|$|After a {{long war}} with the nWo, Luger joined nWo Wolfpac on May 25, 1998. Luger {{played a central role}} in the group's war with Hogan's nWo Hollywood, and even {{convinced}} the long-standing anti-nWo <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> join. On the August 10, 1998 episode of Nitro, he defeated Bret Hart to win his record-tying fifth, and final, United States Heavyweight Championship in an impromptu title match, before dropping the title back to Hart just one day later on Thunder. He also took part in the incident in which both nWo factions united against the dominant Bill Goldberg in early 1999. He remained a member of the new nWo until he was sidelined with a (legitimate) biceps injury.|$|E

25|$|Sting and Ric Flair {{continued}} their feud, and Flair defeated <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship {{for the seventh}} time on January 11. At that time, the title belt was extended to also represent the newly created WCW World Heavyweight Championship, and Flair became the first WCW World Heavyweight Champion. Their feud continued with a WarGames match at WrestleWar between the Four Horsemen and the team of Sting, the Steiner Brothers and Brian Pillman. The Four Horsemen won the match, and Sting's feud with them ended. Sting went on to feud with Nikita Koloff while Flair left World Championship Wrestling {{in the summer of}} 1991 due to disputes with its president, Jim Herd, and joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).|$|E
25|$|O. bauri {{is able to}} {{recognize}} other workers from different nests by antennation. This process happens when two ants are front to front of one another, and either one is touching the other’s antennae with their antennae or head. There are four different behavioral patterns that may result after recognition of the other ant. These are basic alertness, alarm, attack with mandibles or attack with sting. Basic alertness occurs when both ants open their mandibles to about 180°. Alarm is composed of both basic alertness with fast random body movements and release of alarm pheromone. Attack with mandibles is a pattern in which the trap jaw ant will use its mandibles in order to strike {{a blow to the}} opponent. Attack with sting is when the trap jaw ant will bend its abdomen forward and try to use its <b>sting</b> <b>to</b> hurt the opponent.|$|E
25|$|Another {{secondary}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Sting and The Great Muta for the NWA World Television Championship. At WrestleWar, Sting retained the Television Championship against The Iron Sheik and Muta defeated Doug Gilbert. On May 13 edition of World Championship Wrestling, Muta and his manager Gary Hart challenged <b>Sting</b> <b>to</b> a Dragon Shi match. On May 20 edition of World Championship Wrestling, Sting challenged Muta to an immediate match but Hart claimed that he and Muta were not ready. On May 27 edition of World Championship Wrestling, {{it was announced that}} Eddie Gilbert had accepted Muta's open challenge for a Dragon Shi match. On June 14 edition of Clash of the Champions, an in-ring presentation of Dragon Shi was held, during which Gilbert accidentally struck a fireball into Trent Knight's face.
