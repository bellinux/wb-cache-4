40|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} (BE) is {{the only}} identifiable premalignant condition for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Management of BE with low-grade dysplasia continues to be controversial. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or EAC among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasia treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) compared <b>with</b> <b>surveillance</b> endoscopy. Our search included Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central, was limited to English language articles, and was last searched on 31 December 2015. Studies were reviewed by title and abstract, and then full text by two independent reviewers. Two independent reviewers extracted data. Differences were resolved by consensus. The primary outcome of interest was the relative risk of disease progression among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasia treated <b>with</b> RFAcompared <b>with</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Our search resulted in 2, 029 citations, 19 studies {{were included in the}} final analysis, totaling 2, 746 patients. Relative risk of disease progression in RFA compared <b>with</b> <b>surveillance</b> was 0. 14 % (95 % confidence interval: 0. 04 - 0. 45), P= 0. 001. This measure was stable when only all studies were included. Absolute risk reduction was 10. 9 % and the number needed to treat was 9. 2. Results were stable over several quality measures, overtime, and when excluding randomized trials. The cumulative rate of progression to high-grade dysplasia/EAC was lower in RFA compared <b>with</b> <b>surveillance</b> (1. 7 % vs. 12. 6 %, P < 0. 001). Similarly, the incidence rate of progression among patients <b>with</b> <b>surveillance</b> was significantly higher from those treated with RFA (0. 022 vs. 0. 005, P < 0. 001). RFA results in a significant reduction risk of disease progression to high-grade dysplasia/EAC among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasi...|$|R
