5|$|Bormann's {{studies at}} an {{agricultural}} trade high school were interrupted {{when he joined}} the 55th Field Artillery Regiment as a gunner in June 1918, in the last days of World War I. He never saw action, but served garrison duty until February 1919. After working a short time in a cattle feed mill, Bormann became estate manager of a large farm in Mecklenburg. Shortly after starting work at the estate, Bormann joined an antisemitic landowners association. While hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic meant that money was worthless, foodstuffs stored on farms and estates became ever more valuable. Many estates, including Bormann's, had Freikorps units stationed on site to guard the crops from pillaging. Bormann joined the Freikorps organisation headed by Gerhard Roßbach in 1922, acting as <b>section</b> <b>leader</b> and treasurer.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main job was to train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a <b>section</b> <b>leader</b> and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that should have kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. It was dangerous work; on a single day, 3May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost {{until the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E

The division began training near Naples and practiced an amphibious landing at Salerno. Murphy was made <b>section</b> <b>leader</b> on 4 January and promoted to staff sergeant on 13 January. He was hospitalized in Naples with malaria on 21 January, and was unable to participate in the initial landing commanded by Major General John P. Lucas. Murphy returned to his unit in time {{to take part in the}} unsuccessful First Battle of Cisterna, which was fought between 30 January and 1 February.

Scout Networks are mainly member led, but are assisted by a Network Leader who ensures that the Network is working within {{the rules of the}} association. In addition to adult leadership, the association encourages its members themselves to take on positions of responsibility for their section meetings. This can be through responsibility for a group of members, such as the Patrol Leader and Assistant Patrol Leader in Scouts and Sixers and Seconders in Cubs, or through sectional forums to feedback on programmes. The Scout section also have the role of Senior Patrol Leader, usually someone about to move on to Explorers who overlooks all the patrols, {{and the members of the}} Explorer section are openly encouraged to run evenings and to plan their own meetings.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{promoted}} to Temporary Flying Officer, Brooks began {{working for the}} Missing Research and Enquiry Service (MRES), which was an initiative to locate individuals from the Commonwealth of Nations who were missing or killed in action during World War II over hostile territory. He worked with the service for nearly two years, from November 1945 through July 1947, as a Search Officer in Denmark, Norway, and as a <b>Section</b> <b>Leader</b> in the American Zone of Germany. Brooks and a colleague sailed a fishing smack around Cape Nordkinn in the Arctic Circle, the most northerly coastal point of the mainland of Europe, {{in the search for}} missing airmen. It was during his tenure with MRES that he met his wife Birthe. He also played ice hockey during his downtime in Scandinavia with the U.S. Army Allstars, and was selected {{to be a member of}} Canada's national delegation to the 1948 Winter Olympics. This squad, known as the Ottawa RCAF Flyers, consisted entirely of members of the Royal Canadian Air Force.|$|E
5|$|In the Operations notes, Formation Flying, orders {{specifically}} {{stated that}} the formation, as a whole, was not to stay together, saying each six aircraft section {{was to be a}} self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one's own section. If a <b>section</b> <b>leader</b> endeavoured to follow the formation leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, the formation would break apart. Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection; if the formation came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one. Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed this advice during the battle. Wing Commander Kellett had followed the notes, and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together, and lost none of his Wellingtons. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring this alternative.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the quality of the Leader-Member Exchange and the relationship with Organizational Commitment, Organizational Citizenship Behavior, Psychological Empowerment and Job Satisfaction of <b>section</b> <b>leaders</b> and team leaders, in summer children's camps in Greece. The high quality leadership of <b>section</b> and team <b>leader</b> encourages and supports the development of these dependent variables that play a particularly important role in organizational effectiveness camps. The two distinct samples were 669 team <b>leaders</b> and 148 <b>section</b> <b>leaders</b> from all summer children's camps in northern Greece. The participants completed the questionnaire of Leader-Member Exchange, Organizational Commitment, Psychological Empowerment, Organizational Citizenship Behavior and Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire. The results show the positive relationship with all the above means for all <b>leaders</b> and furthermore, <b>section</b> <b>leaders</b> have higher quality leadership than team leaders with moderate quality leadership. Summary, the members of the camps have modestly Organizational Commitment and Organizational Citizenship Behavior, and highly Psychological Empowerment and Job Satisfaction {{as a result of its}} quality leadership...|$|R
