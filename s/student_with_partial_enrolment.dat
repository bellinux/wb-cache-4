40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the situation of}} <b>students</b> <b>with</b> a disability studying in institutions of higher education, {{and how they can}} be helped to achieve their academic aims with the minimum of personal discomfort. Three main groups of students are identified—ambulant disabled and wheelchair bound <b>students,</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>partial</b> or complete loss of sight, and <b>students</b> <b>with</b> hearing impairments—and their particular problems and needs are discussed. Strategies for helping them achieve their academic aims are offered, including the suggestion that each institution should formulate a statement of policy in relation to admitting such students so as to ensure their welfare while they are studying...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{student learning and}} attendance in General Psychology courses which were either technology-assisted (PowerPoint and WebCT) providing <b>students</b> <b>with</b> complete notes, technology-assisted providing <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>partial</b> notes, or taught the traditional way using a chalkboard. Data collected from over 487 participants were analyzed using a 3 -way ANOVA and indicated that student leaning (final grade) was higher in the technology-assisted partial-note condition than the traditional condition and the technologyassisted complete-note condition. Also, attendance did not differ between conditions. Apparent gender differences were also discussed. The small amount of research that has been conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of technology-assisted instruction has resulted in mixed findings. Some studies have found that integrating technology into the classroom creates a rich, effective, and efficient learning environment which improves student performance an...|$|R

It is the first Ukrainian non-governmental educational institution of this kind.Gifted children from Donetsk oblast' and other regions of Ukraine learn ballet skills at Vadim Pisarev' school, there's also a school board for non-resident <b>students,</b> <b>with</b> <b>partial</b> allowance.Graduates of the school become students of prestigious dance institutions over the world, such as the Saint Petersburg Academy of Russian Ballet named after A.

50|$|The {{content of}} lessons may be {{differentiated}} {{based on what}} students already know. The most basic content of a lesson should cover the standards of learning set by the district or state. Some students in a class may be completely unfamiliar with the concepts in a lesson, some students may have partial mastery of the content - or display mistaken ideas about the content, and some students may show mastery of the content before the lesson begins. The teacher may differentiate the content by designing activities for groups of students that cover different areas of Bloom's taxonomy. For example, students who are unfamiliar with the concepts {{may be required to}} complete tasks on the lower levels of Bloom's Taxonomy: knowledge, comprehension, and application. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>partial</b> mastery may be asked to complete tasks in the application, analysis and evaluation areas, and students who have high levels of mastery may be asked to complete tasks in evaluation and synthesis.|$|R

40|$|Assessments {{represent}} {{an important component}} of undergraduate courses because they affect how <b>students</b> interact <b>with</b> course content and gauge student achievement of course objectives. To make decisions on assessment design, instructors must understand the affordances and limitations of available question formats. Here, we use a crossover experimental design to identify differences in how multiple-true-false (MTF) and free-response (FR) exam questions reveal student thinking regarding specific conceptions. We report that correct response rates correlate across the two formats but that a higher percentage of students provide correct responses for MTF questions. We find that MTF questions reveal a high prevalence of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> mixed (correct and incorrect) conceptions, while FR questions reveal a high prevalence of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>partial</b> (correct and unclear) conceptions. These results suggest that MTF question prompts can direct students to address specific conceptions but obscure nuances in student thinking and may overestimate the frequency of particular conceptions. Conversely, FR questions provide a more authentic portrait of student thinking but may face limitations in their ability to diagnose specific, particularly incorrect, conceptions. We further discuss an intrinsic tension between question structure and diagnostic capacity and how instructors might use multiple formats or hybrid formats to overcome these obstacles...|$|R

Several {{studies in}} recent years have {{demonstrated}} that upper-division <b>students</b> struggle <b>with</b> <b>partial</b> derivatives and the complicated chain rules ubiquitous in thermodynamics. We asked several experts (primarily faculty who teach thermodynamics) to solve a challenging and novel thermodynamics problem in order to understand how they navigate through this maze.

This case study focuses on one particular expert: his solution paths, use of sense-making tools, and comparison of different approaches...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} based on {{findings}} made by members of the Student Support Service of the Royal National Institute for the Blind during study visits to Hungary, Poland and Czecho‐Slovakia in June and September 1991 and during attendance at a conference in Prague in November 1991. All these visits were funded by the EC under the Tempus scheme ‐ Trans European Mobility Programme for University Students. The present position of students who have a significant visual disability was assessed against a background of the services available to such students in Britain and Ireland. Information was sought on students’ studies, the support services available from universities, local societies for the blind and other sources. Interviews showed that a significant number of visually handicapped students were studying in higher education, aided generally by supportive friends and staff. However, a considerable lack of specialist material and equipment was revealed and, in certain cases also, a lack of awareness of special needs. There appeared to be little knowledge of the numbers of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> high <b>partial</b> sight, or of their particular requirements. Recommendations for change are made and discussed in relation to personal, financial, vocational and technical requirements, in the short‐, medium‐ and long‐term, bearing in mind economic constraints within the countries concerned...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{student performance}} in courses, instructors have used {{various types of}} question item formats in their examinations. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the performance of pharmacy students completing a Pharmacy Calculations course which employed either open-ended or multiple choice examination questions. Methods A required Pharmacy Calculations course was taught to first year pharmacy students in two sequential years. The course content was essentially identical in both offerings. Year 1 : four examinations using open-ended questions were administered to the <b>students</b> (n= 75) <b>with</b> <b>partial</b> credit awarded. Year 2 : four multiple-choice examinations, employing no means for partial credit were administered (n= 78). The averages for each examination and overall course average for the two offerings were compared using a one-way ANOVA. Both courses were also assessed through an on-line course evaluation system using E-Value. Results Over a two year period, 153 students completed the Pharmacy Calculations course and course evaluation. One student failed the course in each year. In year 1, the class average (86. 97 +/- 6. 08) was significantly (P< 0. 05) lower than year 2 (89. 11 +/- 6. 89), implying that there may be some advantage to students who were offered multiple choice exams. Even <b>with</b> <b>partial</b> credit allotted to open-ended question formats, no apparent advantage is noted. Conclusions and Implications The use of multiple choice exams over open-ended exams in Pharmacy Calculations courses may provide students some added advantage in examinations. Course instructors might consider a combination of formats when assessing student knowledge...|$|R
