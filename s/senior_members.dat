5|$|Local {{units are}} called {{squadron}}s. A squadron is broken into flights. Squadrons {{are the main}} functioning body of Civil Air Patrol. Civil Air Patrol squadrons are designated as either cadet, senior, or composite squadrons. A CAP composite squadron consists of both cadets and <b>senior</b> <b>members,</b> who {{may be involved in}} any of the three missions of Civil Air Patrol. Composite squadrons have two deputy commanders to assist the squadron commander: a Deputy Commander for Seniors and a Deputy Commander for Cadets. A senior squadron includes only <b>senior</b> <b>members,</b> who participate in the emergency services or aerospace education missions of Civil Air Patrol. A cadet squadron is largely made up of cadets, with a small number of <b>senior</b> <b>members</b> as necessary for supervision of cadets and the proper execution of the cadet program. Overseas squadrons operate independently of this structure, reporting directly to the National Headquarters.|$|E

50|$|In 1985, {{indirect}} {{elections were}} introduced for the Legislative Council. To avoid confusion, Sir Edward Youde, the then-Governor, renamed the post <b>Senior</b> Unofficial <b>Member</b> in both councils ''''Senior Member''''. The introduction in 1991 of direct elections to the LegCo {{more than doubled}} the number of its members. The directly-elected members refused to take orders from the <b>Senior</b> <b>Member.</b> The <b>Senior</b> <b>Member</b> at the time, Allen Lee, was unable to represent the council with a single voice and would occasionally have run-ins with the directly-elected members. In 1992, Governor David Wilson abolished the LegCo post of <b>Senior</b> <b>Member.</b> In 1995, Governor Chris Patten renamed the ExCo post of <b>Senior</b> <b>Member</b> ''''Convenor of the Non-official Members''''.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, Emanuel was {{reported}} to have conflicts with other <b>senior</b> <b>members</b> of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point of criticism from left-leaning Democrats for the administration's perceived move to the center. By September 2010, with the Democrats anticipating heavy losses in midterm elections, this was said to precipitate Emanuel's departure as chief of staff.|$|E

5|$|<b>Senior</b> <b>members</b> {{are members}} who joined CAP {{for the first}} time past the age of 18, or who are former cadets who {{transferred}} to the senior member program, which must happen by the cadet's 21st birthday. <b>Senior</b> <b>members</b> who have not yet turned 21years are eligible for flight officer grades, which include flight officer, technical flight officer, and senior flight officer. There is no mandatory retirement age for CAP members, and there are no physical requirements for joining. Members may enter retired status after twenty years of service. The only physical requirements an officer must follow are the grooming and weight standards required of members who wear the United States Air Force-style uniforms (these do not apply to members who choose to wear those uniform designs unique to Civil Air Patrol).|$|E
5|$|A , or , is one {{of three}} <b>senior</b> <b>members</b> of the Yamayuri Council, {{although}} it is also possible to generally speak of {{all the members of the}} Yamayuri Council as roses. A Rose makes the important decisions within this group, since she has control over the student council. Candidates for the position, which lasts through the school year, are chosen through an election. Any student can run to become a Rose, although the position is usually given to the en boutons, the Roses' petite sœurs.|$|E
5|$|As a {{condition}} of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral. A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site, York Minster or Westminster Abbey, would be more suitable. A legal challenge confirmed there were no public law grounds for the courts {{to be involved in}} that decision. Reinterment took place in Leicester on 26 March 2015, during a televised memorial service held {{in the presence of the}} Archbishop of Canterbury and <b>senior</b> <b>members</b> of other Christian denominations.|$|E

5|$|Born the illegitimate {{son of a}} {{domestic}} servant and her employer in Tonbridge, Kent, Smith migrated to Canada in 1907, where he went {{through a variety of}} jobs and began reading about Western esotericism. Through Charles Stansfeld Jones he was introduced to the writings of Thelema's founder, Aleister Crowley. He subsequently joined Crowley's Thelemite order, the A∴A∴, and the Thelemite wing of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). In 1915, he joined the O.T.O.'s British Columbia Lodge No. 1, based in Vancouver, and rose to become one of its <b>senior</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn, {{as well as}} {{the other}} Inns of Court, became noted for the parties and festivals it hosted. Students {{performed}} masques and plays in court weddings, in front of Queen Elizabeth herself, and hosted regular festivals and banquets at Candlemas, All Hallows Eve and Easter. At Christmas the students ruled the Inn for the day, appointing a Lord of Misrule called the Prince of Purpoole, and organising a masque entirely on their own, with the Benchers and other <b>senior</b> <b>members</b> away for the holiday.|$|E
5|$|Membership in the {{organization}} consists of cadets ranging from 12 to just under 21 years of age, and <b>senior</b> <b>members</b> 18 {{years of age and}} up. These two groups each have the opportunity to participate {{in a wide variety of}} pursuits; the cadet program contributes to the development of the former group with a structured syllabus and an organization based upon United States Air Force ranks and pay grades, while the older members serve as instructors, supervisors, and operators. All members wear uniforms while performing their duties.|$|E

5|$|Senior {{membership}} {{is open to}} all U.S. citizens, and resident aliens aged 18 and over who are able to pass an FBI background check. There is no upper age limit, nor membership restrictions for physical disabilities, due to the number of different tasks which members may be called on to perform. Cadet {{membership is}} open to those aged between 12 and 18 who maintain satisfactory progress in school, as determined by the cadet's unit commander; upon their 18th birthday, cadets may become <b>senior</b> <b>members</b> or remain in the Cadet Program until they are 21.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If both the offices governor and lieutenant governor are vacant, the line of succession moves down through the <b>senior</b> <b>members</b> of the state senate and state house of representatives of the same party as the governor. The lieutenant governor was elected separately from the governor until a 1968 {{amendment to the constitution}} made it so that they are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5|$|Since most {{senators}} were former magistrates, {{the senate}} became bound {{together by a}} strong sense of collegiality. At any given point in time, many of the senate's most <b>senior</b> <b>members</b> were ex-Consuls, which facilitated the creation of a bond between the presiding Consul and those <b>senior</b> <b>members.</b> In addition, the Consul was always chosen from senate, and as such he usually held similar ideals as did his fellow senators. When his annual term ended, he returned to their ranks, and so he was unlikely to stand against his fellow senators. Before the enactment of the Ovinian Law, Consuls appointed new senators, but after the enactment of this law, Censors appointed new senators, which caused the senate to become even more independent of the presiding Consul. In addition, the Ovinian Law all but required that ex-magistrates be appointed to the senate, and as such, the process by which Censors appointed new members to the senate became quite objective. This further enhanced the competence, and thus the prestige, of the senate.|$|E

Darwin noted the immense number of organisms dependent on the kelp forests. He received word from Henslow that his first dispatch of specimens had reached Cambridge, with the South American fossils being prized by the expert William Clift as showing hitherto unknown species and features of the Megatherium, and displayed by William Buckland and Clift before the cream of British science, making Darwin's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Veteran West Virginia Senator Harley M.

In honor of his previous service, {{he was assigned to}} the prestigious Committee on Foreign Relations. In this position, he endorsed Eisenhower's appointment of Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal. His relative lack of seniority did not afford him much influence.|$|E

50|$|In January 1945, the 79th Congress, elected Kenneth McKellar, who at {{the time}} was the Senator with the longest {{continuous}} service, to be President pro tempore. Since then, it has become customary for the majority party's <b>senior</b> <b>member</b> to hold this position. Arthur Vandenberg (in 1947-1949) was the last president pro tempore not to be the <b>senior</b> <b>member</b> of the majority party, aside from the single day accorded Milton Young (in December 1980), who was the retiring <b>senior</b> <b>member</b> of the Republican Party, which would hold the majority in the incoming 97th Congress.|$|R
