This he blamed on American cultural imperialism, which meant that most cinemas preferred screening foreign films, especially those from Hollywood, and that Indonesian youth were no longer creating a uniquely Indonesia identity.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they <b>stop</b> <b>smoking,</b> and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{cancer was}} {{uncommon}} {{before the advent}} of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors' Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the Surgeon General of the United States recommended smokers should <b>stop</b> <b>smoking.</b>|$|E

500|$|In December 1962, the Beatles {{concluded}} {{their fifth}} and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, {{they had agreed}} that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, {{in an effort to}} maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, [...] "Look, {{if you really want to}} get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> ..." [...] Lennon said: [...] "We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage.

2500|$|Psychologists who {{strive to}} {{understand}} how biological, behavioral, and social factors influence health and illness are called health psychologists. Health psychologists use their knowledge of psychology and health to promote general well-being and understand physical illness. They are specially trained to help people deal with the psychological and emotional aspects of health and illness. Health psychologists work with many different health care professionals (e.g., physicians, dentists, nurses, physician's assistants, dietitians, social workers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and chaplains) to conduct research and provide clinical assessments and treatment services. Many health psychologists focus on prevention research and interventions designed to promote healthier lifestyles {{and try to find}} ways to encourage people to improve their health. For example, they may help people to lose weight or <b>stop</b> <b>smoking.</b> Health psychologists also use their skills to try to improve the healthcare system. For example, they may advise doctors about better ways to communicate with their patients.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1923, Freud {{detected}} a leukoplakia, a benign growth associated with heavy smoking, on his mouth. Freud initially kept this secret, but in April 1923 he informed Ernest Jones, {{telling him that}} the growth had been removed. Freud consulted the dermatologist Maximilian Steiner, who advised him to quit smoking but lied about the growth's seriousness, minimizing its importance. Freud later saw Felix Deutsch, who saw that the growth was cancerous; he identified it to Freud using the euphemism [...] "a bad leukoplakia" [...] instead of the technical diagnosis epithelioma. Deutsch advised Freud to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking</b> and have the growth excised. Freud was treated by Marcus Hajek, a rhinologist whose competence he had previously questioned. Hajek performed an unnecessary cosmetic surgery in his clinic's outpatient department. Freud bled {{during and after the}} operation, and may narrowly have escaped death. Freud subsequently saw Deutsch again. Deutsch saw that further surgery would be required, but did not tell Freud that he had cancer because he was worried that Freud might wish to commit suicide.|$|E

2500|$|By 1982, Newhart was {{interested}} in a new sitcom.

[...] Mary Frann was cast as his wife, Joanna. [...] Jennifer Holmes was originally cast as Leslie Vanderkellen, but left after former daytime soap star Julia Duffy joined the cast as Dick's inn maid and spoiled rich girl, Stephanie Vanderkellen. [...] Peter Scolari (who had {{been a fan of}} Newhart's since he was 17) was also cast as Dick's manipulative TV producer, Michael Harris, in six of the eight seasons.

Like The Bob Newhart Show, Newhart was an immediate hit, and again, like the show before it, it was also nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards, but failed to win any. During the time Newhart was working on the show, in 1985, his smoking habit finally caught up to him, and he was taken to the emergency room for secondary polycythemia.

2500|$|While Rodgers and Lerner {{were busy}} {{working on their}} {{original}} musical for her, she won the Theatre World Award {{for her role in}} playwright Arthur Kopit's dark comedic farce, Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad. She earned a nomination for the 1966 Tony for Best Actress in a Musical for On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (1965), a Broadway musical created for her by Alan Jay Lerner and Burton Lane. She starred as [...] "Daisy Gamble", a New Yorker who seeks out the help of a psychiatrist to <b>stop</b> <b>smoking.</b> Under hypnosis, the apparently kooky, brash, and quirky character reveals unexpected hidden depths. During her hypnotic trances, she becomes fascinating to the psychiatrist as she reveals herself as a woman who has lived many past lives, one of them ending tragically. While critics were divided over the merits of the show, they praised Harris's performance. The show opened on October 14, 1965 at the Mark Hellinger Theater and ran for 280 performances, earning a total of three Tony nominations. Harris performed numbers from the show with John Cullum on The Bell Telephone Hour ("The Lyrics of Alan Jay Lerner", broadcast on February 27, 1966).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{identify}} factors involved in not <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> {{in spite of}} being pregnant. METHODS: standardized interviews were applied to 486 pregnant women in the pre-natal clinics of four health centers {{in the city of}} Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between April 2003 and February 2004. Every time a smoker was identified, an additional interview, which included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Fagerströn scale for nicotine dependence, and the Screening Questionnaire for Adult Mental Disorders, was carried out. RESULTS: the prevalence of smoking, in the initial stages of pregnancy was 21. 1 %. Most smokers presented a low level of nicotine dependence. Thirty-six percent of them <b>stopped</b> <b>smoking</b> by the first trimester of the present pregnancy without any specific medical intervention. Important differences between those who were able to stop and those who were not were alcohol intake and number of previous attempts at abstinence. Women who <b>stopped</b> <b>smoking</b> drank less during gestation. CONCLUSIONS: <b>stopping</b> <b>smoking</b> during pregnancy seems to be linked to a non-specific drive towards the well-being of the fetus. The number of previous attempts at abstinence was positively related to stopping at the beginning of pregnancy. In spite of the prevalence of the problem, there is still inadequate support for smokers in the prenatal services...|$|R
