500|$|VA Deputy Undersecretary for Health Administrative Operations William Schoenhard wrote a memo on March 15, 2013 {{indicating}} that the VA was changing its performance measure for appointment wait times. The new goal involved measuring {{the number of days}} between a veteran's desired appointment date and the actual date of the appointment. A VA Office of the Medical Inspector report from December 2013 showed a dramatic change in March 2013 of the number of appointments booked within the 14-day window for the Ft. Collins, Colorado outpatient clinic. When investigators asked VA employees to explain [...] "what occurred in March 2013" [...] the employees said that [...] "they were instructed by Business office staff to access the appointment <b>schedule,</b> <b>review</b> it for capacity, inform the Veteran of schedule availability, and then enter the Desired Date as the patient appointment date" [...] and [...] "By entering the Desired Date as the appointment date, the wait time … appears to be zero days." [...] The Ft. Collins clinic is overseen by the Cheyenne, Wyoming, Veterans Affairs office. A coordinator at the Cheyenne office sent an email on June 19, 2013 with instructions on how to manipulate the appointment dates.

40|$|Timber {{harvesting}} {{changes the}} condition of forest ecosystems, which are {{a major influence on}} the characteristics of headwater streams. Such characteristics include the quantity and timing of base flow and storm flow, concentrations of sediment and dissolved nutrients, water temperature, and the stability of the stream channels. This paper explores previous studies dealing with the relationship between timber harvesting and its hydrologic effects, especially long term water yield increase. The watershed disturbance threshold theory is raised and investigated in detail. The development and evaluation of a spatial decision support system, the Harvest <b>Schedule</b> <b>Review</b> System (HSRS), is then described. The HSRS will aid in the minimization of hydrological impacts of forest harvesting, along with its related, negative environmental influences.

40|$|Students in the architecture, engineering, and {{construction}} disciplines are often challenged with visualizing {{and understanding the}} complex spatial and temporal relationships involved in designing and constructing three-dimensional (3 D) structures. An evolving body of research traces the use of educational computer simulations to enhance student learning experiences through testing real-world scenarios {{and the development of}} student decision-making skills. Ongoing research at Pennsylvania State University aims to improve engineering education in construction through interactive construction project learning applications in an immersive virtual reality environment. This paper describes the first- and second-generation development of the Virtual Construction Simulator (VCS), a tool that enables students to simultaneously create and review construction schedules through 3 D model interaction. The educational value and utility of VCS was assessed through surveys, focus group interviews, and a student exercise conducted in a construction management class.

40|$|A massive {{improvement}} {{program of the}} LHC injector chain is presently being conducted under the LIU project. For the proton chain, this includes the replacement of Linac 2 with Linac 4 {{as well as all}} necessary upgrades to the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), the Proton Synchrotron (PS) and Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), aimed at producing beams with the challenging High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) parameters. Regarding the heavy ions, plans to improve the performance of Linac 3 and the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) are also pursued under the general LIU program. The full LHC injection chain returned to operation after Long Shutdown 1, with extended beam studies taking place in Run 2.

40|$|Preparations for {{conducting}} large-scale combustion tests with caking bituminous coal continued during {{the start of}} this quarter. Major project accomplishments related to bituminous coal testing included: a CFD preheat model and evaluation, an update of the process flow diagram and a detailed preheat burner mechanical design (suitable for construction) for firing bituminous coal. Installation and testing of the 85 MMBtu/h bituminous coal preheating system was planned to take place before the end of December. Based on the inability to conduct testing in Riley's Commercial Burner Test Facility (CBTF) during freezing weather, a <b>schedule</b> <b>review</b> indicated required site work for testing bituminous coal at the CBTF could not be completed before freezing weather set in at the site. Further bituminous preheat modification work was put on hold and efforts turned to securing the test facility over the winter season. Bituminous coal tests are therefore delayed; April-May 2005 is earliest estimate of when testing can resume. A request for a time extension was submitted to DOE to extend the project through September 2005 to allow time to secure additional funding and complete the bituminous coal testing. Removal of the PRB PC Preheater from the CBTF burner deck was completed. Decommissioning of the CBTF for the winter was also completed...|$|E

40|$|Maintenance of a {{sustainable}} clean water supply {{is critical for}} our future. However, watershed degradation is a common phenomenon {{around the world that}} leads to poor water quality. In order to protect water resources, the Watershed Forest Management Information System (WFMIS), was developed as an extension of ArcGIS® and is described in this paper. There are three submodels to address nonpoint source pollution mitigation, road system management, and silvicultural operations, respectively. The Watershed Management Priority Indices (WMPI) is a zoning approach to prioritize critical areas for conservation and restoration management. It meets the critical need to spatially differentiate land cover and site characteristics within a watershed to quantify their relative influence on overall water quality. The Forest Road Evaluation System (FRES) is a module to evaluate road networks in order to develop preventive management strategies. The Harvest <b>Schedule</b> <b>Review</b> System (HSRS) is a module to analyze and evaluate multi-year and multi-unit forest harvesting to assist in the reduction of impact on water yield and associated changes in water quality. The WFMIS utilizes commonly available spatial data and has user friendly interfaces to assist foresters and planners to manage watersheds in an environmentally healthy way. Application examples of each submodel are presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design; development {{and testing of}} a personal computer-based system to schedule basic training for Federal Armed Forces of Germany (Bundeswehr) conscripts. Each quarter 20, 000 conscripts undergo three months of basic training in over 100 different units. The training objectives fit in 450 training topics which are currently scheduled in a time consummg manual process. An interactive PASCAL program with a graphical user interface heuristically constructs a schedule and accommodates manual changes. The heuristic uses a clock advancing selection algorithm followed by an improvement algorithm. After pre-assigning topics that require a special facility or instructor, the heuristic schedules the remaining topics while satisfying all prerequisites. Extensive testing of the program on realistic data shows that the software produces a high quality schedule with face validity and requires less than ten minutes on an IBM 80486 DX- 2 66 MHz personal computer to construct a schedule for one quarter. It is estimated that quarterly data entry, <b>schedule</b> <b>review</b> and revision with the program would require 1. 5 man-days; {{this is a significant}} savings compared to the 10 to 15 man-days currently needed without the program. Considering 100 units must produce a quarterly schedule four times a year, the program would cut the Bundeswehr yearly scheduling effort from between 4, 000 and 6, 000 man-days to an estimated 600 man-days.

40|$|The 2 MW, 110 GHz ECH {{system was}} based on the General Atomics Proposal to the Department of Energy: DIII-D Fusion Research Program Vol. I Technical, and Vol. II Cost (GACP- 72 - 166, July 1987 and revised). This {{proposal}} was reviewed in August 1987 by a senior technical review committee, who recommended to vigorously pursue increasing the ECH power to 6 MW. The realization of the higher frequency and power ECH on DIII-D was recognized by the committee to be important, not only for the DIII-D program, but also for future devices and the whole ECH area. Subsequently, an engineering cost and <b>schedule</b> <b>review</b> was conducted by DOE-OAK which confirmed the GA costs and schedules and recommended proceeding directly to 10 MW. However, because of budgetary constraints, in the April 1988 Field Task Proposal submission, GA proposed a phased ECH approach, Phase I being 2 MW and Phase II increasing the power to 10 MW. After review, DOE instructed GA to initiate the prototype 2 MW, 110 GHz program. The contract to procure four 500 kW, 110 GHz, 10 s gyrotrons from Varian Associates was initiated in April 1989 with final delivery by November 1990. Because of difficulties in spreading the energy of the electron beam over the collector area, the testing of the first gyrotron delayed its delivery until February 1991. The second gyrotron was able to operate for 1 s at 500 kW and 2 s at 300 kW, but failed when the cavity suffered thermal damage...|$|E

30|$|Teachers can {{introduce}} spacing {{to their students}} in two broad ways. One involves creating opportunities to revisit information throughout the semester, or even in future semesters. This does involve some up-front planning, and {{can be difficult to}} achieve, given time constraints and the need to cover a set curriculum. However, spacing can be achieved with no great costs if teachers set aside a few minutes per class to review information from previous lessons. The second method involves putting the onus to space on the students themselves. Of course, this would work best with older students – high school and above. Because spacing requires advance planning, it is crucial that the teacher helps students plan their studying. For example, teachers could suggest that students schedule study sessions on days that alternate with the days on which a particular class meets (e.g., <b>schedule</b> <b>review</b> sessions for Tuesday and Thursday when the class meets Monday and Wednesday; see Fig.  1 for a more complete weekly spaced practice schedule). It {{important to note that the}} spacing effect refers to information that is repeated multiple times, rather than the idea of studying different material in one long session versus spaced out in small study sessions over time. However, for teachers and particularly for students planning a study schedule, the subtle difference between the two situations (spacing out restudy opportunities, versus spacing out studying of different information over time) may be lost. Future research should address the effects of spacing out studying of different information over time, whether the same considerations apply in this situation as compared to spacing out restudy opportunities, and how important it is for teachers and students to understand the difference between these two types of spaced practice.|$|E
