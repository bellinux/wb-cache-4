[...] "I do not think fiction could surpass the reality," [...] a British fashion {{magazine}} editor says of The Devil Wears Prada. [...] "rt in this instance is only a poor imitation of life." [...] Wintour, the editor says, routinely requests to be seated out of sight of competing editors at shows. [...] "We <b>spend</b> <b>our</b> working lives telling people which it-bag to carry but Anna is so above the rest of us she does not even have a handbag." ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{legislation}} that would become Medicare was introduced in 1961, he created a recording for the American Medical Association (AMA) warning that such legislation would {{mean the end of}} freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, [...] "we will awake to find that we have socialism. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to <b>spend</b> <b>our</b> sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free." [...] He also joined the National Rifle Association (NRA) and would become a lifetime member.|$|E
500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we <b>spend</b> <b>our</b> life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Frullo {{was also}} {{endorsed}} by U.S. Representative Randy Neugebauer of Lubbock, who defeated Isett in the 2003 special election for Congress. In his initial statement of candidacy, Frullo {{said that he}} is committed to [...] "making sure that government doesn't take away freedoms and overtax us. We need to hold our government accountable on how it <b>spends</b> <b>our</b> money." [...] Frullo, a member of the National Rifle Association, listed the critical issues as the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, property tax reform, U.S.-Mexican border security, photographic identity of voters, and public education, which he describes as [...] "a huge part of our budget and {{we need to make sure}} that we are <b>spending</b> <b>our</b> money properly." ...|$|R
500|$|Cooper's {{ability to}} project his {{personality}} onto his characters {{played an important}} part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper, [...] "This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us <b>spend</b> <b>our</b> lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural." [...] Charles Laughton, who played opposite Cooper in Devil and the Deep agreed, [...] "In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets at it from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life." [...] William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a [...] "superb actor, a master of movie acting". In his review of Cooper's performance in The Real Glory, Graham Greene wrote, [...] "Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Moral anti-realists {{debate whether}} the moral facts {{necessary}} to activate conscience supervene on natural facts with a posteriori necessity; or arise a priori because moral facts have a primary intension and naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical. It {{has also been}} argued {{that there is a}} measure of moral luck in how circumstances create the obstacles which conscience must overcome to apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of enforceable property rights and the rule of law, access to universal health care plus the absence of high adult and infant mortality from conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and famine, people in relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared pangs of conscience associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of food, bribe tax inspectors or police officers, and commit murder in guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel armies. Scrutton has claimed that true understanding of conscience and its relationship with morality has been hampered by an [...] "impetuous" [...] belief that philosophical questions are solved through the analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested interests. Susan Sontag similarly argued that it was a symptom of psychological immaturity not to recognise that many morally immature people willingly experience a form of delight, in some an erotic breaking of taboo, when witnessing violence, suffering and pain being inflicted on others. Jonathan Glover wrote that most of us [...] "do not <b>spend</b> <b>our</b> lives on endless landscape gardening of our self" [...] and our conscience is likely shaped not so much by heroic struggles, as by choice of partner, friends and job, as well as where we choose to live. Garrett Hardin in a famous article called tragedy of the commons argued that any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the general good-by means of his or her conscience- merely sets up a system which, by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to those lacking in conscience, while fostering guilt (including anxiety about his or her individual contribution to over-population) in people acting upon it, actually works toward the elimination of conscience from the race.|$|E
2500|$|Lomborg, Bjørn, , 2007, argues against taking {{immediate}} and [...] "drastic" [...] action to curb greenhouse gases while simultaneously stating that [...] "Global warming is happening. It's {{a serious and}} important problem...". He argues that [...] "...the cost and benefits of the proposed measures against global warming. ...is the worst way to <b>spend</b> <b>our</b> money. Climate change is a 100-year problem— we should not try to fix it in 10 years." ...|$|E

40|$|Using a new dataset of Swiss cantons from 1890 to 2000, we {{estimate}} the causal effect of direct democracy on government <b>spending.</b> <b>Our</b> analysis is novel in two ways: first, we use fixed effects {{to control for}} unobserved heterogeneity; second, we combine a new instrument with fixed effects to address the potential endogeneity of institutional reform. We find that direct democracy has a constraining, but modest effect on <b>spending.</b> <b>Our</b> estimates suggest that a mandatory budget referendum reduces canton expenditures by 9 percent. A decline in the signature requirement for the voter initiative by one percent reduces spending by 2. 2 percent. We find no evidence that direct democracy at the canton level results in higher local spending or a more decentralized government. ...|$|R

2500|$|Sugizo in the {{interview}} said that [...] "there are secrets held by a small elite who control the world...

[...] meant [...] "We have to liberate freedom and rebuild it by ourselves. I think {{the world is in}} need of a revolution. To know what to believe, to know what's really going on in this world we have to take the initiative. That's the sort of signal I'm trying to send". Also added [...] "The thing I seriously want to do the most is make society, the whole world, clean. That's the duty we must fulfill for the next generation".|$|E
2500|$|McNamara's staff {{stressed}} {{systems analysis}} {{as an aid}} in decision making on weapon development and many other budget issues. The secretary believed that the United States could afford any amount needed for national security, but that [...] "this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency {{to the way we}} <b>spend</b> <b>our</b> defense dollars.... You have to make a judgment on how much is enough." [...] Acting on these principles, McNamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $14 billion in the five-year period beginning in 1961. Although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary to national security. He was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.|$|E

40|$|We use unique {{data from}} an insurer that {{exclusively}} offers high-deductible, "consumer-directed" health plans {{to identify the}} effect of plan features, notably employer contributions to the spending account, on health care <b>spending.</b> <b>Our</b> {{results show that the}} marginal dollar contributed by the employer to the spending account is entirely spent on outpatient and pharmacy services. In contrast, out-of-pocket spending was not responsive to the amount the employer contributes to the <b>spending</b> account. <b>Our</b> results represent the first plausibly causal estimates of the components of consumer-driven health plans on health spending. The magnitudes of the effects suggest important health care spending consequences to higher employer contributions to <b>spending</b> accounts. <b>Our</b> findings are most directly relevant to health reimbursement arrangement plan designs, though our results are still of value to health savings account plan designs.
