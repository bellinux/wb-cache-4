5|$|In 2009, she {{returned}} to India {{in the wake of}} the economic recession and moved to Mumbai to stay with Priyanka. During a visit to Yash Raj Films studio, Priyanka (who was filming for Pyaar Impossible!) introduced Parineeti to the head of the public relations team of the company. Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect job, because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> what she had learned and work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession seemed like an excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when she observed Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E
5|$|Salim {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by TJ Ramini. After Drake defeats the henchmen {{in the desert}} ghost town, Salim comes to him on horseback and helps him escape. After Drake was rescued, Salim tells him that the Atlantis of the Sands is a {{dangerous}} place and that Marlowe cannot be allowed to enter because of the evil within. Drake believes that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> these powers to control others through fear, realising it was not treasure they were after. When Sully is rescued, Salim brings both {{of them to the}} open desert where the Atlantis of the Sands is located. Salim heads off and gets separated from Drake and Sully because of the heavy sandstorm. After Talbot is defeated and the Atlantis of the Sands collapse, Salim appears in time to save them.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production was {{originally}} estimated at ten months, but ultimately extended to fourteen months. Each {{time a new}} movement or ability was created for the Prince, it required adjustments to multiple other systems, as leaving them alone would have damaged the game. They also needed to make adjustments to the enemy and partner artificial intelligence, {{and they did not}} have time to polish those systems. All this meant that the debugging started much later than originally scheduled. The Prince had over 780 scripted movements, far more than any other character in the game. This caused problems with creating the movements for other characters. To make the character movements realistic, the team used motion capture to animate their movements. Art director Raphael Lacoste did not join the team until July 2002, well into the game's production, resulting in multiple delays in creating the game's environments. This issue was compounded by the need to produce a demo for the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, then to deliver an entire game at the same if not a higher quality than the demo. Each environment needed to work for the Prince's set of movements and abilities: the work needed involved checking each rewind sequence, and each of the Prince's movement in and effect on the environment worked. These issues were compounded by the late delivery of environmental maps. In hindsight, producer Yannis Mallat lamented the fact {{that they did not have}} enough time to work out the problems caused by these issues. Despite these problems, other parts of production including play-testing, management of creative tools, and the integrated testing system worked smoothly. A cited example was the team discovering a tester that was good at finding severe bugs, so they included her in one of their testing groups, giving her a development kit <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> to sort out those bugs. This was replicated, and managed to greatly increase the amount of bugs that could be found and fixed. The development team's enthusiasm was also high, which enabled the problems during development to be overcome. During the aftermath of E3, the team considered release The Sands of Time as two games so they could include all the desired content, but the idea was dropped. Another element that needed to be cut after the demo was a griffin boss that would appear three times during the Prince's journey.|$|E

25|$|On 31 July Tartar sighted a {{schooner}}. Maxwell set off {{to prevent}} the schooner from entering the narrow and intricate channel between the island of Saona and San Domingo {{where it would be}} difficult for him to pursue. As Tartar got closer he saw that the schooner was using her sweeps to aid her. Her behaviour made Maxwell suspect that his quarry was a privateer so he pursued her until neither vessel could progress farther. At that point, Maxwell was unable to get Tartar into a position from which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> her broadside. Instead, he sent in a cutting out party in three boats. As the boats set out, their quarry fired a gun, hoisted French colours, and then opened fire on the boats. The schooner was not able to deter the attack and the British captured her with no more casualties than two men wounded. The French lost nine killed and six wounded, as well as three missing, presumed drowned when they tried to swim to shore. Maxwell sent the wounded to San Domingo under flag of truce, but kept the other Frenchmen prisoners, there being no English prisoners available for exchange. The privateer was Hirondelle, under the command of Captain La Place. She was armed with ten 4-pounder guns and had been out of San Domingo for two days. She had been active during the French Revolutionary Wars and for the past two years also, having frequently escaped pursuit due to her speed.|$|E

Suffolk quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed the German ships. At 20:30, the heavy cruiser [...] joined Suffolk, but approached the German raiders too closely. Lütjens ordered his ships to engage the British cruiser; Bismarck fired five salvoes, three of which straddled Norfolk and rained shell splinters on her decks. The cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a fog bank, ending the brief engagement. The concussion from the 38cm guns disabled Bismarcks FuMo 23 radar set; this prompted Lütjens to order Prinz Eugen to take station ahead so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> her functioning radar to scout for the formation.|$|E

In a 1994 Rolling Stone interview, Love said she overheard him working on the song's riff in a closet. She said she asked him if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> the riff for one of her songs, to which he replied, [...] " [...] off!" [...] and closed the closet door.

However, Cobain had originally titled the song [...] "Heart-Shaped Coffin".|$|E
500|$|In late September 1917, Worsley and the PC.61 were {{on patrol}} {{to the south}} of Ireland. On 26 September 1917, a nearby tanker was struck by a torpedo from a U-boat, [...] Observing the explosion, Worsley {{gradually}} slowed his propellers, hoping to deceive the U-boat's crew into thinking his P-boat was leaving the area and luring the submarine to the surface. [...] The deception was successful and the UC-33 surfaced, intending to sink the tanker with its deck gun. Worsley immediately ordered full speed ahead and, realising that he would lose time in manoeuvring his ship into a position in which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> her guns, set a collision course with the U-boat, intending to ram the submarine. At high speeds the bow, to which the ram was fitted, of the PC.61 lifted out of the water considerably, and Worsley had to reduce speed at the right moment in order for it to be at the right height to strike the submarine. He timed the reduction of speed of the PC.61 perfectly and she struck the UC-33 midships as it was submerging. The submarine rapidly sunk with nearly all hands, the exception being the captain, who was rescued and later gifted Worsley a silver whistle. The damaged tanker was towed to Milford Haven in Wales, which took 12 hours in an area where other U-boats were known to be lurking.|$|E
500|$|She was {{particularly}} affectionate towards the latter because it {{allowed her to}} appear on camera with her two children, {{and said it was}} her favorite. Certain elements of Rand's characterization were developed by Whitney and Shatner; Whitney would go to Shatner's side when their characters were put in danger – in response, Shatner would put his arms around her, such as in [...] "Balance of Terror". The character was written out of the episode [...] "Dagger of the Mind", which Whitney attributed to the romantic liaison that Kirk has with the female lead in that episode being so overt that it would have caused issues for later plots. This was because the script had Kirk and the female lead sleep with each other. Although Whitney found it difficult to watch as her character had been removed from the episode, she understood why. Part of her outfit was dictated by attempting to increase the duties of the Captain's Yeoman on screen. In order to provide support while part of an away team on a planet, Roddenberry suggested that she could wear a device on an over-the-shoulder strap which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> as an electronic camera. He also suggested immediately that it could be expanded in order to be sold as a toy for young girls. This was part of the development process that {{led to the creation of}} the tricorder.|$|E

500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} and second unit director David Leitch {{compared it to}} a [...] "Jackie Chan hybrid of comedy and action." [...] Prior to the filming, Leitch organized a month-long boot camp in order to prepare Renner and Arterton (who said she was also glad that at least <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> her prior training that she received while studying at RADA) with extensive weapons, fight and stunt training. Janssen said she enjoyed [...] "flying", something that she always wanted to do, adding that despite her reputation as an action star {{it was the first}} film where she really had to do something physical (including suffering a minor accident on the set), because she could not use a double in the close-up scenes where she had the makeup on. During one of the scenes, where Gretel is thrown through a wall and falls down several meters, a stunt double for Arterton was dangerously injured when a nail got lodged in her skull close to the brain; Arterton said she initially wanted to do this stunt herself but Wirkola would not let her. Arterton herself suffered an injury when she sprained her ankle while running through the forest. Stunts for the more aggressive witches were done by New Zealander stuntwoman and actress Zoë Bell. Renner did practically all of his stunt scenes himself.|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that actress Elizabeth Banks would guest {{star on the}} show, and in this episode, she played right-wing CNBC anchor Avery Jessup, and love interest to Alec Baldwin's Jack Donaghy.

[...] "I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true." [...] She said that on her first day on set she [...] "begged" [...] producers if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> a teleprompter—in which she is first introduced in the episode on the set of her show The Hot Box, with her interviewing Jack and another guest (Douglas Rees)—so that she could deliver her lines quickly, explaining that her fast delivery would help [...] "sell" [...] the comedy and her 30 Rock character. They agreed to it, though, a problem ensued when they could not figure the prompter out, which resulted in Banks [...] "throwing fastballs at [...] and him battling them back as fast as possible and hoping they could cut it together faster than we were doing it." [...] Banks revealed to Ausiello that she had no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having [...] "too much fun" [...] making movies to commit to a television show full-time. According to a February 2010 report in the New York Post, after the airing of this episode, the Avery character was based on CNBC news anchor Melissa Francis, and it was Francis who [...] "pitched" [...] the character to a 30 Rock producer.
