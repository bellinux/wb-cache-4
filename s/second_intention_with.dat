40|$|This is {{the first}} {{documented}} case of clostridial myositis in a foal. A 36 -hour-old warmblood filly presented for evaluation of mild colic. The foal received two doses of intramuscular banamine prior to presentation. A firm swelling was noted over the injection sites approximately 48 hours following administration. The swellings were fenestrated, flushed with sterile saline, infused with both oxygen and potassium penicillin, and penrose drains were inserted to prevent closure. The foal was medically managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, intravenous fluids, and gastroprotectants. Damage to the affected region resulted in the sloughing of a 500 cm 2 region of the right medio-caudal thigh. Daily wound management included flushing the wound using intralesional pulsed lavage, cold hosing, and hand walking. The course of hospitalization encompassed one month. The foal was discharged on oral chloramphenicol and gastroprotectants. The affected region healed via <b>second</b> <b>intention</b> <b>with</b> no evidence of fibrotic myopathy...|$|E
40|$|Well control can {{in short}} words be {{described}} as the core for human safety on board a platform or a rig. It includes a variety of elements that go under the name barrier elements that are in place to prevent an unwanted inflow of formation fluids. They need to be functional in order to fulfil their purpose. Elements are made, controlled and replaced by people, it is therefore vital that the people working with them knows how they work in order to detect failure so they can be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. It is also important that everyone working in a drilling operation knows what well control is and the different scenarios that can develop if one should emerge. On the Norwegian Continental Shelf the number one priority from the authorities are safety, this is what the industry chases in pursuit for black gold and high rewards. To secure their investment guidelines, procedures and standards are provided to the industry and it is required that the people working there knows what they say, understand them and work according to them. In this way everything is done {{to make sure that all}} operations are successful operations. This high safety focus ensures that workers can go home from work in the same physical condition as when they went to work in the morning, or when they left for their offshore period 14 days earlier. The different well control methods are used for different situations depending on a variety of factors. This might be what depth the incident happened at, drill string position, personnel competence, and platform capacities to mention a few. For the Driller`s method (DM) and Weight and Wait (W&W) method, in many ways they use the same operational procedures when killing the well, but the thing that separates them from each other are when kill mud gets introduced into the system. Time consumption are also another aspect that separates them, where W&W uses less time compare to DM. W&W can also have an positive advantage, if the kill mud enters the annulus before the kick reaches the casing shoe, then it will be able to reduce the pressure from the kick acting on the casing shoe due to its heavier weight. The Volumetric method and Bullheading method may be the best choice if the drill string is high up or out of the well, if the competence among the personnel is too low to perform a conventional kill method (DM and W&W), or if there are limitation within the equipment to handle the kick on surface etc. In these cases the Volumetric or Bullheading method may be the best choice when killing a well. The selection of mud in the system is also an element related to well control, and knowing the different behaviour between WBM and OBM in the event of a kick is crucial and very important. To know the behaviour increases the chances of detecting a kick early and before it escalates into a large kick. In WBM, when a gas kick enter the wellbore it will occupy annulus space which can be observed at surface as pit gain. However, there is another process developing in the OBM, here the gas gets dissolved into the OBM and the chances of detecting this at surface are small. Also, also if the mud is stationary the kick will also be stationary until circulation starts up again. When the circulation starts up the dissolved gas moves upwards in the annulus together with the mud, nothing happens, not until the well pressure gets reduced to the extent that it reaches the boiling pressure of the gas, or the flash point. What happen is that gas goes out of suspension and back into free gas, this will lead to a rapid displacement of mud, and the result can lead to, if they are unable to trap it in the well and it moves past the BOP, a surface blowout with unpleasant consequences. With today`s search for more and remote black gold, drilling gets deeper along with more complex well paths which reduces the margins for errors. This increases focus and requirements to personnel`s experience and knowledge, and are one of the most important factor in terms of reducing the risk and consequence if an incident should happen. One intention with this thesis is to shed light on different elements related to well control, in this way it is possible to increase the overall understanding a bit more. The <b>second</b> <b>intention</b> <b>with</b> the thesis is to give a broader understanding of four well control methods used today. Two of them will have a higher focus than the rest. Also the importance of knowing and understanding well control calculations is elaborated by calculation examples for several different well scenarios. Also different platform types are used for distinguishing between the different methods. Hopefully the thesis will contribute to a broader understanding of well control...|$|E

METHODS: We present three emblematic cases in which the posterior perineal region was reconstructed by means of vertical subcutaneous pedicle flaps, subsequent to cutaneous tissue loss after surgery for extensive condilomas or neoplastic pathologies. RESULTS: Tissue loss was repaired by means of a V-Y type vertical subcutaneous pedicle flap, constructed laterally of the extirpation zone and advanced in a median direction. In all cases, no ischemia or infection of flaps occurred; sphincteral continence and long-term aesthetic results have proved to be satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Vertical pedicle subcutaneous flaps are well vascularized, extremely mobile, and easy to perform and have no serious postoperative complications...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} one of the {{essential}} problems in epistemology, that is, the foundation and variety of universal concepts. The classical controversy on universals is baseless if we do not consider different kinds of universal concepts. In this thesis, universal concepts are examined as classified into three groups: first <b>intentions,</b> logical <b>second</b> <b>intentions</b> and philosophical <b>second</b> <b>intentions.</b> We elaborate these three kinds of concepts from two perspectives. First, we have a journey in the history of Islamic philosophy from Farabi to contemporary philosophers in order to see what they mentioned in this regard.

Feint attacks aim to provoke a specific reaction (such as a parry-riposte or a counterattack), which the attacker can then counteract to his own advantage (to keep with earlier examples, through a planned counter-riposte or counter-time respectively). In other words, one does not attack with the first movement(s) or intention, but, rather, attacks <b>with</b> a <b>second</b> <b>intention,</b> the goal {{of which is to}} provoke a specific reaction from the open end.

METHODS: 610 consecutive patients underwent surgery for abdominal thoracic endocrinologic and post traumatic pathologies. In 203 cases we used the zipper a new device for skin closure. RESULTS: 6 / 203 Morbility: in six cases it was necessary to substitute the zipper with sutures or leave the wound healing by <b>second</b> <b>intention.</b> The patients were operated for inguinal hernioplasty, axillary lymphadenectomy, appendicectomy and cholecystectomy. These patients developed complications after surgery as hematoma, lymphorrhea, wound infection and a reintervention. The correction has been done removing the zipper and positioning sutures or leaving the wound healing by <b>second</b> <b>intention.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The use of the zipper permits to achieve an efficient seal, a simple application, an aesthetic comfort; it can be applied in local anaesthesia and for its painless, application it is indicated in pediatric surgery...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{contribute}} to the discussion on how to increase lower educated workers' participation in training programs inside and outside the workplace through stimulating <b>intentions</b> <b>with</b> respect to training. Design/methodology/approach: This article is based on data from the Study on Life Long Learning and Employment by TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research), a three-wave longitudinal study among lower educated workers in three different companies in The Netherlands. Data from the baseline questionnaire on 213 workers who are not currently participating in training activities are used along with a multiple regression model to test whether subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, attitude/expected value, management support, coworker support, career orientation, job insecurity and prior participation in informal learning correlate with lower educated workers' <b>intentions</b> <b>with</b> respect to training. Findings: This study shows that when stimulating lower educated workers' <b>intentions</b> <b>with</b> respect to training, one should focus on their attitude towards training participation, their subjective norms on training participation and their perceived behavioral control over participating in training. These aspects can be influenced through management support, coworker support and promoting career orientation. These factors contribute to the personal factors and thus, although indirectly, stimulate <b>intentions</b> <b>with</b> respect to training. Originality/value: This article is the first to present clear ideas on ways to stimulate lower educated workers' intentions to participate in workplace learning activities and to develop interventions to strengthen their current and future labor market position. It also shows that in stimulating lower educated workers' <b>intentions</b> <b>with</b> respect to training the focus should be on individual, as well as organizational, or group factors. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
