Another Germanic group that accompanied the Suebi and settled in Gallaecia were the Buri.

In the Otto configuration based <b>SPR</b> chip, a negative effect of the adhesion layer on the <b>SPR</b> quality can be eliminated because of the arrangement of the metal film which is separated from the glass substrate and this characteristic was analyzed a previous study [3].

We first introduce the concepts of <b>SPR</b> regions and weak <b>SPR</b> regions and show that the <b>SPR</b> region associated with a fixed polynomial is unbounded, whereas the weak <b>SPR</b> region is bounded. We then prove that the intersection of several weak <b>SPR</b> regions associated with different polynomials {{can not be a}} single point. Furthermore, we show how to construct a point in the <b>SPR</b> region from a point in the weak <b>SPR</b> region. Based on these theoretical development, we propose an algorithm for robust design of <b>SPR</b> transfer functions. This algorithm works well for both low order and high order polynomial families.

The tremendous development of <b>SPR</b> use in biomedical applications during the last years is the reason why attention in this review is focused on the application of <b>SPR</b> for biomedical purposes. Biomedical applications take advantage of the ex-quisite sensitivity of <b>SPR</b> for the determination of DNA hybridization, diagnosis of virus-induced diseases, enzyme–substrate interactions, polyclonal antibody characterization, epitope mapping, protein conformation studies and label-free immunoassays. This review covers also some aspects of the evolu-tion of surface plasmon resonance biosensors. The general principles of <b>SPR</b> sensor action are presen-ted and major <b>SPR</b> formats are described. <b>SPR</b> bio-sensor employment for detection of various analytes ranging from small organics up to large protein com-plexes is reviewed. Immobilization methods used in the design of <b>SPR</b> biosensors are briefly described. Application of <b>SPR</b> for analysis of protein kinases as a major component in signal generation and trans-duction in eukaryotic cell is discussed. New ways of <b>SPR</b> application and new designs of hybrid <b>SPR</b> sen-sors are predicted and discussed.

We first cloned endothelial <b>SPR</b> cDNA from bovine aortic endothelial cells (Genebank: DQ 978331).

In vivo delivery of <b>SPR</b> gene significantly increased vascular <b>SPR</b> protein expression (mouse vs. bovine antibodies to differentiate endogenous vs. exogenous), activity, H 4 B content, and NO• production, as well as NO•-dependent vasorelaxation. In endothelial cells transfected with small interfering RNA specific for <b>SPR,</b> ∼ 87 % of mRNA were attenuated (real-time quantitative RT-PCR), corresponding to a significant reduction in <b>SPR</b> protein expression and activity, which was associated with decreases in both intracellular H 4 B content and NO• level.

60|$|The reliques of {{the forty}} Martyrs at Antioch were {{distributed}} among the Churches {{before the year}} 373; for Athanasius who died in that year, wrote an Oration upon them. This Oration is not yet published, but Gerard Vossius saw it in MS. in the Library of Cardinal Ascanius in Italy, as {{he says in his}} commentary upon the Oration of Ephræm Syrus on the same forty Martyrs. Now since the Monks of Alexandria sent the reliques of the Martyrs of Egypt into all parts of the earth, and thereby acquired glory to their city, and declared her in these matters the Metropolis of the whole world, as we have observed out of Chrysostom; it may be concluded, that before Alexandria received the forty Martyrs from Antioch, she began to send out the reliques of her own Martyrs into all parts, setting the first example to other cities. This practice therefore began in Egypt some years before the death of Athanasius. It began when the miracle-working bones of John the Baptist were carried into Egypt, and hid in the wall of a Church, that they might be profitable to future generations. It was restrained in the reign of Julian the Apostate: and then it <b>spred</b> from Egypt into all the Empire, Alexandria being the Metropolis of the whole world, according to Chrysostom, for propagating this sort of devotion, and Antioch and other cities soon following her example.|$|E

By this dispersion of the Christian Jews, the Christian religion, which was already propagated westward as far as Rome, <b>spred</b> fast into all the Roman Empire, and suffered many persecutions under it till the days of Constantine the great and his sons: all which is thus described by Daniel.

And they that understand among the people, shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by spoil many days. Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help, viz. in the reign of Constantine the great; and at that time by reason of their prosperity, many shall come over to them from among the heathen, and cleave to them with dissimulation.

Eunapius also, a heathen, yet a competent witness of what was done in his own times, relating how the soldiers delivered the temples of Egypt {{into the hands of}} the Monks, which was done in the year 389, rails thus in an impious manner at the Martyrs, as succeeding in the room of the old Gods of Egypt. Illi ipsi, milites, Monachos Canobi quoque collocârunt, ut pro Diis qui animo cernuntur, servos & quidem flagitiosos divinis honoribus percolerent, hominum mentibus ad cultum ceremoniasque obligatis.

Than the prince, and King Dampeter (Don Pedro), toke the baner betwene their handes, and <b>spred</b> it abrode, the which was of sylver, a sharp pyle gaules, and delyvered it to hym, and said, 'Sir Johan, behold here youre baner; God sende you joye and honour thereof!' Than Sir Johan Chandos bare his baner to his owne company, and sayde, 'Sirs, beholde here my baner, and yours; kepe it as your owne.' And they toke it, and were right joyful therof, and sayd, that, by the pleasure of God, and Saint George, they wold kepe and defend it {{to the best of their}} powers. And so the baner abode in the handes of a good Englishe squyer, called William Alery, who bare it that day, and acquaytted himself right nobly."--Froissart, Vol. I. ch. 237. The loss of a banner was not only great dishonour, but an infinite disadvantage. At the battle of Cocherel, in Normandy, the flower of the combatants, on each side, were engaged in the attack and defence of the banner of the captall of Buche, the English leader. It was planted amid a bush of thorns, and guarded by sixty men at arms, who defended it gallantly. [...] "There were many rescues, and many a one hurt and cast to the earth, and many feats of armes done, and many gret strokes given, with good axes of steel, that it was wonder to behold." [...] The battle did not cease until the captall's standard was taken and torn to pieces.|$|E

40|$|Surface plasmon {{resonance}} (<b>SPR)</b> is a label-free, highly-sensitive, and real-time sensing technique. Conventional <b>SPR</b> sensors, {{which involve}} a planar thin gold film, {{have been widely}} exploited in biosensing; various miniaturized formats have been devised for portability purposes. Another type of <b>SPR</b> sensor which utilizes localized <b>SPR</b> (LSPR), is based on metal nanostructures with surface plasmon modes at the structural interface. The resonance condition is sensitive to the refractive index change of the local medium. The principles of {{these two types of}} <b>SPR</b> sensors are reviewed and their integration with microfluidic platforms is described. Further applications of microfluidic <b>SPR</b> sensors to point-of-care (POC) diagnostics are discussed...|$|R

A novel fiber-optic <b>SPR</b> sensor with multi-alternating metal layers for biochemical analysis is presented in this paper. Based on the fundamental <b>SPR</b> theory of the fiber optic sensing technology, we theoretically investigated {{the effects of the}} existence of alternating layers deposited on sensing region <b>SPR</b> wavelength changes. The emphasis was placed on the numerical simulation of the fiber-optic <b>SPR</b> sensor’s sensitivity which could be affected by its technical parameters such as the metal thickness, number of alternating layers. Results showed that, compared to the normal <b>SPR</b> sensor with the single metal layer, the proposed sensor had a wider detecting range of the refractive index and higher sensitivity, which can find applications in biological analysis.|$|R
40|$|A graphene-based long-period {{fiber grating}} (LPFG) surface plasmon {{resonance}} (<b>SPR)</b> sensor is proposed. A monolayer of graphene is coated onto the Ag film {{surface of the}} LPFG <b>SPR</b> sensor, which increases {{the intensity of the}} evanescent field {{on the surface of the}} fiber and thereby enhances the interaction between the <b>SPR</b> wave and molecules. Such features significantly improve the sensitivity of the sensor. The experimental results demonstrate that the sensitivity of the graphene-based LPFG <b>SPR</b> sensor can reach 0. 344 nm%− 1 for methane, which is improved 2. 96 and 1. 31 times with respect to the traditional LPFG sensor and Ag-coated LPFG <b>SPR</b> sensor, respectively. Meanwhile, the graphene-based LPFG <b>SPR</b> sensor exhibits excellent response characteristics and repeatability. Such a <b>SPR</b> sensing scheme offers a promising platform to achieve high sensitivity for gas-sensing applications...|$|R
