40|$|Femininity and Dance at the Interface of Performance: An {{exploration}} of Femininity through Performance in <b>Suit</b> <b>Up,</b> a choreographic/performance dance thesis compiles the research behind <b>Suit</b> <b>Up,</b> a ten-minute dance for six women, which investigates {{the performance of}} femininity, and provides a deep analysis of the choreography of <b>Suit</b> <b>Up.</b> This thesis looks at all elements {{that went into the}} production of <b>Suit</b> <b>Up</b> and explores the relationship a woman has with her femininity and the performance of her femininity. This thesis focuses specifically on the gestures that the particular women in this piece associate with their femininity and what this means when femininity and dance are explored together as performance. This {{is by no means a}} comprehensive thesis about the concept of femininity, but it begins to investigate the idea that women perform femininity in different contexts. What are the various ways in which femininity can be performed, including for one’s own self? A video of <b>Suit</b> <b>Up</b> is available at Scripps Dance...|$|R

5|$|He {{began his}} career as a {{distinguished}} junior ice hockey player, named to the Western Hockey League (WHL) West Second All-Star Team and the Western Conference roster for the 1998 WHL All-Star Game (although he missed the game due to injury). Drafted in the first round, fifth overall by the New York Islanders in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft, Brewer has spent parts of his sixteen-year NHL career with the Islanders, the Edmonton Oilers, the St. Louis Blues, Tampa Bay Lightning, Anaheim Ducks and Maple Leafs, and captained the Blues for two years. He has also <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for the Prince George Cougars of the WHL and the Lowell Lock Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL). In 1999, Brewer was selected for the Prince George Cougars' all-time team in a Canadian Hockey League promotion.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{joined the}} {{national}} team for another training camp in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida from February 3 to 9. Following the camp, she {{was named to the}} 24-player roster for the 2011 Algarve Cup. She was subsequently named to the roster of 20 players that <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for the games, although she did not make an appearance. She was on the roster for a match against England on April 2 in East London. In late April, Harris trained with {{the national team}} for three weeks in final preparations for the 2011 Women's World Cup. Although she did not make the final roster for the World Cup, she joined the team following the tournament in November for a two-week training camp in Arizona. She also trained with the team in December and January. Following the 2012 CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying Tournament, Harris joined a 28-player roster for a training camp in Frisco, Texas in the week leading up to a match against New Zealand on February 11, although she did not suit up for the game.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, Harris {{was named}} to a 23-player roster for the 2012 Algarve Cup. While in Portugal, Harris played in a closed-door {{training}} match against China on February 25, splitting halves with Nicole Barnhart. Harris was not named to the roster of 21 players that <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for the games in the tournament. Harris traveled with the national team in early April to compete at the Women's Kirin Challenge Cup in Japan. Following the tournament, she trained with the national team in Florida from April 18 to 30. During the training camp, Harris injured her left shoulder, sustaining a small tear in her labrum. She still went on to train with the national team in New Jersey from May 10 to 25. However, in early June, she decided to undergo surgery to repair the tear {{in order to prevent}} further damage. The surgery kept her off the pitch for the rest of 2012.|$|E

25|$|The league's first 10 {{years was}} known for the intense rivalry of the Crispa Redmanizers and the Toyota Tamaraws, still {{considered}} {{as one of the}} greatest rivalries in league history. Big names such as Robert Jaworski, Ramon Fernandez, Francis Arnaiz, Atoy Co, Bogs Adornado and Philip Cezar played for those squads before the two teams disbanded in 1983 and 1984 respectively. Following their disbandment, the league moved from the Araneta Coliseum to ULTRA in Pasig. There, the league continued to be popular, as several former Toyota and Crispa players <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for different teams.|$|E

25|$|It {{proved to}} be tremendously {{fortunate}} that these events had taken place, as during the 4th quarter of that game in Cincinnati Lloyd Barker attempted a bicycle kick and landed awkwardly, breaking his neck. The story of the insurance gaffe and Barkers injury became national news overnight. After surgery and several days in traction, Barker did recover from his injuries, and {{with the aid of}} a neck brace he made a tearful appearance at a game later in the season. After significant rehab Barker did eventually make a comeback, and <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for the Detroit Rockers, though he never recaptured his earlier form.|$|E
25|$|Thornton, {{a native}} of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, {{fell in love with}} {{basketball}} at an early age and was considered very talented throughout his youth. He attended Bishop McNamara High School, a perennial basketball power, not because of the sport but because of its academic reputation and its proximity to his home. He <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for the varsity team as a sophomore but did not play, largely because he was playing behind future NCAA Division I players Talib Zanna (Pittsburgh), Rashad Whack (Mount St. Mary's), Lawrence Smith (North Carolina A), and Jerome Couplin III, who went on to play football at William & Mary (and eventually, the NFL).|$|E
25|$|In game 10, Romo <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for {{the first}} time this season and was the backup quarterback.

It also marked rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott breaking Tony Dorsett's single season rushing record for a Cowboys rookie. Prescott also tied an NFL rookie record held by Russell Wilson and Dan Marino by throwing multiple touchdowns in 5 straight games. Dallas finished 13–3, tying their best 16-game regular season record. While Dallas defeated Green Bay at Lambeau Field in week 6, the Packers would win at AT Stadium in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs on a last-second field goal, ending their season.|$|E

He was selected three rounds ahead of oldest brother Max when he was drafted in 2007 and was selected 12 positions behind as Griffin when he was drafted third-overall in 2010. Reinhart joined the Kootenay Ice for four games in the 2010–11 season. In his first WHL game, he scored the game-winning goal against the Edmonton Oil Kings. That {{was also the first}} WHL game in which all three Reinhart brothers were playing. Reinhart <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for seven WHL playoffs games, registering zero points in the process, as part of the Ice's Ed Chynoweth Cup championship team.

25|$|After the 2007–08 {{season was}} complete, Kadri was traded by the Rangers to the London Knights, his {{hometown}} team, for {{a package of}} draft picks. He played in 56 games for the Knights in 2008–09, where he scored 25 goals and added 53 assists. Kadri lost time during the 2008–09 season, however, when he suffered a broken jaw. He was selected to play for Team OHL in the ADT Canada Russia Challenge, {{but was unable to}} participate due to jaw injury. Kadri was later invited to Canada's selection camp for the 2009 World Junior Championships, but did not make the final roster. Additionally during the 2008–09 season, Kadri was chosen to play in the OHL All-Star Classic, where he <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for the Western Conference and scored a goal.|$|E
25|$|At 8:38am, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in Boston, Massachusetts, {{reported}} a possible hijacking {{and called the}} Otis Air National Guard Base control tower on Cape Cod, home to the Massachusetts ANG's 102d Fighter Wing, to request military assistance. At that time, Major Dan Nash and Lieutenant Colonel Tim Duffy had air defense alert duty for the 102d. At 8:40am Colonel Bob Marr, a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman serving as NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector commander, learned from the FAA that American Airlines Flight 11 might have been hijacked. The two pilots immediately <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> and headed for their F-15s. Marr ordered Nash and Duffy into the air; their F-15s were airborne within six minutes and as directed, headed for New York City, 153 miles away. Unknown to the pilots, American Airlines Flight 11 had crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City just as Colonel Marr was delivering his order. Meanwhile, at 8:43am, the FAA {{reported a}}nother possible hijacking to the Northeast Air Defense Sector. That was Boston to Los Angeles United Airlines Flight 175. At 9:02am, with the F-15s still 71 miles away, that plane crashed into the World Trade Center's South Tower.|$|E

25|$|Following {{his penchant}} for making big moves, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren pulled off perhaps the most {{stunning}} move of his tenure, trading Mike Richards to the Los Angeles Kings for Brayden Schenn, Wayne Simmonds and a 2012 second-round draft pick; and Jeff Carter to Columbus for their 2011 first-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Sean Couturier), 2011 third-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Nick Cousins) and Jakub Voracek, all within the span of one hour on June 23. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the Phoenix Coyotes' Ilya Bryzgalov to a nine-year, $51million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed Jaromir Jagr to a one-year contract, Maxime Talbot to a five-year contract and Andreas Lilja to a two-year contract. Additionally, Chris Pronger was named Flyers captain; however, 13 games into the 2011–12 season, he was lost {{for the remainder of}} the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome. Bryzgalov's play ranged from spectacular to sub-par, including being benched in favor of Sergei Bobrovsky for the Flyers' 3–2 loss to the New York Rangers in the 2012 Winter Classic, but also being named NHL First Star for the month of March. Twelve rookies <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for the Flyers during the season, with the play of Couturier, Schenn and Matt Read standing out impressively.|$|E
25|$|The Flyers {{began the}} 2009–10 season with some major changes, {{allowing}} goaltenders Martin Biron and Antero Niittymaki to depart via free agency, {{replacing them with}} former Ottawa netminder Ray Emery and former Flyer Brian Boucher, and significantly upgrading the defense {{with the addition of}} Chris Pronger from Anaheim. Pronger came at a price, however, costing the Flyers Joffrey Lupul, Luca Sbisa and the Flyers' first-round draft picks in both 2009 and 2010. The season began in earnest, though it soon unraveled with mediocre play that cost Head Coach John Stevens his job in December. Peter Laviolette was hired as his replacement in order to re institute accountability and restore success to the Flyers, though the results were not immediate; the Flyers suffered a 2–7–1 stretch immediately following his arrival. Injuries took a major toll on the Flyers, with Blair Betts, Daniel Briere, Jeff Carter, Simon Gagne and Kimmo Timonen all missing significant numbers of games, though no position was nearly affected as much with injuries as goaltending. Emery suffered a hip injury in December, played sporadically afterwards and ultimately underwent season-ending surgery. Boucher suffered a hand injury shortly thereafter, which allowed journeyman goaltender Michael Leighton to step in and make an immediate impact. Leighton went 8–0–1 in his first ten starts, including a tough 2–1 overtime loss in the 2010 Winter Classic to Boston at Fenway Park on New Year's Day. Leighton, however, was forced out of the line-up in March with a high ankle sprain, necessitating Boucher's return as starter. All told, seven different goaltenders <b>suited</b> <b>up</b> for the Flyers at various points throughout the year. Mediocre play down the stretch forced the Flyers into a do-or-die shootout with the Rangers in what could have been their final game of the year, with the contest being hosted at the Wachovia Center. Boucher stopped final shooter Olli Jokinen to clinch the seventh seed in the East and a first round matchup with New Jersey.|$|E
