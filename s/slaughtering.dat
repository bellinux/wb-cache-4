5|$|After {{the casting}} of stones, animals are {{slaughtered}} {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael. Traditionally the pilgrims slaughtered the animal themselves, or oversaw the <b>slaughtering.</b> Today many pilgrims buy a sacrifice voucher in Mecca before the greater Hajj begins, which allows an animal to be slaughtered {{in the name of}} God (Allah) on the 10th, without the pilgrim being physically present. Modern abattoirs complete the processing of the meat, which is then sent as charity to poor people around the world. At {{the same time as the}} sacrifices occur at Mecca, Muslims worldwide perform similar sacrifices, in a three-day global festival called Eid al-Adha.|$|E

Dogs were taken, as were skis, but the dogs succumbed to disease in the first season. Nevertheless, the dogs' performance impressed Scott, and, despite moral qualms, he implemented the principle of <b>slaughtering</b> dogs for dog-food to increase their range. During an early attempt at ice travel, a blizzard trapped expedition members in their tent and their decision to leave it resulted in the death of George Vince, who slipped over a precipice on 11 March 1902.|$|E
5|$|Food and cuisine in Ireland {{takes its}} {{influence}} from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate {{and from the}} social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid <b>slaughtering</b> a milk-producing cow.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{the leading}} {{industries}} of St. Louis included brewing, flour milling, <b>slaughtering,</b> paper making, machining, and tobacco processing. Other industries including {{the manufacture of}} paint, bricks, and iron. During the 1880s, the city grew in population by 29 percent, from 350,518 to 451,770, making it the country's fourth largest city; it also ranked fourth as measured by value of its manufactured products, and more than 6,148 factories existed in 1890. However, during the 1890s, manufacturing growth slowed dramatically. The Panic of 1893 and subsequent depression and the overproduction of grain made St. Louis mills considerably less productive and valuable. Flour milling was halved and most other industries suffered similar declines.|$|E

5|$|On-farm {{factories}} in the Deloraine area made cheese, mostly cheddar, during the early 20th century.

Meander had a resident blacksmith from c.1876, though blacksmithing had been done on private properties before this. Blacksmithing as a separate industry continued into the early 20th century. Prompted by new legislation in the 1980s, that enforced hygiene standards in animal <b>slaughtering,</b> a slaughter-house was opened in Meander. It was registered in 1986.

5|$|The Eye's {{aggression}} {{may even}} extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded as evil. Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra {{was believed to}} swallow the multitude of other gods, who in this instance are equated with the stars, which vanish at sunrise and reappear at sunset. In doing so, he absorbs the gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar Eye is said to assist in this effort, <b>slaughtering</b> the gods for Ra to eat. The red light of dawn therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{sought to}} expand {{the power of the}} priests, as from the {{beginning}} of their empire, priests had accompanied Portuguese delegations on diplomatic missions and on occasion were the principal negotiatiors. Treaties they signed with the Keladi Nayakas progressively incorporated clauses which increased the authority of the priests over the local Catholic population, making them obedient to the priests in matters of Christian laws as well as granting priests the authority to punish violations. The Portuguese promised to refrain from <b>slaughtering</b> cows and to halt forcible conversions in their factories. The terms of these treaties were not always honoured by the Portuguese, with the result that whenever hostilities broke out between the Keladis and the Portuguese, the Catholic settlers were often harassed or arrested by the Nayakas.|$|E

Cooking loss was significantly higher for meat samples from cattle <b>slaughtered</b> in the conventional way compared to those from cattle <b>slaughtered</b> by Kosher method.
