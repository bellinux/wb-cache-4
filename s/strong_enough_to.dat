5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection is <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is not <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E

5|$|After {{two months}} of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval power was not yet <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> confront the British Royal Navy. He decided on a {{military}} expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India. Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, with the ultimate dream of linking with Tipu Sultan, a Muslim enemy of the British in India.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{fault with}} the first engines of the class was fore-and-aft vibration, <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> prompt {{passengers}} to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment {{on top of the}} tender to work their way forward into the cab.

5|$|As Julio made landfall, it {{produced}} lightning and locally heavy rainfall, which left {{more than a}} dozen communities isolated due to flooding. The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people. Winds were generally light, although <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> damage a few electrical poles and small buildings. In nearby Sinaloa, rainfall from the storm led to an emergency evacuation of 500 residents.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> oppose it.|$|E
5|$|Automonopoli, {{also known}} as Go to Jail, is an {{unauthorised}} computer version of the boardgame Monopoly, released in June 1983 by Automata UK for the ZX Spectrum.

50|$|The onager is preyed upon by apex predators such as Asiatic leopards {{and striped}} hyenas. A few cases of onager deaths due to {{predation}} by leopards {{was recorded in}} Iran, as a Persian leopard attacked and consumed a Persian onager. Though {{it is said that}} leopards do not usually feed on equids such as in Africa, it may be due that Asian leopards are larger and <b>stronger</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> prey on Asiatic wild asses.|$|R

5|$|Despite the modifications, it was {{realized}} that the walls of Valletta were not <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> withstand a long siege. In 1635, construction of the Floriana Lines commenced, enclosing Valletta's land front. The Floriana Lines were also modified until the 18th century.

5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme.

They are <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be dynamically important: they drive mass inflow into {{the centers of}} galaxies, they modify the formation of spiral arms and they can affect the rotation of gas in the outer regions of galaxies. Magnetic fields provide the transport of angular momentum required for the collapse of gas clouds and hence the formation of new stars.|$|E
