40|$|Background: Continuous {{infusion}} of short life vasodilators are employed to test reversibility of pulmonary hypertension in cardiac transplant candidates. <b>Sublingual</b> isosorbide <b>administration</b> {{has not been}} described in the literature {{and it might be}} a simpler alternative. Aim: To evaluate <b>sublingual</b> isosorbide <b>administration</b> as a test of reversibility of pulmonary hypertension in heart failure. Patients and Methods: Prospective evaluation of patients referred for cardiac transplant evaluation. Patients underwent right catheterization for hemodynamic measurements at baseline and after repeated doses of 5 mg sublingual isosorbide every 5 minutes until observing a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance decrease or symptomatic hypotension. Results: Twenty one patients, 18 men, age 49 ± 15 years, were studied. Fourteen (66 %) were transplanted. The mean sublingual isosorbide dose was 15 ± 5 mg. After isosorbide administration, there was a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (80 ± 8. 5 to 71 ± 6. 6 mmHg, p < 0. 0001), mean pulmonary artery pressure (38 ± 11 to 26 ± 7. 8 mmHg, p < 0. 0001), systemic vascular resistance (1540 ± 376 to 1277 ± 332 dyn*s/cm 5 p < 0. 001), pulmonary vascular resistance (3. 5 ± 2. 2 to 2, 5 ± 1. 6 Wood Units, p < 0. 05) and transpulmonary gradient (13 ± 7 a 10 ± 4 mmHg, p < 0. 004). The cardiac output increased from 3. 96 ± 0. 7 to 4. 38 ± 0. 9 L/min, p= 0. 05.

40|$|SUMMARY A caloric {{requirement}} of the patients {{who do not have}} an access for feeding through an oral route is supported by enteral or parenteral nutrition. In the patients who have suitable gastrointestinal function, enteral feeding is preferred initially. Enteral feeding is also used for administration of medications in patients who cannot swallow. However, an administration of drugs via a feeding tube is complicated; appropriate techniques should be used in order to prevent obstruction of feeding tube and thereby avoid reduction of the drug effect and to minimize the risk of toxicity of given pharmaceuticals. In the patients who are not able to take medication orally, alternative routes such as intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, inhaled, transdermal, rectal, and <b>sublingual</b> <b>administrations</b> are available and should be preferred at the first place. According to the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, an effect of a size and the position of the feeding tube, characteristics of pharmaceutical dosage form and methods of administration should be considered when applying medication via enteral tube. The risk of the drug interactions arises in patients who have nutritional support. In order to prevent drug interactions, a pharmacist, who has an extensive education and knowledge on drugs, its characteristics and mechanism of action is required for multidisciplinary team in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{research}} has shown that the androgen steroid testosterone, the end product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, down regulates the integrated stress response at multiple levels. These effects have been demonstrated {{at the level of the}} amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and along the different nodes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The present study was designed to assess effects of exogenous testosterone upon reactivity of the autonomic nervous system and modulation of the acoustic startle reflex in humans. Twenty healthy female participants received double-blind, placebo-controlled <b>sublingual</b> <b>administrations</b> of. 5 mg testosterone. Measurements were made of phasic electrodermal activity, cardiac responses, and startle reflexes to acoustic probes while participants were exposed to pictures with strongly aversive, neutral, or positive content. Subjective reports of mood and picture evaluations were also obtained. Results support the hypothesis of a generally decreased responsiveness of the stress system by showing reduced skin conductance responses as well as reduced affective startle modulation in anxiety-prone participants after administration of testosterone. Candidate neurobiological mechanisms of action are outlined and discussed, and it is argued that androgens promote dynamic regulation of the stress system through actions upon central neuropeptidergic pathways that control corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) expression. The present findings highlight the importance of further investigation of the possible role of the HPG axis in disorders that are associated with HPA axis dysfunctions...|$|R

In contrast to intravenous and <b>sublingual</b> <b>administration,</b> the terminal half-life of estradiol is 13 to 20 hours with oral administration. The difference is due to the fact that, upon oral administration, a large hormonally inert pool of estrogen sulfate and glucuronide conjugates with extended terminal half-lives is reversibly formed from estradiol during first-pass metabolism, and this pool serves as a metabolically resistant and long-lasting circulating reservoir for slow reconversion back into estradiol.|$|E

40|$|Allergic asthma, {{caused by}} inhaled allergens such as house dust mite or grass pollen, is {{characterized}} by reversible airway obstruction, associated with an eosinophilic inflammation of the airways, as well as airway hyper responsiveness and remodeling. The inhaled allergens trigger a type- 2 inflammatory response with involvement of innate lymphoid cells (ILC 2) and Th 2 cells, resulting in high production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. Consequently, renewed allergen exposure results in a classic allergic response with a distinct early and late phase, both resulting in bronchoconstriction and shortness of breath. Allergen specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only treatment {{that is capable of}} modifying the immunological process underlying allergic responses including allergic asthma and both subcutaneous AIT (SCIT) as well as sublingual AIT (SLIT) have proven clinical efficacy in long term suppression of the allergic response. Although these treatments are very successful for rhinitis, application of AIT in asthma is hampered by variable efficacy, long duration of treatment, and the risk of severe side-effects. A more profound understanding of the mechanisms by which AIT achieves tolerance to allergens in sensitized individuals is needed to improve its efficacy. Mouse models have been very valuable as a preclinical model to characterize the mechanisms of desensitization in AIT and to evaluate novel approaches for improved efficacy. Here, we present a rapid and reproducible mouse model for allergen-specific immunotherapy. In this model, mice are sensitized with two injections of allergen absorbed to aluminum hydroxide to induce allergic sensitization, followed by subcutaneous injections (SCIT) or <b>sublingual</b> <b>administrations</b> (SLIT) of the allergen as immunotherapy treatment. Finally, mice are challenged by three intranasal allergen administrations.

40|$|Although arctigenin (AG) has diverse bioactivities, such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, immunoregulatory and neuroprotective activities, its {{pharmacokinetics}} {{have not}} been systematically evaluated. The purpose of this work was to identify the pharmacokinetic properties of AG via various experiments in vivo and in vitro. In this research, rats and beagle dogs were used to investigate the PK (pharmacokinetics, PK) profiles of AG with different drug-delivery manners, including intravenous (i. v), hypodermic injection (i. h), and <b>sublingual</b> (s. l) <b>administration.</b> The data shows that AG exhibited a strong absorption capacity in both rats and beagle dogs (absorption rate 100 %), and a strong elimination ability (t 1 / 2 beagle dog (25. 9 ± 3. 24 %) > rat (15. 7 ± 9 %) > monkey (3. 69 ± 0. 12 %). This systematic investigation of pharmacokinetic profiles of arctigenin (AG) in vivo and in vitro is worthy of further exploration...|$|R
