60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards me, but Delora's outstretched arm barred her progress.|$|E
60|$|Her glance met his once more, and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> {{towards him}} with hands outstretched.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{stared at}} her, troubled. Suddenly her manner, changed. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> toward him, appealingly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> swift <b>step</b> toward him, with {{stiffened}} {{arms and}} eyes blazing.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> hesitating <b>step</b> forward, but Macheson led her firmly {{towards another}} hansom.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> little <b>step</b> toward me, her {{beautiful}} hands outstretched in a strange, groping gesture.|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} again cast down, and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in the {{direction}} of the window.|$|E
6000|$|The Duchess {{left him}} unceremoniously. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> or two forward with outstretched hands. The butler was announcing-- ...|$|E
60|$|He made {{as if to}} {{approach}} her around the table, and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> that restored their distance.|$|E
60|$|Her antagonist's {{gray eyes}} sparkled {{for the first}} time, and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>step</b> forward, with one white hand half lifted in rebuke.|$|R
60|$|She {{felt for}} one of the trees, and passed her hand {{carefully}} round its trunk. Then <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> few <b>steps</b> forward and stopped short.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> wild <b>step</b> {{towards the}} door, but I caught her {{back with a}} sudden mind-vision of Aunt Olivia flying bareheaded and distraught across the fields.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> backward, {{and put out}} {{her hands}} in an {{undecided}} frightened way, as if to keep me off.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> {{back and}} {{surveyed}} {{him from the}} feet to the face. Their eyes met and locked for a moment.|$|E
60|$|There was a moment's silence. Philippa's {{face had}} become almost stony. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards the telephone. Lessingham, however, {{held out his}} hand.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Bellew {{looked at}} him hard; the {{defiance}} in her eyes changed {{to a sort of}} pity. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>step</b> and put her hand on his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|They {{had been}} {{standing}} together in a little recess of the hall. Suddenly Lenora, whose face was turned towards the entrance doors, gave <b>a</b> little cry. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>step</b> forward.|$|R
60|$|Another glance {{through her}} long, dark lashes {{on both the}} men, and Klara Goldstein turned to go. But before <b>she</b> could <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> toward the door, Béla's masterful hand was on her wrist.|$|R
60|$|She {{tried to}} move; he offered her his hand, but she shied {{from it and}} {{struggled}} to her feet. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward--but limped.|$|E
60|$|He came at last, lurching in his walk, being overstiff {{from his}} long ride. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward to meet him. Her lips parted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Ramage--about {{the forty}} pounds." [...] <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step.</b> [...] "My dear," [...] she added, {{by way of}} afterthought, [...] "you DO {{obliterate}} things!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Reasons {{of health}} {{could not be}} gainsaid. Denis got up reluctantly, and helped his {{companion}} to her feet. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> cautious <b>step.</b> [...] "Ooh!" [...] She halted and leaned heavily on his arm.|$|R
50|$|She lost once in her career, as <b>a</b> five-year-old, after <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> bad <b>step</b> {{and could}} not catch the leading colt, George Martin. She retired after that race, with 7 wins out of 8 starts.|$|R

60|$|Quickly <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> backward, tearing {{herself from}} his grasp. But the {{momentary}} contact had aroused within Tario all the long-buried passions of his loveless existence.|$|E
60|$|With {{a little}} cry, {{that was more}} like a sigh than an outcry, the girl's arms fell to her side; <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> backwards, reeled, and fainted away.|$|E
60|$|The {{door opened}} again, and Topsy, her eyes swelled with crying, appeared, holding {{something}} under her apron. Rosa {{made a quick}} forbidding gesture; but <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> into the room.|$|E
60|$|Thuvia of Ptarth {{looked into}} his face for several moments. Her breast was rising and falling as though to some resistless emotion. <b>She</b> half <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> toward him. Her lips parted as though to speak--swiftly and impetuously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good God--the traitor!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> hurried <b>step</b> forward, {{turned to}} the window, and then came back to Cass with a voice broken with emotion. [...] "I have told you I could trust you. That ring was mine!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{has taken}} {{possession}} of my daughter?" [...] demanded Madame de Bellegarde, sternly. [...] "She {{has not been}} into the world these three years. Does <b>she</b> <b>take</b> such <b>a</b> <b>step</b> at half <b>an</b> hour's notice, and without consulting me?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward, {{and before}} he could divine her purpose sank gently on one knee in a {{wonderful}} courtesy. He took the slim white hand, and bowed low over it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, no," [...] {{she whispered}} hoarsely, {{somewhat}} wildly, as <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward; [...] "no, no, no [...] . . . not yet [...] . . . {{it is not}} true [...] . . . not yet----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get up," [...] she said. The thing writhed {{away from}} her. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward. She had {{realized}} {{the presence of}} the headmaster for one second, and then she was oblivious of it again.|$|E
60|$|But that {{lingering}} farewell glance toward Falcon's Nest suddenly {{changed into}} a startled fearful gaze. Her heart beat fast, and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> involuntary <b>step</b> forward. There was no doubt about it. A dim moving light shone from the lower windows of the cottage.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} as Ford drew back coldly {{and let her}} hand fall from his arm. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> few <b>steps</b> forward, stopped, ran back to him again, crushed his face and head in a close embrace, and then seemed to dip like a bird into the tall bracken, and was gone.|$|R

When the oak finally {{crumbles}} to dust from her efforts, Illyana realizes that she was only trying to create life as a means to an end: destroying Belasco. She tries instead to manifest her desire directly, using the last of her power to create a [...] "Soulsword". The enchantment that held her in Storm's garden is banished in the process and <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>stepping</b> disc to confront Belasco. While fighting Belasco she realizes she is replaying the same scene by which Storm was corrupted, so she spares his life and he escapes. She then uses a light circle to return to Earth, rejoining the X-Men seconds after she had left them.|$|R
