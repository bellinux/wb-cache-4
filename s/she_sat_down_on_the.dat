2500|$|On June 4, 2011, Wallenda {{completed}} a [...] high-wire crossing {{between the two}} towers of the ten-story Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The [...] performance was a recreation of the act that had killed Karl Wallenda in 1978. For the performance, Wallenda's mother, Delilah (Karl's granddaughter), joined him. The mother and son team started {{at opposite ends of}} the wire. [...] When Delilah reached the middle of the wire, roughly the spot Karl had fallen, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wire and Nik stepped over her before the two continued to opposite ends of the wire. At one point during the performance, Nik knelt down on the wire and blew a kiss in honor of his great-grandfather's memory.|$|E
60|$|Selena gave {{a little}} gasp. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lowest step and untied her bonnet strings.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} sofa, {{and though}} the gong was about to sound, incited him to dawdle and stay with her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{a slab of}} lichened granite, and Dick found a place beside her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a log at {{the corner}} of the house, and pulled me down beside her.|$|R
60|$|So saying, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a low stool {{with her}} paper on her knees, and her pencil in her hand.|$|R
60|$|Madame Fontaine behaved admirably. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> window-seat {{at the end}} of the landing, and wrung {{her hands}} with a gesture of despair.|$|E
60|$|She {{drew him}} another glass. Then <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench {{at the table}} with him and the soldiers, and fixed him with her attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "I surely will," [...] replied Columbine, gladly, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} bed. [...] "Ben, you fetch {{that box}} and put his dinner on it." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{light went}} out of Una's eyes. Her lips trembled. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her stool again, a pathetic little figure of disappointment, and began to cry.|$|R
60|$|After dinner {{she set the}} {{electric}} piano-player going. And he augured the worst when <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a cushion footstool at his knee, {{and put her hand}} on his.|$|R
60|$|They did flash; but Kate laughed {{immediately}} after, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a {{chair in}} front of me and cradled her long, thin, spirited dark face in her palms.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> window-seat, {{with her}} elbows {{on her knees}} and her hands {{grasping}} her forehead. A long moaning cry burst from her. She said to herself bitterly the one word--"Farewell!" ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{grass and}} tried to think which way she had come, and which way she ought to return in order to get across the gulch to the farm-house.|$|E
60|$|The lady ignored this advice, and {{by dint of}} much {{strength}} of mind regained her self-control. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> locker again, and folding her arms showed clearly her intention to remain.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a {{piece of}} broken timber and put one arm across her face. He waited--then {{approaching}} his lips to her ear: [...] "Let us go," [...] he whispered.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{me there}} do seem {{something}} dreadful {{as well as}} grand in it," [...] said Nita, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a boulder beside Emma, near {{the lower end of}} the chaotic valley.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{what is this}} I {{hear about}} a wild man?" [...] {{continued}} Laura, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a chair Roger shoved towards her. [...] "You've made Mrs. Wadsworth and Jessie all excited over it." ...|$|R
60|$|The slandered hens {{were nowhere}} near the pansy bed and Marilla did not even glance at it. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cellar hatch and laughed until she was ashamed of herself.|$|E
60|$|The {{tide was}} just {{beginning}} to come in. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> big boulder where Reeves had fallen asleep. Beyond stretched the gleaming blue waters, mellowing into a hundred fairy shades horizonward.|$|E
60|$|They {{came to the}} kennels. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of {{the great}} stone water trough, and put {{her hands in the}} water, moving them gently like {{submerged}} flowers through the clear pool.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike most ES languages, Tigrinya {{has only}} one set of {{applicative}} suffixes, used both for the dative and benefactive and for locative and adversative senses: [...] täxämmita-llu <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> for him or <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> it or <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to his detriment.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a tombstone, {{and placed}} the child before her. After an hour's walk, {{there was a general}} exclamation of {{amusement}} and compassion, on seeing Theodora and the child still in the same positions.|$|R
60|$|George {{explained}} that he had forgotten the serious nature of the accident. He hastily helped her up and turned away with her, but when they had gone a little distance <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a boulder.|$|R
60|$|Poor Feemy's face fell, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{chair from}} which she had risen, {{as if she had}} not {{strength}} to stand. Myles stood still, {{with his back to the}} fire, trying to look as if he were not disconcerted.|$|E
60|$|She {{said nothing}} more; {{her voice was}} expressionless; her manner {{slightly}} repellent; {{but there was something}} in her eyes--eager yet shy, defiant yet pleading--which turned Anne from her purpose of walking away. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boulder beside the girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are weeping at the pathos of the air. Come here, and I will comfort you," [...] said Caroline, in a pitying accent. Mrs. Pryor came. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of her}} patient's bed, {{and allowed}} the wasted arms to {{encircle}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's no account talking," [...] {{said the}} woman, {{suddenly}} growing quite calm; and, clasping her child tighter in her arms, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her box, {{turned her back}} round, and gazed listlessly into the river.|$|R
60|$|She {{was terrified}} {{and of course}} convinced, for she was easy of conviction, believing always {{the last person to}} whom <b>she</b> spoke. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> one of the boxes that {{furnished}} that cheerless refuge of Mr. Butler's.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a box {{near the}} edge of the deck, and peered into the water and along the shore as if she had been sent there to watch for {{breakers}} ahead. Every now and then she screamed out: ...|$|R
60|$|When Eunice {{had placed}} the candle {{on the shelf}} and drawn down the ugly blue paper blinds, {{shutting}} out the strips of violet sky where a score of glimmering points were now visible, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foot of the bed, facing her mother.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was a long}} pause, while a {{blackbird}} sung blithely on {{the willow}} by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said very soberly, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step of the stile, [...] "Laurie, I {{want to tell you}} something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! what {{beautiful}}, beautiful creatures!' said she. 'I'm sure I {{should never}} be tired of watching them.' And <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank, with her elbows {{on her knees and}} her chin in her hands, her eyes fixed on the fishes as they flashed past.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a stone bench {{outside the}} door. [...] "Tell {{me what you}} know about this poor man?" [...] she said. [...] "I don't ask out of idle curiosity--I have a better motive than that. Is he young or old?" ...|$|R
60|$|Ada retired hastily {{to her own}} chamber, {{where she}} {{stood for a moment}} motionless, then twice stamped her little foot, after which <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a stool, and, {{covering}} her face with both hands, burst into a passionate flood of tears.|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} {{afternoon was}} a perfect one. Reeves was sketching on the sandshore when Helen came. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a camp stool a little {{to one side and}} did not speak. After a few moments Reeves pushed away his paraphernalia impatiently.|$|R
