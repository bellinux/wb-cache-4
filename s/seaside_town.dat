40|$|Despite {{their huge}} {{popularity}} as holiday destinations, <b>seaside</b> <b>towns</b> {{have generally been}} under-researched. Existing research is limited to narrow historical perspectives and is often focused at a regional level. British <b>seaside</b> <b>towns</b> have suffered a significant decline {{but there is little}} attention given to how contemporary issues are likely to shape their futures. For this paper, a sample of British <b>seaside</b> <b>towns</b> that form part of the newly approved Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) are analysed to identify how these new governance arrangements are likely to affect future development in these areas. Core-periphery theory (CPT) is used as a framework within which to analyse these arrangements and to identify potential problems and obstacles. Analysis reveals significant governance issues for <b>seaside</b> <b>towns</b> in terms of structural inequalities and relationships of dependency. The LEPs do not adequately recognise the peripheral nature of <b>seaside</b> <b>towns</b> and the special conditions needed for their development. There is a reliance on outdated growth models and {{there is a lack of}} innovation in their approach. From a CPT perspective, the new LEPs do not seem to provide a brighter future for the development of <b>seaside</b> <b>towns...</b>|$|R
50|$|Many <b>seaside</b> <b>towns</b> {{have turned}} to other {{entertainment}} industries, {{and some of them}} have a good deal of nightlife. The cinemas and theatres often remain to become host to a number of pubs, bars, restaurants and nightclubs. Most of their entertainment facilities cater to local people and the beaches still remain popular during the summer months. Although international tourism turned people away from British <b>seaside</b> <b>towns,</b> it also brought in foreign travel and as a result, many <b>seaside</b> <b>towns</b> offer foreign language schools, the students of which often return to vacation and sometimes to settle.|$|R

Follow-up artillery inflicted 18 killed and 33 wounded however, including the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Dittmer, and two company commanders. Two hundred and forty-seven Italian prisoners were taken. Following this, the 5th Infantry Brigade was placed under the command of the 4th Indian Division and the 28th Battalion took up positions near Bardia.|$|E

5|$|Whitby is a <b>seaside</b> <b>town,</b> {{port and}} civil parish in the Borough of Scarborough and English county of North Yorkshire.

Its East Cliff is home to the ruins of Whitby Abbey, where Cædmon, the earliest recognised English poet, lived. The fishing port developed during the Middle Ages, supporting important herring and whaling fleets, and was (along with the nearby fishing village of Staithes) where Captain Cook learned seamanship.|$|E
5|$|The studio {{released}} a free expansion and patch {{to the game}} on 3 June 2014, which in addition to fixing game-breaking issues, added new goat models, a new map to explore based on a <b>seaside</b> <b>town</b> with a carnival, more game-breaking issues, and local multiplayer for up to 4 players via split-screen. Ibrisagic believes that adding multiplayer support atop Steam Workshop support will allow creative users to develop new gameplay modes that will extend the title's playability. The patch also adds in additional controls that the player can use to make the goat perform various freestyle tricks comparable to those in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The studio {{released a}} second free patch to the game on 20 November 2014 including elements that parody massive multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft, though remains a single player or local multiplayer experience.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Leros, New Zealand withdrew its {{squadron}} {{from the}} Long Range Desert Group, compelling the LRDG to reorganise itself into two squadrons of eight patrols each. A Squadron {{was composed of}} Rhodesians and B Squadron comprised British troops and a squadron of signallers; around 80 of the officers and men were from Southern Rhodesia. The group was reassigned from the Middle East Command to the Central Mediterranean Force in early 1944, and deployed to the Gargano peninsula in south-eastern Italy, where a new LRDG headquarters was set up near the <b>seaside</b> <b>town</b> of Rodi. Britain hoped to compel the Germans to commit as many divisions as possible to south-eastern Europe so {{they could not be}} used on the more important fronts closer to Germany. In June 1944 the LRDG was assigned to operate on the western coast of Yugoslavia, with orders to set up observation posts, report the movements of German ships and undertake minor raids.|$|E

40|$|Beatty C. and Fothergill S. (2004) Economic {{change and}} the labour market in Britain's <b>seaside</b> <b>towns,</b> Reg. Studies 38, 461 - 480. For thirty years, Britain's <b>seaside</b> <b>towns</b> have faced the {{challenge}} of the rising popularity of foreign holidays. This paper explores how their economies have adapted, and in particular the extent to which high claimant unemployment in many of the towns is rooted in local job loss. By deploying 'labour market accounts' for 1971 to 2001, the paper shows that in fact the continuing imbalance in seaside labour markets owes more to high levels of in-migration than to job loss, and even the sectors of the local economy most closely linked to tourism show growth in employment. <b>Seaside</b> <b>towns,</b> Unemployment, Migration, Employment, Tourism, Stations balneaires, Chomage, Migration, Emploi, Tourisme, Kustenstadte, Erwerbslosigkeit, Wanderung, Erwerbstatigkeit, Tourismus, Ciudades costeras, Desempleo, Migracion, Empleo, Turismo,...|$|R
5|$|During the Victorian era, Clevedon {{became a}} popular <b>seaside</b> <b>town,</b> having {{previously}} been an agricultural village. Due to improving transport links, via the Clevedon Branch Line, Clevedon {{was able to}} cater for the late 19th century craze for bathing in the sea with saltwater baths adjacent to the pier (since demolished, though the foundations can still be seen), and bathing machines on the main beach. Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. At Clevedon tourism grew following {{the opening of a}} branch line from Yatton railway station which connected it to the Bristol to Exeter Line, enabling travel {{from the rest of the}} country. It was also proposed that a pier could form part of a route from London to South Wales with the use of steamers to cross the Severn Estuary. An enabling act was submitted to parliament in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Not {{a single}} {{residence}} remained undamaged after the hurricane's passage in Bejucal, San Antonio de los Baños, Santiago de Las Vegas, and Mariel, {{and those that}} were not destroyed were unroofed. Nueva Paz suffered the loss of 110homes, while Madruga lost 100; only five remained standing at Managua, and of the eight left at Quivicán, all were severely damaged. At Jibacoa, only 32of the town's 82residences survived the storm. The <b>seaside</b> <b>town</b> of Guanabo was entirely lost, with floodwaters driving the town to sea and leaving its residents homeless. The hamlets of Mantilla, La Chorrera, and Paula disappeared entirely, while Candelaria was washed away {{with the loss of}} all its structures, of which a majority collapsed under the strength of the storm's powerful winds before being driven out to sea. Most structures in Cayajabos, Boyeros, and Aguacate were flattened, while the villages of Alquízar, Güira de Melena, and Vereda Nueva essentially vanished after the storm passed through. Guatao was entirely destroyed, suffering the loss of its apparently indestructible church, while Quemado wholly vanished and only four houses endured the storm's impacts at San Antonio de los Baños.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} about a <b>seaside</b> <b>town</b> which was damaged by a cataclysm and consequently {{sunk into the}} depths of the earth. A town named Rogueport was later built at this site, with the fortunes of the lost kingdom fabled to exist behind the eponymous Thousand-Year Door, located in the ruins of the old town. Mario becomes involved when Princess Peach contacts him about a treasure map that she bought in Rogueport, but becomes part of a larger adventure after learning that Peach has gone missing. With the help of Goombella and Professor Frankly, Mario learns that the map can potentially reveal the location of the 7 legendary Crystal Stars, which are required to unlock the Thousand-Year Door. Under the assumption that Peach herself is trying to find the Crystal Stars, he uses the map in an attempt to locate her.|$|E
