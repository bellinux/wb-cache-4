5|$|In {{many areas}} it is {{regarded}} as an agricultural pest, feeding in large flocks on cultivated cereals such as rice. In Southeast Asia, the <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munia</b> is trapped in large numbers for Buddhist ceremonies, but most birds are later released.|$|E
5|$|The <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munia</b> {{was one of}} {{the many}} bird species {{originally}} described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name of Loxia punctulata.

5|$|Aviary {{experiments}} {{conducted with}} captive flocks of <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munia</b> have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (see Evolutionarily stable strategy) when individuals {{are free to}} choose either behavior. The numbers choosing either producers and scrounger strategies {{have been shown to}} converge on stable frequencies while demonstrating that variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay-offs from the choice of different feeding strategies.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{show that}} <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munias</b> tend {{to adopt the}} scrounger tactic when food is more clumped and when the group size increases. When most foragers adopt scrounging, the time taken to {{discover}} new food patches is greater.|$|R
5|$|The ease of {{maintaining}} these birds in captivity {{has made them}} popular for studying behavior and physiology. Feeding behavior can be predicted by the optimal foraging theory, where animals minimize time and energy spent to maximize food intake. This theory has been tested by studying the strategies used by <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munias</b> to increase their feeding efficacy.|$|R
5|$|<b>Scaly-breasted</b> <b>munias</b> form {{flocks of}} as many as 100 birds. Individuals {{communicate}} with calls that include a short whistle, variations of kitty-kitty-kitty, and a sharp chipping alarm note. They sometimes flick their tails and wings vertically or horizontally while hopping about. The tail flicking motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement. The exaggerated version of the tail flicking movement may have undergone ritualization. As a social signal, tail flicking in several other species acts as a signal indicating the intent to fly and helps keep flocks together.|$|R
5|$|The <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munia</b> feeds {{mainly on}} seeds but also eats small berries {{such as those}} of Lantana. Although the bill is suited for {{crushing}} small grains, they do not show lateral movements of the lower mandible which help European greenfinches in dehusking seeds. Like some other munias, they may also feed on algae, a rich protein source, prior to the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|When foraging, <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munia</b> {{can search}} as {{individuals}} or search for others that have found food and join them. The economic {{consequences of the}} decision to join others has been modeled in two ways: the producer-scrounger model and the information sharing model. These models are based on hypotheses that differ in the degree of compatibility that is assumed between the two food and joining opportunity search modes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munia</b> or spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata), {{known in}} the pet trade as nutmeg mannikin or spice finch, is a sparrow-sized estrildid finch native to {{tropical}} Asia. A species of the genus Lonchura, it was formally described and named by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its name {{is based on the}} distinct scale-like feather markings on the breast and belly. The adult is brown above and has a dark conical bill. The species has 11 subspecies across their range and differ slightly in size and colour.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scaly-breasted</b> <b>munias</b> have {{variable}} competitive {{behaviors that}} allow them to exploit scarce resources. There are two foraging alternatives: producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers. Studies show that these choices lead to a stable equilibrium within a group. When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger, frequency dependent selection results in a stable mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar payoff. Studies indicate that if most of the population consists of producers, then scrounging behavior is favored by natural selection because there is plenty of food to steal. On the other hand, if most birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing is favored.|$|R
500|$|<b>Scaly-breasted</b> <b>munias</b> {{are found}} {{in a range of}} {{habitats}} but are usually close to water and grassland. In India, they are especially common in paddy fields where they are considered a minor pest on account of their feeding on grain. They are found mainly on the plains, but can be observed {{in the foothills of the}} Himalayas, in which they may be present at altitudes near , and in the Nilgiris, where they are found at altitudes up to [...] during the summer. In Pakistan, they are restricted to a narrow region from Swat in the west to Lahore, avoiding the desert zone, and then occurring again in India east of an area between Ludhiana and Mount Abu. The species has also been observed in Kashmir, though this is rare.|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{bronchitis}} virus (IBV) {{causes a}} costly respiratory viral disease of chickens. The role of wild {{birds in the}} epidemiology of IBV is poorly understood. We detected diverse coronaviruses by PCR in wildfowl and wading birds in England. Sequence analysis showed some viruses {{to be related to}} IBV. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a group 3 coronavirus, causes a costly viral disease of chickens that is found worldwide (1). It can cause respiratory disease in chickens of all ages and a loss of production and egg quality in mature hens (2). Some strains are nephropathogenic, resulting in renal-induced mortality rates of up to 25 % for susceptible flocks (1). Currently, the poultry industry controls disease through the use of vaccines. However, IBV continuously generates antigenic variants; current vaccines offer no protection against some of them (3). Wild birds may play a role as both reservoirs and long-distance vectors of IBV. Recently, group 3 coronaviruses genetically similar to IBV were detected in healthy galliform and nongalliform birds (4, 5). This finding may suggest that wild birds are able to carry IBV-like viruses asymptomatically. Other studies have detected coronaviruses that are genetically distinct from IBV in wild birds, including graylag geese (Anser anser), rock doves (Columba livia), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), Chinese bulbuls (Pycnonotus sinensis), red-whiskered bulbuls (Pycnonotus jocosus), gray-backed thrushes (Turdus hortulorum), blackbirds (Turdus merula), white-rumped munias (Lonchura striata), and <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munias</b> (Lonchura punctulata) (6, 7). We report the detection and characterization of group 3 coronaviruses, some of which appear to be related to IBV, from wild bird populations sampled in northern England.

5|$|There are {{two types}} of slope posture, a pre-copulatory one and an {{ordinary}} one. The pre-copulatory behavior of <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munia</b> includes a sequence of actions. The first involves either the male or female playing with nest-material. As soon as a bird has arranged the nest material in its bill, it begins to fly around in a zig-zag path. Once a bird lands close to its partner, the male bends towards the female and wipes its bill. The male then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scaly-breasted</b> <b>munia</b> {{clutches}} usually contain 4 to 6 eggs, but {{can contain}} up to 10. Both sexes build the nest and incubate the eggs, which hatch in 10 to 16 days. Juveniles typically fledge in three weeks. Both sexes may reach sexual maturity {{as early as}} 7 months after birth in captivity. In the wild, however, since maturation may be impacted by variable daylight and humidity, both sexes can take between 12 and 18 months to reach sexual maturity depending {{on the time of}} year. Scaly-breasted munias have a typical life expectancy of 6 to 8 years.|$|E
5|$|Most social foragers must {{search for}} food while also {{avoiding}} predators. It {{has been suggested}} that individuals that play scrounger could also, by virtue of their head position, be alert for predators and hence contribute to antipredatory vigilance. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence more joining. When stationary, the head-up tactic {{has been shown to be}} associated with antipredatory vigilance. However scanning while hopping does not aid in vigilance and it is thought that the scrounger tactic is incompatible with antipredatory vigilance in the <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context {{predict that the}} frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>munia</b> show that the intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when patch location was signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not. Signaling patch location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density had no effect on the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not signaled. When food location was signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} aggressive encounters.|$|E
