40|$|AbstractIntroductionThis study {{compared}} {{the ability of}} different approaches to supplement the antibacterial effects of chemomechanical preparation in oval-shaped root canals. MethodsLong oval canals from extracted teeth infected with Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) were chemomechanically prepared up to a 40 / 04 rotary BioRaCe instrument using 2. 5 % NaOCl irrigation and then subjected to two <b>supplementary</b> <b>protocols.</b> In the passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) /chlorhexidine (CHX) group, canals were subjected to PUI for the activation of NaOCl followed by a final rinse with 0. 2 % CHX digluconate solution. In the Hedström group, canals received additional Hedström filing directed towards the buccal and lingual canal recesses. Bacteriological samples were taken before and after preparation, after PUI or Hedström instrumentation, and after CHX final rinsing. ResultsChemomechanical preparation and the supplementary steps promoted a highly significant bacterial reduction (P. 05). Further rinsing with CHX also failed to significantly increase bacterial elimination when compared with post-PUI samples. However, the cumulative antibacterial effects of PUI and CHX final rinse were effective in significantly reducing bacterial counts to levels below those achieved after preparation (P =. 03). This combined PUI/CHX approach also resulted in {{a significant increase in}} the incidence of negative cultures (P =. 04). ConclusionsFindings suggest that there may be a benefit of using the PUI for the activation of NaOCl followed by a final rinse with CHX as supplementary steps in the treatment of infected oval-shaped root canals...|$|R
50|$|From 28 April to 2 May 2014, Togo’s Ministry of Environment and Forest Resources {{organized}} a stakeholders’ consultative workshop to validate Togo’s revised biosafety law.

50|$|After the British {{victory in}} the Second Boer War, {{movements}} began to unify and consolidate British holdings in Southern Africa.

40|$|The {{first edition}} of the Compendium of United Nations Standards and Norms in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice was {{published}} in 1992. Between the {{first edition of}} the Compendium and the present one, new standards and norms have been developed and five binding legal instruments have been negotiated and adopted by the international community: the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its three <b>supplementary</b> <b>protocols</b> (the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition) and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. The standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, developed over the last 60 years have paved the way to the adoption of those conventions and have provided a starting point for their negotiation. Now the hope is that those legal instruments will reinforce and strengthen the value and significance of the standards and norms, by eliciting the kind of system-wide cooperation that will give full weight to their further application. The present edition of the Compendium has been structured according to a new clustering system articulated as follows: (a) standards and norms related primarily to persons in custody, non-custodial sanctions and juvenile and restorative justice; (b) standards and norms related primarily to legal, institutional and practical arrangements for international cooperation; (c) standards and norms related primarily to crime prevention and victim issues; and (d) standards and norms related primarily to good governance, the independence of the judiciary and the integrity of criminal justice personnel...|$|R

50|$|When Nazi Germany {{signed the}} German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union in 1939 before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the fate (unknown to those affected) of the Germans in Bukovina was sealed. In a secret <b>supplementary</b> <b>protocol,</b> it was agreed (among other things) that {{the northern part of}} Bukovina would be annexed by the USSR under a territorial reorganisation in Eastern Europe, with the German sub-populations undergoing compulsory resettlement. Under this accord, the Soviet Union occupied northern Romania in 1940. The Third Reich resettled nearly the entire German population of Bukovina (about 96,000 ethnic Germans) to (among other places) Poland, where the incoming evacuees were frequently compensated with expropriated farms.From 1941 to 1944, Bukovina was entirely Romanian. Most of the Jewish population (30% of the population as a whole) were murdered by the Third Reich and Romania during the Holocaust.|$|E

[...] After racial evaluation, they were divided into groups: A, Altreich, who were to be settled in Germany and allowed neither farms nor business (to allow for closer watch), S Sonderfall, who were used as forced labor, and O Ost-Falle, the best classification, to be settled in the Eastern Wall—the occupied regions, to protect German from the East—and allowed independence. [...] Similar support therefore was fomented with the use of film to depict Baltic and Volga Germans as persecuted by the Bolshevists, such as the films Friesennot, Flüchtlinge, and The Red Terror.|$|E

40|$|Key {{transfer}} protocols rely on {{a mutually}} trusted Group Key Agreement (GKA) to select session keys and transport session keys to all communication entities secretly. Most often, GKA encrypts session keys under another secret key shared with each entity during registration. In this paper, we propose an authenticated key transfer protocol based on secret sharing scheme that GKA can broadcast group key information to all group members at once and only authorized group members can recover the group key; but unauthorized users cannot recover the group key. The confidentiality of this transformation is information theoretically secure. We also provide authentication for transporting this group key. Goals and security threats of our proposed group key transfer protocol will be analyzed in detail. A Group Key Agreement (GKA) protocol is a mechanism to establish a cryptographic key {{for a group of}} participants, based on each one's contribution, over a public network and allows a set of players to establish a shared secret key which can be used to secure a subsequent communication. The key, thus derived, can be used to establish a secure channel between the participants. When the group composition changes (or otherwise), one can employ <b>supplementary</b> GKA <b>protocols</b> to derive a new key. Group key agreement is a fundamental building block for secure peer group communication systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{grounding}} of {{the bulk}} carrier Pasha Bulker on Nobbys beach, Newcastle in June 2007 has again highlighted the risk from shipping posed to Australia’s extensive and environmentally fragile coastline. Whilst a pollution incident was averted in this case, spills from shipping {{in other states}} (such as the Nakhodka spill off Japan in 1997, the Prestige spill off France in 1999, the Erika spill off Spain in 2003 and the Hebei Spirit spill of South Korea in 2007), have required the constant monitoring and updating of the international regulatory regimes designed to prevent such incidents occurring and to provide compensation when they nevertheless do occur. Two recent additions to this international regulatory system are the Protocol on the Establishment of a Supplementary Fund for Oil Pollution Damage 2003, (the “Supplementary Fund Protocol 2003 ”) and the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage 2001 (“the Bunker Oil Convention 2001 ”). In 2008, Australia gave effect to these instruments, enacting the <b>Supplementary</b> Fund <b>Protocol</b> via the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Act 2008 (Cth), while the Bunker Oil Convention is given effect through the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) Act 2008 (Cth), and the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability For Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) (Consequential Amendments) Act 2008 (Cth). The {{purpose of this article}} is to analyse these international instruments, describe how they came about, and explain the Australian implementation of them.
