40|$|The {{classical}} European {{system based}} {{on the construction of}} transverse structures is very significant in the solving of the problems of deep and lateral erosion and sediment accumulation in torrent beds. However, due to their effective height on the upstream side, the dams check and accumulate the sediment making the siltation (deposition of silt) whose slope is called the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>siltation.</b> This paper presents the natural effects of transverse structures (dams) in Gabrovaèka reka, which can be quantified. The paper presents the effects of bed slope on the slopes of siltation and the amounts of accumulated sediment in the siltations, because the effects of technical works are primarily evaluated by the slopes of siltation and by the amounts of accumulated sediment. The analysis of the dependence of newly formed slopes of siltation (Iz) on natural bed slopes (It) was performed by the method of modeling, as the main method, and also by regression and correlation analyses (simple correlation), as concrete study methods. Under the hypothesis that the siltations have a regular wedge, i. e. prismatic form, the accumulated sediment W [m 3] in the siltations was calculated by B. Kitin (1975) formula. The study results confirm the very high correlation between the slopes of siltation and bed slope and present the amounts of the accumulated sediment in the conditions of different natural bed slopes and valley widths. This is a useful information which can improve and make more efficient the work on torrent con 1 rol with similar orographic, petrographic and particle size characteristics...|$|E
50|$|The {{archaeology}} of the Marib Dam {{shows the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>siltation</b> behind dams in antiquity, and measures {{to extend the}} operational life of the reservoir. The Marib dam impounded floodwater to enable irrigation of downstream oases. Over several centuries, silts entrained in the irrigation water accumulated on the irrigated fields up to 15 m high. This caused loss <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> and conveyance, and the dam was raised to compensate. In addition to small operational openings for irrigation water withdrawals, large openings on the upstream side of the dam were probably used during construction to pass {{the water of the}} river, but may also have been used for periodical flushing of accumulated sediments. These examples show that the engineers of the time were keenly aware <b>of</b> reservoir <b>siltation</b> problems and were able to successfully extend the operational lifetime of the reservoirs by structural enhancements and probable sediment flushing. The same problems <b>of</b> <b>siltation</b> encountered in the ancient dam was also faced {{in the construction of the}} new dam.|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: Siltation is a {{recognized}} stress for the benthic community. It may cause {{changes in the}} structure of habitat substrate and water physical and chemical properties. The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain the effects <b>of</b> <b>siltation</b> on the function of a mountain stream benthic community, specifically in respect to availability of food resources. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out at Bistra Stream on theMedvednica Mountain in NWCroatia. Siltation was caused by quarrying. Samples were taken at a control (unsilted) site and three impact sites on four dates during the spring of 2006. Turbidity, water temperature, pH, oxygen content, conductivity and COD were measured and triplicate benthos samples were taken using a 30 ´ 30 cm Surber sampler on each sampling date. Impact <b>of</b> <b>siltation</b> on functional feeding guilds was analyzed. Results and Conclusions: Turbidity, pH and temperature increased significantly downstream <b>of</b> the <b>siltation</b> source. Total number of individuals decreased by 85 %, number of taxa by 60 % and Shannon’s diversity index followed accordingly (by 56 %). The grazers and the detritivores were proven to be most sensitive to the disturbance. The disturbance did not strongly affect shredders whereas predator abundance increased. We conclude that change in food availability is a crucial aspect <b>of</b> <b>siltation</b> disturbance and that allogenic siltation is more devastating because of the additional chemical changes not noted during natural siltation...|$|R

40|$|In the Western Highlands agro-ecological zone of Cameroon, rivers are {{constantly}} silted and polluted with eroded sediment and waste from cultivated land. This study characterizes and quantifies {{the amount of}} material coming from plots cultivated in the Méloh Watershed. In a natural rocky-bottomed well measuring 0. 90 m deep, 3 m long, and 2. 5 m wide, {{for a period of}} three years we performed the collection, differentiation, and measurement of trapped sediment in the cultivated part of river that runs through the watershed. Both cultivated sides of the watershed had fairly regular <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> 14 % on one side and 17 % on the other side. The material retrieved consisted of soil, plant residues, chemical packages, and plastic casing used for irrigation. During the years 2012 and 2013, farmers practiced both flatbed cultivation and ridging along the steepest slopes. These two methods of land preparation are inefficient in terms of water conservation, as evidenced by the collection of 10. 429 t. ha- 1 average total sediment per year during this period. Tied ridging cultivation method was experimented during the 2013 crop year and adopted on 75 % of plots in 2014. We subsequently collected 3. 586 t. ha- 1 total sediment, a decrease of 65. 61 % compared to the average of previous years.
