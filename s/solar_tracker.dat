5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a <b>solar</b> <b>tracker</b> {{in order to keep the}} focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E
5|$|Most Solar {{parks are}} ground mounted PV systems, {{also known as}} {{free-field}} solar power plants. They can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis <b>solar</b> <b>tracker.</b> While tracking improves the overall performance, it also increases the system's installation and maintenance cost. A solar inverter converts the array's power output from DC to AC, and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage, three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E
25|$|During {{the day the}} sun has {{different}} positions. For low concentration systems (and low temperatures) tracking can be avoided (or limited to a few positions per year) if nonimaging optics are used. For higher concentrations, however, if the mirrors or lenses do not move, then {{the focus of the}} mirrors or lenses changes (but also in these cases nonimaging optics provides the widest acceptance angles for a given concentration). Therefore, it seems unavoidable {{that there needs to be}} a tracking system that follows the position of the sun (for solar photovoltaic a <b>solar</b> <b>tracker</b> is only optional). The tracking system increases the cost and complexity. With this in mind, different designs can be distinguished in how they concentrate the light and track the position of the sun.|$|E
50|$|Heliostats {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from <b>solar</b> <b>trackers</b> or sun-trackers that point directly at the sun in the sky. However, some older types of heliostat incorporate <b>solar</b> <b>trackers,</b> together with additional components to bisect the sun-mirror-target angle.|$|R

40|$|World {{energy needs}} {{increases}} {{every day and}} it becomes more difficult to meet the energy demand of the growing population without harming the environment. Therefore, renewable energy is the main area of study for concerned researchers and scientists. Electricity production by using solar energy {{is one of the}} best alternatives to fossil fuels that lose its importance, due to rising costs and damage to the environment. The number of studies to advance the efficiency of solar systems increases day by day. Especially in electricity supply, usage of high efficiency solar energy systems can meet the expectations.

40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>trackers,</b> with concentrators, using multi-junction {{photovoltaics}} {{are used}} in space applications and big solar-farms in desert like environments. These systems require very expensive materials and direct sunlight. With this thesis we want to investigate the possibilities of improving the efficiency of normal PV modules using <b>Solar</b> <b>trackers,</b> concentrators and artificial cooling of normal mono-junction PV modules. In Belgium the ratio of direct sunlight versus indirect sunlight is mostly below 50 %, so one question to be solved is: “What is the optimal concentration factor, considering different global direct sunlight versus indirect sunlight values?”. An other interesting question is: “Is artificial cooling of PV modules useful? ” Both in the case where the thermal heat is used, and when it’s not used. Of course the answer will vary with geographical location. Fig. 1 : Eg. of a commercial available concentrator (se...|$|R

50|$|A major {{challenge}} {{that must be}} addressed in any solar concentrating technology is the changing angle of the incident rays (the rays of sunlight striking the mirrors) as the sun progresses throughout the day. The reflectors of a CLFR are typically aligned in a north-south orientation and turn about a single axis using a computer controlled <b>solar</b> <b>tracker</b> system. This allows the system to maintain the proper angle of incidence between the sun’s rays and the mirrors, thereby optimizing energy transfer.|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{development and the}} increasing diffusion of concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems highlight the lack of specific international standards in the CPV power rating and characterization field. Presently, the only reference standard for CPV cells and modules is the IEC 62108, which does not impose minimum requirements for <b>solar</b> <b>trackers</b> and simulators used in the qualification process of CPV modules. Nevertheless, {{the overall quality of}} CPV tests is strictly associated to the technical specifications of these devices.
