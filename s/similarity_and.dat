Egyptologist Nabil Swelim believes that Khaba could have been the direct successor to King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He bases his assumptions on similarities between the two's names: both begin with the syllable kha. As a comparison, he points to the names Netjerikhet (Djoser) and Sekhemkhet (Djoserteti), which also display such <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> are widely assumed to have ruled back-to-back.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{can also}} be used to identify functionally important sites, such as binding sites, active sites, or sites corresponding to other key functions, by locating conserved domains. When looking at multiple sequence alignments, it is useful to consider different aspects of the sequences when comparing sequences. These aspects include identity, <b>similarity,</b> <b>and</b> homology. Identity means that the sequences have identical residues at their respective positions. On the other hand, similarity has to do with the sequences being compared having similar residues quantitatively. For example, in terms of nucleotide sequences, pyrimidines are considered similar to each other, as are purines. Similarity ultimately leads to homology, in that the more similar sequences are, the closer they are to being homologous. This similarity in sequences can then go on to help find common ancestry.|$|E

English Study Program, Dian Nuswantoro University. Advisor: Dr. Jumanto, Drs.,M. Pd. This thesis entitled A Contrastive Analysis between English Noun Formations with suffix and Their Indonesian Equivalents in the English Merriam Webster on-line dictionary, Bilingual printed dictionary by Enchols and shadily (2014), and Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (KBBI) on-line. This study directs {{to find the}} <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> the differences. The researcher used a descriptive-qualitative methods during the research since the aims {{of this study is}} to find out the <b>similarities,</b> differences <b>and</b> learning problems or translating problem of English Nouns Formations with suffix and Their Indonesian Equivalents in English Merriam Webster on-line dictionary, Bilingual printed by Echols and Shadily (2014) dictionary, and Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (KBBI) on-line. Based on the analysis that has been done, the researcher has found out that there are 19 types the English Nouns Formations with suffix. About the <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> the differences, the researcher concluded that there are Noun Formations with suffix -age with 4 <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 6 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ery there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –dom there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –hood there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ism there is 1 <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 9 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ship there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –eer there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –er words with no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ess there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ette there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –let words there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ling words there is 1 <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 9 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –al words there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ant words there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ation there is 1 <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 9 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ee there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –or there is 1 <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 9 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ment there is 1 <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 9 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ure words there is no <b>similarities</b> <b>and</b> there are 10 differences. Examples of learning problems based on the differences are as follow (1) Noun formations with suffix –age = The word sewerage consist of base sewer + suffix –age, but their Indonesian equivalents translating sewerage into *saluran, instead of penyaluran kotoran, (2) Noun formations with suffix –dom = The word stardom consist of base star + suffix –dom, but their Indonesian equivalents translating stardom into *gugusan bintang, instead of bintang film, (3) Noun formations with suffix –eer = The word mountaineer consist of base mountain + suffix –eer, but their Indonesian equivalents translating mountaineer into *orang gunung, instead of pendaki gunung...|$|R

Since December 2012, there has been evidence of possibly five planets orbiting Tau Ceti, with two of these being potentially in the habitable zone. Because of its debris disk, any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far more impact events than Earth. Despite this hurdle to habitability, its solar analog (Sun-like) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star. Given its stability, <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> relative proximity to the Sun, Tau Ceti is consistently listed as a target for the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), and it appears in some science fiction literature.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{strontium}} is {{a mixture}} of four stable isotopes: 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr. Their abundance increases with increasing mass number and the heaviest, 88Sr, makes up about 82.6% of all natural strontium, though the abundance varies due to the production of radiogenic 87Sr as the daughter of long-lived beta-decaying 87Rb. Of the unstable isotopes, the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 85Sr is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium, and that of the isotopes heavier than 88Sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium. Of special note are 89Sr and 90Sr. The former has a half-life of 50.6days and is used to treat bone cancer due to strontium's chemical <b>similarity</b> <b>and</b> hence ability to replace calcium. While 90Sr (half-life 28.90years) has been used similarly, it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its production as a fission product. Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated about 30,000km2 with greater than 10 kBq/m2 with 90Sr, which accounts for 5% of the core inventory of 90Sr.|$|E
