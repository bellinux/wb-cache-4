When EDDS is applied in chemical-enhanced <b>soil</b> <b>remediation</b> in excessive case (e.g., when applied for ex-situ soil washing), higher extraction efficiency for heavy metals can be achieved and the amount of extraction is less independent with the EDDS dosage; On the other hand, during <b>soil</b> <b>remediation</b> which involves continuous flushing, metal extraction is often limited by the amount of EDDS. Under EDDS deficiency, initial unselective extraction of heavy metals was observed, followed by heavy metal exchange and re-adsorption of heavy metals that have lower stability constant with EDDS.|$|E
