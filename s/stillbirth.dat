40|$|Abstract Objectives: to {{identify}} the determinants of <b>stillbirths</b> in Zambezia province, Mozambique. Methods: a retrospective cross-sectional ecological study {{was carried out in}} 2013 - 2014 by using perinatal indicators captured by the health information system in Zambezia. Sequentially perinatal care indicators, bivariate analysis and multiple adjusted regression at a 5 % significance level with possible explainable variables of <b>stillbirths</b> were described. Results: a median proportion of <b>stillbirths</b> was 1. 6 %, low birth weight and preterm birth and obstetric complications were 4. 9 %, 1. 9 % and 4. 1 %, respectively. The bivariate analysis demonstrated association of <b>stillbirths</b> with anemia (p= 0. 043), antepartum hemorrhage (p= 0. 009), dystocic delivery (p< 0. 001), obstructed labor (p= 0. 004).

5|$|The other {{significant}} theory {{about the origin}} of the legend, proposed by Robert Chambers in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt. The science of teratology (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of maternal impression (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to Julia Pastrana, a woman with hypertrichosis and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 <b>stillbirth</b> with a face resembling a pig is documented, {{there has never been a}} reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.|$|E

This review discusses the impact of skilled birth attendance (SBA) and the provision of Emergency Obstetric Care (EOC) on <b>stillbirths</b> and perinatal mortality. Methods A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Database and the WHO regional libraries. Data of all eligible studies were extracted into a standardized Excel sheet containing variables such as participants’ characteristics, sample size, location, setting, blinding, allocation concealment, intervention and control details and limitations. We undertook a meta-analysis of the impact of SBA on <b>stillbirths.</b> Given the paucity of data from randomized trials or robust quasi-experimental designs, we undertook an expert Delphi consultation to determine impact estimates of provision of Basic and Comprehensive EOC on reducing <b>stillbirths</b> if there would be universal coverage (99 %). Results The literature search yielded 871 hits. A total of 21 studies were selected for data abstraction. Our meta-analysis on community-based skilled birth attendance based on two before-after studies showed a 23 % significant reduction in <b>stillbirths</b> (RR = 0. 77; 95 % CI: 0. 69 – 0. 85). The overall quality grade of available evidence for this intervention on <b>stillbirths</b> was ‘moderate’. The Delphi process supported the estimated reduction in <b>stillbirths</b> by skilled attendance and experts further suggested that the provision of Basic EOC had the potential to avert intrapartum <b>stillbirths</b> by 45 % and with provision of Comprehensive EOC this could be reduced by 75 %. These estimates are conservative, consistent with historical trends in maternal and perinatal mortality from both developed and developing countries, and are recommended for inclusion in the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) model.

40|$|Abstract Background Pregnancy is a {{state of}} {{increased}} requirement of macro- and micronutrients, and malnourishment or inadequate dietary intake before and during pregnancy, can lead to adverse perinatal outcomes including <b>stillbirths.</b> Many nutritional interventions have been proposed during pregnancy according to the nutritional status of the mother and baseline risk factors for different gestational disorders. In this paper, we have reviewed three nutritional interventions including peri-conceptional folic acid supplementation, balanced protein energy supplementation and multiple micronutrients supplementation during pregnancy. This paper is a part of a series to estimate the effect of interventions on <b>stillbirths</b> for input to Live Saved Tool (LiST) model. Methods We systematically reviewed all published literature to identify studies evaluating effectiveness of peri-conceptional folic acid supplementation in reducing neural tube defects (NTD), related <b>stillbirths</b> and balanced protein energy and multiple micronutrients supplementation during pregnancy in reducing all-cause <b>stillbirths.</b> The primary outcome was <b>stillbirths.</b> Meta-analyses were generated where data were available from more than one study. Recommendations were made for the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) model based on rules developed by the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG). Results There were 18 studies that addressed peri-conceptional folic acid supplementation for prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs). Out of these, 7 studies addressed folic acid supplementation while 11 studies evaluated effect of folic acid fortification. Pooled results from 11 fortification studies showed that it reduces primary incidence of NTDs by 41 % [Relative risk (RR) 0. 59; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 52 - 0. 68]. This estimate has been recommended for inclusion in the LiST as proxy for reduction in <b>stillbirths.</b> Pooled results from three studies considered to be of low quality and suggest that balanced protein energy supplementation during pregnancy could lead to a reduction of 45 % in <b>stillbirths</b> [RR 0. 55, 95 % CI 0. 31 - 0. 97]. While promising, the intervention needs more effectiveness studies before inclusion in any programs. Pooled results from 13 studies evaluating role of multiple micronutrients supplementation during pregnancy showed no significant effect in reducing <b>stillbirths</b> [RR = 0. 98; 95 % CI: 0. 88 – 1. 10] or perinatal mortality [RR = 1. 07; 95 % CI: 0. 92 – 1. 25; random model].
