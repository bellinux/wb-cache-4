5|$|Kesler {{played his}} {{first game of the}} season on February 15 against the Dallas Stars. The game was also witness to a piece of Canucks history as Henrik Sedin {{recorded}} two assists to pass Markus Naslund as the franchise's all-time leading scorer, with 757 points. After recording the record <b>setting</b> <b>point,</b> Sedin was given a standing ovation that carried on as play continued. After three minutes the play stopped, and Sedin saluted the crowd. During a commercial break, the Canucks ran a tribute video for the accomplishment, featuring congratulations from Naslund and Trevor Linden, the third-leading scorer in team history. As for Kesler, he registered an assist and blocked three shots in over 17 minutes of ice time of the 4–3 loss. After experiencing some discomfort in his right foot, Kesler had X-rays taken. The X-rays were negative and he continued to play.|$|E
25|$|Often {{the making}} of conserves can be trickier than making a {{standard}} jam; it requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for {{just enough time to}} allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit, and sugar to penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break down and liquify. This process can also be achieved by spreading the dry sugar over raw fruit in layers, and leaving for several hours to steep into the fruit, then just heating the resulting mixture only to bring to the <b>setting</b> <b>point.</b> As a result of this minimal cooking, some fruits are not particularly suitable for making into conserves, because they require cooking for longer periods to avoid issues such as tough skins. Currants and gooseberries, and a number of plums are among these fruits.|$|E
60|$|In a small peninsula, {{formed by}} a winding of the brook, was situated, on a rising hillock, a large {{rough-hewn}} pillar of stone, said by tradition {{to commemorate the}} fall of a stag of unusual speed, size, and strength, whose flight, after having lasted through a whole summer's day, had there terminated in death, to the honour and glory of some ancient baron of St. Ronan's, and of his stanch hounds. During the periodical cuttings of the copse, which the necessities {{of the family of}} St. Ronan's brought round more frequently than Ponty would have recommended, some oaks had been spared in the neighbourhood of this massive obelisk, old enough perhaps to have heard the whoop and halloo which followed the fall of the stag, and to have witnessed the raising of the rude monument by which that great event was commemorated. These trees, with their broad spreading boughs, made a twilight even of noon-day; and, now that the sun was approaching its <b>setting</b> <b>point,</b> their shade already anticipated night. This was especially the case where three or four of them stretched their arms over a deep gully, through which winded the horse-path to Shaws-Castle, at a point about a pistol-shot distant from the Buck-stane. As the principal access to Mr. Mowbray's mansion was by a carriage-way, which passed in a different direction, the present path was left almost in a state of nature, full of large stones, and broken by gullies, delightful, from the varied character of its banks, to the picturesque traveller, and most inconvenient, nay dangerous, to him who had a stumbling horse.|$|E

50|$|The HIV <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is the viral load of {{a person}} {{infected}} with HIV, which stabilizes {{after a period of}} acute HIV infection. The <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is reached after the immune system has developed specific Cytotoxic T cells and begins to attempt to fight the virus. The higher the viral load of the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> the faster the virus will progress to AIDS; the lower the viral load of the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> the longer the patient will remain in clinical latency.

In the literature review, [...] "Beyond the Hedonic Treadmill, Revising the Adaptation Theory of Well-Being" [...] (2006), Diener, Lucas, and Scollon concluded {{that people are not}} hedonically neutral, and that individuals have different <b>set</b> <b>points</b> which are at least partially heritable. They also concluded that individuals may have more than one happiness <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> such as a life satisfaction <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and a subjective well being <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> and that because of this, one's level of happiness is not just one given <b>set</b> <b>point</b> but can vary within a given range.

50|$|The book {{features}} short anecdotes from {{followers of}} the diet who had heard of it through Roberts' blog or The New York Times. Roberts' diet {{is based on the}} fundamental principle of a <b>set</b> <b>point</b> - the weight which, according to Roberts, a person's brain strives to maintain. When actual weight is below the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> appetite increases; when actual weight is above the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> appetite decreases. Furthermore, eating certain foods can raise or lower the <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> Foods that have a strong flavor-calorie relationship (such as fast food or donuts) raise the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> whereas bland foods which are slowly digested (like extra light olive oil or fructose mixed with water) lower the <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> Roberts states that the diet is based upon connecting two unconnected fields: weight control and associative learning. Because of this, the research behind the diet is from multiple fields, ranging from Pavlovian psychology to physiology to rat psychology.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, the {{longitudinal}} {{study conducted by}} Fujita and Diener (2005) described the life satisfaction <b>set</b> <b>point</b> as a [...] "soft baseline".

Typically, life satisfaction will hover around a <b>set</b> <b>point</b> {{for the majority of}} their lives and not change dramatically. However, for {{about a quarter of the}} population this <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is not stable, and does indeed move in response to a major life event.Other longitudinal data has shown that subjective well being <b>set</b> <b>points</b> do change over time, and that adaptation is not necessarily inevitable. In his archival data analysis, Lucas found evidence that it is possible for someone's subjective well-being <b>set</b> <b>point</b> to change drastically, such as in the case of individuals who acquire a severe, long term disability.
