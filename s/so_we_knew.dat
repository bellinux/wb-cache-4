500|$|Weisman {{and casting}} {{director}} Jamie Thomason each easily picked out Clancy Brown {{for the role}} of Rhino. Weisman explains, [...] "We knew Rhino would require a voice with strength and menace, but Rhino also isn't the brightest bulb on the marquee, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> whoever we cast would also have to have the acting chops and comic timing to take the character beyond the usual dumb goon." [...] They each had worked with Brown previously and knew {{he would be able to}} [...] "nail it", as he is able to give a [...] "tough, low voice" [...] and [...] "turn on a dime between dangerous and comedic characterizations." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two {{tower blocks}} in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House; Peter the Painter was only {{involved}} in a minor capacity in the events, and was not present at the siege. The name plaques on the buildings call Peter the Painter an [...] "anti-hero". The decision angered the Metropolitan Police Federation, and a council spokesman said that [...] "There {{is no evidence that}} Peter the Painter killed the three policemen, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> we were not naming the block after a murderer.... but he is the name that East Enders associate with the siege and Sidney Street." [...] In December 2010, on the centenary of the events at Houndsditch, a memorial plaque for the three murdered policemen was unveiled near the location. Three weeks later, on the anniversary of the siege, a plaque was unveiled in honour of Pearson, the fireman who died because the building collapsed on him.|$|E
500|$|Talking to Nashville Scene, Lewis {{said that}} the songs [...] "weren't written off-the-cuff, but they were {{definitely}} recorded, not carelessly, but with a real effort to capture a live feeling, particularly with the vocals". Lewis continued, [...] "To me, it's a big step in a different direction...and {{to be able to}} sink into the vocal take while the band was playing was a very liberating experience for me." [...] Lewis told The A.V. Club, [...] "We played them on the road 100 times, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> that we could walk into the studio and record them the same way. [...] It wasn't really a studio record, but more of a live record in some ways. It was about getting the band together and creating an atmosphere that lent itself to good chemistry between the band members and trying to capture as much of the record live as we could." [...] As [...] "a child of digital generation", Lewis had generally worked with Pro Tools, but wanted to capture the [...] "not-perfect sound" [...] of some of her favorite records.|$|E

500|$|Mullins {{found that}} [...] "To choreograph a fight is {{constantly}} {{trying to be}} open to doing things differently, and making things creative as possible. Any sequence that you ever do, it doesn’t matter if it’s two punches or 50 punches. The same amount of danger is always there. In order to make something look organic and real, the performers and stunt performers have got to punch each other as hard as they can ... Both of us—myself and Sam—we worked with Kevin [...] on , <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> the level that the director was wanting. So we both felt every piece had to be awesome, because he’s known for putting together amazing sequences that are both unique and hard hitting." [...] Jo also noted that [...] "trying to come up with things people haven’t seen before. There have been so many action movies and so many Marvel movies, you’re constantly wanting to set the bar higher and higher. And it feels like the moves that are even possible just get narrower and narrower cause they’ve been done before." [...] Tancharoen later reflected that [...] "everyone really liked the May versus May fight", and so he and the stunt team would use it as a benchmark to overcome when designing action sequences for future episodes.|$|E
500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch {{of the group}} recollected: [...] "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, came in and said, 'Hey guess what—Madonna's manager called. Do {{you guys want to}} go on tour with her?" [...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> about each other. I don't know why she {{thought it would be a}} good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E
500|$|Del Vecho {{explained}} how the film's animation team was organized: [...] "On this movie {{we do have}} character leads, supervising animators on specific characters. The animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it's always under one lead. I think it was different on Tangled, for example, but we chose {{to do it this}} way as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and then be able to impart that to the crew. Hyrum Osmond, the supervising animator on Olaf, is quiet but he has a funny, wacky personality <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> he'd bring a lot of comedy to it; Anna's animator, Becky Bresee, it's her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead Anna." [...] Acting coach Warner Loughlin was brought in to help the film's animators understand the characters they were creating. In order to get the general feeling of each scene, some animators did their own acting. [...] "I actually film myself acting the scene out, which I find very helpful," [...] said animation supervisor Rebecca Wilson Bresee. This helped her discover elements that made the scene feel real and believable. Elsa's supervising animator was Wayne Unten, who asked for that role because he was fascinated by the complexity of the character. Unten carefully developed Elsa's facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against Anna's fearlessness. He also studied videos from Menzel's recording sessions and animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing. Head of Animation, Lino DiSalvo, said, [...] "The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you've ever seen." ...|$|E

500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E
2500|$|The album artwork {{is based}} on a {{painting}} by Hendrix himself in 1957. [...] "He went through a phase doing watercolors at school and {{this was one of the}} 110 drawings of his that our father kept. When I saw this one he did in 1957, it screamed 'Valleys of Neptune' to me <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> we'd use it for this project," [...] said his step-sister, Janie. The album artwork is a mix of his painting and a Linda McCartney photograph of him with a blue tint.|$|E
2500|$|Scorpion {{appeared}} in the first MK game as one of two palette-swapped ninjas along with Sub-Zero. His early origins were revealed by original series character designer John Tobias in September 2011 when he posted several pages of old preproduction character sketches and notes on Twitter. Scorpion and Sub-Zero were simply described as [...] " [...] palette swap for 2 ninjas—a hunter and the hunted," [...] while Tobias also considered the concepts of {{either one of them}} fleeing their clan, or a [...] "revenge story" [...] involving the then-unnamed characters being part of rival clans. In regards to the game's strict memory limitations, co-creator and programmer Ed Boon explained in 2012: [...] "A lot of attention went into the economics of it, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> that if we could take a character and change their color and use basically the same memory to create two characters, we'd save {{a lot of money and}} we'd have two characters." [...] Scorpion was given a yellow palette with the developers deciding that it would symbolize fire as the exact opposite to Sub-Zero's ice blue, which [...] "prompted the story behind them being these opposing ninja-clan-type characters." [...] A third ninja swap, Reptile, was added in the third revision as a hidden character who was outfitted in green and used Scorpion's spear (along with Sub-Zero's freeze) as part of his offensive arsenal; he was devised by Boon as [...] "a cooler version of Scorpion." [...] The original costume was created from a modified ninja-like outfit bought at a Chicago costume shop and was red for filming in the first game, but a different yellow one with a quilted vest and knee-high shin guards was utilized for MKII. This in turn made the other male ninjas therein—Sub-Zero, Reptile, and hidden characters Smoke and Noob Saibot—palette swaps of Scorpion, with the latter two also using Scorpion's spear when players fought them separately in secret battles. Scorpion and the ninja characters were played by Daniel Pesina, who was replaced by John Turk for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and the 1996 compilation Mortal Kombat Trilogy, while Sal Divita played the character in MK: Mythologies.|$|E
