The police serve as border guards for the outer border of the Schengen Area. The busiest are Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which has 130 man-years tied to it, Storskog on the Russian border and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. These are the only borders with designated border employees—all other are manned with regular officers. The police is not responsible for customs, which {{is the responsibility of}} the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities. Norway participates in a series of international police cooperation, such as Interpol, Europol, the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System,</b> Frontex, and the Baltic Sea Task Force on Organized Crime.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we generalise {{the notion of}} (algebraic) <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to {{continuous}} <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> Just as algebraic <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are concrete representations of Scott domains, continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are concrete representations of continuous Scott domains.

We show how constructions on qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> (such as product and function space) can be "translated" to constructions on continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Among other things, we prove that the category of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> is weak Cartesian closed.

The Council likewise instructed TREVI ministers to take measures in setting up the office. On 7 February 1992, Europol was enshrined with more substance in Article K.1, section 9, as the Maastricht Treaty was signed: Member States shall regard the following areas as matters of common interest: [...] police cooperation for the purposes of preventing and combatting terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of customs cooperation, in connection with the organization of a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European Police Office (Europol).Europol was first de facto organised provisionally in 1993 as the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU) in Strasbourg at the same site as the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> was hosted. The small initial group started operations there in January 1994 under the leadership of Jürgen Storbeck and with a mandate to assist national police forces in criminal investigations. The competition for the permanent site of Europol during the period was between The Hague, Rome and Strasbourg—the European Council decided on 29 October 1993 that Europol should be established in The Hague. A former Catholic boys school built in 1910 at Raamweg 47 was chosen as the precise location. The house was used in World War II by police and intelligence agencies and after the War manned by the Dutch State Intelligence Service until Europol relocated there later in 1994.|$|E
