5|$|Jane's {{reported}} in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents {{in his home}} about a U.S. attack on Iraq. When they raided the house, fighting broke out between Abu Nidal's men and Iraqi intelligence. In the midst of this, Abu Nidal rushed into his bedroom and was killed; Palestinian sources told Jane's {{that he had been}} shot several times. Jane's suggested <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> him killed because he feared Abu Nidal would act against him {{in the event of an}} American invasion.|$|E

5000|$|This {{claim is}} however disputed. Dr Ala Bashir, Saddam Hussein's former {{personal}} physician, stated, [...] "The stories about <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>having</b> body doubles, {{to foster the}} impression that the Iraqi dictator was everywhere, are nonsense." ...|$|R
25|$|Though <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> renounced {{the use of}} {{chemical}} weapons in 1989, many did not believe he would really honor that during a conflict with the United States and the broader coalition forces. As American troops headed to the desert, analysts speculated about their vulnerability to CB attack. Although the location of Hussein's chemical munitions was unknown, their existence was never doubted.|$|E
25|$|The main {{allegations}} were: that Saddam possessed or {{was attempting}} to produce weapons of mass destruction, which <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> used {{in places such as}} Halabja, possessed, and made efforts to acquire, particularly considering two previous attacks on Baghdad nuclear weapons production facilities by both Iran and Israel which were alleged to have postponed weapons development progress; and, further, that he had ties to terrorists, specifically al-Qaeda.|$|E
25|$|One bomb {{missed the}} {{compound}} entirely {{and the other}} three missed their target, landing {{on the other side of}} the wall of the palace compound. Saddam Hussein was not present, nor were any members of the Iraqi leadership. The attack killed one civilian and injured fourteen others, including four men, nine women and one child. Later investigation revealed that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> not visited the farm since 1995.|$|E

25|$|On 13 December 2003, in Operation Red Dawn, Saddam Hussein was {{captured}} by American forces after being found hiding in {{a hole in the}} ground near a farmhouse in ad-Dawr, near Tikrit. Following his capture, Saddam was transported to a U.S. base near Tikrit, and later taken to the American base near Baghdad. On 14 December, U.S. administrator in Iraq L. Paul Bremer confirmed that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> indeed been captured at a farmhouse in ad-Dawr near Tikrit. Bremer presented video footage of Saddam in custody.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, he {{went for}} a period of Islamic study at a Shiite seminary in Najaf, Iraq. Nasrallah was forced to return to Lebanon in 1979, by that time having {{completed}} the first part of his study, as Saddam Hussein was expelling many Shia's, including Khomeini and Abbas Musawi a year earlier. Back in Lebanon, he studied and taught at the school of Amal’s leader Abbas al-Musawi, later being selected as Amal's political delegate in Beqaa, and making him a member of the central political office. Around the same time, in 1980, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> Sadr executed.|$|E
2500|$|Cole {{rejects the}} Bush administrations early claims of Iraqi {{cooperation}} with Al-Qaeda, noting that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> [...] "persecuted and killed both Sunni and Shiite fundamentalists in great number", {{as well as}} claims {{to the effect that}} Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Rather than making America safer, he says, the war has ironically had the opposite effect: inspiring anti-U.S. militants.|$|E
5000|$|Ba'athist Iraq under <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> pursued ethnic {{cleansing}} or the liquidation of minorities, pursued expansionist wars against Iran and Kuwait, and gradually replaced pan-Arabism with an Iraqi nationalism that emphasized Iraq's {{connection to the}} glories of ancient Mesopotamian empires, including Babylonia. Historian on fascism Stanley Payne has said about Saddam Hussein's regime: [...] "There will probably never again be a reproduction of the Third Reich, but <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> come closer than any other dictator since 1945".|$|R

It is also a reference to the war in Iraq, fought on the lie of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>having</b> weapons of mass destruction.|$|R
2500|$|Following the U.S. {{invasion}} of Iraq in 2003, American forces captured {{a number of}} documents detailing conversations that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> with his inner sanctum.

[...] Of Israel's anti-Iraqi endeavors he noted, [...] "Technically, they [...] are right in all of their attempts to harm Iraq." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 Republican presidential debate, Romney mistakenly {{said that}} the Iraq war {{could have been avoided}} if <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> allowed IAEA {{inspectors}} into the country. CNN contributor Paul Begala criticized this remark and called it [...] " [...] huge mistake, a gaffe that -- that's, if this were a general election debate, would be a disqualifier," [...] pointing out that inspectors had been allowed into Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|ElBaradei {{described}} the U.S. invasion of Iraq as [...] "a glaring example of how, in many cases, {{the use of}} force exacerbates the problem rather than [...] it." [...] ElBaradei further stated that [...] "we learned from Iraq that an inspection takes time, that we should be patient, that an inspection can, in fact, work," [...] and that he had [...] "been validated" [...] in concluding that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> not revived his nuclear weapons program.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{run up to}} the 2003 Iraq War, he {{addressed}} parliament saying [...] "The body of evidence that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> possesses a fearsome range {{of weapons of mass}} destruction is substantial.. Let us be clear: <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> weapons of mass destruction and he is a threat to his people, his neighbours and ultimately the middle east and the wider world.

50|$|Aznar: It is very {{important}} to have a resolution. It is not the same to act with it as without it. It would be very advisable to have a majority in the Security Council that supported that resolution. In fact, {{it is important to have}} it passed by a majority, even if someone exercises a veto. Let us consider that the text of the resolution would have among other things to state that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> lost his opportunity.|$|R

2500|$|Four Chechens, Vakhit Murdashev, Viskhan Hadzhimuradov, Skanarbek Yusupov and Ilias Iriskhanov, were {{captured}} by the special operation. According to the ballistic evidence at their trial in the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic, Maskhadov {{was killed by a}} shot from the pistol of Viskhan Hadzhimuradov, his nephew and bodyguard. Hadzhimuradov testified that he does not remember whether he shot Maskhadov or not since he was stunned by an explosion but after the capture Hadzhimuradov reportedly said: [...] "My uncle always told me to shoot him if he is wounded and his capture is imminent. He said that if he is taken prisoner, he would be mistreated like <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> been".|$|E
2500|$|After <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> been deposed, Powell's {{new role}} was to once again {{establish}} a working international coalition, this time {{to assist in the}} rebuilding of post-war Iraq. On September 13, 2004, Powell testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his February 2003 UN presentation were [...] "wrong" [...] and that it was [...] "unlikely" [...] that any stockpiles of WMDs would be found. Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, Powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community, including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that [...] "what one person knew, everyone else knew." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{warnings}} from the German Federal Intelligence Service and the British Secret Intelligence Service questioning {{the authenticity of}} the claims, the US Government and British government utilized them to build a rationale for military action in the lead up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including in the 2003 State of the Union address, where President Bush said [...] "we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs", and Colin Powell's presentation to the UN Security Council, which contained a computer generated image of a mobile biological weapons laboratory. They were later found to be mobile milk pasteurization and hydrogen generation trailers. On 24 September 2002, the British government published its dossier on the former Iraqi leader's WMD with a personal foreword by Blair, who assured readers <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> continued to produce WMD [...] "beyond doubt".|$|E

5000|$|The {{transcript}} {{begins with}} Bush saying {{he wants to}} pursue a second resolution quickly, {{two or three days}} after the meeting. Aznar prefers three days later so the General Affairs and External Relations Council can meet beforehand. Bush envisions a resolution similar to one passed during the Kosovo conflict, and [...] "he wants it written so that it does not contain obligatory elements, that does not mention the use of force, and that states that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> been unable to fulfill his obligations." ...|$|R

2500|$|The job {{of finding}} WMD and {{providing}} {{justification for the}} attack would fall to the intelligence services, but, according to Kampfner, [...] "Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz believed that, while the established security services had a role, they were too bureaucratic and too traditional in their thinking." [...] As a result, [...] "they set up {{what came to be}} known as the 'cabal', a cell of eight or nine analysts in a new Office of Special Plans (OSP) based in the U.S. Defense Department." [...] According to an unnamed Pentagon source quoted by Hersh, the OSP [...] "was created in order to find evidence of what Wolfowitz and his boss, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, believed to be true—that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> close ties to Al Qaeda, and that Iraq had an enormous arsenal of chemical, biological, and possibly even nuclear weapons that threatened the region and, potentially, the United States." ...|$|E

In 2003, she headed the US delegation to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Kirkpatrick was appointed to the Board of Directors of IDT Corp. in 2004. It was revealed after her death that in 2003, she was sent as a US envoy, to meet an Arab delegation and attempt to convince them to support the Iraq War; she was supposed to argue that pre-emptive war was justifiable, but she knew that it would not work and instead argued that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> consistently gone against the UN. However she described George W.

2500|$|Iraq invaded Iran, first attacking Mehrabad Airport of Tehran {{and then}} {{entering}} the oil-rich Iranian land of Khuzestan, {{which also has}} a sizable Arab minority, on 22 September 1980 and declared it a new province of Iraq. With {{the support of the}} Arab states, the United States, and Europe, and heavily financed by the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> become [...] "the defender of the Arab world" [...] against a revolutionary Iran. The only exception was the Soviet Union, who initially refused to supply Iraq on the basis of neutrality in the conflict, although in his memoirs, Mikhail Gorbachev claimed that Leonid Brezhnev refused to aid Saddam over infuriation of Saddam's treatment of Iraqi communists. Consequently, many viewed Iraq as [...] "an agent of the civilized world". The blatant disregard of international law and violations of international borders were ignored. Instead Iraq received economic and military support from its allies, who conveniently overlooked Saddam's use of chemical warfare against the Kurds and the Iranians and Iraq's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.|$|E

5000|$|In doing so, Rothman {{stated that}} [...] "now, {{especially}} in the light and shadow of September 11, {{there is a new}} immediacy and power to Saddam Hussein's longstanding and oft-stated threats against America.

Now, al Qaeda has joined him....The thought of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> sending these same al-Qaeda 'martyrs' to America to spray chemical or biological poisons over America's reservoirs in our most populated cities, is a thought so horrifying, yet so real a possibility, that I cannot in good conscience especially after the surprise attack of Sept. 22, permit this to happen." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of Iraqis overall view the recent parliamentary elections as valid, are optimistic that their {{country is going}} in the right direction and feel that the overthrow of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> been worth the costs.
