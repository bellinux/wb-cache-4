40|$|Noil {{hemp fibre}} (NHF) {{is a kind}} of textile hemp fibre after deep {{degumming}} from <b>scutched</b> <b>hemp</b> fibre (SHF), mechanically-degummed hemp fibre. Both NHF and SHF with strong mechanical properties are good candidates as reinforcing fibres for plastics such as polypropylene (PP). The PP/NHF and PP/SHF composites were blended via internal mixing process. The effect of fibres on the morphology, thermal resistance and reinforcement of the composites were investigated. PP/NHF composites showed higher impact strength, lower flexural strength than PP/SHF at the corresponding loading because NHF has smaller diameter and better thermal resistance than SHF. Meanwhile, NHF has the similar reinforcement to tensile strength with SHF. The effect of maleic anhydride polypropylene (MAPP) on the fibre-resin interface bonding was also comparatively studied. With increasing amount of MAPP, the tensile, flexural and impact strengths of PP/NHF and PP/SHF increased, respectively. The morphology of PP/SHF and PP/NHF results well showed that MAPP improved the interaction of the fibres with PP through chemical adhesion. ...|$|E
500|$|In 1916 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) chief {{scientists}} Jason L. Merrill and Lyster H. Dewey {{created a}} paper, USDA Bulletin No. 404 [...] "Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material", {{in which they}} stated that paper from the woody inner portion of the hemp stem broken into pieces, so called hemp hurds, was [...] "favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood". Merrill and Dewey's findings were not repeated in a later book by Dewey and have not been confirmed by paper production experts. The consistency of long fibers is too low in hemp hurds for commercial papermaking. Numerous machines had been devised for breaking and <b>scutching</b> <b>hemp</b> fibers, but none had {{been found to be}} fully satisfactory in actual commercial work. To produce fiber from hemp was a labor-intensive process if harvest, transport and processing are included. Technological developments decreased the labor but not sufficiently to eliminate this disadvantage.|$|R
