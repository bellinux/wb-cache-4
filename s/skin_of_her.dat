25|$|After {{the priests}} depart, Concetta retires to her bedroom, where she keeps several locked boxes of {{decaying}} mementos of her past, including the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's dog Bendicò, {{which had been}} made into a rug and which is now completely moth-eaten. There, because she is the most pragmatic of the three sisters, she foresees what is about to happen—the confiscation of the relics and the painting, the re-consecration of the chapel, the inevitable spreading of stories of the Salinas' humiliation, and the equally inevitable destruction of what's left of the family's reputation and prestige. Her thoughts are interrupted by a footman announcing the arrival of Princess Angelica Falconeri.|$|E
25|$|A {{procession}} {{of all the}} men and boys, even carrying male infants, accompanied the girl out of the village to the scaffold. Together they awaited the morning star. When the star was due to rise, the girl was placed and tied on the scaffold. At the moment the star appeared above the horizon, the girl was shot with an arrow, then the priest cut the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chest to bleed. She was quickly shot with arrows by all the participating men and boys to hasten her death. The girl was carried {{to the east and}} placed face down so her blood would soak into the earth, with appropriate prayers for the crops and life she would bring to all life on the prairie.|$|E

The high-profile production featured an ensemble cast of Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher, and {{told the story of}} two unhappily married couples in New York which results in an extra-marital affair. Mukerji played Maya Talwar, a woman layered with self-doubt and question about the relationship between her husband (played by Abhishek Bachchan) and herself. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was a popular release, emerging as a major economic success with gross earnings of over [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote, [...] "Rani looks a million bucks and she dives under the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> character to make that part one that we will remember for a long time". The role won Mukerji a third consecutive IIFA Best Actress Award and among other nods, earned her a sixth Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. The poorly received melodrama Baabul was her final appearance that year.|$|E

40|$|Proliferating trichilemmal tumors (PTTs) are benign adnexal skin {{neoplasms}} {{that arise}} from the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. These tumors are most commonly observed on the scalp and occur, most of the time, in elderly women. Malignant transformation of these neoplasms is a rare event; less than 50 cases {{have been reported in}} the English medical literature.

The <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheek had fallen, and her mouth was dragged, and the mark of death was upon her; but the agony of want was past. She sat there listless, indifferent, hardly capable of suffering, even for her child, waiting her doom unconsciously.|$|E

She saw him, and they converged. Her look of 'What do you think of me NOW?' was suggested, he knew, by the thought that the last time they met she had appeared under the disadvantage of mourning clothes, on a wet day in a country-house, where everybody was cross.|$|E

In its half century of existence, the tour visited 200 cities across the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, raising over $50 million for charity. The fashion tour was a pioneer in using African-American models on the runway and helped highlight the works of African-American designers. Building on her difficulties in finding cosmetics suited to the <b>skin</b> tones <b>of</b> <b>her</b> models, Johnson created Fashion Fair Cosmetics in 1973 as a line of makeup that would be sold in leading department stores.|$|R

And as she advanced, those who were near retreated to a respectful distance, making a circle round her and leaving her isolated, with her tall Ethiopian slaves behind her holding broad leaves of palm above her head to shield her from the sun. Thus was the gold of her hair left in shadow, and the white <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face appeared soft and cool, but the sun played with the shimmering folds of her white silk tunic and glinted against the gems on her fingers.|$|E

All this was so unlike her usual fastidiousness and repose that he was struck by it.

50|$|The {{music of}} Rozalie Hirs reveals {{a love for}} sound and refined structures, in {{combination}} with a classic approach to form characteristic of the Hague School. Her compositional techniques involve research into the workings of sound, psychoacoustic effects and emotion in music. The listening experience itself, however, always remains central to her approach. The uninitiated listener {{does not need to}} concern herself with the mathematical skeleton underlying Rozalie Hirs's music. The composer reveals the soft gleaming <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> sounds in <b>her</b> music and poetry.|$|R

What I {{saw was a}} solid phalanx of armed men between myself and a dais {{supporting}} a great bench of carved sorapus wood. On this bench, or throne, squatted a female black. She was evidently very old. Not a hair remained upon her wrinkled skull. With the exception of two yellow fangs she was entirely toothless. On {{either side of her}} thin, hawk-like nose her eyes burned from the depths of horribly sunken sockets. The <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face was seamed and creased with a million deepcut furrows. Her body was as wrinkled as her face, and as repulsive.|$|E
60|$|Marian and Izz {{were much}} {{interested}} in her excursion, knowing that the journey concerned her husband. Their lodgings were in a cottage a little further along the lane, but they came and assisted Tess in her departure, and argued that she should dress up in her very prettiest guise to captivate the hearts of her parents-in-law; though she, knowing of the austere and Calvinistic tenets of old Mr Clare, was indifferent, and even doubtful. A year had now elapsed since her sad marriage, but she had preserved sufficient draperies from the wreck of her then full wardrobe to clothe her very charmingly as a simple country girl with no pretensions to recent fashion; a soft gray woollen gown, with white crape quilling against the pink <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face and neck, and a black velvet jacket and hat.|$|E
6000|$|The girl of {{the golden}} hair and sea-blue eyes {{was sitting on a}} boulder of the headland, half-hidden by a jutting rock. She was looking {{straight}} at Anne with a strange expression--part wonder, part sympathy, part--could it be?--envy. She was bare-headed, and her splendid hair, more than ever like Browning's [...] "gorgeous snake," [...] was bound about her head with a crimson ribbon. She wore a dress of some dark material, very plainly made; but swathed about her waist, outlining its fine curves, was a vivid girdle of red silk. Her hands, clasped over her knee, were brown and somewhat work-hardened; but the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> throat and cheeks was as white as cream. A flying gleam of sunset broke through a low-lying western cloud and fell across her hair. For a moment she seemed the spirit of the sea personified--all its mystery, all its passion, all its elusive charm.|$|E
50|$|A lich acolyte of the Shadow God, Pink is Roland’s sponsor and an {{experienced}} necromancer.

50|$|Seven {{years after}} Sargent painted Madame Gautreau, Gustave Courtois painted her. As {{in the earlier}} painting, the {{portrait}} shows her face in profile.

This time, however, the portrait was well received by the public. In 1897 Gautreau posed yet again for a standing portrait, for what would be her favorite version, by Antonio de La Gándara.|$|R
50|$|Cabanel {{produced}} many {{works of}} portraiture throughout his painting career. His soft and precise depictions of women were very popular among the upper classes, establishing {{the artist as}} a viable resource for beautiful likenesses. In his painting Olivia Peyton Murray Cutting, Cabanel utilized a dark background in order to emphasize the light <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> the woman. <b>Her</b> dress is shiny and ornate, scrunched up where the fabric meets the furniture. Her chair and pillows are lavish and decorated, adding a luxurious effect. These elements can all be seen in Phaedra in the dark background illuminating her pale body, the luscious fabrics that shine and ripple, and the opulent luxury <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bedchamber's adornments. Further, Cabanel's model for the work was a distinguished banker's wife, alluding to the popularity of his portraiture techniques.|$|R
