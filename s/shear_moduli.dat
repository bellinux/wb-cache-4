50|$|Several {{properties}} must {{be taken}} into account when evaluating a material as (super)hard. While hard materials have high bulk moduli, a high bulk modulus does not mean a material is hard. Inelastic characteristics must be considered as well, and shear modulus might even provide a better correlation with hardness than bulk modulus. Covalent materials generally have high bond-bending force constants and high <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> and are more likely to give superhard structures than, for example, ionic solids.|$|E

The fabricated greenware is subjected to heat treatment (densification) at elevated temperatures followed by grinding and polishing to transparency. It can withstand temperatures of about 2100 °C in inert atmospheres. The grinding and polishing substantially improves the impact resistance and other mechanical properties of armor.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{hardness}} {{was first}} {{defined as the}} ability of one material to scratch another and quantified by an integer (sometimes half-integer) from 0 to 10 on the Mohs scale. This scale was however quickly found too discrete and non-linear. Measuring the mechanical hardness of materials changed to using a nanoindenter (usually made of diamond) and evaluating bulk moduli, and the Brinell, Rockwell, Knoop and Vickers scales have been developed. Whereas the Vickers scale is widely accepted as a most common test, there remain controversies on the weight load to be applied during the test. Bulk moduli, <b>shear</b> <b>moduli,</b> and elasticity are the key factors in the superhard classification process.|$|E

40|$|Topology and {{percolation}} effects play {{an important}} role in heterogeneous materials, but have rarely been studied for higher-order tensor properties. We explore the effective elastic properties of random multiphase materials using a combination of continuum computational simulations and analytical theories. The effective <b>shear</b> and bulk <b>moduli</b> of a class of symmetric-cell random composites with high phase contrasts are determined, and reveal shortcomings of classical homogenization theories in predicting elastic properties of percolating systems. The effective shear modulus exhibits typical percolation behavior, but with its percolation threshold shifting with the contrast in phase bulk moduli. On the contrary, the effective bulk modulus does not exhibit intrinsic percolation but does show an apparent or extrinsic percolation transition due to cross effects between <b>shear</b> and bulk <b>moduli.</b> We also propose an empirical approach for bridging percolation and homogenization theories and predicting the effective <b>shear</b> and bulk <b>moduli</b> in a manner consistent with the simulations.

5000|$|As a {{versatile}} tool for characterizing elastic properties of solid materials, RUS has found applications {{in a variety}} of fields.In geosciences {{one of the most important}} applications is related to the determination of seismic velocities in the Earth's interior. In a recent work, [...] for example, the elastic constants of hydrous forsterite were measured up to 14.1 GPa at ambient temperature. This study showed that aggregate bulk and <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> of hydrous forsterite increase with pressure at a greater rate than those of the corresponding anhydrous phase. This implies that at ambient conditions VP and VS of hydrous forsterite are slower than those of anhydrous one; conversely, with increasing pressure, and consequently depth, VP and VS of hydrous forsterite exceed those of anhydrous one. In addition hydration decreases the VP/VS ratio of forsterite, the maximum compressional wave azimuthal anisotropy and the maximum shear wave splitting. These data help us to constrain Earth's mantle composition and distinguish regions of hydrogen enrichment from regions of high temperature or partial melt.|$|E
50|$|For {{isotropic}} materials, {{the presence}} of fractures affects the Young and the <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> perpendicular to the planes of the cracks, which decrease (Young's modulus faster than the shear modulus) as the fracture density increases, indicating that {{the presence of}} cracks makes bodies brittler. Microscopically, the stress-strain relationship of materials is in general governed by the Helmholtz free energy, a thermodynamic quantity. Molecules settle in the configuration which minimizes the free energy, subject to constraints derived from their structure, and, depending on whether the energy or the entropy term dominates the free energy, materials can broadly be classified as energy-elastic and entropy-elastic. As such, microscopic factors affecting the free energy, such as the equilibrium distance between molecules, can affect the elasticity of materials: for instance, in inorganic materials, as the equilibrium distance between molecules at 0 K increases, the bulk modulus decreases. The effect of temperature on elasticity is difficult to isolate, because there are numerous factors affecting it. For instance, the bulk modulus of a material is dependent on the form of its lattice, its behavior under expansion, as well as the vibrations of the molecules, all of which are dependent on temperature.|$|E
30|$|A quasi-simple shear test, {{which is}} the most direct method for {{examining}} the shear properties of sheet metals, has been applied to measure the <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> of wood.

The shear tests were carried out to determine the <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> in the radial and tangential planes. Apparent <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> obtained from the experimental results were corrected by finite element method (FEM) simulation of the shear region, where both shearing and bending are produced.

This suggests that the method employed here can effectively estimate the <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> of wood.|$|E

40|$|The surface {{stability}} of two interacting (for example, by van der Waals forces) incompressible thin films, one bonded to a substrate {{and the other}} to a contactor, is studied extending the work of Shenoy and Sharma, Physical Review Letters 18, 119 – 122 (2001). The analysis indicates that the wavelength of the instability depends strongly on the <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> and thicknesses of the films but not on the nature and magnitude of the interaction. When the films have equal <b>shear</b> <b>moduli,</b> the wavelength of the instability has an intermediate value between the wavelengths of the instabilities had each of the films been interacting with rigid contactors. On the other hand, if the films have different <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> but equal thicknesses, then the wavelength of the instability is identical to that had the films been interacting with rigid contactors. In the more general case when the two films have different <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> and thicknesses, the nature of the critical wavelength is more complex. When ratio of the <b>shear</b> <b>moduli</b> of the contacting film to that of the film bonded to the substrate exceeds 5. 32, the wavelength of the of the instability jumps from the value close to that determined by the thickness of the film bonded to the substrate to that of the contacting film, as the thickness of the contacting film is increased. ...|$|E
