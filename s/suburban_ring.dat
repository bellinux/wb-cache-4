25|$|One {{area where}} hypersegregation {{seems to have}} the {{greatest}} effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent crimes in the U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s. Despite this number, the crime rates in the hypersegregated inner-cities of America are rising. As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven {{times more likely to be}} shot to death and nine times more likely to be murdered than their European American peers. Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans. Research has proven that the more segregated the surrounding European American <b>suburban</b> <b>ring</b> is, the rate of violent crime in the inner-city will rise, but, likewise, crime in the outer area will drop.|$|E
6000|$|Take {{for example}} Guildford, or Folkestone, {{and you will}} find that {{possibly}} even more than half the wealth in the place is non-local wealth--wealth, that is, having no relation to the local production of wealth--and that a large majority of the more educated, intelligent and active inhabitants derive their income, spend their energies, and find their absorbing interests outside the locality. They may rent or own houses, but they have no reality of participation and little illusion of participation in any local life. You will find in both towns a considerable number of hotels, inns, and refreshment places which, although they are regulated by local magistrates upon a basis of one license to so many inhabitants, derive {{only a small fraction of}} their profits from the custom of the inhabitants. You find too in Folkestone, as in most seaside places, a great number of secondary schools, drawing scarcely a pupil from the neighbourhood. And on the other h{{and you will find}} labour in both towns, coming in by a morning train and going out at night. And neither of these instances is an extreme type. As you come in towards London you will find the proportion of what I would call non-local inhabitants increasing until in Brixton, Hoxton, or West Ham you will find the really localized people a mere thread in the mass of the population. Probably you find the thinnest sham of a community in the London boroughs, where a clerk or a working man will shift his sticks from one borough to another and move on to a third without ever discovering what he has done. It is not that all these people do not belong to a community, but that they belong to a larger community of a new type which your administrators have failed to discover, and which your working theory of local government ignores. This is a question I have already written about with some completeness in a book published a year or so ago, and called [...] "Anticipations," [...] and in that book you will find a more lengthy exposition than I can give here and now of the nature of this expansion. But the gist of the argument is that the distribution of population, the method of aggregation in a community, is determined almost entirely by the available means of locomotion. The maximum size of any community of regular daily intercourse is determined by the length of something that I may best suggest to your mind by the phrase--the average possible suburban journey in an hour. A town, for example, in which the only method of progression is on foot along crowded ways, will be denser in population and smaller in area than one with wide streets and a wheeled traffic, and that again will be denser and compacter than one with numerous tubes, trams, and light railways. Every improvement in locomotion forces the <b>suburban</b> <b>ring</b> of houses outward, and relieves the pressure of the centre. Now, this principle of expanding communities holds not only in regard to towns, but also on the agricultural country side. There, also, facilities for the more rapid collection of produce mean finally the expansion and coalescence of what were previously economic unities.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBased on {{the results}} of a PhD dissertation, the paper {{discusses}} the different shrinkage courses in Mulhouse, Roubaix and Saint-Etienne since 1968. The three cities are traditional industrial cities with three different shrinkage developments. In view of these varying situations, the paper analyses the causes and effects of shrinkage through a long-time and dynamic statistical angle. The first analysis is based on a long-time approach of demographic, economic and social changes in the three urban areas (Beauregard, 2009). It reflects on the spatial mix of growth and shrinkage within the areas, between inner cities and <b>suburban</b> <b>rings</b> (Parkinson, 1994; Turok and Edge, 1999; Power and Mumford, 1999). The second statistical analysis is dynamic and leans on inhabitants' residential careers (Authier and al., 2010) between 2003 and 2008. While the first analysis substantiates the conventional results of shrinkage, the second provides new elements concerning the role of employment and economic development in the demographic shrinkage process...|$|R

40|$|The 1990 s saw {{a pickup}} in {{residential}} construction {{not only in}} suburban areas {{but also in the}} central cities of some of the nation’s oldest and largest metropolitan areas.

40|$|TRENDS OF POLICENTRISM AND FRAGMENTATION IN LISBON - In this paper, {{we study}} the transformations of the spatial {{organisation}} of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. The main {{focus is on}} the present restructuring dominated by three main processes. Firstly descentralisation of housing and economic activities, secondly development of new centralities, high status areas with very good accessibility and great attractivity, mainly occupied by office buildings or mixed-used developments (offices, retail, hotel, luxury apartments) in the inner city or close to new suburban highways; and, finally, selective gentrification and re-use of the central city, either by high income housing or modern services. The evolution outlined can achieve the replacement of a strong centralised metropolis with uequal distribution of employment and services between metropolitan core and <b>suburban</b> <b>rings</b> by a new multicentered structure. This evolution goes along with the transmition from the industrial to the post-industrial city that brings fragmentation of the socio-spatial structure with a juxtaposition of territories. In the economic sense the city loses its functional unity made of interdependent spacialised territories. In the social sense this reflects the rise in the number and differentiation due to the increase of opportunities and choices once the position in the labor market is no more sufficient to define social position and people look for and build their identification through goods, places and their symbols...|$|R
40|$|Poverty has {{expanded}} from America’s urban cores to its {{inner and outer}} <b>suburban</b> <b>rings.</b> In the midst of spreading hardship, new opportunities for confronting questions of regional equity are emerging, such as how best to govern our regional spaces {{for the benefit of}} all regional constituents, including the poor, middle class, and affluent. To date, governance theories have proven inadequate to this task. In the parlance of the current regional governance discourse, localists, regionalists, and new regionalists need a framework to make a reality of their seemingly disparate and inconsistent visions of local versus regional interests. Localists champion the autonomy of local governments as the appropriate form of regional management. Regionalists, on the other hand, advocate for mechanisms of regional governance to manage the maintenance and development of regional spaces. While new regionalists have advocated practical steps to eliminate the causes of regional inequities, encouraging more efficient fiscal and land use planning cooperation between local governments in a metropolitan region, new regionalism as a social movement is stalled largely because it has existed as a set of ideals without a framework for effectuating those ideals. This Article introduces a new strategy, regional interest convergence, as a new social justice framework to effectuate new regionalism and revive the movement. Regional interest convergence, a reconceptualization of the interest convergence theory first articulated by Professor Derrick Bell, provides a framework for beginning to address both urban and suburban poverty...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomena}} of residential deconcentration started in Italy during the 1970 s following {{the creation of}} physical infrastructures and a national policy of welfare. In the meanwhile the non residential deconcentration process was partly either the result of market dynamism and of the decisions concerning the location of physical infrastructures. We have also to consider that the historical identity of Italian cities has contributed to slow the process of deconcentration both for residents and for local SME. The two case studies, Rome and Pescara-Chieti, are both in central Italy. The municipality of Rome dominates its monocentric MA; there are, indeed, two major municipalities, Pescara and Chieti, dominating the second polycentric MA. These characteristics influence the process of deconcentration. The two MA are historically connected through the Tiburtina Roman Consular Road, which was, since the 1970 ’s substituted in its functions, by the highway. The two deconcentration phenomena along this axis are not connected, at the moment, {{but there is some}} evidence of possible developments in the future. The two case studies offer an example of small scale deconcentration. In the case of Rome MA, the deconcentrated activities are diffused, especially for the commercial sector, on the city edge and they are strongly influenced by the presence of the Great Ring Road. The deconcentration of the industrial sector mainly concerns the <b>suburban</b> <b>rings.</b> In the case of Pescara-Chieti MA, there is not a trend of deconcentration centre-periphery, but it occurs along the highway and in specific individual locations.

40|$|Both natural {{increase}} and internal migration have played {{roles in the}} shaping of population distribution of Finland since 1900. Far reaching recent changes in the economy have brought about massive shift of jobs from agriculture to manufacturing and services. As a result people have relocated from rural to urban areas. Both natural change and net migration have distinct geographical patterns, resulting in serious depopulation in remote areas {{in the east and}} north of the country. Internal migration benefits the south, the west, coastal areas, urban agglomerations and suburban areas. International migration is a marginal phenomenon in Finland and has little impact on population dynamics. Net migration losses in the past were offset by high {{natural increase}} and in recent decades Finnish emigrants have returned. Urban concentration is a dominant feature of the Finnish migration system. At the subregional level, suburbanisation is visible, but is not as strong as in the overcrowded metropolises of Western Europe. The relationships between migration and size of municipality, migration and population density and migration and urban/rural class of municipalities show that the process of concentration is the strongest force at work in shifting people to urban agglomerations and their <b>suburban</b> <b>rings.</b> Regional patterns of migration show strong transfers of population from north and east to south and to lesser extent to west of the country.

Migration is sex-selective, with a much higher propensity of females to leave remote and rural areas and migrate to urban centres and {{the southern part of the}} country.

40|$|Iron River is a {{community}} in Michigan's relatively depressed Upper Peninsula. In reality, it is five different cities, villages or townships with a total population of around 10, 000 huddled in one relatively compact urbanized area. The depressed economy of this ironmining community led to suggestions that these legal units merge. In this microcosm, there erupted at this time, the same bitter arguments about consolidation which are common when one of America's great cities attempts to annex suburbanites. The smaller <b>suburban</b> units <b>rang</b> with familiar arguments about being swallowed up in a big city, the same arguments one would hear if Chicago proposed to merge {{with a few of}} its suburbs. Thus, what appears to most outsiders as one social and economic community, and certainly is so for many purposes important to its residents, is splintered among five governments for what seem logical reasons to local residents. Those logical reasons which reformers too often have regarded as irrelevant or even pathological, {{are at the heart of}} the problem of resistance to integration in small as well as large communities. Before we can talk very confidently about the future of any urban complex, we must try to understand why what seems to be a single city to outsiders is viewed so often by inhabitants as a variety of units that require legal separateness. I First, let us examine the basis on which an urban complex is viewed by outsiders as a single entity for which a single government would be desirable. Most observers assume this is the case when an urban complex appears to be a single, interdependent, social and economic community. When they see it as having a center at which social and economic decisions are made that affect all parts of the complex, and in turn when they see that the reactions of the parts influence the pattern of decision making at the center, it seems to them a single community. This is the logic of John Dewey: when the indirect consequences of acts of others are recognized and it appears desirable that an attempt be made to regulate them, a public comes into existence. 1 Such a public requires agovernment so that it can shape its own destiny...|$|R
