During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in early 1940, the batik industry greatly declined due to material shortages. The workshops funded by the Japanese however were able to produce extremely fine batiks called Jawa Hokokai. Common motifs of Hokokai includes Japanese cherry blossoms, butterflies, and chrysanthemums.|$|E

25|$|Pashtun {{performers}} remain avid {{participants in}} various physical forms of expression including dance, sword fighting, and other physical feats. Perhaps {{the most common}} form of artistic expression can be seen in the various forms of Pashtun dances. One of the most prominent dances is Attan, which has ancient roots. A rigorous exercise, Attan is performed as musicians play various native instruments including the dhol (drums), tablas (percussions), rubab (a bowed string instrument), and toola (wooden flute). With a rapid circular motion, dancers perform until no one is left dancing, similar to Sufi whirling dervishes. Numerous other dances are affiliated with various tribes notably from Pakistan including the Khattak Wal Atanrh (eponymously named after the Khattak tribe), Mahsood Wal Atanrh (which, in modern times, involves the juggling of loaded rifles), and Waziro Atanrh among others. A <b>sub-type</b> <b>of</b> the Khattak Wal Atanrh known as the Braghoni involves the use of up to three swords and requires great skill.

Twelve native speakers of Japan-ese read aloud twelve sentences that contained various <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> wa and ga. Acoustical analysis of fundamental frequency and pause durations revealed that wa was preceded by a larger fall in fundamental frequency than ga and that wa was frequently followed by a pause, unlike ga. Thematic and contrastive <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> wa were differentiated by pauses as well as fundamental frequency fall.

500|$|Breeders {{introduced}} foreign stallions before {{creating a}} stud {{book for the}} breed. The breed took {{its name from the}} [...] "rich valley of Auxois", where the crossbreeding and selection for the new breed took place. The local mares created from 19th century breeding were crossed with Ardennais and Trait du Nord stallions, sought after for their large size and power, which made them valuable for agricultural work. The birthplace of the breed is around the Cluny Stud, and it was originally considered to be a <b>sub-type</b> <b>of</b> the Ardennais breed.|$|E
500|$|The Andalusian horse {{has been}} known {{historically}} as the Iberian Saddle Horse, Iberian War Horse, Spanish Horse, Portuguese, Peninsular, Extremeño, Villanos, Zapata, Zamoranos, Castilian, and Jennet. The Portuguese name refers {{to what is now}} the Lusitano, while the Peninsular, Iberian Saddle Horse and Iberian War Horse names refer to horses from the Iberian Peninsula as a whole. The Extremeño name refers to Spanish horses from the Extremadura province of Spain and the Zapata or Zapatero name to horses that come from the Zapata family stud. The Villano name has occasionally been applied to modern Andalusians, but originally referred to heavy, crossbred horses from the mountains north of Jaen. The Carthusian horse, also known as the Carthusian-Andalusian and the Cartujano, is a <b>sub-type</b> <b>of</b> the Andalusian, rather than a distinct breed in itself. A common nickname for the Andalusian is the [...] "Horse of Kings". Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano are genetically the same, differing only in the country of origin of individual horses.|$|E
500|$|When {{presented}} for grading and studbook inspection, the heavy-type Dole Gudbrandsdals are tested for pulling power and trotting. [...] In the lighter type, x-rays showing {{the knee and}} lower legs {{to be free of}} defects must be presented, and stallions must have satisfactory results on the track before they may be used for breeding. However, three-year-old stallions may be issued temporary licenses before they begin their racing career if their conformation, breeding, and trotting ability are considered acceptable. Trotting-type mares with proper conformation that are not fast enough during grading may be registered as draft-type Doles. These strict and organized standards have improved the quality of the Dole breed over the past few decades. Although the Dole horse is one of the smallest draft breeds, it shows great pulling power, and is also hardy and agile. They are especially known for their excellent trots, as is shown by the lighter <b>sub-type</b> <b>of</b> the breed. During the late 20th century, interbreeding between the two types became quite common; due to this, the breed became much more uniform in type, with fewer differences between the trotter and draft sections.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Impossible {{is used as}} an {{archetype}} or stock character supervillain. He {{is characterized}} as an evil genius or mad scientist who continually attempts {{to take control of}} the world's population. This is seen as a <b>sub-type</b> <b>of</b> the hero's journey and his calm deconstruction of his own futile, repetitive and self-destructive behaviours is compared to existentialist literature. The supervillains, especially Dr. Impossible, are portrayed as sympathetic characters afflicted with [...] "Malign Hypercognition Disorder", a psychological condition which makes highly intelligent people use their advantages to perform non-virtuous, or evil, actions. Grossman explained that from Dr. Impossible's point of view, he is not inherently evil but rejects societal norms: [...] "it's a matter of integrity — he's sticking to his principles, doing science his own way, pursuing his goals — even if it means the entire world is against him, even if he looks ridiculous in his costume, even if he knows he's going to lose. The superheroes are taking the conformist path, and getting all the applause." [...] From the literary point of view, Grossman believes the supervillains are more interesting characters, [...] "they are usually the most dynamic characters and the most creative. ... Their plans usually start with a great invention, which gives the story all its color and energy. The hero just has to come in and smash it up." [...] Grossman admitted that much of the Dr. Impossible character was inspired by his feelings as a graduate student, [...] "On the one hand, you're supposed to be really smart, and on the other hand, it's a humiliating experience. You're psyched about your intellect and kind of arrogant, but at the same time, you're [...] in the eyes of the world." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines consumer {{attitudes towards}} four <b>SUb-types</b> <b>of</b> interactive digital advertising: internet-based e-and email advertising, and mobile-phone-based SMS- and MMS-type advertising. The differences in attitudes among these four <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> interactive digital advertising are also compared. Data are collected from three universities in Taiwan. Data analysis extracts three attitudinal forms (common factors) towards interactive digital advertising, namely, 'informative', 'entertaining' and 'irritating'. Consumer attitudinal forms towards e-advertising and MMS-type m-advertising are both similar and positive (i. e. informative and less irritating and entertaining). Their attitudinal forms towards email advertising and SMS-type in-advertising are less positive (more irritating and less informative and entertaining). Furthermore, the three attitudinal forms towards the four <b>SUb-types</b> <b>of</b> interactive digital advertising are compared. Consumer 'informative' and 'entertaining' attitudinal forms towards e-advertising and MMS-type m-advertising are similar, while their attitudinal forms towards email advertising and SMS-type m-advertising are equal and lower than towards {{the previous two}} <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> interactive digital advertising.

The study analyzes 60 research articles (30 articles in each language) in terms <b>of</b> <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> lexical cohesion. The study reveals that the order of occurrence in descending order <b>of</b> <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> lexical cohesion is (Rep., Col., Syn., Gen. N., Mer., Hyp., and Ant.) in English data, while the order in Persian data is (Rep., Syn., Col., Ant., Hyp., Mer., Gen. N.). In both data the most frequent sub-types are repetition, collocation, synonymy. In English data the general tendency is towards the use of repetition and collocation but Persian data show the general tendency towards the use of repetition and synonymy. This study might have implications for teachers and researchers {{in the field of}} teaching English as a foreign language {{because of the fact that}} teaching <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> lexical cohesion to foreign language learners will improve the quality of their reading and writing. </p...|$|R
