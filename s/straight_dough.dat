Maize sourdoughs {{were made}} by fermenting maize flour with multiple strains starter culture and with Lactobacillus plantarum. Sourdough fermentation of maize dough brought about a 25 - 26 % increase in loaf volume of maize bread. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a cohesive dough structure in the sourdoughs. Larger cells were also observed in maize breads with maize sourdough. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that maize sourdough had a slightly lower endothermic peak temperature and higher endothermic peak enthalpy than <b>straight</b> maize <b>dough.</b> Rheological analysis showed that maize sourdoughs had a shorter relaxation time. Strain sweep analysis suggested that maize sourdoughs had the lowest elastic modulus, all indicating a softer and less elastic dough. Temperature sweep analysis showed an initial less elastic dough and a final high tan delta, suggesting that the maize dough could withstand gas expansion pressure during baking without crumbling. It appears that improvement in maize bread quality by sourdough fermentation is primarily due to starch granule modification which makes the dough more cohesive, soft and less elastic and improves its ability to trap and withstand {{the pressure of the}} expanding carbon dioxide during fermentation and baking.

5000|$|Prior to 1920, {{there were}} two basic kinds of breads, {{naturally}} leavened French bread, and Vienna bread leavened with cereal press yeast, an early form of baker's yeast. After 1920, when mixing machines became popular among bakers, rural bakers began to make more sponge doughs and city bakers more straight doughs, both replacing sourdough. By the 1930s, <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> had mostly replaced sponge dough, and the terms [...] "French" [...] and [...] "Vienna" [...] breads were used less often. Bakers who continued using older methods were generally unable to compete on a cost basis, and so with [...] "rare exceptions," [...] were limited to local niche markets.|$|E
5000|$|Many breads {{are made}} from a [...] "straight dough", which means {{that all of the}} {{ingredients}} are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising time; others {{are made from}} a [...] "pre-ferment" [...] in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight. On the day of baking, the rest of the ingredients are added, and the process continues as with <b>straight</b> <b>dough.</b> This produces a more flavorful bread with better texture. Many bakers see the starter method as a compromise between the reliable results of baker's yeast and the flavor and complexity of a longer fermentation. It also allows the baker to use only a minimal amount of baker's yeast, which was scarce and expensive when it first became available. Most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories: [...] "poolish" [...] or [...] "pouliche", a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal amounts of flour and water (by weight); [...] "biga", a stiff mixture with a higher proportion of flour; and [...] "pâte fermentée", which is simply a portion of dough reserved from a previous batch.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the high}} cost of wheat {{importation}} in countries where the climatic conditions do not favour its cultivation, alternative sources of bread baking flour are required. Maize is a suitable alternative because it {{is by far the most}} important crop produced in Africa. However, it lacks gluten, the protein that is formed in wheat dough which is responsible for the desirable quality attributes (high loaf volume, soft and open crumb structure) of wheat bread. Therefore the need arises to improve maize bread quality. The effects of three types of non-wheat bread methods on the quality of maize bread were investigated. The first was a traditional sourdough method used in Lesotho for making steamed bread. This involved addition of spontaneously fermenting sorghum malt sourdough (equivalent to 15 % of the total maize flour) and pre-gelatinization of the starch in the maize flour with boiling water. The second was a Food and Agriculture Organization method which involved pre-gelatinization of the starch in 10 % of the maize flour by cooking. The third method was a modern gluten-free sourdough method which involved fermenting 75 % of the maize flour with a multiple strains starter culture or Lactobacillus plantarum plus the natural flora in the maize. The modern sourdough method produced maize bread with a more open crumb structure and a significant increase in loaf volume compared to the other methods. This was probably related {{to the high}} percentage of fermented maize flour in the recipe, which was probably sufficient to modify the dough properties satisfactorily enough to impact positively on the maize bread quality. Based on these findings, the modern sourdough method was investigated further. Maize sourdoughs were prepared (as described) and compared to chemically acidified maize dough. Sourdough maize bread had an approx. 25 - 26 % increase in loaf volume and a more open crumb structure with large gas cells. This showed that the maize bread quality improvement was not due to low pH. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a cohesive dough structure in the sourdoughs. Larger cells and a more uniform crumb structure were also observed in maize breads with maize sourdough. This indicated an improvement in the maize dough properties with sourdough. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that maize sourdough had a slightly lower peak temperature than <b>straight</b> maize <b>dough,</b> an indication of starch modification. Rheological analysis showed that maize sourdough had a shorter relaxation time, an indication that it was less elastic. Strain sweep analysis revealed that maize sourdoughs had the lowest elastic modulus, also indicating a less elastic dough. Temperature sweep analysis showed an initial less elastic dough and a final high tan delta, suggesting that the maize dough could withstand gas expansion pressure during baking without crumbling. The dominant lactic acid bacteria in the sourdoughs were identified as L. plantarum. In the two sourdoughs, the L. plantarum present were gram-positive, catalase negative and exhibited proteolytic activities. However, only the L. plantarum in the multiple strains starter culture fermented maize sourdough exhibited amylolytic activities. It is proposed that proteolytic activity of the L. plantarum degraded the endosperm protein matrix and hydrolysed the proteins soluble in the dough liquid, thereby allowing increased accessibility of water to the starch granules. It is further proposed that the amylolytic activity of the L. plantarum slightly hydrolysed the starch granules, increasing water absorption by the starch granules. It is proposed that improvement in maize bread quality by sourdough fermentation is due to starch modification (increase water accessibility and water absorption by the starch granules due to the proteolytic and amylolytic activities of the dominant lactic acid bacteria in the sourdoughs) which made the dough less elastic. This in-turn improves the ability of the dough to trap and withstand the pressure of the expanding carbon dioxide in the fermenting dough and bread.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of sourdough (indirect bread dough mixing method) on the quality of rye/wheat bread (TYPE 500 wheat flour and whole grain rye flour - 60 : 40) and determine its advantages over the <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> method. Three bread dough mixing methods were used: I - indirect bread dough mixing using flour scalding; II - indirect bread dough mixing without flour scalding; III - <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> mixing. The study involved the monitoring of the following: microbial characterristics of the flour and dough (yeasts and lactic acid bacteria) and of the bread (presence of Enterobacteriaceae, yeasts and moulds); chemical properties of the dough and the bread (pH and degree of acidity); organoleptic attributes of bread (volume, porosity according to Dallman, crumb elasticity, pore structure fineness, bread crumb score, external appearance, crumb appearance, flavour of both the crust and the crumb). The results showed the highest counts of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in the indirect bread dough mixing method using rye flour scalding. The rye/wheat bread made with sourdough had a mild sourish flavour, an intense aroma, a prolonged shelf life, and reduced crumbliness. The study suggests that the technological process of sourdough-type rye/wheat bread making is an important requirement in improving bread quality and assortment that can be used in any bakery facility.

The special features of baking without gluten and possibilities to increase the quality of gluten-free bread were also discussed. The aim of the experimental research was to develop high protein gluten-free oat-based bread. The effect of different protein concentration on structural, textural and sensory properties of gluten-free oat bread was studied. Also the effect of processing method on bread quality was studied by using sourdough technology and <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> technology. Gluten-free oat bread recipe and baking protocol as well as sourdough fermentation conditions were optimized {{on the basis of}} preliminary trials. Oat-based breads with varying protein content were baked by using <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> and sourdough technologies. Reference sample was oat-based bread without added protein. Specific volume, moisture content, texture profile analysis (crumb hardness, chewiness and resilience) and starch retrogradation of gluten-free breads were analysed. For shelf life measurements, breads were stored in plastic bags at room temperature from 1 to 3 days. Sensory profile of bread samples were evaluated on the day of baking by a trained panel. Descriptive analysis method was used. Palatable high protein gluten-free oat-based bread was obtained in this study. Increasing amount of protein improved the crumb structure and shelf life of gluten-free breads. All of the protein supplemented breads had agreeable sensory profile. Sourdough did not further improve the quality of high protein gluten-free bread except for increased aroma intensity.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} and qualitative changes of water-extractable arabinogalactan-peptide (WE-AGP) during a <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> wheat bread-making process in the flour from two wheat varieties Skirlou and Soissons were investigated. The extractability of WE-AGP remains constant or increases slightly {{as a result of}} the bread-making process (increases of 12 % for Skirlou and 10 % for Soissons). This contrasts with the great increase in extractability of the water-extractable arabinoxylan (WE-AX) (29 % for Skirlou and 77 % for Soissons of the initially present WE-AX). No changes in arabinose substitution of WE-AX (0. 47 - 0. 50 for Skirlou, 0. 52 - 0. 54 for Soissons) and WE-AGP (0. 66 - 0. 70 for Skirlou, 0. 69 - 0. 72 for Soissons) occurred during the bread-making process. In contrast to differences found in molecular weight distribution of WE-AX, no differences in molecular weight distribution of WE-AGP as a result of processing were observed. Apparent molecular weights of 2. 4 x 10 (4) and 2. 2 x 10 (4) were found for WE-AGP samples of flour and doughs at different stages of the breadmaking process for Skirlou and Soissons, respectively. The H- 1 NMR spectra (300 MHz, D 2 O, 85 degrees C) of the WE-AGP isolated from flour, dough, and bread fraction were comparable. Taken together, the above data suggest that, unlike what can be observed in gluten agglomeration in dilute systems (Roels, S. P., et al. J. Agric.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{endogenous}} non-starch polysaccharide hydrolysing enzymes on flour non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) was investigated. <b>Straight</b> <b>dough</b> bread-making experiments were performed with three flour samples (cvs. Skirlou, Estica and Soissons) varying in endogenous NSP hydrolysing enzyme activities and/or non-starch polysaccharide contents and structures. Part of the water-unextractable NSP became extractable during the mixing (7 to 12 %) and baking(14 to 15 %) phases. For all three flours, very low levels (0 to 5 %) of water-unextractable NSP were solubilised during fermentation. Since two wheat flours with varying endogenous activities behaved similarly {{it is not}} clear whether this solubilisation was enzymic. Changes in molecular weight distribution of the arabinoxylans during fermentation can in part be ascribed to enzymic hydrolysis. Difficulties associated with the isolation of pure arabinoxylan from dough and bread samples suggest that other phenomena, such as interaction and association with proteins and/or other wheat components, are in play.

40|$|The aim of {{our work}} was to {{optimise}} the whole grain oat baking process {{both in terms of}} bread quality and physiological functionality of oat â-glucan in bread. The flour used in baking was whole grain oat (51 %) and wheat (49 %). A <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> baking process was used. The effects of gluten, water and processing conditions (mixing time, intermediate proof, proof time, proof temperature, and baking temperature) were investigated using response surface methodology. A central composite design was constructed to study the effects of two ingredients and five processing parameters on baking performance. Response variables measured were: specific volume, instrumental crumb hardness (after 2 and 72 h storage), and sensory texture and flavour of crust and crumb. The concentration (McCleary & Codd 1991) and molecular weight distribution of â glucan (Suortti, 1993) were analysed from both flours and bread. The largest specific volume, smallest instrumental hardness of the crumb and best sensory quality was attained by adding 42 % water and 7 % gluten to the dough and mixing it for 4 min. The intermediate proof of 5 min resulted in the softest bread crumb, but 20 gave enhanced specific volume, crust properties and flavour. Optimal proofing conditions were 40 °C and 75 min. The optimal baking temperature was 210 °C. After optimisation, the specific volume of oat bread was 3. 7 cm 3 /g, hardness after 2 h was 0. 14 kg, and after 72 h 0. 3 kg. The sensory quality of the bread was good. The results show that bread containing 51 % whole grain oat can be baked and that good taste and texture as well as long shelf life can be attained by optimizing recipe and processing parameters. In <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> baking about 30 % of the â-glucan of the flour was degraded. The possibilities to reduce the degradation of â- glucan during processing will be studied further.

40|$|The impact {{mechanism}} of endoxylanases in <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> bread-making {{was investigated in}} fractionation-reconstitution experiments. To this end, two European flours with different breadmaking characteristics were separated in gluten, prime starch, a squeegee fraction (SQF), and a water-extractable fraction. Whereas the former fractions contained negligible levels of arabinoxylan (AX), the latter contained, respectively, most of the water-unextractable AX (WU-AX) {{and all of the}} water-extractable AX (WE-AX). In vitro modification with a Bacillus Subtilis endoxylanase allowed controlled solubilization of WU-AX from SQF and controlled degradation of solubilized AX and WE-AX from the water-extractables. It followed from bread-making tests with the reconstituted flours that endoxylanases exert positive loaf volume effects in bread-making by lowering the concentration of WU-AX and increasing that of total soluble AX Limited degradation of WE-AX and significant breakdown of solubilized AX by endoxylanases, on the other hand, resulted in volume lasses when compared to their nondegraded counterparts. The volume increasing effects of endoxylanases are therefore related to their ratio of solubilizing to degrading activity and thus to their substrate specificity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} wheat flour water-extractable {{arabinogalactan}}-peptide (WE-AGP), arabinogalactan from larch wood (LW-AG) and gum arabic from acacia tree (AT-GA) (1. 0 % and 2. 0 % substitution levels) on mixing characteristics of doughs from flour from two wheat Varieties (Torii-ida and Soissons) and the {{volumes of the}} resulting breads were studied. Baking absorption (500 Brabender Units line) decreased {{in the case of}} substitution of a limited proportion of flour (1 % and 2 %) with wheat flour WE-AGP, LW-AG and AT-GX. AT-GA decreased baking absorption less than wheat flour WE-AGP or LW-AG. Extended mixing times were required to obtain optimum Torfrida flour doughs (consistency of 500 Brabender Units) in the case of arabinogalactan(-peptide) substitution. However, this effect was not clear in the case of Soissons flour dough-making. Micro-extension tests on doughs (consistency of 500 Brabender Units and optimum mixing) illustrated that all arabinogalactan(-peptide) s caused a significant increase in maximum resistance to extension and a significant decrease in dough extensibility. The effects were less pronounced in the case of AT-GA substitution. In <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> bread-making, arabinogalactan(-peptide) s caused a slight decrease in bread volume.

40|$|The {{level of}} high {{molecular}} weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in Soissons flour was increased with isolated Soissons HMW-GS (1. 0 - 4. 0 mg/g of flour) by either simple addition or using a previously developed method (Bekes et al. Cereal Chem. 1994, 71, 44 - 50) for incorporation of monomeric glutenin subunits into flour endogenous glutenin polymers. It was demonstrated that the incorporation method, originally developed for Mixograph tests, is equally well-suitable for <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> breadmaking tests, allowing direct extension {{of the effect of}} incorporated glutenin subunits on dough Mixograph mixing properties to their effect on loaf volume. Although the expected dough strengthening effect (increased mixing requirement and tolerance to overmixing) upon incorporation of HMW-GS was indeed clear from the Mixograms, the improved dough properties did not lead to higher loaf volumes. Furthermore, simple addition of unalkylated HMW-GS also strengthened the dough. On the other hand, alkylated Soissons HMW-GS did not improve dough mixing properties. The different effects of alkylated and unalkylated HMW-GS may suggest that even with simple addition unalkylated HMW-GS can be incorporated into flour endogenous glutenin polymers or may point to the importance of free sulfhydryl groups during dough mixing. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Wheat kernel {{associated}} endoxylanases {{consist of}} a majority of microbial endoxylanases and a minority of endogenous endoxylanases. At least part of these enzymes can be expected to end up in wheat flour upon milling. In this study, the contribution of both types of these endoxylanases to changes in the arabinoxylan (AX) population during wheat flour breadmaking was assessed. To this end, wheat flour produced from two wheat varieties with different endoxylanase activity levels, both before and after sodium hypochlorite surface treatment of the wheat kernels, was used in a <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> breadmaking procedure. Monitoring of the AX population during the breadmaking process showed that changes in AX are to a large extent caused by endogenous endoxylanases, whereas the contribution of microbial endoxylanases to these changes was generally very low. The latter points to a limited contamination of wheat flour with microbial enzymes during milling or to an extensive inactivation of these wheat flour associated microbial endoxylanases by endoxylanase inhibitors, present in wheat flour. When all wheat kernel associated microbial endoxylanases were first washed from the kernels and then added to the bread recipe, they drastically affected the AX population, suggesting that they can have a large impact on whole meal breadmaking. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Antifirming {{properties}} of amylases in bread crumb were evaluated in <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> breadmaking {{and related to}} the amylolytically modified starch structure. Amylase properties and action mechanisms determine starch structure in the breads and, hence, how amylopectin recrystallization, starch network formation, water redistribution, and water mobility occur during breadmaking and storage. A bacterial endo-alpha-amylase mainly hydrolyzed the longer starch polymer chains internally. It thus {{reduced the number of}} connections between the crystallites in the starch networks, resulting in a softer bread crumb. However, because the enzyme had only little impact on the outer amylopectin chains, amylopectin recrystallization and the concomitant water immobilization presumably were not hindered. The loss of plasticizing water as a result of recrystallization presumably reduces the flexibility of the gluten network and results in poor crumb resilience. In contrast, in breadmaking, the Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic alpha-amylase acted as an exoacting amylase with more pronounced endoaction at higher temperatures. This enzyme caused extensive degradation of the crystallizable amylopectin side chains and thus limited amylopectin recrystallization and network formation during storage. As a result, it prevented the incorporation of water in the amylopectin crystallites. In this way, the different starch and gluten networks kept their flexibility, resulting in a softer crumb with good resilience. status: publishe...|$|E

The postprandial insulin responses, but not those of glucose, to the 100 % rye breads made with sourdough method were lower than the responses to the refined wheat bread.

Baking performance was evaluated using the <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> method. Protein content (PC), main protein fractions (glutenins, gliadins, albumins-globulins), and mixograph development time (MDT) were significantly influenced by NF treatment and BWL but not by their interaction.

The amount and timing of fertilizer applied to the BWL modified the PC, PSD, PDP, and bread loaf volume. PDP exhibited a larger variation in comparison to the PSD of glutenins. The split application of 150 kg of urea/ha (50 - 50 - 50) to all BWL showed a better loaf volume response than the same amount of urea applied at sowing (150 - 0 - 0). The application of 300 kg of urea/ha to all BWL, either at sowing or at three split applications of 100 kg of urea/ha each, resulted in higher flour unextractable polymeric protein (FUPP).

40|$|Effects {{of three}} ferments, sponge (S), {{refrigerated}} sponge (RS) and spontaneous sour dough (SS), {{with and without}} addition of acids (citric acid, lactic acid and acetic acid) on the characteristics and shelf-life of white bread was studied. Bread samples ranked widely in pH (5. 71 - 3. 47) and total tritatable acid (TTA) (3. 90 - 15. 67 ml NaOH). The SS, having the lowest pH and highest TTA and lactic/acetic ratio gave the bread with the highest volume, good crumb grain and the lowest rate of staling during storage. Further acidification of 20 % SS sample by addition of acids caused lower volume, coarser crumb grain and less typical flavour as well as faster staling. The use of 20 % SS delayed the growth of mold, extending bread shelf-life twofold with respect to that of <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> bread (D).

Fresh S and D breads showed lower enthalpy values (ΔHg) than RS and SS breads, increasing in the latter with percentage of SS added. Addition of organic acids to 20 % SS bread formula decreased ΔHg of fresh bread. During storage ΔHg values of all samples increased sharply in the first five days. The 20 % SS bread underwent the smallest change and the D and S breads the highest ones. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|In this work, the {{application}} of lipase and monoglyceride in fiber enriched pan bread was studied, to verify the possibility of substituting the emulsifier by the enzyme. Initially, the main raw materials (flour and wheat bran) were characterized. The pan breads were produced using the <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> method. A central composite rotational design was used, with two independent variables: i) lipase dosage; and ii) monoglyceride dosage and, in parallel, a control test was carried out (without the addition of lipase and monoglyceride) for comparison. The dependent variables or responses were the quality characteristics of the breads: i) specific volume; ii) sensory acceptance (appearance, texture, aroma and taste); and iii) shelf life evaluated by crumb moisture and firmness after one, four and seven days from baking. Within the ranges studied, {{it was possible to}} verify that only crumb moisture on the fourth and seventh days after processing was influenced by the variation of the lipase and monoglyceride dosages. In the sensory evaluation, it was observed that the average scores attributed to the control breads were lower than the lowest average of the experimental design trials, except for taste and aroma. As {{it was not possible to}} obtain mathematical models for all the responses, Assays 5 (1 % monoglyceride), 7 (25 ppm lipase) and 9 (25 ppm lipase and 1 % monoglyceride) of the experimental design, and the control test, were selected for the evaluation of the results by analysis of variance. In the conditions used and for the dosages of lipase (0 to 50 ppm) and monoglyceride (0 to 2 %) used, the possibility to substitute monoglyceride by lipase in fiber enriched pan bread was verified...|$|E
40|$|In {{diseases}} of the gastrointestinal tract, it is recommended to refrain from food oxidation. Therefore, the inclusion in the diet of bakery products with low acidity {{is important in the}} diet for such patients. One way to reduce the acidity of bread is the use of electric aqueous solution (EAS). Studied the effect of EAS with different values of рН (7. 42; 9. 34; 11. 12) on the properties of dough and quality of bread from wheat flour first grade. The dough is kneaded <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> method. In the fermentation process investigated the change in effective viscosity and titratable acidity. After fermentation the dough is molded, the test workpiece is subjected to proofing and baking. In ready from deliah determined the acidity, moisture content, porosity and specific volume. It is established that all samples of the test there was a decrease of effective viscosity in the fermentation process due to the occurrence of physico-chemical processes. The maximum value of effective viscosity is characterized by the semi-finished product, obtained using EAS рН of which 11. 12 (3474 PA⋅s). It is revealed that the least value of ultimate рН (1. 7 deg) also had a sample on EAS with a рН = 11. 12. The use of catholyte fraction of HRES with the given value of рН allowed to decrease the acidity in the finished product (45. 5 %) compared with the control in the pilot study value was 1. 2 degrees, while in the control to 2. 2. The research concluded that the use of electroactivated aqueous solution suitable for the production of bakery products of low acidity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} substituting wheat flour with defatted Jack bean flour and Jack bean protein concentrate on bread quality. Jack bean flour milled from the seed nibs was defatted with n-hexane {{and part of the}} defatted flour (DJF) extracted in acid medium (pH; 4. 5) for protein concentrate (JPC). Both the DJF and JPC were analysed for nutrient composition, and then used to fortify bread. Five bread samples with 0 %, 10 % and 20 % of DJF or JPC were prepared using <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> procedure, and then analysed for quality characteristics. The DJF and JPC had 28. 8 % and 49. 47 % protein, 46. 44 % and 30. 22 % carbohydrate, 0. 61 % and 1. 00 % crude fibre respectively; and were rich in Ca, Fe, Zn and P. Both DJF and JPC improved quality of bread but JPC conferred better quality. The 20 % DJF and JPC respectively improved protein content of bread from 9. 45 % to 10. 97 % and 11. 16 %, crude fibre from 2. 39 % to 5. 20 % and 5. 32 %, fat from 2. 35 % to 7. 00 % and 6. 55 %, and ash content from 1. 35 % to 2. 05 % and 2. 10 % but decreased carbohydrate content from 72. 12 % to 50. 45 % and 50. 39 % in the bread samples. All the fortified bread samples had acceptable crumb colour, crumb texture, flavour and loaf volume significantly comparable (p> 0. 05) to those of 100 % wheat bread. Thus, defatted Jack bean flour and Jack bean protein concentrate is recommended for use in fortifying bread for higher quality...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{our modern}} life, theburdensof non-communicable {{diseases}} such as obesity, cancer, cardiovasculardisease,and type- 2 diabetes haveincreased. By contrast, life expectancy and also cost of healthcare has increased. Therefore, individuals search other ways to improve or maintain their well-being. Inthis regard, food and pharmaceutical industriesoffer functional foods (FFs) with health promotingand disease-preventing properties. Sesbania grandifloraL. Poiris a small, loosely branching tree alsoknown as the local name,Agathi. Agathibelongs to the Fabaceaefamily, {{and is one of}} the most popular green vegetables andtraditional medicinal plantsof India. The chemical analysis of Sesbania grandifloraleaves reveal it to be a rich source of nutrientsand beneficial bioactive compounds,such as antioxidants and polyphenols. Bread has been regarded as one of the most popular foodfor centuries, as agood source of calories and othernutrients. Bread is traditionally made from wheat flour. The addition of Agathi leaves led to the enhancementof functionality of common bread. Objective: Against the background of thisinformation, the present investigation was undertaken withaclear objective of evaluatingthe effects of the additionof Agathi leaves on the sensory, textural, andbaking characteristics,byexamining their microbial quality on a 5 -daystorage period,at an ambient temperature,in different packaging materials, and assessingthe improvement, if any, in their antioxidant content. Methods: Shade dried Agathi leaf powder was analysedfor proximate,mineral,and phytochemical composition. Bread samples were prepared with ingredients such as yeast, salt, sugar, water,shortening, baking time,temperature using <b>straight</b> <b>dough</b> process,and varying levels ofshade dried Agathi leaves. Physical parameters such as loaf weight, loaf volume,and color values were recorded. Breads were subjected to a sensory evaluation, andin vitroanti-oxidant capacitywas evaluated. Results: Addition of leaves to the plain bread is a means offortification of bread. The leaves ofthe Agathiplant are rich in nutrients, antioxidants and, dietaryfiber. Incorporation of dried leaves to wheat flour shows that the supplemented breads have,in general, enhanced moisture retention capacity, slowerstaling rate, richer antioxidant content, better bakingcharacteristics, and improved sensory properties in termsof color, texture, mouthfeel, and flavor. Shade driedleaves at 10 % level of additionon wheat flour werefound to be the optimum level that offered the highest acceptability of the fortified bread. Conclusion: Results show that the addition ofthe Agathileaf powder bettered the crumb moisture contentwith only a little increase in crumb firmness. A substantialimprovement in sensory characteristics was observed withthe Agathisupplemented breads. A sharp increase in antioxidantcontentwas an important beneficial fortification effectobserved inthe fortified breads. Agathileaf contentof 10 gmwas found to be the optimumlevel that offered the best compromise forthe highest acceptability of the fortified breads...|$|E
