5|$|As First Sea Lord, Battenberg was {{responsible}} to the First Lord for {{the readiness of}} the fleet and the preparation of naval strategy, {{as well as the}} development of a scheme for <b>state</b> <b>insurance</b> of merchant vessels in times of war, which was to prove essential in preventing prohibitive insurance rates that would have stifled British trade.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{also created}} or reorganized several {{government}} agencies. In cooperation with Pennsylvania governor James H. Duff, {{he created the}} Ohio River Sanitation Commission (ORANSCO) to combat pollution in the Ohio River and its tributaries. He curbed fraud in the insurance industry by reorganizing the <b>state</b> <b>Insurance</b> Commission and hiring a national prominent expert to rewrite the state's entire insurance code. To assist the General Assembly in writing more effective and efficient legislation, Clements created the non-partisan Legislative Research Commission, stocked with professionals from various disciplines, to conduct governmental research. He created the Kentucky Agriculture and Industrial Board (the predecessor of the current Kentucky Department of Commerce), which attracted 250 new industries {{to the state and}} created 40,000 new jobs during its first three years. He also created the Kentucky Building Commission to manage and plan all new state buildings. Among the commission's first projects were a new $6million capitol annex and {{the construction of a new}} state fairgrounds. To retain the most qualified government employees, he supported a constitutional amendment that quadrupled the minimum annual salary for state employees from $5,000 to $20,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Laffoon {{sought the}} office of state treasurer. He faced no {{opposition}} in the Democratic primary, but the entire Democratic ticket was defeated in the general election. In 1911, he ran for state auditor, but lost in the primary to Henry Bosworth. That same year, he was elected as one of Hopkins County's delegates to the state Democratic convention. A bill passed {{in the state legislature}} in 1912 created a <b>State</b> <b>Insurance</b> Rating Board under {{the office of}} state auditor, and Bosworth appointed Laffoon chairman of the board due to his experience in the insurance field and as a reward for his loyalty to the party. In 1915, Laffoon sought the post of Commonwealth's Attorney for the Fourth Judicial District, which comprised Hopkins, Caldwell, Crittenden, and Livingston counties. He lost in the primary to J. Elliott Baker, but the Republican candidate, Charles Ferguson, won the general election.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state's major {{political}} offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a <b>state</b> <b>insurance</b> kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal financial gain. In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges but a grand jury refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to confirm or deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the insurance scheme, but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Livestock {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or <b>state</b> <b>insurance.</b> Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation. The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is {{research}} of practice of making financial reserves of the <b>state</b> social <b>insurance</b> in Ukraine and determining their optimal size. The method of study allows finding how the financial reserves ensuring sustainability of the <b>state</b> social <b>insurance</b> over three years (2014, 2015, 2016). Methodology. The {{results of the study}} were obtained after analysing the indicators of the budget of <b>state</b> social <b>insurance</b> funds (2014, 2015, 2016). In the course of research, an analysis and synthesis as methods of theoretical knowledge of phenomena are used. Comparisons and measurements are used as empirical methods for the conducted research. Results of the research showed the lack of uniform methodological principles for the formation of financial reserves of <b>state</b> social <b>insurance,</b> which is confirmed by their various volumes, and the absence of the mandatory creation condition of them. Extrapolating the provisions of Article 14 - 3 of the Budget Code of Ukraine, we propose that the amount of cash in circulation should not exceed 2 % of the budget expenditures of the state social funds, that is, to provide a seven-day need for financing the insurance payments. At the same time, the condition of keeping the amount of cash on hand {{at the end of the}} period (year) should become mandatory. Practical implications. For conducting research and substantiation of relevant conclusions, the indicators of budgets of the <b>state</b> social <b>insurance</b> funds of Ukraine for three years are analysed (2014, 2015, 2016). Value/originality. A step that will balance the financial resources of <b>state</b> social <b>insurance</b> is the need to introduce uniform requirements for the formation of financial reserves of <b>state</b> social <b>insurance</b> funds. The proposed measures will enable to make more manageable the system of the <b>state</b> social <b>insurance</b> funds in Ukraine...|$|R
