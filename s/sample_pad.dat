5000|$|The first element (the <b>sample</b> <b>pad)</b> acts as {{a sponge}} and holds an excess of sample fluid. Once soaked, the fluid migrates to the second element (conjugate pad) in which the {{manufacturer}} has stored the so-called conjugate, a dried format of bio-active particles (see below) in a salt-sugar matrix that contains everything to guarantee an optimized chemical reaction between the target molecule (e.g., an antigen) and its chemical partner (e.g., antibody) that has been immobilized on the particle's surface. While the sample fluid dissolves the salt-sugar matrix, it also dissolves the particles and in one combined transport action the sample and conjugate mix while flowing through the porous structure. In this way, the analyte binds to the particles while migrating further through the third capillary bed. This material has one or more areas (often called stripes) where a third molecule has been immobilized by the manufacturer. By the time the sample-conjugate mix reaches these strips, analyte has been bound on the particle and the third 'capture' molecule binds the complex. After a while, when more and more fluid has passed the stripes, particles accumulate and the stripe-area changes color. Typically {{there are at least}} two stripes: one (the control) that captures any particle and thereby shows that reaction conditions and technology worked fine, the second contains a specific capture molecule and only captures those particles onto which an analyte molecule has been immobilized. After passing these reaction zones the fluid enters the final porous material, the wick, that simply {{acts as a}} waste container.|$|E

30|$|The {{lateral flow}} test strip was {{composed}} of <b>sample</b> <b>pad,</b> conjugate pad, NC membrane, and absorbent pad, and all parts were pasted on a PVC baking (Fig.  1 b). The <b>sample</b> <b>pad</b> was saturated with PBS containing 0.1  % Tween- 20 (v/v) and dried at room temperature. The prepared QD-labeled anti-CA 72 - 4 mAb (CC 49) was applied into the conjugate pad, dried at 37  °C overnight and stored at 4  °C. To prepare the test line and control line, Biodot BJQ 3000 model XYZ 3200 was used. A solution of anti-CA 72 - 4 mAb (B 72.3, 2  mg/mL) was immobilized on NC membrane as a test line. The goat anti-mouse IgG was immobilized at a concentration of 1  mg/mL as a control line. After immobilization, the NC membrane was dried at 37  °C for 1  h and then blocked with PBS containing 1  % BSA (w/v). Absorbent pad was not treated. The <b>sample</b> <b>pad,</b> conjugate pad, coated membrane, and absorbent pad were sequentially laminated and pasted to a PVC backing pad with proper overlaps {{to ensure that the}} testing solution could migrate through the whole test strip.

40|$|Introduction: Careful {{planning}} {{on health care}} may {{prevent the spread of}} disease and reduce theexpense for treatment. Regarding the importance of health care in the clinical centers includingphysiotherapy clinics, {{this study was designed to}} investigate the rate of bacterial contamination ofelectrotherapy’s pads which use in the physiotherapy clinics of Semnan University of Medical Sciences(Iran). Material and Methods: 20 electrotherapy’s <b>pads</b> were <b>sampled</b> from three physiotherapy clinics. Inorder to find any contamination, the samples were cultured in the Medical School’s microbiologylaboratory. A questionnaire was used to collect data about the method of washing and sterilizing used inthe physiotherapy clinics. Results: The laboratory results showed all <b>sampled</b> <b>pads</b> were infected, while different pattern ofcontamination were seen among clinics. Normal skin flora of bacteria was found in the sampled padsfrom two clinics that used normal washing method and Whitex sterilizing method, while more varieties ofcontamination including; Klebsiella, Serratia and Enterobacteria were found in the other clinic that usedjust normal washing method. Conclusion: The results indicated that the all <b>sampled</b> <b>pads</b> were contaminated and this could beconsidered as a potential factor for transfer contamination between patients and therapists. These resultsconfirm the importance of using substituting methods such as disposable pad, sterile electrolyte jell, andor using standard sterilizing method to disinfect the electrotherapy pads. More research is needed tocontrol and prevent the ways of transfer contaminations in the physiotherapy clinics...|$|R
