Supposedly, the liner started to <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water before Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before it slid out of reach. In 1954, Queen Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake.|$|E
5|$|George Eastham, who had {{previously}} been Waddington's assistant, was appointed as manager in March 1977, but the club's <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Second Division in 1976–77 season proved unstoppable. Eastham did not last long, leaving in January 1978 after only 10 months in charge. The club's misery was compounded by a defeat to non-league Blyth Spartans in the FA Cup shortly afterwards. Alan Durban, arriving from Shrewsbury Town, {{was selected as the}} club's new manager in February 1978. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in his first full season, 1978–79, with a third-place finish. After consolidating the club's position in the First Division, Durban left for Sunderland in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E

25|$|Running plays a {{much larger}} role in {{baseball}} because of the low scoring; also, players on the batting team must run much further to score a run, because runners may remain in play (that is, on the bases) without scoring, and because baserunners can advance to the next base before the ball is hit again (steal the base) {{as soon as the}} ball is live. Base stealing often requires sliding, in which the runner throws himself to the ground to avoid being tagged or over-running the base. The runner may also deliberately <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fielder at the base he is trying to steal to keep him from catching the ball or to disrupt a double play. At home plate the runner often will simply, and legally, run into a catcher who is blocking the baseline but who does not have the ball (a defensive player may not impede the runner unless he has the ball or {{is in the process of}} catching it).|$|E

Kimi Räikkönen was equally displeased, complaining about the rules concerning driving standards.

2500|$|There was a BCS {{controversy}} in the remaining at-large team that was selected {{to play in the}} BCS bowl games. The California Golden Bears expected to get the invite, having only lost one game to the top-ranked and undefeated Trojans. Meanwhile, the Texas Longhorns had lost only one game as well - to the #2 and undefeated Oklahoma Sooners. In the 2004 NCAA Division I-A football rankings on November 27, Cal was in the #4 BCS position and Texas was #5. Texas remained idle the next Saturday, but Cal had defeated the Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles in a makeup game from Hurricane Ivan on December 4. Going into the game, the Golden Bears were made aware that while margin of victory did not affect computer rankings, it did affect human polls and just eight voters changing their vote could affect the final standings. In a dramatic twist, Texas, who had been left out of the BCS the year before because of the Oklahoma loss in the Big 12 championship, got enough voters to change their mind in the final vote and more computer points to <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> BCS #4 slot. When the December 4 rankings came out, Texas was in the #4 BCS position and Cal was in the #5 position. Texas edged California out of the #4 spot by a mere [...]0102 points. The final poll positions had been unchanged with Cal at #4 AP, #4 coaches, and #6 computers polls and Texas at #6 AP, #5 coaches, and #4 computer polls.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{programme}} {{transmitted by}} the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC Horizon broadcast on 12 October 2000, two geologists (Day and McGuire) cited this crack {{as proof that}} half of the Cumbre Vieja had moved towards the Atlantic Ocean (Day et al.; 1999, and Ward and Day, 2001). They postulate that this process was driven by the pressure caused by the rising magma heating water trapped within the structure of the island. They hypothesised that during a future eruption, the western flank of the Cumbre Vieja, with a mass of approximately 1.5 x1015 kg, could <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ocean. This could then potentially generate a giant wave which they termed a [...] "megatsunami" [...] around - high in the region of the islands. The wave would radiate out across the Atlantic and inundate much of the eastern seaboard of North America about 7 hours later, many of the islands in the Caribbean and northern coasts of South America between six and eight hours later. They estimate that the tsunami will have waves possibly [...] or higher causing massive devastation along the coastlines. Modelling suggests that the tsunami could inundate up to [...] inland – depending upon topography. The basis for Ward and Day (2001) modelling the collapse of a much larger portion of the western flank than that that the currently visible surface crack indicates as being potentially unstable, was based on geological mapping by Day et al.; (1999). In this paper they argue that {{a large part of the}} western flank has been constructed in the scar of a previous collapse and therefore sits upon unstable debris.|$|E

2500|$|The 1914 {{collection}} by Frank Thomas Bullen, Songs of Sea Labour, {{differed from}} the work of writers such as Masefield in having a more practical, rather than romantic, tone. Bullen, an Englishman, was an experienced shantyman, who sailed during the heyday of shanties to ports in the Southern U.S. and the Caribbean. He took a firm stance that only true work songs should be included in his collection, thus resisting the temptation to let shanties <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> genres of ballads or other off-duty songs. (Pressure of his publisher forced him to include two sea songs, clearly demarcated, {{at the end of the}} book.) And rather than shape the shanties to appear as narrative pieces, he noted that, since most shanties would usually be improvised, it would be disingenuous to present more than one or two sample verses. As for his framing of the genre's origins, Bullen stated his belief that, [...] "he great majority of these tunes undoubtably emanated from the negroes of the Antilles and the Southern states, a most tuneful race if ever there was one, men moreover who seemed unable to pick up a ropeyarn without a song…" [...] And Bullen's musicologist editor, Arnold, claimed, [...] "he majority of the Chanties are Negroid in origin…" [...] Bullen's insistence on including only true work songs in the collection meant that he likely omitted songs—generally those for heaving tasks, like capstan work—which had been easily borrowed from the land-based traditions of various nations. The effect of including only the most exclusively work-oriented songs meant that a higher percentage of African-American songs were represented.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{practice}} sessions—both on Saturday morning—were held {{before the}} late afternoon race. The first session ran for 45 minutes and the second lasted half an hour. Both practice sessions took place in dry and warm weather conditions. Di Grassi used the full [...] available to him and recorded the first practice session's fastest lap at one minute and 22.451 seconds, almost 1.2 seconds faster than Bird in second and Vergne third. Buemi was fourth-fastest, ahead of Nico Prost and Rosenqvist. Sarrazin, Mitch Evans, Daniel Abt and Nelson Piquet Jr. rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The track's surface caught several drivers off guard after locking their tyres, causing them to <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> run-off areas, while multiple cars were affected by oversteer. Abt broke the left-front rim on his car following an collision the barriers lining the track. In the second practice session, Prost was the quickest driver {{with a time of}} one minute and 22.180 seconds; Vergne was second and Rosenqvist placed third. Sarrazin was fourth-fastest; Heidfeld was fifth and Bird took sixth. Loïc Duval was seventh-fastest, Robin Frijns eighth and the two NextEV cars of Oliver Turvey and Piquet completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. During the session where di Grassi and Adam Carroll skidded under braking on the dusty surface and slid into the track's run-off areas, Sarrazin stopped at the pit lane exit but restarted his car without external aid. Buemi glanced the Bus Stop chicane inside barrier, and speared straight into the exit wall at high speed. Buemi was unhurt and exited his car without external assistance. Because his vehicle was significantly damaged, he was forced to use his second car for qualifying. The crash prompted the session to prematurely end five minutes before it was due to conclude as there was damage to the barrier and debris was strewn across the circuit. e.Dams-Renault mechanics worked for the next five hours to build a new car around a spare monocoque.|$|E
