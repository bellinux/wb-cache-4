5|$|By 1982 16 {{per cent}} of Yorkshire's public houses {{were tied to}} Stones. Bass closed the Cannon Brewery in April 1999 {{with the loss of}} 57 jobs. Bass blamed the closure on the steep decline in sales of cask {{conditioned}} beers (nationally there had been a 14 per cent decline in sales of cask beer over the previous 12 months) which the brewery produced. The brewer realised £1 million in efficiency savings by closing the brewery. The Campaign for Real Ale blamed the brewery's closure on Bass' failure to promote their cask conditioned products. As well as Stones Bitter, the Cannon brewed the small scale Bass Special, Bass Light and Bass Mild brands from the mid-1990s as declining Stones volumes left the brewery with <b>spare</b> <b>capacity.</b> Bass Light and Bass Mild had been sold in the Sheffield area as Stones Mild and Stones Dark Mild respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Bayan {{class was}} a group of four armored cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy around the {{beginning}} of the 20th century.

The ship participated in several of the early naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, and provided naval gunfire support for the Imperial Russian Army until she struck a mine. Bayan was trapped in harbor during the subsequent Siege of Port Arthur, and was sunk by Japanese artillery. She was salvaged and put into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy with the name of Aso. She mostly served as a training ship before she was converted into a minelayer in 1920. The ship was sunk as a target in 1932.|$|E

5|$|Manchester Airport {{serves as}} the main {{international}} hub for Northern England and is the busiest airport anywhere in the UK outside London, handling 25.6 million people in 2016. In total, there are seven international airports in the North; these are (in descending order of passenger traffic) Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool John Lennon, Leeds Bradford, Doncaster Sheffield, Humberside and Durham Tees Valley. Many of these airports were developed during the boom in low-cost air travel during the early 2000s, but have suffered since the Great Recession – Durham Tees Valley is running at just 3% of its maximum capacity, and Blackpool Airport closed as an international airport in 2014. The devolution of Air Passenger Duty to Scotland represents a further possible threat to Northern English airports, allowing Scottish airports to offer cheaper flights than their English rivals. Few spoke flights operate between Northern airports and the national hubs at Heathrow and Gatwick, putting further strain on the smaller Northern airports and forcing connecting passengers to travel via continental European airports.

40|$|Despite {{the high}} {{throughput}} and low complexity achieved by input scheduling based on Birkhoff-von-Neumann (BvN) decomposition; {{the performance of}} the BvN switch becomes less predictable when the input traffic is bursty. In this paper, we propose a deflection-compensated BvN (D-BvN) switch architecture to enhance the quasi-static scheduling based on BvN decomposition. The D-BvN switches provide capacity guarantee for virtual circuits (VCs) and deflect bursty traffic when overflow occurs. The deflection scheme is devised to offset the excessive buffer requirement of each VC when input traffic is bursty. The design of our conditional deflection mechanism is {{based on the fact that}} it is unlikely that the traffic input to VCs is all bursty at the same time; most likely some starving VCs have <b>spare</b> <b>capacities</b> when some other VCs are in the overflow state. The proposed algorithm makes full use of the <b>spare</b> <b>capacities</b> of those starving VCs to deflect the overflow traffic to other inputs and provide bandwidth for the deflected traffic to re-access the desired VC. Our analysis and simulation show that this deflection-compensated mechanism can support BvN switches to achieve close to 100 % throughput of offered load even with bursty input traffic, and reduces the average end-to-end delay and delay jitter. Also, our result indicates that the packet out-of-sequence probability due to deflection of overflow traffic is negligible, thus only a small re-sequencing buffer is needed at each output port...|$|R

40|$|Amla {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} plants in Indian traditional medicine and has been shown to improve various age-related disorders while decreasing oxidative stress. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a proposed cause of aging through elevated oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the effects of Amla on mitochondrial function in C 2 C 12 myotubes, a murine skeletal muscle cell model with abundant mitochondria. Based on cell flux analysis, treatment with an extract of Amla fruit enhanced mitochondrial <b>spare</b> respiratory <b>capacity,</b> which enables cells to overcome various stresses. To further explore the mechanisms underlying these effects on mitochondrial function, we analyzed mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant systems, both proposed regulators of mitochondrial <b>spare</b> respiratory <b>capacity.</b> We found that Amla treatment stimulated both systems accompanied by AMPK and Nrf 2 activation. Furthermore, we found that Amla treatment exhibited cytoprotective effects and lowered reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cells subjected to t-BHP-induced oxidative stress. These effects were accompanied by increased oxygen consumption, suggesting that Amla protected cells against oxidative stress by using enhanced <b>spare</b> respiratory <b>capacity</b> to produce more energy. Thus we identified protective effects of Amla, involving activation of mitochondrial function, which potentially explain its various effects on age-related disorders...|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{to define}} the blood {{hemostatic}} potential in patients with chronic coronary heart disease and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Subjects and methods. The investigation {{is based on the}} in-depth dynamic clinicobiochemical study of 43 patients who has undergone surgical myocardial revascularization under extracorporeal circulation. Ten current standardized laboratory tests were used to evaluate the hemostatic system. At the stages of the investigation, the parameters of the latter were determined and the blood hemostatic potential was estimated in the patients with coronary heart disease. Results. The investigation has indicated that in patients with chronic heart disease, hypercoagulation was compensated due to the changes in the anticoagulation and fibrinolytic systems. In patients with the acute coronary syndrome, the indices of the external and internal mechanisms of coagulation were in the normal physiological range at all the stages of the investigation, even at its stage 3 whereas the parameters, such as the levels of soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC), fibrinogen, and D-dimers, suggest thrombinemia and activated coagulation. Conclusion. The absence of activation of the external and internal coagulation pathways with the elevated level of markers of activated coagulation of SFMC and D-dimers in patients with ACS is not that of activation, as such. The patients of this group show a reduction in coagulation factors due to their uptake for the stabilization of the functional status of the hemostatic system. The investigation has demonstrated that in patients with chronic coronary heart disease, the <b>spare</b> <b>capacities</b> of the hemostatic system are higher due to no deficit of individual coagulation factors and to the higher <b>spare</b> <b>capacities</b> of the fibrinolytic system.

25|$|With {{few options}} left, the Commissioners built a steam pumping station at Arram Beck in 1868. This was not successful, as the low {{banks of the}} Hull meant {{that there was little}} <b>spare</b> <b>capacity,</b> and the pumped water would often return to the drain because of the {{overfall}} near Grovehill. Next they suggested to the Holderness Drainage that if they jointly dredged the Hull, they could use the mud to raise the banks {{on both sides of the}} river, but the Driffield Navigation objected, and little dredging took place. Finally, the impasse was broken in 1880. The Commissioners obtained a new Act of Parliament, which allowed them to dredge the river from the Driffield Navigation to the Old Harbour. They had to alter the lock at Hempholme, to allow for the lower water levels, but the restrictions on the height of the banks and the necessity of the overfall, imposed by the 1798 Act, were removed. By early 1883, most of the dredging had been done and the banks had been raised. The Arram Beck pumping station, and another at Hempholme, started working, and further south, the new river levels enabled a new steam pumping station to be erected at Dunswell by the Beverley and Skidby Drainage. Regular flooding of the Beverley and Barmston level was effectively ended.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a non-iterative, distributed model predictive control (MPC) algorithm suitable for managing water-level references for large-scale automated irrigation channels {{to ensure the}} satisfaction of water-level and flow constraints. This algorithm is developed by first introducing the concept of <b>spare</b> supply <b>capacity,</b> which allows constraint information to be shared between serially-connected subsystems. Exact and approximate methods for calculating <b>spare</b> supply <b>capacity</b> are presented. A solution of the finite-horizon optimal control problem incorporating the computed <b>spare</b> supply <b>capacity</b> is then obtained for every subsystem. The collection of solutions obtained is shown to be “mutually feasible” {{in the sense that}} they describe a suboptimal solution of the large-scale problem. The computational complexity of the resulting distributed MPC algorithm is approximately linear in the number of control gates, making it potentially more efficient than a centralized MPC algorithm for long irrigation channels. A simulation investigation of part of an automated irrigation channel is presented which compares the proposed distributed MPC algorithm to existing MPC methods. This simulation investigation finds that while the proposed algorithm is successful in satisfying the imposed constraints, it yields higher peak gate flow commands than a centralized MPC controller. This is consistent with the trade-off of computational complexity for optimality exploited in moving from MPC to distributed MPC...|$|R
