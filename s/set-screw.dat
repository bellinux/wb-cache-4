50|$|Clamp-style shaft collars are {{designed}} {{to solve the problems}} associated with the <b>set-screw</b> collar. They come in one- and two-piece designs. Instead of protruding into the shaft, the screws act to compress the collar and lock it into place. The ease of use is maintained with this design and there is no shaft damage. Since the screws compress the collar, a uniform distribution of force is imposed on the shaft, leading to a holding power that is nearly twice that of <b>set-screw</b> collars.|$|E

Seeking a safer, more efficient connection method, Marr, {{working in his}} home workshop, developed the first pressure-type wire connector.

40|$|Many {{concepts}} {{are able to}} initiate an increase in resource productivity in enterprises and supply chains – although some of these approaches do not directly address resource efficiency. From these instruments, we derived seven important <b>set-screws,</b> pointing at the most important starting points for resource productivity. Considering the differences of the examined <b>set-screws</b> {{in general and of}} the approaches lying in the background in particular, the existing portfolio of instruments seems broad enough to successfully implement instruments aiming at an increase of resource efficiency in the enterprises.

50|$|The screws {{used in the}} Flexowriter were unique, having large flat {{heads with}} a very narrow {{screwdriver}} slot and a unique thread size and pitch. This {{may have been a}} conscious decision. Another reader found that standard 4-40UNC threads appear to fit some of the cover-attachments; internally, the headless <b>set-screws</b> require fluted Bristol keys, which are not commonly available in Great Britain.|$|R

5000|$|Speed Lock (1930): Frank Burton {{replaced}} Johnson's military-style compound-motion trigger, {{hung from}} the sear, with a new trigger with a low pivot and rear sear notch, reducing trigger travel by 75% and providing for <b>set-screw</b> pull-weight adjustment. In addition, Burton redesigned the firing pin so as to reduce its travel from approximately [...]5" [...] (12mm) to [...]125" [...] (3mm): all of {{which resulted in a}} much faster lock time and greater accuracy. At this time the original model's knurled cocking-piece disappeared, replaced by a short trapezoidal boss. This and all subsequent M52 actions cocked on opening, like a Mauser. Burton carefully designed the Speed Lock to fit the existing receiver and bolt body without modification. Winchester for some years offered a conversion kit for older [...] "slowlock" [...] 52s.|$|E

5000|$|The basic {{shape of}} the heaters is a disk with each side an {{extremely}} shallow cone. The essential structure consists of two large discs of pressed steel clamped between chrome-plated grilles. This simple and lightweight construction made the units easily portable. The heater is mounted on slim triangular chrome-plated legs, and has white handles to either side made from stay-cool compression-moulded urea-formaldehyde plastic. The internal components can be easily accessed by {{the removal of the}} four <b>set-screws</b> underneath the handles, after which the top grille and back panel simply lift off.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanism}} {{has been}} designed to apply the loads (the stirring and the resection forces and torques) in self-reacted friction stir welding. This mechanism differs somewhat from mechanisms used in conventional friction stir welding, as described below. The tooling needed to apply the large reaction loads in conventional friction stir welding can be complex. Self-reacted friction stir welding has become popular in the solid-state welding community as a means of reducing the complexity of tooling and to reduce costs. The main problems inherent in self-reacted friction stir welding originate in the high stresses encountered by the pin-and-shoulder assembly that produces the weld. The design of the present mechanism solves the problems. The mechanism includes a redesigned pin-and-shoulder assembly. The welding torque is transmitted into the welding pin by a square pin that fits into a square bushing with <b>set-screws.</b> The opposite or back shoulder is held in place by a Woodruff key and high-strength nut on a threaded shaft. The Woodruff key reacts the torque, while the nut reacts the tensile load on the shaft...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Object To {{compare the}} Sliding with Non-sliding lag screw of a gamma {{nail in the}} {{treatment}} of A 1 and A 2 AO-OTA intertrochanteric fractures. Materials and methods 80 patients were prospectively collected. In each group, AO/OTA 31 -A were classified into group A. AO/OTA 31 -A 2. 1 was classified as group B. We classified the A 2. 2 and A 2. 3 as group C. According to the <b>set-screw</b> locking formation of Gamma-III, the cases were randomly allocated to Sliding subgroup and Non-sliding subgroup in A, B and C groups. Follow-ups were performed 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results In the Sliding group, the bone healing rate 3, 6, 12 months postoperatively reached 85. 00 %, 97. 50 %, 100 % in group A, B and C. Meanwhile, in Non-sliding group, postoperatively, bone healing rate were 90. 00 %, 95. 00 % and 97. 50 % in group A, B and C, respectively. Both differences were not significant. Lower limb discrepancy between Sliding and Non-sliding pattern was significantly different in group C which represent fracture types of AO/OTA 31 -A 2. 2 and A 2. 3 (0. 573 ± 0. 019 mm in Non-sliding group, 0. 955 mm ± 0. 024 mm in Sliding group, P Conclusions As a result, we can conclude that the sliding distance is minimal in Gamma nails and it is related to the comminuted extent of the intertrochanteric area in A 1 and A 2 AO-OTA intertrochanteric fractures. For treating these kinds of fractures, the sliding of the lag screw of an Gamma nail does not improve any clinical results and in certain cases, such as highly comminuted A 1 and A 2 fractures, can therefore even benefit from a locked lag screw by tightening the <b>set-screw.</b> </p...|$|E
30|$|The {{specimens}} {{were then}} instrumented according to group using the Gamma 3 Cephalomedullary nail system (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ, USA). A surgeon {{trained in the}} implantation of these treatment techniques performed all surgical procedures in general accordance with the Instructions for Use Guidelines. Proximally, lag screws {{were placed in the}} center–center position, as previously described by Baumgartner, for all treatments (Baumgaertner et al. 1995). Intramedullary nail and lag screw angles were measured for each femur. The proximal <b>set-screw</b> was placed to allow sliding of the lag screw. In the locked group, a single distal interlocking screw in the dynamic position was used. Anterior to posterior (A-P) and lateral radiographs were obtained prior to mechanical testing to insure proper implant placement and to measure tip-apex distance (TAD). All TADs were less than 25  mm.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A compact 20 MeV linac with an RF laser-driven {{electron}} gun {{will be used}} to drive a high-gain (10 cm gain length). 10. 6 pm wavelength FEL amplifier, operating in the SASE mode. Satumus will mainly study FEL physics in the high-gain regime, including start-up from noise, optical guiding, sidebands, saturation, and superradiance, with emphasis on the effects important for future short wavelength operation of FEL’s. The hybrid undulator was designed and built at the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in the U. S. S. R. The primary magnetic flux is provided by C-shaped iron yokes, where between the poles thin blocks of neodymium-iron-boron magnets are placed to provide additional magnetic flux along the undulator axis, The field strength is adjusted by moving the thin Nd-Fe-B blocks on a <b>set-screw</b> mount. The initial assembly will have forty periods, each l&m long. The gap distance between the “yoke ” pole-pieces is fixed at 5 mm. The undulator field has been measured, yielding an on axis peak value of 6. 6 kGauss, which closely matches computer simulations. Table 1. Satumus design parameters...|$|E
