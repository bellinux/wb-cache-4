50|$|One {{particular}} {{species with}} a known life cycle is the unnamed Hematodinium parasite taken from host Nephrops norvegicus. Appleton and Vickerman’s (1998) in vitro experiments describe {{the fusion of}} macrodinospores and microdinospores to produce filamentous trophonts that form colonies known as ‘Gorgonlocks.’ Next, these Gorgonlocks either progress into ‘clump’ colonies, or they become an interconnected plasmodial colony known as an arachnoid trophont. The arachnoid trophont enlarges to form an arachnoid sporont, which enters sporogony to produce sporoblasts. <b>Sporogenesis</b> follows in which sporoblasts develop into macro- and microspores, coming full circle with the life cycle. Appleton and Vickerman (1998) suggest that the life stage that scientists often encounter Hematodinium sp. is sporogony. However, other researchers oppose their proposition as trophic stages {{have been found in}} other hosts (Meyers et al., 1987).|$|E
5000|$|Many {{multicellular}} organisms {{form spores}} during their biological life cycle {{in a process}} called <b>sporogenesis.</b> Exceptions are animals and some protists, who undergo meiosis immediately followed by fertilization. Plants and many algae {{on the other hand}} undergo sporic meiosis where meiosis leads to the formation of haploid spores rather than gametes. These spores grow into multicellular individuals (called gametophytes in the case of plants) without a fertilization event. These haploid individuals give rise to gametes through mitosis. Meiosis and gamete formation therefore occur in separate generations or [...] "phases" [...] of the life cycle, referred to as alternation of generations. Since sexual reproduction is often more narrowly defined as the fusion of gametes (fertilization), spore formation in plant sporophytes and algae might be considered a form of asexual reproduction (agamogenesis) despite being the result of meiosis and undergoing a reduction in ploidy. However, both events (spore formation and fertilization) are necessary to complete sexual reproduction in the plant life cycle.|$|E
50|$|The {{nucellus}} (plural: nucelli) {{is part of}} {{the inner}} structure of the ovule, forming a layer of diploid (sporophytic) cells immediately inside the integuments. It is structurally and functionally equivalent to the megasporangium. In immature ovules, the nucellus contains a megasporocyte (megaspore mother cell), which undergoes <b>sporogenesis</b> via meiosis. In gymnosperms, three of the four haploid spores produced in meiosis typically degenerate, leaving one surviving megaspore inside the nucellus. Among angiosperms, however, a wide range of variation exists in what happens next. The number (and position) of surviving megaspores, the total number of cell divisions, whether nuclear fusions occur, and the final number, position and ploidy of the cells or nuclei all vary. A common pattern of embryo sac development (the Polygonum type maturation pattern) includes a single functional megaspore followed by three rounds of mitosis. In some cases, however, two megaspores survive (for example, in Allium and Endymion). In some cases all four megaspores survive, for example in the Fritillaria type of development (illustrated by Lilium in the figure) there is no separation of the megaspores following meiosis, then the nuclei fuse to form a triploid nucleus and a haploid nucleus. The subsequent arrangement of cells is similar to the Polygonum pattern, but the ploidy of the nuclei is different.|$|E
50|$|Unilocular sporangia develop {{scattered}} {{over most of}} the thallus except in the areas immediately below growing tips. When <b>sporogenesis</b> occurs close to the tips of branches the apical cells are generally no longer active. Sporangial initials are from the cells forming the thallus surface. They can be distinguished at an early stage by their size and by the presence of numerous electron transparent vesicles. The adjacent vegetative cells (any of the cells of a plant or animal except the reproductive cells) are smaller in size and are filled almost completely with densely packed physodes (any of various vesicular intracellular inclusions of brown algae that are of uncertain constitution and function). As the sporangium develops and enlarges further the nucleus and chloroplasts divide a number of times. The sporangium is egg-shaped and lies within the cortical (cells in the cortex) and medullary (or pith) cells. It is slightly narrower where it touches the surface. In the beginning the nuclei are in a central position, each being closely linked with a chloroplast. In the course of the first few divisions the chloroplast loses its characteristic star-shaped shape and the pyrenoid becomes smaller and occupies a side position. Subsequently the nuclei are concentrated near the outer areas of the cytoplasm, and flagella appear to divide into separate types within vesicles before the division of individual meiospores (spores produced by meiosis). The chloroplasts meanwhile have largely regained a star-shaped form with a central pyrenoid. Mature sporangia appear as dark-brown spots on the thallus. The entire contents of a sporangium are discharged together with a mass of sticky material. As it slowly disperses the meiospores swim free. The side biflagellate (has two flagellate) meiospores contain one chloroplast with an eyespot (eyespot apparatus) and are capable of motion for {{a relatively short period of}} no more than 15 min. Upon settling they become spherical, measuring 6.5-11 gm in diameter.Each meiospore contains one to four relatively large lipid bodies in addition to the more numerous, smaller physodes.|$|E

The spores thus formed possess the same heat resistance as spores formed {{in a complete}} growth medium. Various factors influencing <b>sporogenesis</b> in water are described. Glucose in low concentration completely suppresses <b>sporogenesis</b> under these conditions and the suppression is relieved {{by the presence of}} ammonia as an exogenous source of nitrogen. Various amino acid and purine antimetabolite analogues inhibit <b>sporogenesis</b> and their inhibitory effects are completely reversed by much smaller amounts of the corresponding metabolites. <b>Sporogenesis</b> is thus regarded as a de novo synthesis of spore proteins from preexisting endogenous (enzyme) proteins. Cells low in protein fail to sporulate and the capacity of the cell to adaptively attack maltose and trehalose is strongly interfered with after the cell is irreversibly committed to sporulation, but not before that. Evidence is advanced supporting the hypothesis that <b>sporogenesis</b> is an endogenous process which commences when the supply of exogenous energy and carbon is depleted. It utilizes low molecular weight nitrogenous substances liberated by the degradation of preexisting enzyme proteins of the vegetative cell. <b>Sporogenesis</b> and adaptive enzyme formation are regarded as competitive synthetic processes, both utilizing endogenous enzyme proteins.

40|$|Abstract: The {{formation}} of sporangial sori on laminarian blades depends both on environmental and endogenous factors. In nature, most laminarian species form sorus during the slow growth {{period of the}} blade. There is recent experimental evidence {{for the existence of}} sporulation inhibitors produced by the actively growing basal blade meristem, moving in distal direction and preventing sorus formation. Sorus may readily develop during the active growth phase on isolated blade discs or distally of transverse cuts in entire blades, probably due to isolation from the inhibitor stream. In nature, growth activity of the blade decreases due to an endogenous circannual rhythm, possibly decreasing the sporulation inhibitor concentration down to a critical level enabling sorus formation. Light and temperature demands of <b>sporogenesis</b> for Laminaria digitata were investigated using isolated blade discs. Optimal <b>sporogenesis</b> took place in photon fluence rates of 20 - 200 µmol m- 2 s- 1; while no induction was achieved in continuous darkness.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the BAH (Biologische Anstalt Helgoland) was to gain control over the induction of <b>sporogenesis</b> in Laminaria digitata and to reduce {{the time it takes}} individual algae to start reproduction. Compared to the occurrence of double prime sorus double prime (sporogenous tissue) on L. digitata in the field, the experiments showed the acceleration of <b>sporogenesis</b> by 5 months under certain conditions in the laboratory. Pieces of young tissue developed sorus under various light regimes and a range of temperatures. In contrast to L. digitata, L. saccharina tissue required short-day conditions for sorus formation that was obtained at least two months ahead of natural occurrence. The minimum plant age of L. digitata facilitating <b>sporogenesis</b> was found to be 7. 5 months {{at the start of the}} experiment, with the first sorus showing after 5 weeks. This corresponds to our findings in mass cultures of local L. digitata which have been undertaken close to the island of Helgoland. They rendered early formation of sorus on 8. 6 months old sporophytes as calculated from the zoospore stage, contrasting to 18 months in natural populations and reconfirming findings in mass cultures at CEVA, Pleubian. The youngest tissue forming sorus in the experiment was collected from a second year plant and was only 14 to 28 days old. Older pieces of the thallus preceeded younger pieces in sorus formation. Nutrient enriched seawater accelerated <b>sporogenesis</b> compared to pure seawater, but had the disadvantage of facilitating luxuriant growth of epiphytes. The viability of the laboratory raised spores was tested and a completely normal developement of young sporophytes obtained. 340 m of culture string were densely seeded with L. digitata spores from 12 disks with an original diameter of 23 mm. double prime Phycotrons double prime, designed by IFREMER, Nantes, and employed at Helgoland showed that in parallel experiments isolated disks of thallus preceded whole algae in the formation of spores by far.

40|$|This paper, {{although}} {{limited to}} the effects of homologous antibodies acting as inhibitors of the sporulation process of bacterial cells, is {{one of a series of}} current investigations of various physio-logical factors concerned in <b>sporogenesis.</b> The essentials for <b>sporogenesis</b> recently have been hypothesized and experimentally supported by Hardwick and Foster (1952). They point out, with good evidence, that spore formation appears to involve an endogenous mechanism and con-sequently is not dependent primarily upon an exogenous energy supply. It is demonstrated further by them that there are two factors es-sential for sporulation: (1) energy from an intracellular source; (2) nitrogenous precursors which furnish the material for the svnthesis of the spore. The main objective of the present paper is concerned with this pool of nitrogenous materials and its relationship to <b>sporogenesis.</b> The author is interested in the supposition that perhaps some of the external (peripheral) protein material of the cell, as well as some of the internal protein components, namely, enzymes (Hardwick and Foster, 1953), may be supplying necessary con-stituents to this nitrogenous pool. This con-jecture was tested by reacting antibodies homol-ogous for resting vegetative cells with external antigenic proteins, which procedui'e rendered the protein units inert.

Vegetative growth of P. penetrans was observed only in infected nematodes harvested at 12 and 16 DAI, whereas cells at different stages of sporulation and mature endospores were observed at 24 and 38 DAI. ELISA and immunoblot analysis revealed that the adhesin-associated epitope was first detected at 24 DAI, and increased in the later stages of <b>sporogenesis.</b> These results indicate that the synthesis of adhesin-related proteins occurred at a certain developmental stage relative to the sporulation process, and was associated with endospore maturation. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that the distribution of the epitope is nearly uniform on the periphery of each spore, as defined by parasporal fibers. Immunocytochemistry at the ultrastructural level indicated a distribution of the epitope over the parasporal fibers. The epitope also was detected over other structures such as sporangium and exosporium during the <b>sporogenesis</b> process, but it was not observed over the cortex, inner-spore coat, outer-spore coat, or protoplasm.

40|$|<b>Sporogenesis</b> and spores of Equisetum bogotense (Equisetaceae) from {{mountain}} areas of Colombia. Studies on some reproductive traits in Equisetum species are scarce and valuable to understand species distribution. Therefore, a {{detailed study of}} the <b>sporogenesis</b> process and spore development in E. bogotense is presented, with {{an analysis of the}} main events during meiosis, maturation of spores, spore wall ultrastructure, orbicules and elaters. Specimens were collected from 500 to 4 500 m in Cauca, Colombia. Strobili at different maturation stages were fixed, dehydrated, embedded in resin, and ultra-microtome obtained sections were stained with Toluidine blue. Observations were made with optical microscopy with differential interference contrast illumination technique (DIC), transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM). Ultrathin sections (70 - 80 μm) for TEM observations were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate; while samples for SEM observations, were fixed, dehydrated in 2. 2 -dimethoxypropane and dried at critical point as in standard methods. Strobili have numerous mature sporangiophores, each one with a peltate structure, the scutellum, bearing five-six sessile sporangia attached to the axis of strobilus by the manubrium. Immature sporocytes (spore mother cells) are tightly packed within the young sporangia. The sporocytes quickly undergo meiosis, by passing the stage of archesporium and give origin to tetrads of spores. The tapetum loses histological integrity during early stages of <b>sporogenesis,</b> intrudes as a plasmodial mass into the cavity of the sporangium, partially surrounding premeiotic sporocytes, and then, tetrads and adult spores. The tapetum disintegrates {{towards the end of the}} <b>sporogenesis,</b> leaving spores free within the sporangial cavity. Spores present several cytological changes that allow them to achieve greater size and increase the number of plastids, before reaching the adult stage. Sporoderm includes three layers external to the cytoplasmic membrane of the spore cell, and they are pseudoendospore, exospore and perispore. Viewed with SEM, the exospore is smooth to rugulate, with micro perforations, while the perispore is muriform, rugate, with narrow, delicate, discontinuous, randomly distributed folds delimiting incomplete, irregular areolae, externally covered by of different size, densely distributed orbicules. These orbicules are also found all over the external face and margins of the elaters, while the internal face is smooth and lack orbicules. Viewed with TEM, the exospore is a thick layer of fine granular material, while perispore is a thinner layer of dense, separate orbicules. The elaters are composed by two layers of fibrillar material: an inner layer with longitudinally oriented fibrils and an outer, thicker and less dense layer with fibrils transversely fibrils and abundant, external orbicules. It is suggested that the processes of ontogeny and characters of the sporoderm are relatively constant in Equisetum; however, <b>sporogenesis</b> in E. bogotense is synchronous and this condition has been observed so far only in E. giganteum, a tropical genus also found in Colombia.
