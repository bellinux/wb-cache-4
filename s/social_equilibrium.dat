40|$|This thesis uses <b>social</b> system <b>equilibrium</b> {{theory to}} answer the {{question}} how terrorism works. Counterterrorism policy can benefit from a systems analysis of both terrorist groups and targeted social systems. Current terrorism theory does not adequately address the broad question of how terrorism causes political-social change and is thus of limited use to counter strategic terrorist objectives. This thesis proposes the Dynamic Equilibrium Theory of Terrorism (DETT) as a social systems framework for understanding how terrorism causes change. The social system is examined as a complex living system composed of two primary components; value and environment. These two components exist in dynamic equilibrium, a homeostatic process of balance which functions to keep the system operating within normal parameters. When these components are out of balance, changes occur within the system. If the value-environment relationship is significantly out of balance, the system may enter disequilibrium, characterized by dysfunction and a high likelihood of violence. Terrorism is a unique political weapon because it targets a <b>social</b> system's <b>equilibrium</b> in order to force change. It is a violent environmental input at immediate and recognizable odds with a system's value and as such disrupts the value-environment equilibrium. The DETT theory offered in this thesis is used to examine Al Qaeda and the attacks of 9 / 11. Theses attacks were a terrorist input that disrupted our <b>social</b> system <b>equilibrium</b> and forced changes. US Air Force (USAF) author...|$|R
40|$|By {{making a}} {{distinction}} {{between public and private}} preferences, the paper presents a dual preference model depicting possible responses (i. e., exit, sincere voice and self-subversion) to social pressures from two opposing pressure groups. Exit is deserting the setting; sincere voice is publicly expressing dissatisfaction and self-subversion is the misrepresentation of one's private preference under social pressures. Exit and sincere voice involve prohibitive costs, making self-subversion the superior option. Massive self-subversion polarizes the society, harboring multiple social equilibria with oscillating public opinion. In an effort to dominate the public discourse, each rival pressure group opts for favorable corner equilibrium. The paper applies the dual preference model to Turkey where two kinds of self-subversion appear in response to competing Islamist and secularist social projects. Islamist pressures lead to pro-Islamist self-subversion, and secularist pressures to pro-secularist self-subversion, resulting in the polarization of the Turkish public opinion along Islamists vs. Secularists. Three field experiments with 450 respondents provide empirical support for the model's conclusions. The paper ends with the discussion of the model's implications for new <b>social</b> <b>equilibrium(s).</b> ...|$|R

These have been obtained using an approximate fixed point theorem. As an application {{of the existence of}} such approximate social Nash equi-libria, sufficient conditions for the existence of a suitable approximate walrasian equilibrium in finite economies are obtained. Among others things, it is shown that the approximate walrasian equilibrium here considered is approximatively weakly efficient. Key words.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{political}} economy of social insurance in a world where individuals differ in both income and risk. Social insurance is financed through distortionary taxation and redistributes across income and risk. Individuals vote on social insurance that they can complement with insurance bought on the private market. Private insurance is actuarially fair but suffers from adverse selection, which results in a screening equilibrium with partial coverage. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>social</b> insurance is the result of an electoral competition game where parties maximize the utility of their members. We calculate the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>social</b> insurance offered by the two parties as well as their equilibrium membership, and study how the equilibrium outcome is affected by electoral uncertainty, distortions from taxation, risk aversion and the distribution of risk and income. We then calibrate the model to US data from the PSID survey.

Of independent interest, our techniques show that in a combinatorial auction setting, efficiency guarantees of a mechanism via smoothness for a very restricted class of cardinality valuations, extend with a small degradation, to subadditive valuations, the largest complement-free class of valuations.
