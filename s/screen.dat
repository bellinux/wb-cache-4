5|$|A 24-inch 1080p PlayStation branded 3D television, officially {{called the}} PlayStation 3D Display, was {{released}} in late 2011. A feature of this 3D television is SimulView. During multiplayer games, each player will only see their respective <b>screen</b> (in full HD) appear on the television through their respective 3D glasses, instead of seeing a split <b>screen</b> (e.g. player 1 will only see player 1's <b>screen</b> displayed through their 3D glasses).|$|E
5|$|A Gothic <b>screen</b> {{was also}} {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The <b>screen</b> is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the <b>screen.</b> Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the <b>screen</b> to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the <b>screen,</b> leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the <b>screen.</b> The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the <b>screen,</b> ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green <b>screen</b> compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong Country uses {{a series}} of map screens to track the players' progress. Between each level, players control their {{character}} on the map <b>screen,</b> navigating {{to the next level}} they want to play. Each level on the map is marked with an icon: unfinished levels are marked by Kremlings (the game's main enemy), while friendly areas are marked by members of the Kong family. Every individual world map <b>screen</b> has one boss enemy {{at the end of the}} course, which must be defeated to travel back to the main map <b>screen</b> of the whole island. It is possible to access previous world maps without defeating the boss by finding Funky Kong and borrowing his barrel plane. Players use this ability to select the world from the main <b>screen,</b> then the level within it. During play the game interface hides most game-related information, such as the number of bananas, letters, and animal tokens collected, as well as the number of lives remaining. When an item is collected, the relevant information briefly appears on the <b>screen.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Repeated {{participation}} {{is important in}} faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) <b>screening</b> for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, {{a large number of}} <b>screening</b> invitations over time may lead to <b>screening</b> fatigue and consequently, decreased participation rates. We evaluated the impact of <b>screening</b> fatigue on overall <b>screening</b> programme effectiveness. Methods Using the ASCCA model, we simulated the Dutch CRC <b>screening</b> programme consisting of biennial FIT <b>screening</b> in individuals aged 55 – 75. We studied the resilience of the programme against heterogeneity in <b>screening</b> attendance and decrease in participation rate due to <b>screening</b> fatigue. Outcomes were reductions in CRC incidence and mortality compared to no <b>screening.</b> Results Assuming a homogenous 63  % participation, i. e., each round each individual was equally likely to attend <b>screening,</b> 30  years of <b>screening</b> reduced CRC incidence and mortality by 39 and 53  %, respectively, compared to no <b>screening.</b> When assuming clustered participation, i. e., three subgroups of individuals with a high (95  %), moderate (65  %) and low (5  %) participation rate, <b>screening</b> was less effective; reductions were 33  % for CRC incidence and 43  % for CRC mortality. <b>Screening</b> fatigue considerably reduced <b>screening</b> effectiveness; if individuals refrained from <b>screening</b> after three negative <b>screens,</b> model-predicted incidence reductions decreased to 25 and 18  % under homogenous and clustered participation, respectively. Figures were 34 and 25  % for mortality reduction. Conclusions <b>Screening</b> will substantially decrease CRC incidence and mortality. However, <b>screening</b> effectiveness can be seriously compromised if <b>screening</b> fatigue occurs. This warrants careful monitoring of individual <b>screening</b> behaviour and consideration of targeted invitation systems in individuals who have (repeatedly) missed <b>screening</b> rounds...|$|R

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time across the <b>screen,</b> and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall {{to the bottom of the}} <b>screen</b> when hit.

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the <b>screen.</b> One duck at a time flies across the <b>screen,</b> with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} <b>screen</b> and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the <b>screen.</b> As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the <b>screen</b> where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the <b>screen.</b> An <b>screen</b> overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E

If the parents of carrier newborns would not be tested however, prenatal <b>screening</b> detects most carrier couples. Prenatal and single entry preconceptional <b>screening</b> programmes have a favourable cost-savings balance in the Netherlands under {{a wide range of}} assumptions. For double entry preconceptional <b>screening</b> and neonatal <b>screening,</b> high enough values of uptake of <b>screening,</b> prenatal diagnosis, and induced abortion are necessary.
