50|$|When Black Bolt {{attempted}} {{to set off}} an explosion that would spread the Terrigen Mists across the galaxy, reasoning that this action would render all equal, Crystal defied his orders and risked her life to take Lockjaw to confront him, disabling the Terrigen qualities of the explosion and convincing Black Bolt that the powers that would be created by his plan would cause more harm than good. Although Black Bolt acknowledged her wisdom, an attack by Vulcan meant that Black Bolt was kept too busy to accompany Crystal and Lockjaw when {{they were forced to}} flee before the bomb — now a <b>simple</b> <b>explosive</b> device — went off, apparently killing Black Bolt and Vulcan. After some time with Medusa ruling in Black Bolt's stead, he is resurrected and returns to the throne. Shortly thereafter, Black Bolt makes a decree that the Inhumans would return to Earth, leaving Ronan the Accuser in charge of the empire; Crystal is given the choice to leave with the royal family or stay by her husband.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a model of}} asset market exuberance, collapse and recovery using subjective investor-based rational expectations {{about the impact of}} fundamentals on the market price. Investors are assumed to have heterogeneous market sentiments, allowing them to be exuberant, cautious, or fundamentalist via boundary conditions that describe their respective views of the market impact of the same economic fundamentals. Equilibrium solution paths of the model take varying forms, depending on the parameter settings that reflect the importance of each type of market participant. This rational expectations model of asset pricing is shown to be consistent with a <b>simple</b> <b>explosive</b> continuous time autoregression when exuberant sentiment dominates the market. The model explains asset price bubbles, including expansion and subsequent collapse, together with long-term recovery. Extensions of the model allow for contagion effects in which market sentiments are transmitted from a primary market to a secondary market, reproducing speculative behavior and corrections in the secondary market. Some of the implications of the model for empirical work are explored...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor {{more than}} 15 yr, the {{recording}} of hydroacoustic signals with hydrophones moored in a minimum sound-velocity channel, called the SOFAR (SOund Fixing And Ranging) channel, has allowed for detection and localization of many small-magnitude earthquakes in oceanic areas. However, the interpretation of these hydroacoustic signals fails to provide direct information on the magnitudes, focal mechanisms, or focal depths of the causative earthquakes. These limitations result, in part, from an incomplete understanding of the physics of the conversion, across the seafloor interface, from seismic waves generated by subseafloor earthquakes to hydroacoustic T waves. To try and overcome some of these limitations, we have developed a 2 -D finite-element mechanical model of the conversion process. By computing an exact solution of the velocity field of the waterborne T waves, our model shows that a double-couple source mechanism of a subseafloor earthquake generates T waves, whose take-off angles are adequate to allow penetration into the SOFAR channel and efficient trapping by this waveguide. Furthermore, our model confirms that a double-couple source with a high S-wave content produces higher-amplitude T waves than a <b>simple</b> <b>explosive</b> source, which only generates P waves...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of overweight and obesity among primary education pupils and to identify differences in motor skills between normal weight, excessive and obese pupils. Partial aim was to determine differences in motor status of girls and boys and their anthropometric characteristics (Body Mass Index, body fat percentage). The study was conducted in two primary schools in Zagreb, Ivan Goran Kovačić and Davorin Trstenjak. Total of 333 pupils, aged 7 – 11, were measured (178 boys and 155 girls). Four anthropometric and seven motor variables were used to analyze differences in motor abilities of children. Children were divided into three groups within gender based on their body fat measures. We established a statistically signifi cant difference in motor abilities between groups of subjects in three subsamples (1 st– 2 nd class girls and 3 rd– 4 th boys and girls). Children with normal weight have better results in explosive strength, coordination, static strength of arm and shoulder than children who are overweight and obese. The differences are not observed in motor variables where body weight is not a requisite for effi cient execution of movement. Differences in motor skills by gender showed that boys are better in coordination, speed of the <b>simple</b> movements, <b>explosive</b> and repetitive strength, and girls are better in fl exibility. The conclusion of this study confi rmed the existence of differences in the development of motor skills in children with normal body weight compared to children who are overweight or obese.

40|$|Errata {{are shown}} in red. The process of placing a {{separating}} hyperplane for data classification is normally disconnected from the process of selecting the features to use. An approach for feature selection that is conceptually <b>simple</b> but computationally <b>explosive</b> is to simply apply the hyperplane placement process to all possible subsets of features, selecting the smallest set of features that provides reasonable classification accuracy. Two ways to speed this process are (i) use a faster filtering criterion instead of a complete hyperplane placement, and (ii) use a greedy forward or backwards sequential selection method. This paper introduces a new filtering criterion that is very fast: maximizing the drop in the sum of infeasibilities in a linear-programming transformation of the problem. It also shows how the linear programming transformation {{can be applied to}} reduce the number of features after a separating hyperplane has already been placed while maintaining the separation that was originally induced by the hyperplane. Finally, a new and highly effective integrated method that simultaneously selects features while placing the separating hyperplane is introduced. 1...|$|R
40|$|Each {{of three}} parts {{examines}} the complex rhythmic and drama-means by which Berryman's poetry became a single drive towards {{life and a}} sense of wholeness. Part I explains Berryman's notion of "living poetry," using the concept of rhythm, not simply metrics, and analyzes four exemplary poems which span the thirty-five years of his career. Part II places Berryman in the English Romantic tradition of the poetry of experience with special reference to Keats's notion of the "chameleon poet" and Wordsworth's and Yeats's poetry of the central self. Much of the argument of Part II is based on Berryman's unpublished notes on Keats's Letters. Part III examines in detail, in light of the first two parts, the three major phases of Berryman's poetry and focuses primarily on The Dispossessed (1948), The Dream Songs (I 967), and Love and Fame (1971) each of which are representative of each phase. In the first phase, Berryman carefully polishes his verse, arid he takes as his models Yeats and Auden. But during his long apprenticeship (ca, 1935 - 45), he begins to find his own voice through his strong sense of being a chameleon poet (i. e. dramatic monologue) and by concentrating mainly upon characters who are under stress [...] thus, the beginning of his disrupted syntax which continues in his Sonnets, written in 1947, and in Homage to Mistress Bradstreet. But not until The Dream Songs does Berryman's twisted syntax seem functional. The Dream Songs is Berryman's greatest work not only artistically, but also in the penetration of its thought, the subtlety of its feeling, and the sense of wholeness it suggests. In the third phase (Love and Fame) Berryman sets out to do something he had not done before. His style becames <b>simple,</b> but <b>explosive,</b> and his voice speaks directly and autobiographically. But his poetry is still no less subtle and complex in his exploration of the nature of his relation to past and future experience...|$|R
30|$|A {{comparison}} between case A (3 D velocity model) and case B (half-space model) {{indicates that the}} localized strong ground shakings in the Taipei basin and Yilan plain {{could be due to}} the low velocity sedimentary deposits; the strong motion that occurred in the Hualien area might result from complex path effects, such as sedimentary deposits in Longitudinal Valley, topographic scattering (Lee et al., 2009), or subducting structures (Furumura and Kennett, 2005; Chen et al., 2013). A stronger ShakeMap pattern can be observed between Yilan and Hualien in case A compared to that in case B. This might be due to the topographic effect which could cause amplified ground motion at tops and ridges of mountain (Lee et al., 2009). The finite-fault ruptured from the deep to the shallower subduction zone (from north to south) also caused a remarkable directivity effect, which produced a southern-extension ShakeMap pattern from the epicenter in cases A and B, but it was not present in case C. It is noted that a northwesterly strong-motion extension can be found in both the finite-fault model (cases A and B) and the double-couple point source (case C), compared to that with a <b>simple</b> geometric decay (<b>explosive</b> source in case D) where there is no such extension. This implies that the source effect, especially the radiation pattern, is one of the dominant factors that caused strong ground shaking in northern Taiwan.|$|R
40|$|Explosive boiling {{has been}} proposed, by {{extensive}} theoretical and experimental work, {{to be one}} of the dominant mechanisms in the UV nanosecond laser ablation. For a better understanding of the processes involved in material ejection, simple systems have to be examined. Van der Waals molecular solids provide a unique medium for studying these issues. This thesis concerns optical examination of the temporal evolution of morphological changes induced to van der Waals films, upon irradiation below and above the ablation threshold, in order to quantitatively describe the explosive boiling process. Neat toluene film is studied extensively, because it is highly transparent and, thus, optical examination is possible, via optical probing techniques. This thesis continues the previous work to examine in quantitative way the explosive boiling. Parameters examined: a. the dependence on laser pulses. It is shown that this is a critical parameter for the reproducibility of the results and that there is a high sensitivity of bubble formation on the structure/morphology of the film. b. neat toluene is compared with mixtures composed of toluene with a dopant ((CH 3) 2 O or c- C 6 H 12) to show how the phenomenon depends on chemical composition. The most important result is that bubble formation is much lower for the more volatile dopant, which is opposite to what a <b>simple</b> theory of <b>explosive</b> boiling predicts. This directly demonstrates the competition between explosive boiling and surface desorption. c. a preliminary examination of solid vs. liquid toluene. Bubble formation and growth is indicated to be consistent with material ejection. However, several discrepancies exist between theoretical estimations and experiment. The most important one is that ablation is predicted to occur at temperatures close to the spinodal limit, whereas, experimentally, ablation is observed at temperatures well below that limit. Overall, we claim that the quantitative description of explosive boiling is not so well described by the theoretical models. Therefore, theoretical estimations will have to be improved, by taking into account all these factors that affect bubble formation and growth...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} dynamics of subaerial and submarine explosive silicic volcanism in the Kermadec arc (SW Pacific) {{by looking at the}} microtextures of bubbles in pumice. An increasing body of evidence from oceanic arcs shows that submarine pumice-forming eruptions are surprisingly common. Such eruptions involve silica-rich magmas, despite their oceanic setting, and many are large enough to form calderas and represent a significant hazard. This study contributes towards the understanding of conditions during silicic volcanic eruptions, using comparisons and contrasts between pyroclasts from subaerial and submarine eruptions from the same tectonic setting. Five volcanoes are investigated (Raoul, Raoul SW, Macauley, Healy and Havre), all of which have erupted dacite to rhyodacite of broadly similar chemical and physical properties within the last 10, 000 years. These eruptions occurred over a range of water depths providing constraints that allow such processes to be quantified by ‘eliminating’ the variables of magma chemistry and tectonic setting. In this thesis I quantify the pyroclast bubble size distributions and number densities for subaerial and submarine pumices using an adaption of the FOAMS program [Shea et al., 2010 a: JVGR 190, 271 - 289]. The investigation of pumices from six subaerial eruptions from Raoul volcano show there is a dearth in pyroclasts with ~ 65 - 75 % vesicularity with most deposits having pyroclasts with vesicularities higher than this range (mode ~ 82 %). It is these 65 - 75 % vesicularity clasts, however, that have the highest bubble number density (BND) values, regardless of eruption intensity, style or degree of interaction with external water. This study suggest that this 65 - 75 % vesicularity range is pivotal in the fragmentation of magma, with higher vesicularity clasts preserving varying degrees of post-fragmentation bubble growth and coalescence, and hence decrease in BND values. The implications from this study are broad reaching as most pyroclast bubble size studies focus on modal density clasts, which I show do not preserve characteristics of the magma at fragmentation, but instead preserve some degree of post-fragmentation expansion prior to quenching in the conduit or eruption plume. The thorough assessment of pyroclast textures from the subaerial erupted Raoul pyroclasts allows for comparisons to be made with submarine erupted pyroclasts sampled via dredging. These results permit inferences to be drawn as to the influence of both eruption rate and water depth on the eruption dynamics, with the interplay between the two playing a vital role. Results of this work challenge the existing notion of <b>simple</b> end-member <b>explosive</b> or effusive regimes and define a new intermediate eruptive style (Tangaroan) that is unique to the submarine realm. This eruptive style is neither effusive nor explosive yet generates highly vesicular, widely dispersed pumice clasts through buoyant detachment of foaming magma at vent. These magma blebs undergo further vesiculation processes whilst being transported within the water column before disintegration by hydrofracturing. In contrast, higher eruption rates cause fragmentation to occur within the conduit prior to any quenching influence of the overlying water column. The higher dynamic pressure of a significant overlying water column acting on the eruption jet inhibits rapid decompression and expansion of clasts, as it would if erupted into air, and therefore affects the vesiculation processes in the resulting pyroclasts. If the eruption jet is able to breach the sea surface, the rapid decrease in pressure is translated to the pyroclast texture as an additional rapid homogenous nucleation event. This nucleation event is seen as zones of abundant small bubbles within the complex heterogeneous groundmass texture of large, thin walled, highly coalesced and sometimes highly contorted bubbles. These distinctive differences open up the possibility of being able to fingerprint subaerial versus submarine erupted pyroclasts in ancient volcaniclastic sequences...|$|R
