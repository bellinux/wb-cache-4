500|$|Two other {{participants}} were profoundly affected. Firstly, Knicks center Darrall Imhoff was branded as {{the player who}} let Chamberlain score 100 on him, although he only played 20 of 48minutes and {{was not on the}} court when it happened. On the other hand, the game immortalized little-used Warriors reserve player Joe Ruklick as the man who gave Chamberlain the 100-point assist. Decades later, The New York Times interviewed Ruklick and found out that he refers to himself as [...] "a walking footnote" [...] of one of basketball's greatest moments. The game also produced the famous picture of Chamberlain <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench,</b> holding up a paper with a scribbled [...] "100". The photograph was actually a matter of improvisation: when Warriors PR manager Harvey Pollack entered the Warriors locker room, he took a paper and scribbled the number on it, and Associated Press photographer Paul Vathis who was there at the game (not for professional reasons, but rather because he wanted to give his son a treat) took the now-famous photo. Cherry calls it the [...] "ultimate picture" [...] of Wilt Chamberlain.|$|E

500|$|Poppy {{initially}} {{appeared as}} a guest character in two episodes, broadcast on 11 and 13 January 2011, in [...] "filler" [...] scenes that were substituted for those cut from a controversial baby-swap storyline in which Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack)'s son James dies of sudden infant death syndrome, and she secretly swaps him with Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace)'s son, Tommy. A spokeswoman for EastEnders claimed that {{although some of the}} baby-swap scenes had been edited in response to reaction from viewers, none had been removed: [...] "Given the audience response to this storyline, we felt on this occasion that it was appropriate to respond and make some changes. The vast majority of material remains intact and we don't believe that those trims we have made will weaken or detract from the overall storyline for viewers".

Cyrus then emerged {{from the bottom of}} the stage while playing a white grand piano, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bench.</b> Midway through the song, Cyrus stood up and continued performing while the video screens were brought down to Cyrus' height. Cyrus described the performance as a [...] "sneak preview" [...] of The Last Song, adding that her excitement about the life imitating art scenario she experienced while filming The Last Song led her to show the movie on tour. Melinda M. Thompson of The Oregonian believed that by playing the piano at the opening night's performance of [...] "When I Look at You", Cyrus [...] "showcased her many talents and proved she really just beginning to grasp her star power." [...] Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times attended the September 22 concert in Los Angeles, California at the Staples Center and commented, [...] "Once again, make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift {{performed}} [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] on all venues of {{her first}} headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to June 2010.

Midway through [...] "You're Not Sorry", Swift ceases playing the piano and commences to sing a cover version of Justin Timberlake's [...] "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around" [...] while whipping her hair, maintaining on the bench. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} performance, she intermingled between the two songs as smoke swirled and lightning was projected on the stage. Jon Pareles of The New York Times referred to the performance as one of the night's highlights at the August 27, 2009, concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Reed Fischer of Miami New Times attended the March 7, 2010, concert at BankAtlantic Center in Sunrise, Florida and, of the cover of [...] "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around", said, [...] "That, and some extended beating on an oil drum sculpture, made for the only unsavory moments of the night." [...] Alice Fisher of the United Kingdom magazine The Observer believed the performance at the May 7, 2009, concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London, England [...] "was undermined by the way Swift writhed on her stool and awkwardly thumped the piano lid {{in one of the most}} unconvincing displays of passion I've seen since Footballers' Wives finished." [...] Swift also performed the song at an exclusive performance, hosted by 95.8 Capital FM, the 2009 Academy of Country Music Awards, and the 2009 CMA Music Festival. During her Speak Now World Tour, she used elements of [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] and [...] "Apologize" [...] while performing [...] "Back To December". She also performed the song twice on the Red Tour.|$|E
