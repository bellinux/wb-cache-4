5|$|To this dreadful monster the effluvium of {{the weasel}} is fatal, {{a thing that}} has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; <b>so</b> <b>true</b> is it that it has pleased Nature {{that there should be}} nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this {{struggle}} of nature against its own self.|$|E

After reviewing the idea, Fred Bonativa turned it down, and <b>so</b> <b>True</b> decided to work on it during his vacation time. True planned a ten-day trip that would take him through the state of Jalisco to Nayarit state. He started his journey 1 December 1998 in Tuxpan, Jalisco, was last seen 4 December in Chalmotita, Jalisco, and his wife reported him missing on 10 December.|$|E

25|$|An {{ecological}} {{switch from}} a predatory to herbivorous lifestyle {{was likely to}} have been a driving and influential force in directing the morphological adaptations of therizinosaurians. This is perhaps even more <b>so</b> <b>true</b> for therizinosaurids, which seem to have further adapted their pelvic and pectoral girdles to increase their upright reach, an adaption believed to have aided in a life of herbivory. Moreover, understanding the feeding patterns of these dinosaurs is important for understanding their morphology and how herbivory emerged within Theropoda. While a majority of theropod dinosaurs were carnivorous, a few select groups either transitioned or returned to an herbivorous lifestyle. Of the groups thought to have returned to herbivory, therizinosaurians are thought to have made the switch first, and are subsequently the most widely regarded candidate for the emergence of herbivory within Theropoda.|$|E
25|$|In {{their new}} market, the Coyotes have {{continued}} to struggle {{both on and off}} the ice. They have not won a playoff series besides their run to the Conference Final in 2012. When the team declared bankruptcy in 2009, the NHL took over the franchise. In the midst of the league's search for a new Coyotes owner, True North Sports and Entertainment made two bids with the intent of returning the franchise to Winnipeg. True North also considered buying the Nashville Predators, likely to move it to Winnipeg. These bids were turned down only after the league reached an agreement with the municipal government, which agreed to subsize the Coyotes' losses in order to keep the Coyotes in Phoenix, <b>so</b> <b>True</b> North turned its attention to the financially struggling Atlanta Thrashers, moving it to Winnipeg to become the second incarnation of the Jets (see below).|$|E
25|$|If one accepts that Shakespeare made a {{conscious}} decision to use Holinshed more frequently during his re-editing of True Tragedy, one must ask why he may have done <b>so.</b> <b>True</b> Tragedy is roughly one thousand lines shorter than 3 Henry VI, and whilst many of the differences are simple aesthetic changes and alternate phraseology (much of which is easily attributable to inaccurate reporting), one major difference between the two that runs throughout is how they each handle violence. On the whole, 3 Henry VI is far more restrained in its depiction of war, whereas True Tragedy has more explicit and sustained on-stage combat and more royal processions and celebrations after combat. Much more so than does 3 Henry VI, True Tragedy conforms to the so-called Tudor myth that the Wars of Roses were God's punishment for people straying from the path laid out for them, and His means of purging the country of evil and opening the way for the righteous Tudor dynasty to establish peace. Traditionally, this has been a common way of interpreting the entire octalogy; advocated and elaborated upon by critics as diverse as August Wilhelm Schlegel, Hermann Ulrici, Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Irving Ribner, M.M. Reese, Robert Rentoul Reed, and, most famously, E.M.W. Tillyard, with whom the phrase Tudor myth is now most associated.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for [...] "Night Out" [...] were mixed.

Porter went on to praise the acting work of both B. J. Novak and Paul Lieberstein, {{as well as the}} writing of Mindy Kaling. TV Squad's Jay Black said that Michael summed up [...] "Night Out" [...] perfectly when he said [...] "Best. Night. Ever." [...] Black went on to praise both of the storylines, and the ability of the show to achieve success both in as well as out of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton building. Similar to Black's statements, Gretchen Hansen of Entertainment Weekly stated that Best. Night. Ever.' Oh, <b>so</b> <b>true,</b> Michael." [...] She also stated that [...] "I guess I {{knew it was going to}} be a good episode of The Office when I had two pages of scribbled notes before the first commercial break." [...] Hansen went on to praise both the acting and the writing of the episode as points that contributed to the success of the episode. Rachel Cericola, of TV Fodder, praised the writing of the episode by Mindy Kaling. She also praised the storyline of the episode that did not involve Michael and Dwight, saying [...] "The second plotline was its usual funny filler. However, it was Toby's revelation that made it all worthwhile." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Susan, Lynette, and Gabrielle comfort Bree at the {{hospital}} was the last scene of the season involving the four principal characters. Teri Hatcher commented: [...] "It was a heavy scene. There was a very genuine and deeply felt recognition that all four of us {{together as a team}} appreciated the ride we'd had this season and were grateful that we'd survived it together." [...] An extension of the scene, in which the women discuss Susan's discovery of Martha Huber's journal, was cut for time, though it was aired on Good Morning America on May 23, 2005, one day after the episode's broadcast, and was included on the first season DVD set. The death of one housewife's husband was confirmed prior to the episode's broadcast. Steven Culp was not surprised when his character was killed off, stating [...] "I had a sneaking suspicion someone was going to go." [...] Producer and writer Kevin Murphy explained the reasoning for killing off the Rex character: [...] "As we neared the end of season 1, our plan was that each woman would enter a new life chapter. Gabrielle would learn to function without Carlos, Susan and Mike would build their relationship, Lynette would go back to work, and Bree would become a single woman. We either had to have Rex divorce her or die." [...] Cherry named the {{scene in which}} Bree finishes her spring cleaning before mourning the death of her husband as one of his top three favorites of the season, stating: [...] "It was one of the favorite things I wrote because it was <b>so</b> <b>true</b> to her character. She had to finish the cleaning she started, and she comes in and everything’s perfect." [...] A scene between Gabrielle and John was also cut for time.|$|E

[...] The Thread that Runs <b>So</b> <b>True</b> (1949) has become a classic of American education. Ruel Foster, a professor at West Virginia University, noted in 1968 that the book had good sales in its first year. At the time, he wrote, sales for the book had gone up in each successive year, an astonishing feat for any book. The book has remained continuously in print for more than 50 years.|$|E
