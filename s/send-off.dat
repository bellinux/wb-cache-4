Bedell-Sivright eventually allowed his side to resume play, but without their ejected teammate.|$|E
5|$|When Khánh {{heard of}} his ouster, he {{declared}} {{it to be}} illegal. After defying his colleagues and travelling {{around the country for}} a day in a fruitless attempt to rally support for a comeback, Khánh went into exile after being named to fill the meaningless post of Ambassador-at-Large and allowed an elaborate ceremonial military <b>send-off</b> to save face. Phát and Thảo were later sentenced to death in absentia. Thảo was hunted down and killed in July 1965, while Phát remained on the run for several years before turning himself in and being pardoned.|$|E
5|$|The episode's story {{focuses on}} couple Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro). The flashbacks reveal their lives before {{arriving}} on the island, {{and what they}} have been doing between day one and day eighty-one. Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) returned for the fifth time since his death late in the first season. Furthermore, Ethan (William Mapother) and Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) reprised their guest roles in flashbacks. The episode got a mixed response from critics and fans, with positive reception considering it an entertaining <b>send-off</b> to two unpopular characters, but negative reviews deeming it unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|Not a large player by the {{standards}} of the time, Kelly had the reputation as an aggressive forward. He was sent off eleven times while playing for Wests, though some <b>send-offs</b> were for scrum breaches rather than foul play.|$|R
50|$|In English club {{football}} at the time, players sent-off during a match {{were required to}} face the RFL judiciary, including those from touring international teams.

5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic <b>send-off</b> as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.|$|E
5|$|Many fans {{hoped to}} see him play for Italy at Euro 2004, or with the 2004 Olympic squad that {{eventually}} managed a Bronze medal, {{but this was not}} to be the case. However, he was given an international <b>send-off</b> by Trapattoni at age 37 in a friendly match against Spain on 28 April 2004, in which he wore the number 10 shirt for the final time, as well as the captain's armband for part of the match. Although Baggio entertained the crowd with his creativity and skill, he was unable to score, despite winning a free-kick from which Vieri's equalising goal arose. The match finished 1–1 and Baggio was given a standing ovation after being substituted off for Fabrizio Miccoli. This was Baggio's 56th and final match for Italy, {{and it was the first}} time an Italian footballer's career had been celebrated this way since Silvio Piola retired.|$|E
5|$|In {{a return}} match on 19 January, Yorkshire fielded a {{stronger}} side {{than in the}} first match and inflicted one of the Natives' heaviest losses, a 16–4 defeat. The team then went undefeated until 16 February, when they faced England. Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football Union (RFU) had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the New Zealanders, regarding them as unsportsmanlike, and tensions reached a nadir {{in the aftermath of}} the England international, during which the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill, refereeing the game, awarded a number of controversial tries to England, prompting three of the Natives to temporarily leave the field in protest; England eventually won 7–0. The Natives apologised afterwards for their behaviour, but the damage was not repaired. The New Zealanders left England without an official <b>send-off,</b> and travelled to Australia where they toured Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. They then returned to New Zealand, where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before. They went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match, on 24 August 1889, 7–2 to Auckland.|$|E

25|$|Western {{criticism}} of Hu, particularly regarding human rights, exposes his hypersensitivity to social stability {{but does not}} lay as much emphasis on his fresh commitment to address China’s multi-faceted social problems. Hu’s pragmatic, non-ideological agenda had two core values—maintaining social stability to further economic development and sustaining Chinese culture to enrich national sovereignty. In domestic policy, he seems to want more openness to the public on governmental functions and meetings. Recently, China's news agency published many Politburo Standing Committee meeting details. He also cancelled many events that are traditionally seen as communist extravagances, such as the lavish <b>send-off</b> and welcoming-back ceremonies of Chinese leaders when visiting foreign lands. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership under Hu also focused on such problems as the {{gap between rich and}} poor and uneven development between the interior and coastal regions. Both party and state seem to have moved away from a definition of development that focuses solely on GDP growth and toward a definition which includes social equality and environment effects.|$|E
