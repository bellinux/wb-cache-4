5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31BC, Octavian {{consolidated}} his political power and in 27BC was named Augustus by the Roman Senate, becoming the first Roman emperor. Around this time, Tiridates II of Parthia briefly overthrew Phraates IV, {{who was able to}} quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as a <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> pay to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the building of a new temple to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the breastplate scene on his statue Augustus of Prima Porta.|$|E

25|$|Both of the lovers' fates are {{interwoven}} {{yet they}} deceive {{the other in}} a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely {{what is going on in}} the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was a <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E

Extant research indicates that <b>price</b> reactions <b>to</b> announcements of economic events are inversely related {{to the amount of}} surprise in the announcements. Prior "WSJ" anouncements of possible bankruptcy filings increase the markets "a priori" assessment of firms' probability of bankruptcy, thereby potentially reducing the surprise in subsequent bankruptcy filings. We hypothesize <b>smaller</b> <b>price</b> reactions <b>to</b> bankruptcy filings for firms where the "WSJ" previously published an article indicating that the firm may file for bankruptcy. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis. Specifically, we find <b>smaller</b> <b>price</b> reactions <b>to</b> bankruptcy filings for firms with prior "WSJ" announcements of possible bankruptcy filings. Our results hold after controlling for firm size, probability of bankruptcy, exchange listing, leverage, and predisclosure information. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998. ...|$|R

500|$|Tender Mercies {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Richard Corliss of Time {{declared it}} the [...] "best American {{movie of the}} new year". Carol Olten of The San Diego Union-Tribune declared Tender Mercies the best movie of 1983, and [...] "the most poignant, but forthright, film of the year, with a brilliant performance by Robert Duvall". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This is a small, lovely and somewhat overloaded film about small-town life, loneliness, country music, marriage, divorce and parental love, and it deals {{with all of these}} things in equal measure. Still, the absence of a single, sharply dramatic story line is a relatively <b>small</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> pay for the plainness and clarity with which these other issues are defined." [...] She also praised Beresford's direction, which she said lent the movie a light touch. The Times Canby wrote, [...] "In all respects Tender Mercies is so good that it has the effect of rediscovering a kind of film fiction that has been debased over the decades by hack moviemakers, working according to accepted formulas, frequently to the applause of the critics as well as the public." [...] Leonard Maltin gave it three out of four stars, applauding Duvall in particular and describing it as a [...] "winning but extremely low-key film", though he characterized Foote's screenplay as [...] "not so much a story as a series of vignettes". David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor praised the film for its values, for underscoring the good in people and for avoiding flashiness and quick cuts in favor of a subtle and deliberately paced story, while maintaining a PG rating and omitting sex, drugs and violence. He also felt, however, that it tended toward melodrama on a few occasions and that the soundtrack had [...] "a bit of syrupy music ... especially at the end".|$|E

40|$|Filtering and auto-deflection are OCLC {{capabilities}} {{that have been}} available although perhaps not well used yet in the interlibrary loan community. The University of Iowa have identified several collections that do not circulate and edit these cataloging records individually to filter requests, since the policy directory {{can not be used}} to deflect these. These collections include the Iowa Womanâ€™s Archives collection, the Roxburghe Collection in Special Collections, and the permanent reserve collection of videos. Interlibrary Loan staff members are responsible for the creation and maintenance of these records. Local holdings records for serials are also created and maintained by ILL staff. The future ability for auto-selection of lenders for articles (i. e. direct request) provides the motivation for adding local holdings records to serials in that if our holdings are not available on OCLC, our library will be chosen after those whose holdings are available.

40|$|We {{consider}} a price adjustment {{process in a}} model of monopolistic competition. Firms have incomplete information about the demand structure. When they set a price they observe the amount they can sell at that price and they observe {{the slope of the}} true demand curve at that price. With this information they estimate a linear demand curve. Given this estimate of the demand curve they set a new optimal price. We investigate the dynamical properties of this learning process. We find that, if the cross-price effects and the curvature of the demand curve are <b>small,</b> <b>prices</b> converge <b>to</b> the Bertrand-Nash equilibrium. The global dynamics of this adjustment process are analyzed by numerical simulations. By means of computational techniques and by applying results from homoclinic bifurcation theory we provide evidence for the existence of strange attractors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether investors produce more information on firms that have listed stock options than on similar firms that do not have options and, if so, whether this additional information translates into a smaller stock-price reaction to releases of public information such as earnings announcements.

Prior results regarding this issue are limited and contradictory. We also find, contrary to previous research, that this additional information production does not lead <b>to</b> a <b>smaller</b> <b>price</b> reaction <b>to</b> earnings announcements.
