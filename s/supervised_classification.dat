25|$|Class {{prediction}} analysis: This approach, called <b>supervised</b> <b>classification,</b> {{establishes the}} basis for developing a predictive model into which future unknown test objects can be input in order to predict the most likely class membership of the test objects. Supervised analysis for class prediction involves use of techniques such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbor, learning vector quantization, decision tree analysis, random forests, naive Bayes, logistic regression, kernel regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, mixture of experts, and supervised neural gas. In addition, various metaheuristic methods are employed, such as genetic algorithms, covariance matrix self-adaptation, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization. Input data for class prediction are usually based on filtered lists of genes which are predictive of class, determined using classical hypothesis tests (next section), Gini diversity index, or information gain (entropy).|$|E

The purpose was to evaluate SIR-A data as a complement to Landsat MSS data in an agricultural environment. The SIR-A data was filtered using a 7 x 7 pixel moving window median filter. Principal components analysis indicated the SIR-A data were discriminating between trees and agricultural fields. <b>Supervised</b> <b>classifications</b> using wheat, pasture, trees, and idle classes resulted in increased accuracies for wheat and pasture and slightly decreased accuracies for trees and idle for the Landsat MSS/SIR-A registered data sets over the Landsat MSS alone.

This investigation utilized data supplied by the NS- 001 aircraft multispectral scanner (15 m IFOV) of NASA. The instruments recognized a total of 9 vegetation classes and one soil class. A hybrid parallelepiped-Bayesian maximum likelihood classifier was employed to produce the <b>supervised</b> vegetation <b>classifications.</b> The data were obtained {{at the height of the}} fall foliage display for this portion of West Virginia. Results show that both classifications are highly accurate, based on a comparison of assignment of vegetation classes on each of the images with actual ground conditions.

Categorization tasks in which no labels are supplied are referred to as unsupervised classification, unsupervised learning, or data clustering. The task of <b>supervised</b> <b>classification</b> involves extracting information from the labeled examples that allows accurate prediction of class labels of future examples. This may involve the abstraction of a rule or concept relating observed object features to category labels, or it may not involve abstraction (e.g., exemplar models). The task of clustering involves recognizing inherent structure in a data set and grouping objects together by similarity into classes. It is thus a process of generating a classification structure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Supervised</b> <b>classification</b> {{makes use}} of {{training}} samples. Training samples are areas {{on the ground for}} which there is Ground truth, that is, what is there is known. The spectral signatures of the training areas are used to search for similar signatures in the remaining pixels of the image, and we will classify accordingly. This type of classification which uses the training samples for classification is called <b>supervised</b> <b>classification.</b> Expert knowledge is very important in this method since the selection of the training samples and adopting a bias can badly affect the accuracy of classification. One popular technique is the Maximum Likelihood principle. It calculates the probability of a pixel belonging to a class (i.e. feature) and allots the pixel to its most probable class.|$|E

Unsupervised and <b>supervised</b> <b>classifications</b> as well as regression analyses were used to examine LANDSAT data from Lake Champlain and from four small nearby lakes. Unsupervised and <b>supervised</b> <b>classifications</b> were found to be of somewhat limited value. Regression analyses revealed a good correlation between depth-integrated total phosphorus concentrations and LANDSAT band 4 data (r 2 = 0. 92) and between Secchi disk transparencies and LANDSAT band 4 data (r 2 - 0. 85). No correlation was found between depth-integrated chlorophyll-a samples and LANDSAT data.

40|$|There {{are several}} studies on tequila agave (Agave tequilana Weber variety blue) {{regarding}} its physiology, diseases, and environmental conditions. However, {{there are not}} documented studies {{on the use of}} satellite technology to locate it. The experience reported does not give details on processes, and techniques. Moreover, the validation criteria are not reported, therefore it is not possible make serious conclusions. Based on this, Jalisco state government (through FIPRODEFO) started a project of satellite imagery classification, in order to identify, locate, and evaluate agave plantations. This project is developed in collaboration with the Tequila Administration Council (TAC), which is providing field information. The current goals are been focused on: a) an analysis of TAC database (land crop area, location, agave age, etc.); and b) development of a geographical information system to link ground information with satellite imagery. Based on this information, several algorithms had been tested, through different techniques, such as no <b>supervised</b> <b>classifications,</b> <b>supervised</b> <b>classifications.</b> Spatial modeling has been also compared, based mainly on the development of regression and classification trees (CART) technology. The average accuracy was around 70 %, which is not enough for the TAC requirements.

5000|$|The {{first step}} in the <b>supervised</b> <b>classification</b> method is to {{identify}} the land-cover and land-use classes to be used. Land-cover refers to the type of material present on the site (e.g. water, crops, forest, wet land, asphalt, and concrete). Land-use refers to the modifications made by people to the land cover (e.g. agriculture, commerce, settlement). All classes should be selected and defined carefully to properly classify remotely sensed data into the correct land-use and/or land-cover information.
