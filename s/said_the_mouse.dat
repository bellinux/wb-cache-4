Nate Ralph of PC World said the Naga 2014 has a more comfortable design compared to the previous versions. Hayden Dingman, also of PC World said the nineteen buttons may be over the top for most people, but for those who need it, it's the best option.

Rich Brown of CNet <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> does not warrant the high price tag and awarded it an overall rating of 7.3/10. The reviewers at PC Magazine thought the Epic was expensive, but commended the mouse's attractiveness and wireless feature.

6000|$|Not {{long after}} this another great longing came over <b>the</b> Cat.

'How beautifully {{you tell}} stories!' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> little <b>mice.</b> And next evening they came with four others, {{who wanted to}} hear the tree's story, and it told still more, for it remembered {{everything}} so clearly and thought: 'Those were happy times! But they may come again. Humpty dumpty fell downstairs, and yet he married a princess; perhaps I shall also marry a princess!' And then it thought of a pretty little birch-tree that grew out in the wood, and seemed to the fir-tree a real princess, and a very beautiful one too.|$|R

2500|$|Krazy Kat (also {{known as}} Krazy & Ignatz at some reprints and compilations) is an American {{newspaper}} comic strip by cartoonist George Herriman (1880–1944), which ran from 1913 to 1944.

The characters had been introduced previously in a side strip with Herriman's earlier creation, [...] The phrase [...] "Krazy Kat" [...] originated there, <b>said</b> by <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> by way of describing the cat. Set in a dreamlike portrayal of Herriman's vacation home of Coconino County, Arizona, Krazy [...] mixture of offbeat surrealism, innocent playfulness and poetic, idiosyncratic language has made it a favorite of comics aficionados and art critics for more than 80 years.|$|R

Sinclair User were similarly impressed giving a score of 94% concluding that it is [...] "an improvement on a legendary game. It still looks tatty but plays brilliantly". In contrast, Tony Dillon in a review for Commodore User gave the game only 2/10, labelling the game [...] "a very big letdown" [...] with [...] "little or no improvement over the original". Additionally he <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> control on the Amiga version was [...] "apallingly bad" [...] (a criticism also levelled in the positive C&VG review).|$|E

6000|$|A cat {{had made}} {{acquaintance}} with a mouse, and had spoken {{so much of}} the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at last <b>the</b> <b>Mouse</b> consented to live in the same house with her, and to go shares in the housekeeping. 'But we must provide for the winter or else we shall suffer hunger,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> Cat. 'You, little Mouse, cannot venture everywhere in case you run at last into a trap.' This good counsel was followed, and a little pot of fat was bought. But they did not know where to put it. At length, after long consultation, <b>the</b> Cat <b>said,</b> 'I know of no place where it could be better put than in the church. No one will trouble to take it away from there. We will hide it in a corner, and we won't touch it till we are in want.'

40|$|Karyotypes of <b>the</b> Japanese harvest <b>mouse,</b> Micromys nzinutus japonicus, {{from two}} populations {{occurring}} in Fukuoka and the Tsushima Islands, {{were examined in}} detail using conventional, G- and C-band stainings.

The karyotypes in the two populations concerned were much the same as in other Japanese and Eurasian populations. Thus, it may be <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> harvest <b>mouse</b> has a quite conservative karyotype in spite of its wide geographical distribution. So far as it is based upon the karyotype, this conservatism does not support a specific division of <b>the</b> Japanese harvest <b>mouse</b> (M. japonicus) from the Eurasian one (M. minutus), which was proposed by Tokuda (1941), thus we regard <b>the</b> Japanese harvest <b>mouse</b> as M. minutus; moreover, M. minutus aokii (Kuroda, 1922) from Tsushima seems to be a synonym of M. minutus japonicus (Thomas, 1905) from the mainland of Kyushu...|$|R

The scaling function {{can be used as a}} comparative metric for tail length, or equivalent conditional value at risk, even where moments do not exist. Directional entropy can also be used to identify regions of maximal exposure to new information, which can actually increase entropy rather than collapse it.
