40|$|In mammals, {{control of}} S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) {{translation}} is {{one component of}} a feedback network that regulates intracellular levels of the polyamines, spermidine, and spermine. AdoMetDC mRNA from mammals contains a highly conserved upstream open reading frame (uORF) within its leader sequence that confers polyamine-regulated suppression of translation on the associated downstream cistron. This regulation is mediated through an interaction {{that depends on the}} amino acid sequence of the uORF-encoded hexapeptide. It remains to be shown whether polyamines participate directly in this interaction or indirectly through a <b>specialized</b> signal <b>transduction</b> pathway. We show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not have a uORF associated with its AdoMetDC gene (SPE 2) and that ribosome loading on the SPE 2 mRNA is not positively influenced by polyamine depletion, as it is in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, the mammalian AdoMetDC uORF, when introduced into a polyamine auxotroph of yeast, conferred polyamine regulation of both translational efficiency and ribosome loading on the associated mRNA. This regulatory activity depended on the amino acid sequence encoded by the fourth and fifth codons of the uORF, as in mammalian cells. The fact that the regulatory properties of this mammalian translational control element are quite similar in both mammalian and yeast cells suggests that a <b>specialized</b> signal <b>transduction</b> pathway is not required. Rather, it seems likely that polyamines may be directly participating in an interaction between the uORF-encoded peptide and a constitutive component of the translation machinery, which leads to inhibition of ribosome activity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSonic Hedgehog (Shh) {{signals are}} transduced into nuclear ratios of Gli {{transcriptional}} activator versus repressor. The initial {{part of this}} process is accomplished by Shh acting through Patched (Ptc) to regulate Smoothened (Smo) activity. The mechanisms by which Ptc regulates Smo, and Smo activity is transduced to processing of Gli proteins remain unclear. Recently, a forward genetic approach in mice identified a role for intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes in Shh signal transduction, downstream of Patched (Ptc) and Rab 23. Here, we show that the retrograde motor for IFT is required in the mouse for the phenotypic expression of both Gli activator and repressor function and for effective proteolytic processing of Gli 3.

It is still uncertain to what extent the functional role of a T cell - as an nterleukin 2 (IL- 2) -producing helper, an IL- 4 -producing helper, or a killer expressing granzymes and perforin - is irreversibly determined by intiathymic events. Another, related question is whether the stimuli required by a cell to induce expression of any of its 'response' genes may also change in development, through maturation of <b>specialized</b> signal <b>transduction</b> pathways.

The present study used light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry to characterize the distribution of two PP 1 isoforms, PP 1 alpha and PP 1 gamma 1, in the rat neostriatum. Both isoforms are heterogeneously distributed in brain with the highest immunoreactivity being found in the neostriatum and hippocampal formation. Further, both isoforms are highly and specifically concentrated in dendritic spines. Weak immunoreactivity is present in dendrites, axons, and some axon terminals. Immunoreactivity for PP 1 alpha is also present in the perikaryal cytoplasm and nuclei of most medium- and large-sized neostriatal neurons. The specific localization of PP 1 in dendritic spines is consistent with a central role for this enzyme in signal transduction.

40|$|Male odors can {{influence}} a female’s reproductive physiology. In the mouse, {{the odor of}} male urine results in an early onset of female puberty. Several volatile and protein pheromones have previously been reported to each account for this bioactivity.

We evaluate the response of wild-type and mutant mice lacking a <b>specialized</b> sensory <b>transduction</b> channel, TrpC 2, and find TrpC 2 function to be necessary for pheromone-mediated uterine growth. We analyze the relative effectiveness of pheromones previously identified to accelerate puberty through direct bioassay and find none to significantly accelerate uterine growth in BALB/cJ females. Complementary to this analysis, we have devised a strategy of partial purification of the uterine growth bioactivity from male urine and applied it to purify bioactivity from three different laboratory strains. The biochemical characteristics of the active fraction of all three strains are inconsistent with that of previously known pheromones.

40|$|The mitotic {{checkpoint}} is a <b>specialized</b> signal <b>transduction</b> pathway {{that contributes}} to the fidelity of chromosome segregation. The signaling of the checkpoint originates from defective kinetochore-microtubule interactions and leads to formation of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), a highly potent inhibitor of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) —the E 3 ubiquitin ligase essential for anaphase onset. Many important questions concerning the MCC and its interaction with APC/C have been intensively investigated and debated in the past 15 years, such as the exact composition of the MCC, how it is assembled during a cell cycle, how it inhibits APC/C, and how the MCC is disassembled to allow APC/C activation. These efforts have culminated in recently reported structure models for human MCC:APC/C supra-complexes at near-atomic resolution that shed light on multiple aspects of the mitotic checkpoint mechanisms. However, confusing statements regarding the MCC are still scattered in the literature, making it difficult for students and scientists alike to obtain a clear picture of MCC composition, structure, function and dynamics.

50|$|In {{order to}} survive, plants {{must be able}} to respond to many biotic and abiotic stresses, {{including}} pathogen attack, piercing/sucking insects, herbivory, and mechanical wounding. These stresses activate <b>specialized</b> signal <b>transduction</b> pathways, which are specific to the stressor and the amount of tissue damage inflicted. Similar to mechanical wounding, chewing insects, such as the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta, one of the major pests of tomato), cause extensive tissue damage activating the jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated response (Walling 2000). This JA-mediated response revolves around the octadecanoid pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of JA and several other potent signaling molecules, and ends in the regulation of two sets of genes whose expression changes over time. The early genes amplify the wounding signal and can be detected 30 minutes to 2 hours after damage (Ryan 2000). Late gene expression can be seen 4-24 hours after wounding. Products of late-response genes act as deterrents to chewing-insect feeding, often by decreasing the nutritional value of the food ingested or interfering with insect gut function (Walling 2000). For example, serine proteinase inhibitors (Pins) interfere with digestive proteases in the insect gut and polyphenol oxidases (PPO) act to decrease the nutritive value of plant leaves after ingestion by herbivores (Johnson et al. 1989; Ryan 2000; Orozco-Cardenas 2001).

They are also required for the consequent colonization of the tissues and for invasion of the uroepithelium. Here, we studied {{the role of the}} <b>specialized</b> signal <b>transduction</b> system CRP-cAMP in the regulation of type 1 fimbriation. Although initially discovered by regulating carbohydrate metabolism, the CRP-cAMP complex controls a major regulatory network in Gram-negative bacteria, including a broad subset of genes spread into different functional categories of the cell. Our results indicate that CRP-cAMP plays a dual role in type 1 fimbriation, affecting both the phase variation process and fimA promoter activity, with an overall repressive outcome on fimbriation. The dissection of the regulatory pathway let us conclude that CRP-cAMP negatively affects FimB-mediated recombination by an indirect mechanism that requires DNA gyrase activity. Moreover, the underlying studies revealed that CRP-cAMP controls the expression of another global regulator in Gram-negative bacteria, the leucine-responsive protein Lrp. CRP-cAMP-mediated repression is limiting the switch from the non-fimbriated to the fimbriated state. Consistently, a drop in the intracellular concentration of cAMP due to altered physiological conditions (e. g. growth in presence of glucose) increases the percentage of fimbriated cells in the bacterial population. We also provide evidence that the repression of type 1 fimbriae by CRP-cAMP occurs during fast growth conditions (logarithmic phase) and is alleviated during slow growth (stationar...|$|R

However, recent reports {{have described the}} presence of embB mutations, especially those at embB codon 306, in isolates susceptible to ethambutol. To clarify the role of embB mutations in ethambutol resistance, we sequenced the ethambutol resistance-determining region in spontaneous ethambutol-resistant mutants. In our study, 66 % of spontaneous mutants contained a single point mutation in embB, with 55 % of these occurring at embB 306. The MIC of ethambutol for spontaneous mutants was increased two- to eightfold relative to the pansusceptible M. tuberculosis strains from which the mutants were generated. To further characterize the role of embB 306 mutations, we directly introduced mutant alleles, embB(M 306 V) or embB(M 306 I), into pansusceptible M. tuberculosis strains and conversely reverted mutant alleles in spontaneous ethambutol-resistant mutants back {{to those of the}} wild type via allelic exchange using <b>specialized</b> linkage <b>transduction.</b> We determined that the MIC of ethambutol was reduced fourfold for three of the four spontaneous ethambutol-resistant embB 306 mutants when the mutant allele was replaced with the wild-type embB allele. The MIC for one of the spontaneous mutants genetically reverted to wild-type embB was reduced by only twofold. When the wild-type embB allele was converted to the mutant allele embB(M 306 V), the ethambutol MIC was increased fourfold, and when the allele was changed to M 306 I, the ethambutol MIC increased twofold. Our data indicate that embB 306 mutations are sufficient to confer ethambutol resistance, and detection of these mutations should be considered in the development of rapid molecular tests...|$|R

The generalized transduction is found within the lytic cycle where units of the bacterial DNA are packaged in a phage capsid. Therefore, when these type of phages infect other bacterial cells, the bacterial DNA is inserted inside. Previously mentioned, bacterial genes can be transferred in generalized transduction.

To determine whether inactivation of other enzymes of the mycolic acid-synthesizing FASII complex also leads to lysis, we characterized the essentiality of two β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthases, KasA and KasB, in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Using <b>specialized</b> <b>transduction</b> for allelic exchange, null kasB mutants, but not kasA mutants, could be generated in Mycobacterium smegmatis, suggesting that unlike kasB, kasA is essential. To confirm the essentiality of kasA, and to detail the molecular events that occur following depletion of KasA, we developed CESTET (conditional expression <b>specialized</b> <b>transduction</b> essentiality test), a genetic tool that combines conditional gene expression and <b>specialized</b> <b>transduction.</b> Using CESTET, {{we were able}} to generate conditional null inhA and kasA mutants. We studied the effects of depletion of KasA in M. smegmatis using the former strain as a reference. Depletion of either InhA or KasA led to cell lysis, but with different biochemical and morphological events prior to lysis. While InhA depletion led to the induction of an 80 -kDa complex containing both KasA and AcpM, the mycobacterial acyl carrier protein, KasA depletion did not induce the same complex. Depletion of either InhA or KasA led to inhibition of α and epoxy mycolate biosynthesis and to accumulation of α′-mycolates. Furthermore, scanning electron micrographs revealed that KasA depletion resulted in the cell surface having a “crumpled” appearance, in contrast to the blebs observed on InhA depletion. Thus, our studies support the further exploration of KasA as a target for mycobacterial-drug development...|$|E

To test whether the neuroligin/β-neurexin junction is related to synapses, we generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies to neuroligin 1.

Quantitative immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that neuroligin 1 is clustered in synaptic clefts and postsynaptic densities. Double immunofluorescence labeling revealed that neuroligin 1 colocalizes with glutamatergic but not γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic synapses. Thus neuroligin 1 is a synaptic cell-adhesion molecule that is enriched in postsynaptic densities where it may recruit receptors, channels, and signal-transduction molecules to synaptic sites of cell adhesion. In addition, the neuroligin/β-neurexin junction may be involved in the specification of excitatory synapses...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} bacilli display two signature features: acid-fast staining and {{the capacity}} to induce long-term latent infections in humans. However, the mechanisms governing these two important processes remain largely unknown. Ser/Thr phosphorylation has recently emerged as an important regulatory mechanism allowing mycobacteria to adapt their cell wall structure/composition in response to their environment. Herein, we evaluated whether phosphorylation of KasB, a crucial mycolic acid biosynthetic enzyme, could modulate acid-fast staining and virulence. Tandem mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that phosphorylation of KasB occurred at Thr 334 and Thr 336 both in vitro and in mycobacteria. Isogenic strains of M. tuberculosis with either a deletion of the kasB gene or a kasB_T 334 D/T 336 D allele, mimicking constitutive phosphorylation of KasB, were constructed by <b>specialized</b> linkage <b>transduction.</b> Biochemical and structural analyses comparing these mutants to the parental strain revealed that both mutant strains had mycolic acids that were shortened by 4 - 6 carbon atoms and lacked trans-cyclopropanation. Together, these results suggested that in M. tuberculosis, phosphorylation profoundly decreases the condensing activity of KasB. Structural/modeling analyses reveal that Thr 334 and Thr 336 are located {{in the vicinity of the}} catalytic triad, which indicates that phosphorylation of these amino acids would result in loss of enzyme activity. Importantly, the kasB_T 334 D/T 336 D phosphomimetic and deletion alleles, in contrast to the kasB_T 334 A/T 336 A phosphoablative allele, completely lost acid-fast staining. Moreover, assessing the virulence of these strains indicated that the KasB phosphomimetic mutant was attenuated in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice following aerosol infection. This attenuation was characterized by the absence of lung pathology. Overall, these results highlight for the first time the role of Ser/Thr kinase-dependent KasB phosphorylation in regulating the later stages of mycolic acid elongation, with important consequences in terms of acid-fast staining and pathogenicity...|$|R
40|$|First {{published}} online: September 20, 2013 BACKGROUND: Improving {{our understanding}} {{of the relationship between the}} genotype and the drug resistance phenotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis will aid the development of more accurate molecular diagnostics for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Studies that use direct genetic manipulation to identify the mutations that cause M. tuberculosis drug resistance are superior to associational studies in elucidating an individual mutation's contribution to the drug resistance phenotype. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature for publications reporting allelic exchange experiments in any of the resistance-associated M. tuberculosis genes. We included studies that introduced single point mutations using <b>specialized</b> linkage <b>transduction</b> or site-directed/in vitro mutagenesis and documented a change in the resistance phenotype. RESULTS: We summarize evidence supporting the causal relationship of 54 different mutations in eight genes (katG, inhA, kasA, embB, embC, rpoB, gyrA and gyrB) and one intergenic region (furA-katG) with resistance to isoniazid, the rifamycins, ethambutol and fluoroquinolones. We observed a significant role for the strain genomic background in modulating the resistance phenotype of 21 of these mutations and found examples of where the same drug resistance mutations caused varying levels of resistance to different members of the same drug class. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review highlights those mutations that have been shown to causally change phenotypic resistance in M. tuberculosis and brings attention to a notable lack of allelic exchange data for several of the genes known to be associated with drug resistance.

Based on the properties of the DNA packaging mechanism of phage P 22 a model for the generation of various types of specialized transducing particles is presented that suggests generation of substantial numbers of specialized transducing genomes which are heterogeneous but only some of which have terminally redundant ends. The primary attachment site, ataA, for phage P 22 in S. typhimurium is located between the genes proA,B and supQ newD. (The newD gene is a substitute gene for the leuD gene, restoring leucine prototrophy of leuD mutant strains.) The proA,B and supQ newD genes are very closely linked and thus cotransducible by generalized transducing particles. Specialized transducing particles can carry either proA,B or supQ newD but not both simultaneously, and thus cannot give rise to cotransduction of the proA,B and supQ newD genes. This difference is used to calculate the frequency of generalized and specialized transducing particles from the observed cotransduction frequency in phage lysates. By this method, very high frequencies of supQ newD (10 (- 2) /PFU) - and proA,B (10 (- 3) /PFU) -specialized transducing particles were detected in lysates produced by induction of lysogenic strains.

By using different recipient strains and phage helper strains, it was possible to show that most specialized transducing particles (ca. 99 %) contain linear genomes that cannot circularize upon injection into a new host cell and that require the presence of an integrated prophage as a site for a recombinational event to give rise to a transductant.

40|$|Fluorescence {{spectroscopy}} {{was used}} to characterize blue light responses from chloroplasts of adaxial guard cells from Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and coleoptile tips from corn (Zea mays). The chloroplast response to blue light was quantified by measurements of the blue light-induced enhancement of a red light-stimulated quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence. In adaxial (upper) guard cells, low fluence rates of blue light applied under saturating fluence rates of red light enhanced the red light-stimulated fluorescence quenching by up to 50 %. In contrast, added blue light did not alter the red light-stimulated quenching from abaxial (lower) guard cells. This response pattern paralleled the blue light sensitivity of stomatal opening in the two leaf surfaces. An action spectrum for the blue light-induced enhancement of the red light-stimulated quenching showed a major peak at 450 nm and two minor peaks at 420 and 470 nm. This spectrum matched closely an action spectrum for blue light-stimulated stomatal opening. Coleoptile chloroplasts also showed an enhancement by blue light of red light-stimulated quenching. The action spectrum of this response, showing a major peak at 450 nm, a minor peak at 470 nm, and a shoulder at 430 nm, closely matched an action spectrum for blue light-stimulated coleoptile phototropism. Both action spectra match the absorption spectrum of zeaxanthin, a chloroplastic carotenoid recently implicated in blue light photoreception of both guard cells and coleoptiles. The remarkable similarity between the action spectra for the blue light responses of guard cells and coleoptile chloroplasts and the spectra for blue light-stimulated stomatal opening and phototropism, coupled to the recently reported evidence on a role of zeaxanthin in blue light photoreception, indicates that the guard cell and coleoptile chloroplasts <b>specialize</b> in sensory <b>transduction...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{recombinant}} DNA molecules {{were constructed}} from plasmid RSF 2124 and the EcoRI fragment of lambda DNA containing the genes responsible for prophage integration. The {{presence of these}} genes in recombinant plasmids was detected genetically. lambda int-gene was shown to be expressed in either orientation of insertion in the plasmid. We found that recombinant plasmid was able to integrate into chromosome of lambda lysogens. The integration of plasmid into host chromosome was demonstrated by contransduction of chromosome and plasmid markers using generalized transducer P 1 and by <b>specialized</b> <b>transduction</b> with lambda phages...|$|E
