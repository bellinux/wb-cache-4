About 80 tests were conducted on 10 pound lots totaling over 1000 dozen pairs of stockings, besides tests on loads up to 500 pounds each. Operating conditions employed in boiling-off hosiery are reviewed.

40|$|Travel along unpaved roads is {{not always}} assured, because of their low standards, poor riding quality, impassability in wet weather, and the danger in the {{quantity}} of dust that is generated by moving vehicles and wind. Stabilisation with electrochemical-based non-traditional soil stabilisation additives (chemical additives) may offer {{a solution to this}} continual problem. The objective {{of this paper is to}} report on the strength behaviour of a typical marginal quality weathered quartz gravel material treated with two electrochemical-based non-traditional soil stabilisation additives, enzyme and <b>sulphonated</b> <b>oil</b> to assess their potential value for unpaved road construction under wet and dry conditions. These treated panels were trafficked under 100 vehicles per day. The evaluation was done by means of laboratory tests and field investigations for three years. The characteristics of the natural material and the binding ability of the non-traditional soil stabilisation additives were established from the laboratory testing. Density and moisture, and the strength development of the treated material were determined from field investigations. These two non-traditional soil stabilisation additives appear to have affected the particles and their water component, hence an increase in densities was achieved. The degree of formation and paste surrounding the particles appeared to have varied with time and differed between the additives. An increase in density in the <b>sulphonated</b> <b>oil</b> additive treated panel occurred three months after construction, and a further increase was again noticed eight months after construction (five months thereafter). Up to eight months after construction, the enzyme additive treated panel showed a significant decrease in density, but showed a slight increase thirty-one months after construction. This increase in densities might probably be because of further densification by traffic. The variations in density were attributed to testing variability. In the in situ and soaked DCP-CBR strength measurements, the <b>sulphonated</b> <b>oil</b> additive treated panel reached its maximum in situ strength at two months after construction, while the enzyme additive treated panel reached its maximum in situ strength at five months after construction. Up to eight months after construction, both treated panels indicated a significant decrease in both the in situ and soaked DCP-CBR strength conditions. The decrease was attributed to rain. There was, however, little evidence to show that the additives had improved the material, with the control panel being consistently stronger in both the in situ and soaked DCP-CBR conditions. The importance of considering the time factor in the strength development of non-traditional stabilisation test techniques, as well as the number of tests, was highlighted in the results of this study. The natural variability of the materials used in this type of study is generally high, and the precision of the test method is typically quite low. On this basis, it is usually difficult to draw definite conclusions. This paper is based on the first author’s MSc in Applied Science project report submitted to the University of Pretoria.

40|$|Abstract: Dandruff, {{also known}} as seborrhea sicca, pityriasis capitis or sicca capitis, {{can be defined as}} chronic non-inflammatory scaling of the scalp, or an {{abnormality}} in the desquamation process which occurs on the scalp (Willet, 2010). It is said that dandruff affects at least 50 % of the world’s adult population and about 15 – 20 % of the world’s total population (Prambhamanju et al., 2009). Dandruff is usually marked by flaking as well as itching and irritation of the scalp which can also lead to greasiness. Dandruff can lead to physiological and psychological issues and can be very distressing and embarrassing for sufferers, causing low self-esteem and social problems (Nowicki, 2006). According to the literature, pale <b>sulphonated</b> shale <b>oil</b> has widespread dermatological uses as it is believed to have anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-seborrheic properties (Lunar Pharmaceutics, 2014). The aim {{of the study was to}} ascertain the effect of sodium shale <b>oil</b> <b>sulphonate</b> 1 % shampoo on the appearance of dandruff. Forty participants completed the study and participants were of both genders between the ages of 18 and 45. The study compromised of 16 days with 3 visits each 8 days apart. The study design consisted of double-blind, placebo-controlled study where participants were grouped into matching pairs based on the severity of the condition. Participants were then randomly assigned to the treatment or placebo group. At each visit, participants were assessed using the following assessment measures: a Visual Analogue Scale for the participant comprising of scaling, irritation, itching, greasiness and global impression; a Visual Analogue Scale for the researcher comprising of scaling, irritation, greasiness and global impression as well as an Adherent Scalp Flake Score grading completed by the researcher. Parametric and non-parametric analyses were used and the results of the study demonstrated overall statistically significant improvement in all parameters for the treatment and placebo groups but the extent of improvement was greater in the treatment group. However, at individual visits, only certain parameters expressed statistically significant changes when compared to the placebo group [...] . M. Tech. (Homoeopathy...|$|R
