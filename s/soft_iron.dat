5|$|Hastati (singular: Hastatus) were a {{class of}} {{infantry}} employed in the armies of the early Roman Republic who originally fought as spearmen, and later as swordsmen. These soldiers were the staple unit after Rome threw off Etruscan rule. They were originally some of the poorest men in the legion, and could afford only modest equipment—light chainmail and other miscellaneous equipment. The Senate supplied their soldiers with only a short stabbing sword, the gladius, and their distinctive squared shield, the scuta. The hastatus was typically equipped with these, and several <b>soft</b> <b>iron</b> tipped throwing spears called pila. This doubled their effectiveness, {{not only as a}} strong leading edge to their maniple, but also as a stand-alone missile troop. Later, the hastati contained the younger men rather than just the poorer, though most men of their age were relatively poor. Their usual position was the first battle line. They fought in a quincunx formation, supported by lighter infantry. The enemy was allowed to penetrate the first battle line consisting of hastati, after which the enemy would deal with the more hardened, seasoned soldiers, the principes. They were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms of 107 BC.|$|E

25|$|Rather {{than using}} <b>soft</b> <b>iron</b> armor, {{as on the}} earlier Type 87, the {{designers}} chose to use steel plate armor developed by the Nihon Seikosho Company (JSW). The type of armor {{was referred to as}} 'Niseko steel', an abbreviation of Nihonseikosho.|$|E
25|$|Improvements on this {{followed}} {{developments in}} metallurgy: steel coulters and shares with <b>softer</b> <b>iron</b> mouldboards to prevent breakage, the chilled plough (an early example of surface-hardened steel), and eventually mouldboards with faces {{strong enough to}} dispense with the coulter.|$|R

25|$|The pipe wrench, or Stillson wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning <b>soft</b> <b>iron</b> {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. The pipe wrench was invented by Daniel C. Stillson in 1869.|$|E
25|$|If {{used in a}} {{location}} with strong magnetic fields, which can curve electron paths, steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain, photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of <b>soft</b> <b>iron</b> or mu-metal. This magnetic shield is often maintained at cathode potential. When this is the case, the external shield must also be electrically insulated {{because of the high}} voltage on it. Photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first dynode are especially sensitive to magnetic fields.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, while {{heating and}} folding serves to even out the {{distribution}} of carbon throughout the blade, {{a small amount of}} carbon is also 'burnt out' of the steel in this process; repeated folding will eventually remove most of the carbon, turning the material into <b>softer</b> <b>iron</b> and reducing its ability to hold a sharp edge. This can be combated with carburization, though it does not produce even carbon distribution, partially defeating the purpose of folding.|$|R

25|$|The {{direction}} of magnetization of the wedges in (A) can be calculated using {{a set of rules}} given by Abele and allows for great freedom {{in the shape of the}} cavity. Another class of design is the magnetic mangle (B), proposed by Coey and Cugat, in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that their magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod design. This design greatly increases access to the region of uniform field, at the expense of the volume of uniform field being smaller than in the cylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the number of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in many possibilities including a dynamically variable field and various dipolar configurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are closely related to the k=2 Halbach cylinder. Other very simple designs for a uniform field include separated magnets with <b>soft</b> <b>iron</b> return paths, as shown in figure (C).|$|E
25|$|Hyder Ali, {{prince of}} Mysore, {{developed}} war bombs with an important change: {{the use of}} metal pipes to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered <b>soft</b> <b>iron</b> he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was {{much higher than the}} earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometer). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Hyder Ali's son, Tippu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.|$|E

50|$|Steel {{with less}} than 0.6% Carbon content cannot be {{hardened}} enough by simple heat-treatment to make useful hardened-steel tools.

50|$|Yale’s other {{significant}} invention is the Chilled Iron Bank Doors and Vaults. Previous bank doors, vaults, and safes had plates of hard cast behind <b>soft</b> wrought <b>iron,</b> {{which can be}} easily broken using {{the right amount of}} leverage and skillful vault-picking. The hard casts are often rigid and fragile, and susceptible to heavy tinkering. Yale used a lattice screen, or basketwork of <b>soft,</b> tough wrought <b>iron,</b> instead of the hard cast, infused in the metal covering of the vaults, thus producing incomparably strong corners and surfaces that Yale presented to be unbreakable.|$|R

500|$|The density {{difference}} between lead (11.32g/cm3) and bismuth (9.78g/cm3) {{is small enough}} that for many ballistics and weighting applications, bismuth can substitute for lead. For example, it can replace lead as a dense material in fishing sinkers. It {{has been used as}} a replacement for lead in shot, bullets and less-lethal riot gun ammunition. The Netherlands, Denmark, England, [...] Wales, the US, and many other countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds, as many birds are prone to lead poisoning owing to mistaken ingestion of lead (instead of small stones and grit) to aid digestion, or even prohibit the use of lead for all hunting, such as in the Netherlands. Bismuth-tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead. (Another less expensive but also more poorly performing alternative is [...] "steel" [...] shot, which is actually <b>soft</b> <b>iron.)</b> Bismuth's lack of malleability does, however, make it unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets.|$|E

50|$|In most {{techniques}} {{the basic}} materials, generally iron and/or steel, are shaped {{into a bar}} or billet first. At this stage if several metals are to be used they will be combined by welding to form the billet. In some techniques, notably the traditional folded steel blades of China, Korea, and Japan, the billet might be drawn, folded and welded back on itself creating layers of steel of different types. In others longer bars or rods of steel and iron might be welded together, edge to edge, to create the basic billet placing the <b>softer</b> <b>iron</b> inside with the steel at the core and edges. Once the billet is created it is drawn out farther, generally tapering to the edge(s) and point. The technique of fullering {{might be used to}} create a ridge or ridges {{down the length of the}} blade. Whether single or multiple, the ridge's primary purpose to give the blade greater structural strength relative to its mass.|$|R
2500|$|Bell's {{telephone}} transmitter (microphone) {{consisted of a}} double electromagnet, in front of which a membrane, stretched on a ring, carried an oblong piece of <b>soft</b> <b>iron</b> cemented to its middle. A funnel-shaped mouthpiece directed the voice sounds upon the membrane, and as it vibrated, the <b>soft</b> <b>iron</b> [...] "armature" [...] induced corresponding currents in the coils of the electromagnet. These currents, after traversing the wire, passed through the receiver which consisted of an electromagnet in a tubular metal can having one end partially closed by a thin circular disc of <b>soft</b> <b>iron.</b> When the undulatory current passed through the coil of this electromagnet, the disc vibrated, thereby creating sound waves in the air.|$|E

50|$|The iron shank {{was the key}} to the {{function}} of the pilum. The weapon had a hard pyramidal tip but the shank was made of <b>softer</b> <b>iron.</b> This softness would cause the shank to bend after impact, thus rendering the weapon useless to the enemy who might throw it back. However, there were many cases where the whole shank was hardened, making the pilum more suitable as a close quarters melee weapon, while also making it useful for enemy soldiers to pick up and throw back. Also, if the pilum struck a shield it might embed itself and thus the bending of the shank would force the enemy to discard their shield as it would render the shield impractical to use without removing the pilum from the shield, which in itself would be time consuming. Even if the shank did not bend, the pyramidal tip still made it difficult to pull out.|$|R

2500|$|From {{the third}} century BC, the Roman legion added a skirmisher type of soldier to its {{tactical}} formation. The Velites were light infantry armed with a short sword (the gladius or pugio), a small round shield and several small javelins. These javelins were called veruta (singular [...] "verutum"). The Velites typically drew near the enemy, hurled javelins against its formation and then retreated behind the legion's heavier infantry. The Velites were considered highly effective in turning back war elephants, on account of discharging a hail of javelins at some range and not presenting a [...] "block" [...] that could be trampled on or otherwise smashed - unlike the close-order infantry behind them. At the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, the javelin-throwing Velites proved their worth and were no doubt critical in helping to herd Hannibal's war elephants through the formation to be slaughtered. The Velites would slowly have been either disbanded or re-equipped as more-heavily armed legionaries from the time when Gaius Marius and other Roman generals reorganised the army in the late second and early first centuries BC. Their role would most likely have been taken by irregular auxiliary troops as the Republic expanded overseas. The verutum was a cheaper missile weapon than the pilum.
