A multi-disciplinary panel from four European countries developed <b>structure</b> <b>indicators</b> in three steps: identification and listing of indicators, remote ranking of indicators using multi-criteria scoring, selection of indicators in a face-to-face consensus meeting. Additionally, the top-ten indicators were identified as a minimal set of key indicators. A survey {{was sent to the}} directors of antimicrobial stewardship programmes in European hospitals. The yes/no answers for the indicators were transformed into numbers in order to calculate the total scores. A list of 58 indicators was selected and categorised into the following topics: antimicrobial stewardship services (12 items), tools (16 items), human resources and mandate (6 items), health care personnel development (4 items), basic diagnostic capabilities (6 items), microbiological rapid tests (2 items), evaluation of microbiological drug resistance data (3 items), antibiotic consumption control (5 items) and drug use monitoring (4 items). The indicator scores, reported by 11 pilot hospitals from five European countries, ranged from 32 to 50 (maximum score = 58) and from 5 to 10 points (maximum score = 10) for, respectively, the complete and the top-ten list.

Unfortunately, habitat values and ecological quality of these areas are often challenged by consecutive urbanization. The assessment of changing structure and function of an urban open space system is crucial in maintaining livable cities.

40|$|Domestic {{cattle grazing}} as a {{disturbance}} factor to the vegetation structure is investigated. It is {{concluded that the}} process of heterospecific attraction plays as important a role as vegetation structure in predicting waterfowl assemblage patterns. The study site, an estuarine wetland in an urban zone in Helsinki, is studied during one staging period. Two sets of shorelines are focused on, grazed and ungrazed. Avian assemblages are compared in both types of shorelines based on variables of community structure and habitat resource use. The two most influential variables are aquatic invertebrate biomass index as food supply, and bare shoreline proportion as habitat <b>structure</b> <b>indicator.</b> The process of competition as regulating factor in forming avian aggregations is ruled out by confirming that sufficient amounts of habitat resources, food and space are available. The co-occurrence patterns of foraging guilds are analyzed. Heterogeneous vegetation structure, combined with social attraction, influences avian distribution patterns. Niche partitioning is absent across the whole landscape as invertebrate food resource is not a limiting factor. Microhabitat use within plots is evenly distributed. The constantly popular microhabitats are sections of the grazed shorelines where resource partitioning is absent. Avian habitat preferences are shaped by extent of available bare shoreline and the presence of other waterfowl. The latter effect is confirmed both as conspecific and heterospecific attraction. It is the first time this wetland, which is also a designated Natura 2000 and Ramsar site, is being investigated for wildlife community dynamics. The site does not suffer from major environmental threats and has potential for more waterfowl consumers.
