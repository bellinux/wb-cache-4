25|$|New Zealand's {{first tour}} of England {{for nine years}} <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} the weakest of the Test-playing nations taking on the side that could probably {{claim to be the}} strongest. In home series England had successively beaten Australia and the West Indies, and a combination of fast bowling from Brian Statham, Fred Trueman and others, spin bowling from Jim Laker and Tony Lock, and apparently reliable batting led by captain Peter May, Colin Cowdrey and Tom Graveney had made them a formidable side.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the book when Cal discusses his family's history and actions prior to his birth, he speaks in an androgynous voice, with limited omniscience; he acknowledges that he is fabricating some of the details. John Mullan, University College London's professor of English and a contributor to The Guardian, wrote that by permitting Cal to be unrealistically aware of fellow characters' thoughts, Eugenides intentionally contravenes an elementary standard in storytelling fiction. In the novel's closing pages, Cal provides minute details about his father's dying moments and thoughts in a nonsensical car accident even though he is several thousand miles from the scene and only learns of the tragedy from his brother. Cal has the ability to dwell in the minds of others because as a female who has become a male, his identity is not confined by his own body. According to Mullan, this [...] "mobility of identification becomes a narrative principle" [...] and is thoroughly exploited in Middlesex. The novel follows the principle that people are molded by events prior to their birth, and Eugenides explores a character's prenatal life in terms of his or her genes; the narrator is, however, subject to the principle that whatever he does not know is of his imagination. As such, contradictory statements highlight the unreliable nature of Cal's narration. While narrating the story that pre-dates his birth, he remarks, [...] "Of course, a narrator in my position (prefetal at the time) can't be entirely sure about any of this." [...] However, he later says, [...] "I alone, from the private box of my primordial egg, <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on." [...] Cal's dubious omniscience, doubtful narration, and parodies combine to show that his unreliability is an act of mischief.|$|E

2500|$|In another {{significant}} moment in his officiating career, Strom was saved from an angry mob by legendary center Wilt Chamberlain {{during a game}} played in Memphis, Tennessee in the mid-1960s. Strom had made a call that went against the St. Louis Hawks and at halftime was called a [...] "gutless bastard" [...] by Hawks general manager Irv Gack at the scorer's table. The fiery official asked Gack to repeat the comment as he {{reached across the table}} and grabbed Gack by the shirt. Fans started coming down from the seats while Chamberlain, playing for the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on. He stepped across the table, picked Strom up and said, [...] "C'mon Earl. Let's {{get the hell out of}} here." ...|$|E

Social media sites including Facebook also featured rumours of further disturbances or details surrounding known disturbances which were later proven to be inaccurate; for instance there were rumours of disturbances {{in the town of}} Dudley and at the nearby Merry Hill Shopping Centre, but no incidents in these areas were detected by police. Rumours of a hospital being targeted by rioters in Birmingham were also proven to be wrong, as were rumours of disturbances in the Heath Town district of Wolverhampton, which had witnessed a serious riot in May 1989.|$|E

2500|$|During 6 March, the III Flak Korps {{anti-aircraft}} gun crews emplaced {{on top of}} the [...] Erpeler Ley, strategically overlooking the Ludendorff Bridge, had been ordered by the Luftwaffe to help defend Koblenz. The replacement unit was not motorized and was placed on the outskirts of Remagen. As the Americans advanced towards the Rhine on the night of 6–7 March, 14 men from the {{anti-aircraft gun}} crews deserted. Bratge only learned about the replacement unit's presence on 7 March when he <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> left of the unit manhandling its guns across the bridge. Aware of the Americans' impending arrival, he angrily ordered the unit's Luftwaffe commander to get the weapons moved to the top of Erpeler Ley as quickly as possible, but the units were not yet in place at 2:00 pm when the first Americans arrived.|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting the words, [...] "And Phineas, {{the son of}} Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it," [...] in [...] the Gemara {{asked what}} Phineas saw. [...] Rav said that Phineas <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> {{happening}} and remembered the law governing intimacy with an idolatrous woman, and asked Moses whether he had not taught that zealots may punish one who cohabits with an idolatrous woman. [...] Moses replied that he who reads the letter should be the agent {{to carry out its}} instructions. [...] Alternatively, Samuel said that Phineas saw that (in the words of [...] ) [...] "There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord," [...] which he interpreted to mean that whenever the Divine Name is being profaned, one may relax the general principle that one must defer to one's teacher — the giver of wisdom — and go ahead to make a legal decision in the presence of one's teacher. [...] Rabbi Isaac said in Rabbi Eleazar's name that Phineas saw the Angel of Death wreaking destruction among the people, and (in the words of [...] ) [...] "he rose up out of the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand." [...] Thus, Phineas must not have had his spear when he sat among the congregation, and from this we learn that one may not enter a house of learning with weapons.|$|E
