40|$|The {{perceived}} {{importance of}} Corporate Governance {{has grown in}} recent years and two key concepts that have been associated with good governance are transparency and accountability (Werther and Chandler 2006 : 77).

Takala (2007 : 4) called for a more radical approach to studying business practice and the role of business within a wider society in order to challenge the dominant discourse. This paper responds to that challenge by exploring the relationship between business ethics, corporate social responsibility and governance, but rather than taking the dominant functionalist approach, the focus is on a more critical conception of organisation. Based on a study of a number of firms with radical or alternative governance structures I argue that alongside transparency and accountability a key feature of <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> <b>practice</b> is a transformation of power structures.

Under mild conditions, (3) the firm produces the socially optimal quantity and partially pro-visions the public good, without intervention by a social planner, and (4) decreasing marginal production costs increases public goods as much as decreasing marginal ex-ternalities.

30|$|This study {{provides}} understanding {{of factors that}} affect US consumers’ intentions to patronize retail apparel brands engaged in corporate social responsibility (CSR). The study utilizes a dual theoretical framework comprised {{of the theory of}} reasoned action (TRA) and Schwartz’s value theory. Data were collected via a web-based survey from a national sample of 407 US consumers. Findings revealed that moral norms, subjective norms, and attitudes were all important predictors of US consumers’ intentions to patronize retail apparel brands engaged in CSR. Overall, {{the results of this study}} provide important theoretical implications for extending the TRA to include measures of self-transcendent values (universalism and benevolence) and moral norms in the context of consumers’ ethical decision making. The findings also provide important practical implications for retail apparel brands planning to incorporate CSR policies in their corporate agenda. It is proposed that retail apparel brands should integrate CSR related information in their strategic marketing activities to increase consumer awareness of its <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices,</b> which in turn may enhance brand image.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} discussions about ethics {{beginning}} with a fair and fundamental question: “What is ethics all about?” It {{is the same as}} morality, or is kind of a soft law that imposes values but without enforcing them? What is the contribution of the society in imposing values and ethical standards, and how business is involved? Ethical standards are applied in business word, differing from social responsibilities that business has in the social environment where it operates. To better exemplify those concepts the researcher goes through one of the largest companies that offers wireless communications, Vodafone Albania; also one of the world’s largest mobile telecommunication operators. The bright side of social responsibilities is associated in some cases by regressive informal standards applied to all investors and new businesses in the country. The cost of informality is paid in full by the society diminishing the values of social responsibilities and ethical standards applied by business organizations. Even though, Vodafone has successfully implemented social responsiveness initiatives through cause promotions initiatives, corporate social marketing, cause related marketing, company philanthropy, community volunteering, and <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> that support social causes to improve community well-being and protect the environment...|$|R
30|$|Several {{important}} marketing implications {{emerged from}} this study for retail apparel brands engaged in CSR or planning to engage in CSR in the future. First, {{this study showed that}} values and norms are integral in consumer ethical decision making process. To target more ethically aware consumers, companies should adequately incorporate their CSR activities in their marketing communications. Secondly, consumer segmentation and understanding the attitudes of consumers are important in formulating marketing strategies for retail apparel brands. Findings of this study propose that brands would benefit from investing in identifying the right target market segments who place high importance their self transcendent values and moral norms and create targeted marketing strategies. By engaging in CSR activities and effectively promoting retail apparel brands’ <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> image, brands can leverage the social value created. These actions would directly benefit the financial bottom-line of the brand along with increasing the firm’s brand equity. The provision of information regarding retail apparel brands’ <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> may also positively influence consumers’ patronage intentions. Thus, findings of the present study demonstrate that if retail apparel brands effectively promote information regarding their responsible practices, consumers {{may be more likely to}} take them into account during their purchase decisions.|$|R

At a time when natural resources are consumed faster than they can be renewed, when the gap between rich and poor deepens, when the issue of sustainable development and <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> are becoming a priority, the phenomena of ethical consumption and ethical consumer behaviour play a more prominent role in marketing theory and practice research.

Beyond their profit objectives, {{they are not}} only increasingly exhorted to address social and environmental issues associated with their business activities but also asked to play a constructive role in fighting against problems such as human misery and global ecological deterioration. Despite their rising importance in the conduct of business, the dynamic and necessarily multipartite processes underlying the integration of CSR in corporate strategies and operations – or CSR development processes – are still under-explored. In this context, the central objective of this dissertation is to contribute to a better comprehension of these processes. For this purpose, we introduce a threefold perspective on CSR development. We first adopt a company-focused approach to explain the interconnections between CSR development and cultural and organizational adaptations of companies. Then we focus on the stakeholder side of CSR development to analyze the nature of stakeholders’ motivation to influence CSR development at companies and the strategies they use to do so.

However, the role of the private sector in development cooperation is more disputed, from proponents’ claim that supporting the growth and development of (formal) business is at the heart of what aid should do to antagonists’ view that aid could and should be used better than to increase profits for business. The present report is not about private sector development in partner countries per se. It studies the extent to which actors in the business sector can act as partners in development cooperation to help fulfil the objectives of aid.

Such partnerships, referred to as Joint Development Initiatives (JDI), are expected to realize mutual gains. Potential gains for public actors include an increase in reach and improved efficiency in delivery; additional (private) financial resources and innovative capacity. Potential gains for private sector actors include the emergence of new firms and markets when prohibitive risk levels are lowered through public involvement; market access and higher turnover for existing firms; and more <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices,</b> increasing the sustainability of firms...|$|R

Typically, these efforts emphasize the central importance of ethics within the curriculum, including specific principles such as social responsibility, sustainability, stewardship, and social justice. With this research, we focus on social responsibility because it is an emerging business philosophy that constitutes a central theme in the Jesuit business curriculum. As Jesuit business programs continue to emphasize social responsibility in the curriculum, it becomes imperative to evaluate the effects of this mission-driven effort on Jesuit-educated students.

Banking institutions are now competing {{on the basis}} of services rather than {{on the basis of}} physical products as it is hard to distinguish between products of competing brands in a given product category. It is the service offered by the banks that manifests true value. Service innovation involves intangible resources for a more radical service logic perspective that challenges the conventional attribute-based view of services delivery designs. It goes beyond the conventional boundaries of product innovativeness and involves assimilation of improved service processes by means of designing and improvising service delivery systems. In fact, the Malaysian banking industry has witnessed radical transformations based on many innovations in products, processes, services, business models, technology, and delivery systems. The pervasive influence of information and communication technology has revolutionized in banking. There has been relatively little research investigated the appropriate service innovations that influence firm performance in Malaysian banking industry. Thus, this research paper attempts a look at identifying the initiatives of Maybank Malaysia toward sustainability through a planned and systematic service innovation.
