It has been usually {{assumed that the}} initial state is a statistical mixture of sterile <b>sneutrinos</b> and anti-sneutrinos with equal abundances. We calculate the lepton asymmetry due to the most general initial mixture. The usually assumed equal mixture produces a small, but sufficient, lepton asymmetry which {{is proportional to the}} ratio of the supersymmetry breaking scale over the Majorana scale. A more generic mixture, still with equal contents of <b>sneutrinos</b> and anti <b>sneutrinos,</b> yields an unsuppressed lepton asymmetry.

50|$|Typically {{the dark}} matter {{candidate}} of the MSSM is an admixture of the electroweak gauginos and Higgsinos and is called a neutralino.

5000|$|A very {{attractive}} way to motivate R-parity {{is with a}} B − L continuous gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken at a scale inaccessible to current experiments. A continuous [...] forbids renormalizable terms which violate B and L.
