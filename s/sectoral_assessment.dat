30|$|Construction of {{narratives}} regarding {{global warming}} and climate change has long been rooted in natural sciences—an attempt to understand the biophysical processes. This has involved monitoring of El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) and other oceanic and atmospheric predictors of climate (Yasunaka and Hawana 2005; Hasternrath et al. 2004); and <b>sectoral</b> <b>assessment</b> of impacts of climate change (Fabeku and Okogbue 2014; Tonnang et al. 2010; Kundezewicz et al. 2008; Hansen and Indeje 2004). Biophysical assessment of global warming has led to improvement {{in the understanding of}} interactions between atmosphere, sea, and land surfaces; advances in modeling and prediction of the global climate system. This has laid the foundation for adaptation (Hansen 2005). Indeed, the idea of climate change has been universalized—generalized (Hulme 2008). The generalization of climate change may apply to the physical drivers (such as El Niño southern oscillation), global-scale impacts (such as sea level rise), and on global benefits of mitigation to climate change (Locatelli 2011). Although universalization is in line with globalization, it fails to account for the geographical diversity of the physical and human environments. Understanding of climate change can be improved when the physical dimensions are allowed to be interpreted by their cultural meanings.|$|E
40|$|Attaining deep {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emission reductions in industry {{in order to}} support a stringent climate change control target will be difficult without recourse to CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). Using the insights from a long-term bottom-up energy systems model, and undertaking a <b>sectoral</b> <b>assessment,</b> we investigated the importance of CCS in the industrial sector. Under climate policy aimed at limiting atmospheric concentration of GHGs to 650 ppm CO(2) e, costs could increase fivefold when CCS is excluded from the portfolio of mitigation option measures in the industry sector as compared to when CCS is excluded in the power sector. This effect is driven largely by the lack of alternatives for deep emission reductions in industry. Our main policy conclusion is that a broader recognition of CCS in industrial applications in both current policy discussions and research, development, and demonstration funding programmes is justified. In recognition of the heterogeneity of the many types of industrial production processes, the size and location of industrial CO 2 sources, the specific need for CCS-retrofitting, and the exposure of most industrial sectors to international trade, policies aimed at supporting CCS must distinguish between the different challenges faced by the power and industrial sectors...|$|E

To do so, we seek to relate CCMT patent counts to two specific headline targets: (1) achieving 20 % of gross final energy consumption from renewables, and (2) achieving a 20 % increase in energy efficiency.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to derive {{an assessment of the}} potential climate change impacts on a global city - in this case the 31 county region that comprises the New York City metropolitan area. This study comprises one of the regional components that contribute to the ongoing U. S. National Assessment: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change and is an application of state-of-the-art climate change science to a set of linked <b>sectoral</b> <b>assessment</b> analyses for the Metro East Coast (MEC) region. We illustrate how three interacting elements of global cities react and respond to climate variability and change with a broad conceptual model. These elements include: people (e. g., socio- demographic conditions), place (e. g., physical systems), and pulse (e. g., decision-making and economic activities). The model assumes that a comprehensive assessment of potential climate change can be derived from examining the impacts within each of these elements and at their intersections. Thus, the assessment attempts to determine the within-element and the inter-element effects. Five interacting sector studies representing the three intersecting elements are evaluated. They include the Coastal Zone, Infrastructure, Water Supply, Public Health, and Institutional Decision-making. Each study assesses potential climate change impacts on the sector and on the intersecting elements, through the analysis of the following parts: 1. Current conditions of sector in the region; 2. Lessons and evidence derived from past climate variability; 3. Scenario predictions affecting sector; potential impacts of scenario predictions; 4. Knowledge/information gaps and critical issues including identification of additional research questions, effectiveness of modeling efforts, equity of impacts, potential non-local interactions, and policy recommendations; and 5.

40|$|Some {{would say}} that land use plans are the dinosaurs of {{planning}} policy. And indeed, in almost every country in continental Europe land use plans emerged as main instruments in the earliest/almost prehistoric periods of organic planning legislation. But unlike the dinosaurs, land use plans have managed to survive {{in most of these}} countries and they have adapted successfully until now as some kind of living fossils. That is why we prefer to see them as crocodiles. Like crocodiles, land use plans appear quite frightening because of their non contemporary unattractive look and their lethal/legal power. Unfortunately, similar to the gradual extinction of crocodiles because of climate change, land use plans seem to become endangered and mainly too because of drastic changes in contextual factors. Since their features seem rather unappealing at first sight, acolytes of crocodiles as well as land use plans rarely raise their voices in the debate about their survival. However, this contribution wants to change strategy. It consciously ignores the characteristics of land use plans that might make them vulnerable. Instead, it addresses three main contextual aspects of its questionable survival. In other words it focuses on the destructive ways in which planners, policy makers and citizens more and more position land use plans as planning instruments. First, planners and policy makers seem to have almost blind faith in the power of land use plans. The latter are still too often considered, by planners as well as policy makers, as the universal solution of each planning process. This dogmatic belief burdens land use plans with impossible expectations since it ignores the original ambition of land use plans, namely offering a framework for the assessment of building permits. It also neglects the role and position of other policy instruments in consolidating the outcomes of a planning process. Secondly, convinced of the robustness of land use plans, {{in the last two decades}} policy makers in closely related policy domains such as for instance environmental, nature conservation and cultural heritage policy, have legally linked their own <b>sectoral</b> <b>assessment</b> tools to the approval process of land use plans. Despite the integrating character of planning, this strategy has led primarily to a formal overload of land use plans with sectoral policy goals what makes them obese and vulnerable. Finally, the sensitivity of individual citizens for interference of government in their private property rights has grown tremendously, even when this interference is inspired by public interests. The combination of government’s preference for land use plans as a tool to limit these rights on the one hand and the vulnerability of these plans because of the lethal amount of linked sectoral policies on the other hand, make land use plans ideal subjects for judicial procedures. Already weakened because of the combination of the first two aspects, land use plans are easy preys. Before officially declaring land use plans extinct, this contribution pleads for a drastic sanitation of the societal and political context in which land use plans have to function. We want to prevent these crocodiles from extinction because, in our opinion, land use plans still have an optimistic and meaningful life expectancy. But as crocodiles have adapted to and need a specific climate, land use plans need to be strictly used for the purposes they were generated for originally...|$|E

40|$|Assessing {{the impact}} of macro-level policy driven land use changes on {{regional}} sustainability is an important task that can facilitate complex decision making processes of introducing reforms. The research work demonstrates the ability of Sustainability Impact Assessment Tool (SIAT), a meta-model, in conducting ex ante spatially explicit cross <b>sectoral</b> impact <b>assessments</b> of changes in common agricultural policy (CAP). The meta-model is able to appraise impacts of CAP amendments on land use and their repercussions on multiple indicators of sustainability. The presented study comprehensively analyses the possible impacts of discontinuing direct financial support to farmers under CAP. The simulations of the meta-model are able to reveal the land use changes both at EU and regional levels {{as well as to}} bring forth the subsequent changes in a number of indicators representing the regional sustainability (for five case study regions). In a nutshell, the simulations indicate that a reduction in direct support brings in general, a decrease in farmed area, an increase in forested land, less fluctuation in natural vegetation coverage, increase in abandoned arable land area and negligible changes in built-up area despite regionally diverging land use trends. The simulated changes in sustainability indicators for the study regions in consequence to these land use changes show that the discontinuation of subsidies evokes responses that are in general climate friendly (reduction in methane and N 2 O emissions, diminishing energy use and reduction in global warming potential), economically beneficial (increase in gross value of agriculture) and socially desired (decrease in unemployment rate) as well as environmentally harmful (increase in pesticide use). Even though the appraisals of diversity indicators such as forest deadwood and farmland birds are not conclusive for all regions, the changes are positive for the former indicator and slightly negative for the latter in general. The trade-offs among these regional sustainability indicators using their directional associations are also presented for a comprehensive assessment of the impacts. JRC.

40|$|The chapter Thinking through complex {{values is}} part of the book Cerreta M., Concilio G., Monno V., Making Strategies in Spatial Planning. Knowledge and Values, that {{contains}} discussion of specific issues in urban planning which require new practices and approaches. The interdisciplinary material is supported by practical experiences. Includes useful references and practical examples of integration between strategic planning and evaluations. The book aims to improve decision-making processes in different urban contexts, and discusses strategic spatial planning with emphasis on the role of values and cognitions dynamics within the planning-evaluation interplay. In the book, values and cognitions dynamics are investigated as crucial aspects of planning practices devoted to the development of strategic actions strictly linked to spatial contexts. Different methodologies and approaches are examined to support collaborative decision making and to manage comprehensive and participatory knowledge throughout strategic planning processes. The discussion is carried out from both theoretical and practical points of view. The book also dissects the multiple meanings of strategic planning and its implication in terms of mobilization and creation of values and knowledge. Critical issues are examined in relation to both the dynamics of negotiation and construction of diverse values and knowledge in planning processes, and in relation to some experiences carried out in different urban contexts. The chapter explores how thinking through complex values can support the structuring of integrated decision-making by orienting it towards the elaboration of strategic goals and actions able to create new values from the plurality of knowledge and the specificity of the context. With its normative, spatial, temporal, cultural, social, and cognitive features, the context becomes the frame in which planning responses and behaviours 1 can be shaped. In its first part, this chapter explores the connection between values, knowledge and strategies, focussing on their interdependencies. Values make explicit the relations between different knowledge forms; conversely, the interaction of knowledge makes it possible to recognize values. At the same time, knowledge orients value and value represents the measure of knowledge. The second part of the chapter discusses the role of evaluation within an integrated perspective, which is seen as an “opportunity” to elaborate strategies and “organize hopes” in spatial planning. The integrated perspective considers evaluation as an activity embedded in the planning process and supporting many other activities in that process, each time playing a different role. Within an integrated perspective evaluation underpins the dialogue between knowledge and values in order to translate such dialogue into the planning of strategic objectives and actions; it enables the identification of relevant values and related meanings, the exploration of opportunities and the creation of alternatives; it measures possible impacts and effects while managing complex and multiple priority systems. The third part of the chapter focuses on three case studies, in which the evaluation process was structured in an integrated perspective guided by complex value-focused thinking and based on a “combinatorial philosophy”. The use of combinatorial assessment methodologies is becoming a widespread practice. They are seen as flexible tools able to overcome the limits of each single method, to accommodate a multi-dimensional and plural perspective and improve the quality of the decision-making process. These three cases represent different attempts to identify complex values as premises for the process at hand, and to exploit the plurality and diversity of knowledge in order to identify situated strategies. Finally, this chapter reflects {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} integrated approaches and highlights the need to view evaluation and planning as reciprocally embedded, mutually shaping activities. It may well be argued that within the field of integrative approaches, the recognition of value (economic, non-economic and intrinsic) assumes a fundamental role and is closely linked to different forms of knowledge. Through their interaction strategic objectives and evaluation criteria are identified, scenarios constructed, decisional rules deduced and <b>sectoral</b> <b>assessments</b> implemented in order to create and prioritize alternative options. The use of a combination of techniques penetrates and includes informal, „soft spaces‟ of decision, able to complement the more formal process, combining flexible and functional approaches with formal development plan strategies, and considering decision support versus discussion support...|$|R
40|$|Attention has {{recently}} focused on <b>sectoral</b> concern with <b>assessment</b> and feedback {{as a result}} of the National Student Survey. Government, the higher education agencies and the NUS have called for urgent action to address this concern. Existing data from institutional student feedback surveys, using the Student Satisfaction Approach, some dating back well over a decade, shows that the issue is not a new one. Indeed, several institutions have been addressing student concerns and as a result, have seen student satisfaction increase. This paper explores the existing student feedback data in order to identify not only how students' perceptions of assessment and feedback have changed over time but also the main concerns of students and institutions and what action has been taken by institutions to increase satisfaction. Several main concerns emerge from the data. Students value feedback as it is re-assuring as an indication of their progress and that it should be timely. Institutions that have used the Student Satisfaction Approach are concerned to clarify their processes to students, to increase their own efficiency in returning work, to monitor and review their assessment and feedback régimes and to share good practice, both internally and externally. Action taken {{as a result of}} listening to the student voice results in increased satisfaction but this can take several years. © 2009 The Authors.

The project considered working on "fringe areas" in terms of its disciplinary and geographical focus, considering synergies between natural and social science approaches in rural-urban fringe (RUF) areas. The RUF, the space where countryside meets town, is amongst society's most valued and pressured places, yet in policy and decision-making it remains largely forgotten, lacking sufficient understanding and evidence for integrated management. This research looked at existing research and data, carried out primary research and co-produced material to encourage more positive, inclusive and proactive agendas for managing the RUF. The research team consisted of academics, policy advisors and practitioners working collectively across professional, disciplinary, scalar and <b>sectoral</b> boundaries. Our <b>assessment</b> tool was a framework uniquely fusing ideas within the Ecosystem Approach (EA) and Spatial Planning (SP) to provide an improved lens within which to view the RUF. Three cross-cutting themes emerged from the fusion of SP and EA ideas; Time, Connections and Values. These concepts were unpacked within eight themed workshops (data: workshop reports) and two RUF site-based visioning exercises (data: transcripts of both visioning exercises) which formed the primary data for the project. In addition, outputs are available, including project newsletters, press releases, short professional articles, policy brief videos, and several academic journal articles are in progress or already submitted for review. Further information and documentation for this study may be found through the RELU Knowledge Portal: Managing environmental change at the rural-urban fringe webpage. <br...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} gains in ‘environmental efficiency’ may have {{opportunity}} costs {{in terms of}} ‘economic efficiency’ has still {{a significant role in}} the environmental and industrial policy debate. In this paper we exploit a detailed NAMEA-based dataset to explore the evidence regarding the dynamic trade off or ‘joint dynamics’, between economic and environmental productivities in the Italian economy. The quite long period of observations (1993 - 2006) allows a robust ex post dynamic <b>assessment.</b> <b>Sectoral</b> heterogeneity and variance in emission-economic productivity relationships is fully captured; the panel is well balanced. We do not observe joint economic-environmental productivities in the case of CO 2 emissions per labour with relative delinking performances that seem to be worsening since the late 90 ’s, as elasticities and some structural breaks show. This evidence gives food for thought, since the stagnation period experienced by Italy seems to have had effects on its environmental ‘efficiency’ performances. CO 2 on value added instead correlates with labour productivity showing a joint dynamic efficiency improvement. SOx analyses again show the presence of relevant structural breaks that fully explain the reduction of SOx per unit of labour – technical efficiency. As for carbon, a joint productivity dynamic relationship is observed for SOx on value added and labour productivity, with slightly larger elasticities. The analyzed period was characterized by a sharp increase of globalization trends. The economic globalization we consider interestingly appears to be a driver of emission efficiency with different effects for CO 2 and SOx. Nevertheless, trade – environment relationships at sector level need further examinations by means of decomposition and input output frameworks that could fruitfully be complement of NAMEA based analyses...|$|R
40|$|Large scale {{development}} of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) {{is seen as}} a potential solution to deal with future energy challenges of the Indian building sector. This paper aims to assess the current status of NZEB niche development in India and identifies barriers that obstruct wide scale uptake of NZEBs. The paper addresses the research question: How well does NZEB niche development in India perform under an integrated theoretical framework of the <b>Sectoral</b> System Innovation <b>Assessment</b> Framework (SSIAf) ? The SSIAf is an integrated assessment framework developed in a previous conceptual study using insights from the theoretical frameworks of Strategic Niche Management (SNM) and Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS). In this paper the shaping of expectations, actor networks, institutions, learning process and market demand creation form the core theoretical building blocks to analyse the transformative processes. Conceptually speaking, the framework addresses both niche and sectoral regime levels. A case study research design was used to analyse three completed and four on-going NZEB pilot demonstration projects in India. The results show {{that it is possible to}} use the comprehensive framework to assess NZEB niche development in India. However, it turned out that some of the frameworks’ components showed a few mutual interdependencies. It is particularly two conceptual building blocks of the SSIAf that are of importance to understand NZEB niche development: (I) actor networks and (ii) institutions. It was observed that these analytical concepts are key driving forces, and also influence the other three components (that is: shaping of expectations, learning process and market demand for NZEBs). Concerning the NZEBs in India, it was observed that the niche development is currently in Research & Development phase, an early form of niche formation process. The study is of importance, since it one of the few studies in which transition theory concepts are applied and tested in a developing country’s building sector...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing work {{to analyse}} a country's {{competitive}} standing {{has led to}} the application of the benchmarking method to comparative <b>sectoral</b> and national <b>assessment.</b> The method involves a comparison in terms of performance which explicitly looks for the best process, the "best practice". The use of benchmarking in analysing competitiveness has introduced a new quality to the discussion of locations because it relentlessly measures (individual) location factors of one country against the best practices of competitors (i. e., other countries). A survey of top-level executives at 11 major companies engaged in multinational activities has shown that benchmarking is used throughout as the method of choice for internal location assessment. Benchmarking of economic framework conditions, on the other hand, is interesting to companies only when they actually refer to the operative level. Intra- and inter-company benchmarking at the operative level is regularly used by all companies within the scope of continuous internal improvement, whereas location benchmarking is performed by just two out of three companies surveyed, and its use restricted to cases of concrete investment decisions. Internal location assessments yield the subjective view that a company has of a location. They are valuable for economic policy in that they clearly indicate the shortcomings of a location and thus complement external location analyses. Currently, internal and external benchmarking are pursued more or less separately from each other. Economic policy should aim at a closer match between them. Policy initiatives towards this end thus would be: • an image campaign for Location Austria which should emphasise the locational qualities offered by the country; • continuing the WIFO location report as a set of benchmark indicators, which could then be used to furnish arguments for the image campaign and to support location marketing with a view to attracting new businesses to locate in Austria; • an annual benchmarking forum, organised to present the results of external location benchmarking for Austria; • an independent ombudsman office created for problems that occur at the interface of companies and public administration.
