5|$|Tupolev TB-1 and two Tupolev I-4 {{on top of}} the wings. The {{normally}} <b>sesquiplane</b> I-4s had {{the bottom}} wings removed (with no ill effect on flight characteristics) due to clearance problems with TB-1 propellers. First flight 3 December 1931. The TB-1 was piloted by A. I. Zalevskiy and A. R. Sharapov, the I-4s were piloted by V. P. Chkalov and A. F. Anisimov. Vakhmistrov himself flew in the front gunner's turret.|$|E
5|$|Helped by his schoolfriend Cammarotta-AdornoIn, Coandă {{started to}} build his slender <b>sesquiplane</b> and the unusual {{powerplant}} in a workshop {{in the courtyard of}} his house where he tested the thrust of the powerplant on a dynamometer, tests which are described in detail in the April 1910 edition of La Technique Aéronautique. He filed for several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 May 1910, with later additions to the existing patents.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-6 (Istrebitel—fighter) {{began in}} September 1928 with a {{deadline}} for delivery for the first prototype of 1 August 1929 after the first prototypes of the Polikarpov I-3 were completed. Although the new fighter shared many {{of the characteristics of}} the earlier design, including the staggered <b>sesquiplane,</b> single-bay, layout of the wings, it was a new design which used a nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled Bristol Jupiter radial engine rather the water-cooled inline engine of its predecessor. It was designed by the OSS (—Landplane Department), later redesignated as OPO-1 (—Experimental Department) of Aviatrest ("Aviation Trust") under the supervision of Nikolai Polikarpov, head designer of the department. It was originally intended to be compared to the I-3, but this was changed to an evaluation of construction methods with the wooden construction I-6 compared to the mixed construction Polikarpov I-5. Both aircraft used the Jupiter VI engine for which a license had recently been negotiated.|$|E

5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a <b>sesquiplane</b> which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The Nieuport-Delage NiD 52 was a French fighter {{aircraft}} of the 1920s. A single-engined <b>sesquiplane,</b> {{it served}} with the Spanish Air Force, being operated by {{both sides of the}} Spanish Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot {{prepared}} two {{designs to}} meet the requirement. One, the Port Victoria P.V.5, was a development of its earlier P.V.2 <b>sesquiplane,</b> while the P.V.5A differed in having a more conventional biplane wing.|$|E
50|$|The Buhl Airsedan was a civil utility {{aircraft}} {{manufactured in the}} United States by Buhl Aircraft Company in the late 1920s and early 30s. Later models featured gradually increased seating and larger engines, but all were conventional <b>sesquiplanes</b> with fully enclosed cockpits and passenger cabins.|$|R
5000|$|The Waco Custom Cabins were {{a series}} of {{up-market}} single-engined four-to-five-seat cabin <b>sesquiplanes</b> of the late 1930s produced by the Waco Aircraft Company of the United States. [...] "Custom Cabin" [...] was Waco's own description of the aircraft which despite minor differences, were all fabric-covered biplanes.|$|R
50|$|CLA.4 - Two Cranwell CLA.4s {{were built}} for the 1926 Lympne light {{aircraft}} trials, they were two-seat inverted <b>sesquiplanes.</b> The first aircraft was flown by Comper at the trials but was withdrawn with a damaged landing gear. The second aircraft was destroyed in a crash in March 1927.|$|R
25|$|The Nieuport 14 was a {{military}} reconnaissance <b>sesquiplane</b> produced in France during the First World War. When the French Army deployed it in 1916, they found its performance inadequate, and the type was quickly withdrawn from front-line service.|$|E
25|$|The Sikorsky S-35 was an American twin-engined <b>sesquiplane</b> {{transport}} later {{modified to}} three-engines. It {{was designed and}} built by the Sikorsky Manufacturing Company for an attempt by Rene Fonck on a non-stop Atlantic crossing for the Orteig Prize. It was destroyed in the attempt.|$|E
25|$|The Navy-Wright NW-1 was an {{unconventional}} streamlined design, {{based on a}} <b>sesquiplane</b> with main wheels faired into the lower wing, and bracing minimized to further reduce drag. Lamblin radiators were suspended beneath the fuselage and wire bracing was incorporated for the mid-fuselage mounted main wing and tailplane.|$|E
50|$|The Waco {{name was}} {{extremely}} well {{represented in the}} U.S. civil aircraft registry between the wars, with more Wacos registered than the aircraft of any other company. Production types including open cockpit biplanes, cabin biplanes and cabin <b>sesquiplanes</b> (known by Waco as Custom Cabins) as well as numerous experimental types.|$|R
50|$|From the Type B of 1911 to the World War I Caudron G.3 Caudron biplanes had {{a common}} layout with tractor engines, {{occupants}} in a nacelle mounted between {{the wings and}} empennage on twin booms. The earlier Types B-D in this sequence began as equal span biplanes, then were modified into <b>sesquiplanes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Driggs-Johnson DJ-1 Bumblebee was {{a single}} engine, low power, single seat, parasol wing sports {{monoplane}} built in the US in 1924. It and its immediate development the Driggs Dart 1 had some competition successes; the design was further developed into two seat <b>sesquiplanes</b> known as the Driggs Dart 2 and Skylark. In all, about twenty were built.|$|R
25|$|A further factory {{conversion}} of a Mars III (civil registered as G-EAYN) {{led to the}} Gloster Grouse I, a <b>sesquiplane,</b> powered by a 185hp Siddeley Lynx, that became the prototype for a small production run of Grouse II for Sweden. The Grouse series was the progenitor of the later Gloster Grebe.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, Waco {{introduced}} its slightly larger Custom Cabin series (which featured a <b>sesquiplane</b> layout without ailerons {{on the lower}} wing) and decided to differentiate between the Standard and Custom Cabin types by appending an S to the model designator. in 1936 the C-S was replaced with an 'S' signifying 'Standard'. For example, the YKC of 1934 became the YKC-S of 1935 and the YKS of 1936, though with additional minor improvements.|$|E
25|$|The Port Victoria aircraft, {{designed}} by W.H. Sayers, was designated P.V.7. It {{was a very}} small single bay tractor biplane, of <b>sesquiplane</b> configuration, with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing. The wings featured the same high-lift section as used in previous Port Victoria aircraft, and were fitted with ailerons only on the upper wing. It was intended, as was the competing Eastchurch design, to use a 45hp (34kW) geared ABC Gnat two-cylinder air-cooled engine. Armament was a single Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing.|$|E
50|$|Two Type Cs {{were built}} and {{delivered}} to the military in November 1911. In July 1912 they were modified into <b>sesquiplanes</b> to ease their accommodation in field tents. The Type C appeared in the Caudron catalogue of 1912 in that form, with the upper wing overhang supported by parallel, outward leaning struts from the bases of the outer interplane struts.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1914 Gustave Delage {{joined the}} company and by adding a small set of lower wings to a type 10 parasol {{monoplane}} began to develop the highly successful <b>sesquiplanes</b> ("one and a half wing" [...] aircraft with a full chord upper wing and a single-spar, half-chord lower wing) for which the Nieuport company would become famous during World War I.|$|R
50|$|The Bartel BM 1 Maryla, {{originally}} Bartel M.1 was {{a fighter}} aircraft {{design for the}} Polish military that did not advance beyond the design stage. It was designed {{in response to a}} Polish War Ministry competition in 1925 and was placed third, netting Bartel a zł 1,000 prize. Maryla was the name of Bartel's wife. The design was a single-seat parasol-wing monoplane similar in configuration to the Nieuport-Delage <b>sesquiplanes</b> of the era. A distinctive feature were Y-shaped struts joining wing with an undercarriage. It was not built.|$|R
25|$|Early in 1923, a {{decision}} was made to redesign the racer and in the months following, a completely new design emerged with the original landplane being converted into a floatplane. Radical surgery was performed to turn the <b>sesquiplane</b> into a biplane, with strutted wings, wing surface radiators, enlarged tail surfaces and a set of floats also part of the redesign. Fitted with a new, more powerful 700hp Wright T-3, a development of the T-2 and a three-blade propeller, the second of the NW series was designated NW-2 and was entered into the 1923 Schneider Trophy held at Cowes, Isle of Wight.|$|E
25|$|The Type F was {{a single}} seat biplane with the same layout as all other Caudron landbased biplanes before it, apart from the Type B Multiplace. They were all twin boom tractor {{configuration}} aircraft with a short central nacelle and twin fins. Compared to the Type B to Type E range, the Type F differed most obviously in the nacelle design and the vertical tail shape. By 1913, when the Type F appeared, {{at least one of}} each of the earlier types had been modified from an equal span biplane to a sesquiplane; like the Type E, the Type F was a <b>sesquiplane</b> from the start.|$|E
25|$|In early 1916, the Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot {{designed}} a two-seat pusher configuration landplane fighter aircraft, (possibly designated the P.V.3). Although {{this was not}} built, Port Victoria was ordered to build a floatplane derivative for reconnaissance operations, being required to carry a Lewis gun and radio and to have an endurance of eight hours. The resultant aircraft, the Port Victoria P.V.4, had <b>sesquiplane</b> wings and a small streamlined nacelle for the two crew, which {{was attached to the}} upper wing. It was to be powered by a 150hp (112kW) Smith Static radial engine, an experimental engine which, while light, promised excellent fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|Even {{as close}} air support began during World War I, there were pioneer {{attempts}} to direct the trench strafing by the ground troops marking their positions by laying out signal panels on the ground, firing flares, or lighting smoke signals. Aircrews had difficulty communicating with the ground troops; they would drop messages or use messenger pigeons. Benno Fiala von Fernbrugg, an Austro-Hungarian pilot, pioneered the use of radio for fire control; at the Battle of Gorlice he used a radio transmitter in his airplane to send changes via morse code to an artillery battery on the ground. Colonel Billy Mitchell also equipped his Spad XVI command airplane with a radio, and the Germans experimented with radios in their Junkers J.I all-metal-structure, armored-fuselage <b>sesquiplanes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Potez 26 was a lighter, smaller span, single-seat fighter {{version of}} the two-seat biplane Potez 25 {{reconnaissance}} aircraft. Both types were <b>sesquiplanes</b> with markedly smaller lower wings. Both upper and lower wings were rectangular in plan, with long-span ailerons only on the upper plane. They were single bay biplanes, their wing interconnected by N-form interplane struts assisted by wire bracing. These interplane struts leaned outwards and narrowed to meet the closer spars of the smaller-chord lower wing. Centrally, the upper wing was held over the upper fuselage by two pairs of struts, a parallel pair forward and an inverted V at the rear forming a cabane. There was a semicircular cut-out in the upper trailing edge to improve the pilot's forward view.|$|R
50|$|The Waco Custom cabin series {{included}} {{all of the}} enlarged-cabin <b>sesquiplanes</b> from 1935 and can be further divided into six basic models, OC, UC QC, GC, RE and VN, with additional subtypes differing primarily in engine installation (indicated by the first letter of the designation or by a low dash number, i.e. -1, -2) and by model year (dash numbers -6, -7, -8). Letters were not used sequentially.Each basic type was offered with almost any engine the customer wished and designations were created accordingly, however some engines were more popular than others resulting in some types being offered, but never built. Due to {{the wide variety of}} engines already offered, it was both relatively easy and common to change the installed engine, resulting in a lot of confusion as to the correct designation to use for a specific airframe.|$|R
25|$|In 1928, {{the design}} bureau led by Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov {{produced}} the R-5 {{to replace the}} R-1, an unlicensed copy of the Airco DH.9A, which was the Soviet Union's standard light reconnaissance aircraft/bomber. As a response, the design bureau led by Andrei Tupolev produced a rival replacement for the R-1, based on Tupolev's earlier Tupolev R-3. Like the R-3, the new design, the ANT-10 was a single-engined <b>sesquiplane</b> with a duralumin structure, but with a much larger upper wing (based on that of the I-4 fighter). Like the R-5, it was powered by an imported BMW VI engine. It could carry 500kg (1,100lb) of bombs in an internal bomb-bay.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 Nieuport {{produced}} a {{design for a}} single-seat <b>sesquiplane</b> fighter of mixed construction, the Nieuport-Delage NiD 42, which was ordered in small numbers for the French air force, entering service in 1927. Nieuport developed three refined versions in 1927, the all-metal NiD-52 and NiD-72 and the mixed construction Nieuport-Delage NiD 62. Like the NiD 42 on which it was based, the NiD 52 was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Hb V12 engine, but the wooden monocoque rear fuselage was replaced by an equivalent made of duralumin and the wooden wing ribs by light alloy, while retaining a fabric covering. Both the main and secondary wings were of reduced area compared to the NiD-42, and an enlarged tail fitted {{in an attempt to}} improve the aircraft's handling. Armament remained two 7.7mm Vickers machine guns.|$|E
25|$|Like the P.V.2, the new design, the Port Victoria P.V.9 was a single-engined <b>sesquiplane</b> (i.e. a biplane {{with its}} lower wing {{much smaller than}} its upper wing) braced with faired steel tubes. The fuselage, wider {{than that of the}} P.V.2, was mounted between the upper and lower wings, almost filling the inter-wing gap, giving an {{excellent}} view for the pilot. Armament was a Vickers machine gun synchronised to fire through the propeller disc, with a Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing firing over the propeller. Power was provided by a Bentley BR1 rotary engine. While the designers had hoped to use the same high-lift aerofoil section as used in the P.V.2, this was rejected by the Admiralty, who demanded the use of the more conventional RAF 15 aerofoil, which resulted in a larger aircraft with a reduced climb rate and ceiling.|$|E
5000|$|The Wizard {{was fast}} and had {{impressive}} climb performance, and was {{tested by the}} Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) at RAF Martlesham Heath {{from the end of}} January 1928. While the A&AEEs test pilots praised the Wizrd's performance, they criticised the pilot's forward view and considered the aileron control loads too heavy. [...] During the summer of 1928, the Wizard made its first public appearance at the Royal Air Force Display at Hendon, among the other new single-seater fighters. The Wizard attracted a great deal of attention, mainly because of its clean lines and generally attractive appearance, as well as its unusual layout. (Parasol monoplane designs has not been in service with the Royal Air Force {{since the days of the}} First World War, when a number of Morane-Saulnier's were used. Since then the RAF had used biplanes or at most <b>sesquiplanes</b> for its fighters).|$|R
50|$|The Potez 28, known also as the Potez 28/2 or the Potez 28 G.R. (Grands Raids or long {{distance}} flights, a standard French description of such types) {{was a close}} relative of both the Potez 25 and the Potez 25 G.R., all single engine <b>sesquiplanes.</b> In its original biplane form it was particularly like the latter, though strengthened and somewhat enlarged with an upper wingspan increased by 19% {{to allow for the}} weight of extra fuel. Unusually for such a large machine, it was a single bay biplane, with two spar wings. The lower wing was both shorter and narrower (55%) in chord than the upper, resulting in it having only 36% of the area. Pairs of interplane struts leaned outwards and diverged toward the more widely separated upper wing spars. The upper wing was supported over the fuselage by further pairs of outward leaning struts from the upper fuselage, converging to its spars.|$|R
5000|$|Waco {{had been}} {{building}} a series of successful cabin biplanes, when in 1935 they introduced {{a new series of}} upmarket cabin <b>sesquiplanes</b> intended for the wealthy private individual or business. The original biplanes had been given a designation ending in C, however with the new Custom Cabin, Waco decided to differentiate the new design and existing C types that remained in production were recoded as C-S types to indicate Standard Cabin, until Waco changed their designation again in 1936 to just an S. For example, the 1934 Standard Cabin YKC was redesignated as a YKC-S in 1935, and as a YKS-6 in 1936. 1936 also saw the adoption of a numerical suffix to indicate the model year of the design, as [...] "-6" [...] for 1936, [...] "-7" [...] for 1937, etc. Since it referred to a model and not the year of production, the [...] "-7" [...] was carried into 1939 for some Custom Cabins, while others were designated [...] "-8". [...] In 1936, Waco started using a short form to refer to the types of aircraft without the engine and model identifiers resulting in C-6, C-7 and C-8 however as Waco only built one type of Custom cabin in each of those years, they refer to the QC-6, GC-7 and GC-8 series respectively.|$|R
