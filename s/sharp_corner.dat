British Columbia and Washington resident populations are amongst the most intensively studied marine mammals anywhere in the world.

25|$|Liquids {{have little}} {{compress}}ibility. Water, for example, will compress by only 46.4 {{parts per million}} for every unit increase in atmospheric pressure (bar). At around 4000 bar (58,000 psi) of pressure, at room temperature, water only experiences an 11% decrease in volume. In the study of fluid dynamics, liquids are often treated as incompressible, especially when studying incompressible flow. This incompressible nature makes a liquid suitable for transmitting hydraulic power, because {{very little of the}} energy is lost in the form of compression. However, the very slight compressibility does lead to other phenomena. The banging of pipes, called water hammer, occurs when a valve is suddenly closed, creating a huge pressure-spike at the valve that travels backward through the system at just under the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by liquid's incompressibility is cavitation. Because liquids have little elasticity they can literally be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or a dramatic change in direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or a <b>sharp</b> <b>corner</b> in a pipe. A liquid in an area of low pressure (vacuum) vaporizes and forms bubbles, which then collapse as they enter high pressure areas. This causes liquid to fill the cavities left by the bubbles with tremendous localized force, eroding any adjacent solid surface.|$|E
25|$|Several {{additions}} {{had been}} built onto the original structure between 1970 and 1976, creating a sprawling, non-linear complex of function rooms and service areas. The resulting complex was roughly square in shape, and {{though it was not}} situated in a north-south direction, reports of the fire have tended to assign those points to points in the complex for ease of reference. Assuming this system, the front entrance of the complex lay at the southern point of the compass. Along the central portion of the southern wall, to the east of the building entrance, was a small event room called the Zebra Room. A narrow corridor to the Zebra Room's east separated it from the Viennese Room and a series of service spaces, which ran northward along the building's eastern wall. This interior corridor terminated between the Garden Room, occupying the central portion of the north wall of the building, and the Cabaret Room, which jutted out from the northeastern corner of the building. A smaller, branching corridor led from the internal corridor to an exit door that sat between the Garden Room and the Cabaret Room; to exit the building from the Cabaret Room using that corridor, a person would have, in order, pass through a set of double doors into the main interior corridor, pass through a single door between the main interior corridor and the branching interior corridor, turn a <b>sharp</b> <b>corner</b> into the branching corridor, and proceed approximately one-quarter of the length of the Cabaret Room to the single door that connected the branching corridor to the exterior of the building. This complex navigation was not atypical for the building; a number of other event and services spaces were scattered {{throughout the rest of the}} building, with some rooms leading into each other, some leading into interior hallways, and some leading to the outside of the building. A partial second story covered approximately the southern third of the building, sitting above the main entrance, Zebra Room, and main dining room; it held two more small event rooms made of six smaller rooms conjoined, collectively labeled the Crystal Rooms.|$|E

2500|$|The LP is delicate. Any {{accidental}} {{fumbling with}} the stylus or dropping {{of the record}} onto a <b>sharp</b> <b>corner</b> can scratch the record permanently, creating a series of [...] "ticks" [...] and [...] "pops" [...] heard at each subsequent playback. Heavier accidents can cause the stylus {{to break through the}} groove wall as it plays, creating a permanent skip that will cause the stylus to either skip ahead to the next groove or skip back to the previous groove. A skip going to the previous groove is called a broken record; the same section of 1.8 seconds of LP (1.3s of 45rpm) music will repeat over and over until the stylus is lifted off the record. It is also possible to put a slight pressure on the headshell causing the stylus to stay in the desired groove, without having a playback break. This requires some skill, but is of great use when, for instance, digitizing a recording, as no information is skipped.|$|E

Its fibular crest ends in a hook-shaped process pointing to above, a condition that is unique in the entire Theropoda. The astragalus and calcaneum, the upper ankle bones, are fused just as in Bambiraptor. The top of the calcaneum has but a small contact facet for the calfbone, indicating that this fibula must have had a very narrow lower end. The metatarsus has an estimated length of , which makes it rather long relative to the remainder of the hindlimb.|$|E
2500|$|The final B-body Caprice was {{not well}} {{received}} by critics and did not hold on to high sales numbers. The car's styling was criticized with car aficionados calling it a [...] "beached whale" [...] and [...] "an upside-down bathtub". For 1993 there were some revisions, the most obvious being {{the removal of the}} skirted rear wheel wells in favor of more conventional, open wheel wells. This applied only to the sedan model; station wagons retained the skirted wheel wells. A final appearance tweak appeared on the 1995 Caprice sedan {{in the form of a}} restyled side window between the back door and C pillar (windows on Caprices of the generation through 1994 were triangular, but the 1995 window had 4 sides and lacked the <b>sharp</b> <b>corner</b> pointed toward the rear), and the wagon was given the same mirrors as the sedan.

2500|$|On {{turned parts}} an {{undercut}} {{is also known}} as a neck or [...] "relief groove". They are often used {{at the end of the}} threaded portion of a shaft or screw to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as thread relief in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least [...] smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. [...] Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter. [...] They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If an undercut is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a <b>sharp</b> <b>corner</b> is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on technical drawings by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.|$|E

2500|$|When a coin is struck, the {{planchet}} is not heated. Although the planchet {{would be}} softer and more malleable, {{the extra time}} and expense would prove too great for the Mint. The planchet is therefore struck at room temperature, {{and the only thing}} which makes the coin form is the tremendous pressure used to strike it. With a metal such as nickel, which is harder than a normal coin metal like silver, gold or copper, the pressure must be greater. When a nickel coin, or any coin, is struck, the metal must [...] "flow" [...] into the contours of the front and back dies. It is through the atoms of the metal flowing into the dies that flow lines are created. However, when metal flows over a <b>sharp</b> <b>corner</b> in the die, like the edges of a mintmark or words, it tends to roll the detail out. It wears on the die, and a little detail is lost with every strike. Die Deterioration Doubling is most prevalent on the date and mintmark because these fine details are alone {{in the middle of the}} field, and the metal must flow into these without the help of other valleys nearby. When the metal rolls into the mintmark or date, it wears away the corner of the die, and after long enough will appear on the coin as Die Deterioration Doubling.|$|E
