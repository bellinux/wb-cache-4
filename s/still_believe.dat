5|$|The General and {{his entourage}} arrive {{at the port of}} Mompox. Here they are stopped by police, who fail to {{recognize}} the General. They ask for his passport, but he is unable to produce one. Eventually, the police discover his identity and escort him into the port. The people <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> him to be the President of Gran Colombia and prepare banquets in his honor; but these festivities are wasted on him due to his lack of strength and appetite. After several days, the General {{and his entourage}} set off for Turbaco.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} closed in 1914 {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, for the duration of which the steel structure was not maintained and consequently became rusty. During the war the government made unsuccessful attempts to buy the tower for its metal. Controversy still surrounds the decision to dismantle the tower after the war ended; some <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> the structure was safe and could have been repaired. Demolition began in 1919 and by 1921 only the ballroom remained. The metal was sold to scrap dealers.|$|E
5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossil record}} (especially the sister species, Pinguinus alfrednewtoni) and {{molecular}} evidence {{show that the}} three closely related genera diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout Xantus's murrelet, had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. Apparently, by that time, the murres, or Atlantic guillemots, already had split from the other Atlantic alcids. Razorbill-like birds were common in the Atlantic during the Pliocene, but {{the evolution of the}} little auk is sparsely documented. The molecular data are compatible with either possibility, but the weight of evidence suggests placing the great auk in a distinct genus. Some ornithologists <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> it is more appropriate to retain the species in the genus Alca. It is the only recorded British bird made extinct in historic times.|$|E
5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> in such an existence).|$|E
5|$|The {{arboreal}} {{hypothesis was}} popular in Heilmann's day, even {{prior to his}} research, {{as it had been}} advanced by Marsh. It fell out of favor following Ostrom's research in the 1960s and 1970s, which suggested that the ancestors of birds were fast–running bipedal animals, lending credence to the cursorial model. The focus shifted back to the arboreal model when several Chinese non–avian theropods from the Early Cretaceous were found in the early 2000s. These new finds, represented chiefly by Epidendrosaurus and Microraptor, have been described as possessing features that indicate an arboreal lifestyle; Microraptor even has flight feathers on its legs, which suggest it was a glider. While the arboreal hypothesis is still popular in modern times, there are several proponents of the cursorial model and no consensus has been established. Adherence to the arboreal model is shared both by paleontologists who accept the dinosaurian ancestry of birds, and by the minority who <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> birds to have evolved from a non-dinosaurian group of reptiles. Although the arboreal model was somewhat popular before Heilmann's research, his writings helped to advance and popularize it and the idea continues to have a hold.|$|E

5|$|Canada is religiously diverse, {{encompassing}} a {{wide range}} of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

25|$|While enthusiasts <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> {{the mystery}} can be solved, {{scholarly}} attempts at decipherment {{are thought to}} be unlikely to succeed unless more examples of the signs turn up somewhere, as it is generally thought that there is not enough context available for meaningful analysis. Any decipherment without external confirmation, such as successful comparison to other inscriptions, is unlikely to be accepted as conclusive.|$|E
25|$|From 1937 to 1941, {{a series}} of stones were {{discovered}} that were {{claimed to have been}} written by Eleanor Dare, mother of Virginia Dare.

25|$|Chinese {{scholars}} have long {{concluded that the}} received text was a 3rd-century AD forgery by Wang Su {{that had nothing to}} do with the original text of the same title. There has been some reassessment of this view in light of archaeological discoveries of Western Han dynasty tombs at Dingzhou (55 BC) and Shuanggudui (165 BC), but most scholars <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> the work to be a forgery.|$|E
25|$|Deaths were {{recognized}} to evil spirits or to kanaima, who were healers that had evil intentions and solely used their powers for that reason. Nowadays, Wapishana use words like hepatitis, malaria, and pneumonia to identify causes of death, {{but they often}} <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> that the true cause is kanaima or another malevolent spirit. A person's prized possessions are buried {{with them in the}} Wapishana culture for use in the afterlife.|$|E

I <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40–$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.|$|E

25|$|The Deathly Hallows {{are three}} magical {{objects that are}} the focus of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – an unbeatable wand, a stone to bring the dead to life, and a cloak of invisibility. When owned by one person, they are said to give mastery over death. The objects are {{generally}} remembered only as part of a wizard's fairy tale called The Tale of the Three Brothers, and have become mythological over time, but a small number of wizards including Dumbledore <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> in their existence and seek them. According to Rowling, the story about how these objects came into existence is based upon Geoffrey Chaucer's The Pardoner's Tale.|$|E
25|$|When Sol persuades {{almost all}} of ShadowClan to give up belief in StarClan, Tawnypelt takes her kits Flamepaw, Tigerpaw, and Dawnpaw to ThunderClan, hoping to find refuge there, stating {{that she and her}} kits {{do not want to be}} part of a Clan that does not believe in StarClan. In hope of helping ShadowClan, Raggedstar and Runningnose beg Jaypaw to help. Jaypaw, along with Tigerpaw, Flamepaw, Dawnpaw, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze, creates a fake sign from StarClan to show Blackstar StarClan is real. Blackstar is still not {{convinced}} until the fake sign turns real when Raggedstar and Runningnose come to tell Blackstar to get rid of Sol and to <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> in StarClan. Blackstar is convinced and tells his Clan.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disease described by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra. Today, {{the most commonly used}} drug to combat this disease is levodopa or L-DOPA. This precursor to dopamine can penetrate through the blood–brain barrier, whereas the neurotransmitter dopamine cannot. There has been extensive research to determine whether L-dopa is a better treatment for Parkinson's disease rather than other dopamine agonists. Some believe that the long-term use of L-dopa will compromise neuroprotection and, thus, eventually lead to dopaminergic cell death. Though there has been no proof, in-vivo or in-vitro, some <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> that the long-term use of dopamine agonists is better for the patient.|$|E
