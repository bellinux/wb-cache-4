5|$|The {{two main}} {{meteorological}} {{factors contributing to}} a storm surge are a long fetch of winds <b>spiraling</b> inward toward the storm, and a low-pressure-induced dome of water drawn up under and trailing the storm's center.|$|E
5|$|There is some <b>spiraling</b> of {{the tool}} as it cuts, so the form {{at the bottom of}} the {{workpiece}} may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. <b>Spiraling</b> may be undesirable because it binds the body {{of the tool}} and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} tornadoes include the {{multiple}} vortex tornado, landspout and waterspout. Waterspouts {{are characterized by}} a <b>spiraling</b> funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These <b>spiraling</b> columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil.|$|E
50|$|The normal Archimedean <b>spiral</b> {{occurs when}} c = 1. Other <b>spirals</b> falling into this group include the {{hyperbolic}} <b>spiral</b> (c = -1), Fermat's <b>spiral</b> (c = 2), and the lituus (c = -2). Virtually all static <b>spirals</b> appearing in nature are logarithmic <b>spirals,</b> not Archimedean ones. Many dynamic <b>spirals</b> (such as the Parker <b>spiral</b> {{of the solar}} wind, or the pattern made by a Catherine's wheel) are Archimedean.|$|R
50|$|A {{hyperbolic}} <b>spiral</b> is a transcendental plane curve {{also known}} as a reciprocal <b>spiral.</b> A hyperbolic <b>spiral</b> is the opposite of an Archimedean <b>spiral</b> and is a type of Cotes' <b>spiral.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Approximate {{logarithmic}} <b>spirals</b> {{can occur}} in nature (for example, the arms of <b>spiral</b> galaxies or phyllotaxis of leaves); golden <b>spirals</b> are one special case of these logarithmic <b>spirals.</b> A recent analysis of <b>spirals</b> observed in mouse corneal epithelial cells indicated that some can be characterized by the golden <b>spiral,</b> and some by other <b>spirals.</b> It is sometimes stated that <b>spiral</b> galaxies and nautilus shells get wider {{in the pattern of}} a golden <b>spiral,</b> and hence are related to both [...] and the Fibonacci series.In truth, <b>spiral</b> galaxies and nautilus shells (and many mollusk shells) exhibit logarithmic <b>spiral</b> growth, but at a variety of angles usually distinctly {{different from that of the}} golden <b>spiral.</b> [...] This pattern allows the organism to grow without changing shape.|$|R
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{resemble}} <b>spiraling</b> pinwheels. Though {{the stars}} and other visible material contained in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane, the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter that extends beyond the visible component, {{as demonstrated by the}} universal rotation curve concept.|$|E
5|$|Denny, a {{neighboring}} student whom Johnny financially and emotionally supports, has a run-in with an armed drug dealer named Chris-R, whom Johnny and Mark overpower and take into custody. Denny also lusts after Lisa, ultimately confessing to Johnny his attraction. Johnny slowly begins <b>spiraling</b> into a mental haze and calls upon Peter, his and Mark's psychologist friend. Peter alternates between defending Lisa and assessing {{her as a}} sociopath which results in Mark, feeling guilty about his and Lisa's affair, briefly trying to murder him.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward <b>spiraling</b> winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, the <b>spiral</b> of Theodorus (also called {{square root}} <b>spiral,</b> Einstein <b>spiral</b> or Pythagorean <b>spiral)</b> is a <b>spiral</b> {{composed}} of contiguous right triangles. It was first constructed by Theodorus of Cyrene.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>spiral</b> {{formed by}} {{parametric}} plot of [...] {{is known as}} Nielsen's <b>spiral.</b> It is {{also referred to as}} the Euler <b>spiral,</b> the Cornu <b>spiral,</b> a clothoid, or as a linear-curvature polynomial <b>spiral.</b>|$|R
50|$|Barless <b>spiral</b> {{galaxies are}} one of three general types of <b>spiral</b> galaxies under the de Vaucouleurs system {{classification}} system, the other two being intermediate <b>spiral</b> galaxy and barred <b>spiral</b> galaxy.

5|$|Waterspouts {{have similar}} {{characteristics}} as tornadoes, {{characterized by a}} <b>spiraling</b> funnel-shaped wind current that form over bodies of water, connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds. Waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes, or more specifically, non-supercelled tornadoes that develop over large bodies of water. These spiralling columns of air are frequently developed within tropical areas close to the equator, but are less common within areas of high latitude.|$|E
5|$|After the break-up, Strummer {{contacted}} Jones in {{an effort}} to reform the Clash. Jones, however, had already formed a new band, Big Audio Dynamite (B.A.D.), that had released its debut late in 1985. The two did work together on their respective 1986 projects. Jones helped out with the two songs Strummer wrote and performed for the Sid and Nancy soundtrack. Strummer, in turn, cowrote a number of the tracks on the second B.A.D. album, No.10, Upping St., which he also co-produced. With Jones committed to B.A.D., Strummer moved on to various solo projects and screen acting work. Simonon formed a band called Havana 3am. Headon recorded a solo album, before once again <b>spiraling</b> into drug abuse. Chimes drummed with a succession of different acts.|$|E
5|$|He and Sharif met in Lahore in June 2008 {{to discuss}} Musharraf's removal and the {{constitutional}} amendments, which the PML-N viewed as not going {{far enough to}} fulfill the Murree declaration. He opposed impeachment calls because he claimed the coalition {{did not have the}} two-thirds majority in both legislative bodiesâ€”National Assembly and Senate. He was unwilling to restore the judiciary as divisions in the coalition grew and popular sentiment shifted towards Sharif. The coalition criticised the government for barring Sharif from competing in the June by-elections. Because of the impasses over Musharraf and the judiciary, the coalition could not address rising food shortages and <b>spiraling</b> inflation, which was the highest in 30 years.|$|E

40|$|Theories {{of stellar}} <b>spiral</b> arms in disk galaxies can be grouped into two classes {{based on the}} {{longevity}} of a <b>spiral</b> arm. Although the quasi-stationary density wave theory supposes that <b>spirals</b> are rigidly-rotating, long-lived patterns, the dynamic <b>spiral</b> theory predicts that <b>spirals</b> are differentially-rotating, transient, recurrent patterns. In order {{to distinguish between the}} two <b>spiral</b> models from observations, we performed hydrodynamic simulations with steady and dynamic <b>spiral</b> models. Hydrodynamics simulations in steady <b>spiral</b> models demonstrated that the dust lane locations relative to the stellar <b>spiral</b> arms (hereafter, arm-gas offsets) depend on radius, regardless of the strength and pitch angle of the <b>spiral</b> and the model of the inter-stellar medium (ISM). In contrast, we found that the dynamic <b>spiral</b> models show no systematic radial dependence of the arm-gas offsets. The arm-gas offset radial profile method, together with the other test methods, will help us to distinguish between the two <b>spiral</b> models in observed <b>spiral</b> galaxies.

5|$|Kraken Unleashed (named for {{the fictional}} sea monster {{of the same}} name) is a steel floorless roller coaster located at SeaWorld Orlando in the United States. Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride {{features}} a total of seven inversions including two vertical loops, a dive loop, a <b>spiraling</b> camelback (zero-g roll), a cobra roll and a flat spin Kraken opened on June 1, 2000. It is also the world's second longest floorless coaster elongating up to 4,177 feet (1,273 m). The coaster was refurbished and renamed to Kraken Unleashed. The refurbishment included Virtual Reality.|$|E
5|$|Rival {{producers}} of Somali shillings emerged after 1991. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. A competition for seigniorage drove {{the value of}} the money down to about $0.04 per SoSh (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers have refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which has helped stop the devaluation from <b>spiraling</b> further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries are treated as the same currency. It takes large bundles to make cash purchases.|$|E
5|$|Weather systems {{affecting}} Newfoundland usually {{originate from}} the west, over mainland Canada, {{or from the}} southwest, from {{the east coast of}} the United States. Cyclonic storms consist of an area of low atmospheric pressure characterized by inward <b>spiraling</b> winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere. Such storms passing to the south of the island bring strong northeasterly winds sweeping in off the open North Atlantic Ocean. These storms are sometimes referred to as Nor'easters and are responsible for the worst of Newfoundland's weather. High winds sweeping over a large surface of ocean can build up very large waves. The frequency and severity of storms is greatest between November and March, although they may occur at any time of the year.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of hypercycle <b>spirals</b> in a two-dimensional cellular automaton model is analyzed. Each of these <b>spirals</b> can {{be approximated by}} an Archimedean <b>spiral</b> and the center, width, and phase of the hypercycle <b>spiral</b> change according to Brownian motion. A barrier exists between two <b>spirals</b> if the phase synchronization hypothesis is taken into account, and the occurrence rate of pair decay (the simultaneous disappearance of two <b>spirals)</b> {{can be explained by}} the random walk simulation with the barrier. Adjacent species violation is shown to be a necessary condition for creating new <b>spirals.</b> A hypercycle system can live long if the <b>spirals</b> in the system are somewhat unstable, since new <b>spirals</b> cannot emerge when existing <b>spirals</b> are too stable...|$|R
50|$|Usually, most <b>spiral</b> galaxies contain two {{clearly defined}} <b>spiral</b> arms, or they contain only fuzzy {{filamentary}} <b>spiral</b> structures. Galaxies with three well-defined <b>spiral</b> arms are rare.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of formation, high clouds {{indicated}} the presence of intense convection, and the cyclone featured an axisymmetric cloud structure, with a distinct, cloud-free eye and rainbands <b>spiraling</b> around the disturbance as a whole. Soon thereafter, the parent low separated from the medicane entirely and continued eastward, meandering toward the Aegean Sea and Turkey. Initially remaining stationary between Greece and Sicily with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1002mbar (29.59inHg), the newly formed system began to drift southwest-to-south in the following days, influenced by northeasterly flow incited by the initial low, now far to the east, and a high-pressure area above central and eastern Europe. The system's atmospheric pressure increased throughout 15January {{due to the fact}} it was embedded within a large-scale environment, with its rising pressure due to the general prevalence of higher air pressures throughout the region, and was not a sign of deintensification.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{changes were}} made to give the {{ceremony}} a sleek, interactive look while shortening {{the length of the}} ceremony. Cates announced that in certain categories, all five nominees would be up onstage prior to the announcement of the award. In other instances, the actor or actress would present the award in the audience. In addition, production designer Roy Christopher designed an technologically ambitious stage for the telecast that both saluted the past while look toward the future. The set prominently featured 26 high-definition video monitors floating over the first twelve rows of the audience and a 40-foot LED screen situated beneath a layer of plexiglass on the stage floor. Both screens were used display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters took the stage or random film clips during several commercial breaks. A gold rod featuring 23 different life-sized Oscar statuettes <b>spiraling</b> upward was placed at center stage.|$|E
5|$|Oberon is the second-darkest large moon of Uranus after Umbriel. Its surface shows {{a strong}} {{opposition}} surge: its reflectivity decreases from 31% at a phase angle of 0Â° (geometrical albedo) to 22% {{at an angle}} of about 1Â°. Oberon has a low Bond albedo of about 14%. Its surface is generally red in color, except for fresh impact deposits, which are neutral or slightly blue. Oberon is, in fact, the reddest among the major Uranian moons. Its trailing and leading hemispheres are asymmetrical: the latter is much redder than the former, because it contains more dark red material. The reddening of the surfaces is often a result of space weathering caused by bombardment of the surface by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Oberon is more likely caused by accretion of a reddish material <b>spiraling</b> in from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
5000|$|A {{logarithmic}} <b>spiral,</b> equiangular <b>spiral</b> or growth <b>spiral</b> is a self-similar <b>spiral</b> curve {{which often}} appears in nature.

5|$|Saudis and Jordanians {{provided}} an active {{support to the}} royalists through {{the first years of}} war. The September 1962 coup d'Ã©tat in Yemen was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Jordan, prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists, beginning October 1. The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid to the Republicans, rapidly <b>spiraling</b> the country into a full-scale war, as the Republicans called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops. On November 4, with the war expanding across North Yemen, the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages. The same day, a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan became widely known. Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi Arabia and the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and the Republicans, the Saudis decided to launch attacks on the Republicans in North Yemen.|$|E
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these <b>spiraling</b> runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E
5|$|The dam {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1950s; construction work commenced in 1968, involving the diversion of the North Fork American River through a tunnel {{and the construction of}} a massive earthen cofferdam. Following a nearby earthquake and the discovery of a seismic fault that underlay the dam site, work on the project was halted for fears that the dam's design would not allow it to survive a major quake on the same fault zone. Although the dam was redesigned and a new proposal submitted by 1980, <b>spiraling</b> costs and limited economic justification {{put an end to the}} project until severe flooding in 1986 briefly renewed interest in Auburn's flood control potential. The California State Water Resources Control Board denied water rights for the dam project in 2008 due to lack of construction progress.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{studies of}} the {{properties}} of multiarmed <b>spirals</b> show that they can form spontaneously in low excitability media. The maximum number of arms in a multiarmed <b>spiral</b> {{is proportional to the}} ratio of the single <b>spiral</b> period to the refractoriness of the medium. Multiarmed <b>spirals</b> are formed due to attraction of single <b>spirals</b> if these <b>spirals</b> rotate in the same direction and their tips are less than one wavelength apart, i. e., a <b>spiral</b> broken not far from its tip can evolve into a 2 -armed <b>spiral.</b> We propose this mechanism to be responsible for the formation of multiarmed <b>spirals</b> in mounds of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} is considered {{that there are}} two types of <b>spiral</b> for each <b>spiral</b> galaxy: an underlying <b>spiral</b> of relatively old stars seen in red and IR photographs and a <b>spiral</b> outlined by H II regions and young bright blue stars.

50|$|In {{microwave}} systems, a <b>spiral</b> antenna {{is a type}} of RF antenna. It {{is shaped}} as a two-arm <b>spiral,</b> or more arms may be used. <b>Spiral</b> antennas were first described in 1956. <b>Spiral</b> antennas belong to the class of frequency independent antennas which operate over a wide range of frequencies. Polarization, radiation pattern and impedance of such antennas remain unchanged over large bandwidth. Such antennas are inherently circularly polarized with low gain. Array of <b>spiral</b> antennas can be used to increase the gain. <b>Spiral</b> antennas are reduced size antennas with its windings making it an extremely small structure. Lossy cavities are usually placed at the back to eliminate back lobes because a unidirectional pattern is usually preferred in such antennas. <b>Spiral</b> antennas are classified into different types; archimedean <b>spiral,</b> square <b>spiral</b> and star <b>spiral</b> etc. Archimedean <b>spiral</b> is the most popular configuration.|$|R
