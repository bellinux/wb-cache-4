40|$|From the Introduction]. The European Community is in {{the midst}} of {{attempting}} to create a "Single Unitary Market" across western Europe (European Community, 1985; Moravcsik, 1991; Garrett, 1992). This project is fascinating for two reasons. First, some think we are witnessing one of the most important peaceful assaults upon national sovereignty in history. The construction of the <b>single</b> <b>unitary</b> market will require nation states to give up power to control their economic and geographic boundaries. Analyzing the negotiations towards a <b>single</b> <b>unitary</b> market - and taking particular notice of which aspects of the market are more difficult to change than others - gives us insights into the multiple dimensions of sovereignty. Second, it provides scholars interested in economic sociology, the sociology of markets, and political economy an opportunity to see if their theories can give them any leverage on what the causes and outcomes of this process are likely to be...|$|R

40|$|Are {{real-world}} objects {{represented as}} bound units? Although {{a great deal}} of research has examined binding between the feature dimensions of simple shapes, little work has examined whether the featural properties of real-world objects are stored in a <b>single</b> <b>unitary</b> object representation. In a first experiment, we found that information about an object‚Äôs color is forgotten more rapidly than the information about an object‚Äôs state (e. g., open, closed), suggesting that observers do not forget objects as entirely bound units. In a second and third experiment, we examined whether state and exemplar information are forgotten separately or together. If these properties are forgotten separately, the probability of getting one feature correct should be independent of whether the other feature was correct. We found that after a short delay, observers frequently remember both state and exemplar information about the same objects, but after a longer delay, memory for the two properties becomes independent. This indicates that information about object state and exemplar are forgotten separately over time. We thus conclude that real-world objects are not represented in a <b>single</b> <b>unitary</b> representation in visual memory...|$|R
40|$|The NSTSCE {{stakeholders}} have jointly funded {{this research}} {{for the purpose of}} developing and disseminating advanced transportation safety techniques and innovations. i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY When determining crash causation, crash databases emphasize a <b>single,</b> <b>unitary</b> critical reason (CR) as the primary proximal cause of a safety-critical event (SCE), which leaves no room for the specification of any other potential contributing factors to the crash/event genesis. This is {{despite the fact that it}} is well established in the transportation safety field that crash genesis typically involves a convergence of several factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the crash trifecta concept to determine if the convergence of multiple elements, rather than a <b>single,</b> <b>unitary</b> critical reason, has greater value in explaining the complexities of crash genesis. Specifically, the crash trifecta concept is defined as three separate, but converging, elements: 1. Unsafe pre-incident behavior or maneuver (e. g., speeding, tailgating, unsafe turn); 2. Transient driver inattention (which may be driving related, such as mirror use, or unrelated, such as reaching for an object); an...|$|R
