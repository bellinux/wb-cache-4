25|$|As the <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> {{system is}} only one of many {{three-dimensional}} coordinate systems, there exist equations for converting coordinates between the <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> system and others.|$|E
25|$|The <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> {{system is}} also {{commonly}} used in 3D game development to rotate the camera around the player's position.|$|E
25|$|As a torus is {{the product}} of two circles, a {{modified}} version of the <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> system is sometimes used.|$|E

30|$|Skowronski [19] firstly {{introduced}} <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinates</b> {{system into}} wavelet domain. Wang [15] extended this idea. However, {{he did not}} propose the properties of spherical transform in wavelet domain, neither define a proper threshold in <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinates</b> system.|$|R

25|$|The {{geographic}} {{coordinate system}} uses the azimuth and {{elevation of the}} <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> system to express locations on Earth, calling them respectively longitude and latitude. Just as the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is useful on the plane, a two-dimensional <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> system is useful {{on the surface of}} a sphere. In this system, the sphere is taken as a unit sphere, so the radius is unity and can generally be ignored. This simplification can also be very useful when dealing with objects such as rotational matrices.|$|E
25|$|The <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> system generalises the {{two-dimensional}} {{polar coordinate}} system. It {{can also be}} extended to higher-dimensional spaces and is then {{referred to as a}} hyperspherical coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems following other conventions are used outside mathematics. In a geographical coordinate system positions are measured in latitude, longitude and height or altitude. There are a {{number of different}} celestial coordinate systems based on different fundamental planes and with different terms for the various coordinates. The <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems used in mathematics normally use radians rather than degrees and measure the azimuthal angle counterclockwise from the -axis to the -axis rather than clockwise from north (0°) to east (+90°) like the horizontal coordinate system. The polar angle is often replaced by the elevation angle measured from the reference plane. Elevation angle of zero is at the horizon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coordinate}} systems are implemented in either <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinates</b> or rectangular <b>coordinates.</b> <b>Spherical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> projected on the celestial sphere, are {{analogous to the}} geographic coordinate system used {{on the surface of}} Earth. These differ in their choice of fundamental plane, which divides the celestial sphere into two equal hemispheres along a great circle. Rectangular coordinates, in appropriate units, are simply the cartesian equivalent of the <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> with the same fundamental (...) plane and primary (-axis) direction. Each coordinate system is named after its choice of fundamental plane.|$|R

25|$|The {{relations}} between the above coordinate systems, and also Cartesian coordinates are not presented here. The transformation between geodetic and Cartesian coordinates {{may be found in}} Geographic coordinate conversion. The relation of Cartesian and spherical polars is given in <b>Spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. The relation of Cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in Torge.|$|E
25|$|In {{astronomy}} {{there are}} a series of <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems that measure the elevation angle from different fundamental planes. These reference planes are the observer's horizon, the celestial equator (defined by Earth's rotation), the plane of the ecliptic (defined by Earth's orbit around the Sun), the plane of the earth terminator (normal to the instantaneous direction to the Sun), and the galactic equator (defined by the rotation of the Milky Way).|$|E
25|$|In {{three-dimensional}} space, if one coordinate is {{held constant}} {{and the other}} two are allowed to vary, then the resulting surface is called a coordinate surface. For example, the coordinate surfaces obtained by holding ρ constant in the <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinate</b> system are the spheres with center at the origin. In three-dimensional space the intersection of two coordinate surfaces is a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system we may speak of coordinate planes.|$|E

An overall dimensionless length scale factor R describes the size scale of the Universe {{as a function of}} time; an increase in R is the expansion of the Universe. A curvature index k describes the geometry. The index k is defined {{so that it can be}} only 0, corresponding to flat Euclidean geometry, 1, corresponding to a space of positive curvature, or −1, a space of positive or negative curvature. The value of R as a function of time t depends upon k and the cosmological constant Λ. The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy. The equation describing how R varies with time is known as the Friedmann equation after its inventor, Alexander Friedmann.|$|E
