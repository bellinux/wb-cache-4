40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{behaviour}} of the Members of the European Parliament (<b>MEPs)</b> <b>of</b> the Dutch Freedom Party is examined. The research question is: How can the behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>MEPs</b> <b>of</b> the Dutch Freedom Party be characterized? The behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>MEPs</b> <b>of</b> the Freedom Party is researched {{through the use}} of role theory. There are many different typologies concerning the roles of members <b>of</b> national parliaments, <b>MEPs</b> and eurosceptic MEPs which are discussed in this thesis. It is then researched which of these roles are applicable to the behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>MEPs</b> <b>of</b> the Freedom Party. The parliamentary activities (written questions, motions for resolutions, speeches in the plenary, attendance to plenary) <b>of</b> the <b>MEPs</b> <b>of</b> the Freedom Party are covered and two MEPs (Barry Madlener and Auke Zijlstra) of the Freedom Party were asked a number of questions about their behaviour in the European Parliament...|$|R
40|$|Rehabilitation programs, to be {{efficiently}} tailored, need clear prognostic markers. In acute stroke, neurophysiological measures, such as motor evoked potentials (MEPs), {{have been}} proposed, although with discordant results. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify a reliable neurophysiological measure of recovery in acute poststroke individuals by combining MEPs and the N 100 component of transcranial magnetic stimulationevoked potentials (TEPs). Nine acute post-stroke subjects were included. Clinical evaluation performed in the first week after the event included administration of the European Stroke Scale and Barthel Index and recording <b>of</b> <b>MEPs</b> and TEPs; administration of the clinical scales was repeated after one and three months. The presence/absence <b>of</b> <b>MEPs</b> and TEPs showed correlations with motor outcome. Individuals with a poorer outcome showed absence <b>of</b> both <b>MEPs</b> and TEPs; absence <b>of</b> <b>MEPs</b> alone was related to a partial recovery. Given the results of this exploratory study, further investigation is needed to define the accuracy of combined use <b>of</b> <b>MEPs</b> and TEPs as an approach for predicting motor recovery after acute stroke...|$|R

40|$|Motor evoked {{potential}} polyphasia A novel endophenotype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy Objective: We compared the motor {{evoked potential}} (MEP) phases using {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), their relatives, and healthy con-trols, hypothesizing that patients and their unaffected relatives may share a subtle pathophysio-logic abnormality. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we investigated 23 patients with IGE, 34 first-degree rela-tives, and 30 matched healthy controls. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed to pro-duce a series <b>of</b> suprathreshold single-pulse <b>MEPs.</b> A semiautomated method was used to count phases. We compared between groups the mean number <b>of</b> <b>MEP</b> phases, the stimulus-to-stimulus variability in MEP phases, and the proportion <b>of</b> polyphasic <b>MEPs</b> within subjects. Results: Patients with IGE and their relatives had a significantly increased number <b>of</b> <b>MEP</b> phases (median for patients 2. 24, relatives 2. 17, controls 2. 01) and a significantly higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>MEPs</b> with more than 2 phases than controls (median for patients 0. 118, relatives 0. 088, con-trols 0. 013). Patients had a greater stimulus-to-stimulus variability in number <b>of</b> <b>MEP</b> phases than controls. There were no differences between patients and relatives. Conclusion: Increased MEP polyphasia in patients with IGE and their first-degree relatives may reflect transient abnormal evoked oscillations. The presence <b>of</b> polyphasic <b>MEPs</b> in relatives as well as patients suggests that MEP polyphasia {{is not related to}} treatment, and is in isolation insuf-ficient to predispose to epilepsy. Polyphasic MEP may be a novel endophenotype in IGE...|$|R

2500|$|The Treaty {{changes the}} way in which MEP seats are apportioned among member states.

Motor function of affected extremities was measured at onset time and at {{six months after the}} onset. Patients were classified into two groups according to the time <b>of</b> <b>MEP</b> from the onset <b>of</b> stroke: early <b>MEP</b> group (within 15 days from onset) and late MEP group (16 – 30 days from onset). Patients were also classified into two groups according to the presence <b>of</b> <b>MEP</b> on the affected abductor pollicis brevis (APB) : MEP (+) group-patients (showing MEP in the affected APB) and MEP (–) group-patients (no MEP in the affected APB). Motor outcome was compared between the two early and late MEP groups or between the presence and absence <b>of</b> <b>MEP</b> in the affected APB groups. Results For patients with MEP (+), a larger portion in the late MEP group showed good prognosis compared to the early MEP group (late MEP, 94. 4 %; early MEP, 80 %).
