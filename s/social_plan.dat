40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the history of}} the idea of <b>social</b> <b>planning,</b> and of the pioneering Masters Programme in <b>Social</b> <b>Planning</b> established at the University of Wales Swansea in 1973.

Nevertheless, it has a very important intellectual and policy agenda, and if the word 'planning' proves a liability it can be replaced by 'policy' or 'strategy'. The major questions reviewed at CDS-Swansea in the 1970 s are still pertinent, and new dimensions have been added through growing concerns for nation-building, sustainability, democracy, gender equity and human rights.
