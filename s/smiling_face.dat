25|$|Another venerable Corfu {{tradition}} {{is known as}} the Carnival or Ta Karnavalia. Venetian in origin, festivities include a parade featuring the main attraction of Karnavalos, a rather grotesque figure with a large head and <b>smiling</b> <b>face,</b> leading a diverse procession of colourful floats. Corfiots, young and old, dress up in colourful costumes and follow the parade, spilling out into the area's narrow streets (kantounia) and spreading the festivities across the city, dancing and socialising. At night, in the island's more sophisticated social circles, dance and costume parties are traditional.|$|E
25|$|Kayak {{stanchions}} or kayak cockpit stanchions (ayapervik sg ayaperviik dual ayaperviit pl or ayaperyaraq sg ayaperyarat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, ayaperwig in Cup'ig) are {{top piece}} centered at side of coaming {{and used as}} a support as one climbs out of a kayak. They prevented the person from falling while {{getting in and out}} of the kayak. All kayaks had ayaperviik on them. This one has a woman's frowning face with a down-turned mouth carved on it. Perhaps the other side would have a man's <b>smiling</b> <b>face</b> carved on it.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{from the}} 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu Khmer Empire {{dominated}} vast {{parts of the}} Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost {{in the development of}} Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of Jayavarman VII, a Buddhist king that built Angkor Thom walled city, adorned with the <b>smiling</b> <b>face</b> of Lokeshvara in Angkor Thom dvaras (gates) and prasat towers Bayon. Angkor {{was at the center of}} this development, with a Buddhist temple complex and urban organization able to support around 1million urban dwellers. A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{revealed an}} automatic behavioral bias in high socially anxious individuals (HSAs) : although their explicit evaluations of <b>smiling</b> <b>faces</b> are positive, they show automatic avoidance of these faces. This is reflected by faster pushing than pulling of <b>smiling</b> <b>faces</b> in an Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT; Heuer et al., 2007). The current study addressed the causal role of this avoidance bias for social anxiety. To this end, {{we used the}} AAT to train HSAs, either to approach <b>smiling</b> <b>faces</b> or to avoid them. We examined whether such an AAT training could change HSAs' automatic avoidance tendencies, and if yes, whether AAT effects would generalize to a new approach task with new facial stimuli, and to mood and anxiety in a social threat situation (a video-recorded self-presentation). We found that HSAs trained to approach <b>smiling</b> <b>faces</b> did indeed approach female faces faster after the training than HSAs trained to avoid <b>smiling</b> <b>faces.</b> Moreover, approach-faces training reduced emotional vulnerability: it led to more positive mood and lower anxiety after the self-presentation than avoid-faces training. These results suggest that automatic approach-avoidance tendencies have a causal role in social anxiety, {{and that they can}} be modified by a simple computerized training. This may open new avenues in the therapy of social phobia...|$|R

25|$|Brother Timothy of Christian Brothers winery {{was also}} {{instrumental}} {{in establishing the}} modern wine industry in Napa. After an earlier career as a teacher, he transferred to the order's Mont La Salle located on Mount Veeder in the Mayacamas Mountains northwest of Napa in 1935 to become the wine chemist for the order's expanding wine operations. Christian Brothers had grown grapes and made sacramental wine in Benicia, California during Prohibition, but decided to branch out into commercial production of wine and brandy after the repeal of Prohibition. The science teacher was a fast learner and soon established Christian Brothers {{as one of the}} leading brands in the state's budding wine industry.

25|$|Born in Kanagawa Prefecture in September of {{the first}} year of Bunkyū (1861), Sōjirō is an illegitimate child who was badly mistreated by his father's family {{to the point of being}} beaten for faltering in his tasks. To build a {{tolerance}} to the beatings, Sōjirō put on a <b>smiling</b> <b>face</b> as his tormenters decide to let him be. One night, at age eight, Sōjirō witnessed the recently scarred Makoto Shishio killing two police officers and was spared due to the criminal seeing the boy's smile. While secretly feeding Shishio and providing him with bandages, Sōjirō takes the man's ideals to heart while receiving a wakizashi. When his family learned that he is harboring Shishio and decide to murder the child and pin the blame on the fugitive, Sōjirō uses the wakizashi Shishio gave him to slaughter his family. Soon after, once Shishio's wounds are healed, Sōjirō travels with him as his right hand and member of the Jupongatana.|$|E
