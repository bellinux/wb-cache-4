5|$|In 2012, {{during the}} {{contract}} {{negotiations between the}} city the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), compromise {{could not be reached}} over issues like health insurance increases, teacher evaluations, and seniority pay increases. On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike. On September 10, the CTU began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who have been laid off due to a school closing to be hired in another school and <b>student</b> <b>test</b> scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012, and students began their return to the schools the following day.|$|E

Kolb 2 ̆ 7 s Learning Styles Inventory (LSI) as a tool for categorization and analysis of systematic differences between American and International students. The research addressed five primary questions: 1. Are the learning styles of the International <b>students</b> <b>tested</b> different from those established by Kolb in previous studies of American students? 2. Do the learning styles of the International <b>students</b> <b>tested</b> differ among the various groups? 3. Are there differences among the groups of International <b>students</b> <b>tested</b> that can be related to gender? 4. Do the learning styles of the International <b>students</b> <b>tested</b> show any variation according to age? And if present, does that pattern differ in any way from patterns identified for American subjects tested? 5. Are the learning styles of the International <b>students</b> <b>tested</b> similar or dissimilar from the norms established by Kolb for American students in various fields of academic study...|$|R

25|$|Public elementary, {{middle and}} high school test scores in Hawaii are below {{national}} averages on tests mandated under the No Child Left Behind Act. The Hawaii Board of Education requires all eligible students to take these tests and report all <b>student</b> <b>test</b> scores. This may have unbalanced the results that reported in August 2005 that of 282 schools across the state, 185 failed to reach federal minimum performance standards in mathematics and reading. The ACT college placement tests show that in 2005, seniors scored slightly above the national average (21.9 compared with 20.9), but in the widely accepted SAT examinations, Hawaii's college-bound seniors tend to score below the national average in all categories except mathematics.|$|E
2500|$|Education {{reform was}} {{a major focus of}} Fenty's mayoral tenure. On the first day of his term, he {{introduced}} legislation to vest control of the public schools in himself, rather than the elected school board. Previous attempts to reform the schools, including one in 1996 where a D.C. financial control board took charge of the schools, had failed. At the beginning of Fenty's term, <b>student</b> <b>test</b> performance scores and graduation rates were among the lowest in the nation and District residents had been demanding that the schools be [...] "fixed". In April 2007, the D.C.Council approved Fenty's plan; the necessary legislation was approved by the U.S.Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush in May 2007.|$|E

2500|$|High-stakes testing {{creates more}} {{incentive}} for cheating. Because cheating {{on a single}} critical exam may be easier than either learning the required material or earning credit through attendance, diligence, or many smaller tests, more examinees that do not actually have the necessary knowledge or skills, but who are effective cheaters, may pass. Also, some people who would otherwise pass the test but are not confident enough of themselves might decide to additionally secure the outcome by cheating, get caught and often face even worse consequences than just failing. [...] Additionally, if the test results are {{used to determine the}} teachers' pay or continued employment, or to evaluate the school, then school personnel may fraudulently alter <b>student</b> <b>test</b> papers to artificially inflate student performance.|$|E
2500|$|A {{report issued}} by the Economic Policy Institute in August 2010 {{recognized}} that [...] "American public schools generally do {{a poor job of}} systematically developing and evaluating teachers" [...] but expressed concern that using performance on standardized tests as a measuring tool will not lead to better performance. The EPI report recommends that measures of performance based on standardized test scores be one factor among many that should be considered to [...] "provide a more accurate view of what teachers in fact do in the classroom and how that contributes to student learning." [...] The study called value-added modeling a fairer means of comparing teachers that allows for better measures of educational methodologies and overall school performance, but argued that <b>student</b> <b>test</b> scores were not sufficiently reliable as a means of making [...] "high-stakes personnel decisions".|$|E
