40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to improve the resolution of dynamic maskless holographic lithography (DMHL) by using two-photon absorption, to provide a more thorough characterization of the process, and to expand the functionality of the process by adding previously undemonstrated patterning modes. Two-photon DMHL will be performed in both 2 D and 3 D configurations with specific characterization relating to process resolution and repeatability. The physical limits of DMHL will be discussed and ways to circumvent them will be proposed and tested. DMHL eliminates the need for a separate mask for every different pattern exposure and allows for real-time shaping of the exposure pattern. It uses an electrically addressable spatial light modulator (SLM) to create an arbitrary intensity pattern at the <b>specimen</b> <b>plane.</b> The SLM is a phase mask that displays a hologram. An algorithm is used to find an appropriate phase hologram for each desired intensity pattern. Each pixel of the SLM shapes the wavefront of the incoming laser light so that the natural Fourier transforming property of a lens causes the desired image to appear in the <b>specimen</b> <b>plane.</b> The process enables one-off projects to be done without the cost of fabricating a mask, and makes it possible to perform lithography with fewer (or even no) moving parts...|$|E

In the demagnetized state at 290 K, a (110) oriented surface contains many non- 180 ° walls, oriented along crystallographic directions, typically 50 µm in width. Synchrotron X-radiation topographs have been taken sequentially in increasing magnetic fields up to 3 kOe oriented in various directions in the <b>specimen</b> <b>plane.</b> After signifiant reorganization of the structures in low fields, an immobile domain structure formed which persisted up to the highest fields available. Application of a field parallel to [1 [MATH] 1] resulted in immobile walls parallel to [1 [MATH] 1]. From consideration of the X-ray diffraction contrast in the synchrotron topographs we suggest that in the demagnetized state closure structures exist between domains magnetized {{in one of the}} [111] easy directions in the surface and an inclined [111] easy direction. The immobile structures consist of 109 ° walls between the two [111] easy directions inclined to the surface. From magnetostatic considerations we see that such walls can lie in any plane containing [110] and as the component of magnetization in the <b>specimen</b> <b>plane</b> is equal in sense and magnitude in both domains, the structure is immobile.

40|$|Specimen {{size and}} loading rate {{effects on the}} {{fracture}} of ferritic steels remain key issues {{for the application of}} pre-cracked Charpy specimens. This investigation employs nonlinear finite element analyses to assess the effects of specimen size and loading rate on cleavage fracture and ductile crack growth in these specimens. To examine loading rate effects on cleavage fracture, plane strain and 3 -D' finite element analyses assess crackfront stress triaxiality in quasi-static and impact-loaded CVN <b>specimens.</b> <b>Plane</b> strain analyses utilize J-Q trajectories and the Toughness Scaling Methodology to quantify loading rate effects on near-tip constraint. Crack front conditions in the 3 -D analyses are characterized in terms of the Weibull stress which reflects the statistical effects on cleavage fracture. The 3 -D computations indicate a less strict size/deformation limit than plane strain analyses to maintain small-scale yielding conditions at fracture under quasi-static and impact loading conditions. For impact analyses which violate these size/deformation limits, a modified toughness scaling methodology based on the Weibull stress is described to remove the effects of constraint loss. This new scaling model also enables prediction of the distribution of quasi-static fracture toughness values from a measured distribution of impact toughness values (and vice versa). This procedure is applied to experimental data obtained from a CrNi- Mo-V pressure vessel steel and accurately predicts quasi-static fracture toughness values in 1 T-SE(B) specimens from impact-loaded, pre-cracked CVN specimens. To quantify the effects of loading rate on ductile crack growth in CVN <b>specimens,</b> <b>plane</b> strain, finite element analyses are used to model ductile crack extension in specimens subjected to quasi-static and impact loading. The Gurson-Tvergaard dilatant plasticity model for voided materials describes the degradation of material stress capacity. Fixed-size, computational cell elements defined over a thin layer along the crack plane provide an explicit length scale for the continuum damage process. Parametric studies focusing on numerically generated R-curves quantify the relative influence of impact velocity, material strain rate sensitivity, and properties of the computational cells (thickness and initial cell porosity). In all cases, impact loading elevates significantly the R-curve by increasing the amount of background plasticity. Validation of the computational cell approach to predict loading rate effects on R-curves is accomplished by comparison to quasi-static and impact experimental sets of R-curves for three different steels.

It suggests that casting defects strongly affect the fatigue properties of aging stainless cast steel. Furthermore, according to the estimation of fatigue life, it is clear that fatigue life of aged stainless cast steel can evaluate by using the casting defect size at crack initiation site and the stress intensity factor calculated by defect size. In addition, to clear the fatigue crack propagation behavior, the relationship between the fatigue crack growth rate and effective stress intensity range was examined by using the unloading elastic compliance method which can observe the detailed fatigue crack closure behavior...|$|R

For the study of magnetization reversal dynamics and magnetic domain wall (DW) motion in ferromagnetic thin films, imaging techniques are indispensable. Here, we report 4 D imaging of DWs by the out-of-focus Fresnel method in Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM), with in situ spatial and temporal resolutions. The temporal change in magnetization, as revealed by changes in image contrast, is clocked using an impulsive optical field to produce structural deformation of the specimen, thus modulating magnetic field components in the <b>specimen</b> <b>plane.</b> Directly visualized are DW nucleation and subsequent annihilation and oscillatory reappearance (periods of 32 and 45 ns) in nickel films on two different substrates.

For endomicroscope application, wide-field two-photon excitation {{has the advantage of}} requiring no scanning in the distal end. However, wide-field two-photon excitation requires peak power that is 10 [superscript 4]– 10 [superscript 5] times higher than the point scanning approach corresponding to femtosecond pulses with energy on the order of 1 – 10  μJ at the <b>specimen</b> <b>plane.</b> The transmission of these high energy pulses through a single mode fiber into the microendoscope is a significant challenge. Two approaches were pursued to partially overcome this limitation. First, a single high energy pulse is split into a train of pulses with energy below the fiber damage threshold better utilizing the available laser energy. Second, stretching the pulse width in time by introducing negative dispersion was shown to have the dual benefit of reducing fiber damage probability and compensating for the positive group velocity dispersion induced by the fiber. With these strategy applied, 11 fold increase in the two photon excitation signal has been demonstrated. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)
