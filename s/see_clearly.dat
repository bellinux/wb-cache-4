5|$|There is {{debate about}} the extent to which the Renaissance {{improved}} on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance towards the modern age.

5|$|After Martel {{returned}} from his injury, he {{was placed in a}} storyline in which he blinded Jake Roberts by spraying him in the face with cologne on the Brother Love Show. Martel and Santana faced each other on the November 11 episode of Wrestling Challenge, and Roberts interfered. Unable to <b>see</b> <b>clearly,</b> he accidentally attacked Santana but vowed revenge against Martel. Bad News Brown left the WWF after SummerSlam, citing broken promises as his reason.|$|E

5|$|The plane {{took off}} {{normally}} from runway 17 (today's runway 18) at 12:55am Central Time on Tuesday, February 3. Dwyer, {{the owner of}} the flight service company, witnessed the take-off from a platform outside the control tower. He was able to <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> the aircraft's tail light for most of the brief flight, which started with an initial left turn onto a northwesterly heading and a climb to 800ft. The tail light was then observed gradually descending until it disappeared out of view. Around 1:00am, when Peterson failed to make the expected radio contact, repeated attempts to establish communication were made, at Dwyer's request, by the radio operator, but they were all unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Snell's law - {{the index}} of {{refraction}} of water {{is similar to that}} of the cornea of the eye—30% greater than air. This is the reason a diver cannot <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> underwater without a diving mask with an internal airspace.|$|E
25|$|Divers {{who need}} {{corrective}} lenses to <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> outside {{the water would}} normally need the same prescription while wearing a mask. Generic and custom corrective lenses are available for some two-window masks. Custom lenses can be bonded onto masks that have a single front window or two windows.|$|E

The magnitudes of the Gamma Volantis stars are fourth and sixth, and of Epsilon Volantis fourth and eighth.|$|E
25|$|Her {{original}} {{power was}} nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> what she did see, and give a clear expression to what she had to say. In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.|$|E

25|$|Dmitry's {{mother died}} in 1911, at her funeral the grand duke’s poor {{eyesight}} became the source of temporary mirth {{at the end of}} the ceremony when he tried to kiss the icon his mother held in her hands. Unable to <b>see</b> <b>clearly,</b> he misjudged the distance and, bending forward to make his farewell, missed the open coffin completely, tumbling off the steps with a loud crash as his ceremonial saber and medals struck the stone floor. Relatives rushed to his side, but the grand duke appeared unfazed and went on as though nothing had happened.|$|E
25|$|By {{wearing a}} flat diving mask, humans can <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> under water. The scuba mask's flat window {{separates}} the {{eyes from the}} surrounding water by a layer of air. Light rays entering from water into the flat parallel window change their direction minimally within the window material itself. But when these rays exit the window into the air space between the flat window and the eye, the refraction is quite noticeable. The view paths refract (bend) {{in a manner similar}} to viewing fish kept in an aquarium. Linear polarizing filters decrease visibility underwater by limiting ambient light and dimming artificial light sources.|$|E
25|$|A diving mask (also half mask, {{dive mask}} or scuba mask) is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} that allows underwater divers, including, scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers to <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> underwater. Surface supplied divers usually use a full face mask or diving helmet, but in some systems the half mask may be used. When the human eye is {{in direct contact with}} water as opposed to air, its normal environment, light entering the eye is refracted by a different angle and the eye is unable to focus the light. By providing an air space in front of the eyes, light enters normally and the eye is able to focus correctly.|$|E

25|$|Monovision {{is the use}} of single-vision lenses (one {{focal point}} per lens) to focus an eye (typically the {{dominant}} one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Alternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of strabismus and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.|$|E
25|$|Though image {{intensification}} technology {{employed by}} different manufacturers varies, from the tactical {{point of view}} a night vision system is an optical device that enables vision at low light. The US government itself has recognized the fact that technology itself makes little difference as long as an operator can <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> at night. Consequently, the United States bases export regulations not on the generations, but on a calculated factor called figure of merit (FOM). The method of FOM calculation {{and its implications for}} export are briefly described in a National Defense University document called “The NATO Response Force” authored by Jeffrey P. Bialos, the Executive Director of the Transatlantic Security and Industry Program at the Johns Hopkins University and Stuart L. Koehl, a Fellow at the Center for Transatlantic Relations of the same university.|$|E

Robbie Shakespeare played the bass on [...] "Concrete Jungle", while organist Tyrone Downie {{performed on the}} same track {{as well as on}} [...] "Stir it Up". Chris Karen, Francisco Willie Pep and Winston Wright served as percussionists, and the female backing singing was performed by Rita Marley and her friend Marcia Griffiths, the latter of whom was already popular in Jamaica as a solo artist and together with her husband Bob Andy released successful singles. Tommy McCook played the flute.|$|E
500|$|American artists Johnny Nash and Barbra Streisand also {{recorded}} covers of [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] and released them as commercial singles in 1972 and 1974, respectively. Nash's version was featured on his eleventh studio album, I Can <b>See</b> <b>Clearly</b> Now (1972), and was {{distributed in the}} 7" [...] format in Jamaica and South Africa as the record's fourth and final single. Rita Marley, Bob's wife, was upset that Nash created a cover as he would be credited for the single's success and not Marley. Streisand's rendition was included on her sixteenth studio album, ButterFly (1974), and released as the record's lead single on 16 December 1974. It divided music critics {{in the way that}} several thought her voice was not suited for reggae music. In 1991 the singer would appear on Larry King Live and admit her disappointment in ButterFly and the songs that appeared on it.|$|E
