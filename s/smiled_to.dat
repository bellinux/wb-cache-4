500|$|Woolley {{had hoped}} to begin {{production}} of the new coins on July 1, 1916. There was heavy demand for small change, and as delays in actual production stretched into {{the second half of}} the year, Woolley was forced to have Barber prepare dies for 1916-dated dimes and quarters bearing the chief engraver's 1892 design. According to numismatist David Lange, [...] "Barber must have secretly <b>smiled</b> <b>to</b> himself as his familiar Roman bust of Liberty once again dropped from the presses by the thousands, and then by the millions." [...] There were sufficient half dollars from 1915 available to meet demand; no Barber halves were struck in 1916. The production difficulties were eventually ironed out, and at least token quantities of each of the new coins were struck in 1916, putting an end to the Barber coinage series.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes-Benz withdrew {{entirely from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of 1932 {{in the face of the}} {{economic}} crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, [...] "I can still see the expression on [...] Campari's face when I arrived back at the factory. He <b>smiled</b> <b>to</b> himself as if to say, Well, didn't I tell you that one wasn't going to make it?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Target Books novelisations give {{additional}} {{insight into}} the character. These were chiefly written by Terrance Dicks and/or Malcolm Hulke (who had collaborated on the television serial The War Games). In addition, Dicks oversaw the editing {{of the majority of}} the range. The first Target novel to feature The Master, written by Hulke, is Doctor Who and the Doomsday Weapon. This begins with two Time Lords discussing the history of TARDISes. One remarks that [...] "Two [...] have been stolen. By Time Lords. They both became bored with this place. It was too peaceful for them, not enough happening... One of them nowadays calls himself The Doctor. The other says he is The Master". The narrative continues [...] "The old Keeper <b>smiled</b> <b>to</b> himself, although remembering with some glee all the fuss when two TARDISes were stolen." [...] Asked for further information about the pair [...] "You mentioned the Doctor and the Master?" [...] the elder Time Lord continues [...] "There were tens of thousands of humans from the planet Earth, stranded on another planet where they thought they were re-fighting all the wars of Earth's terrible history. Well, the Doctor had done the best he could to stop it all. But in the end we had to step in and get all those poor soldiers back to Earth, and to all the right times in Earth’s history." ...|$|E
