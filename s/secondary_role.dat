5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. With an eye to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master town plan that called {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Hōshō {{participated in}} the Battle of Midway in June 1942 in a <b>secondary</b> <b>role.</b> After the battle, the carrier resumed her {{training}} role in Japanese home waters {{for the duration of}} the conflict and survived the war with only minor damage from air attacks. She was used as a repatriation transport after the war, making nine trips to bring some 40,000 Japanese soldiers and civilians to Japan from overseas locations. Hōshō was scrapped in Japan beginning in 1946.|$|E

5|$|Following Toronto's first-round exit, McGrady {{became a}} free agent, signing a six-year, $67.5 million {{contract}} with the Orlando Magic. He elected to join the Magic {{in part because he}} disliked his <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> playing behind Vince Carter, in part so that he could return home to Florida, and in part to play with their other newly acquired free agent, Grant Hill. Hill would go on to play in only 47 games total throughout his tenure with the team, forcing McGrady into a larger leadership and scoring role than anticipated.|$|E
5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size {{reduction}} of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.|$|E
5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E

5|$|Mycenaean armies shared several common {{features}} with other significant Late Bronze Age powers: they were initially based on heavy infantry, which bore spears, large shields and, in some occasions, armor. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry. Armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors until {{the collapse of}} the Bronze Age, while the sword played a <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> in combat.|$|E
5|$|No. 34 Squadron is the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) unit {{responsible}} for the transport of VIPs, including members of the Australian government, the Governor-General, and visiting dignitaries. It is based at Defence Establishment Fairbairn in Canberra, and administered by No.84 Wing, {{which is part of}} Air Mobility Group. The squadron has a <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> providing emergency transport during humanitarian operations. Its motto is Eo et redeo ("IGo and IReturn").|$|E
5|$|Olivier {{had been}} {{attempting}} to broaden his film career. He {{was not well}} known in the United States despite his success in Britain, and earlier attempts to introduce him to American audiences had failed. Offered the role of Heathcliff in Samuel Goldwyn's production of Wuthering Heights (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film's director, William Wyler, offered Leigh the <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> of Isabella, but she refused, preferring the role of Cathy, which went to Merle Oberon.|$|E

5|$|The HV and the HVO {{completely}} {{pushed the}} VRS from Mostar, advancing further east along {{the slopes of}} the Velež Mountain and capturing high ground overlooking the city by 21 June. The ARBiH supported the eastward push from the city only in a <b>secondary</b> <b>role.</b> Even though the front lines did not move significantly to the east, the city of Mostar was relatively secure from future VRS attacks. The offensive is considered to have ended on 26 June, when the HVO captured the Merdžan Glava peak of the Velež Mountain.|$|E
5|$|The pier's <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> was as {{a public}} pier, where {{pleasure}} craft were allowed to dock. Tour boats offering {{a view of the}} Kowloon side of the harbour used the pier for passenger boarding. Up to 1978, it was the finishing line for the annual cross-harbour swimming race. As the ceremonies declined, the pier's secondary purpose became the main one: people met and strolled in the area, and others fished.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Kunis {{auditioned for}} but failed to get {{the role of a}} Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly. Instead, she was cast in the <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were {{required}} to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. That '70s Show ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.|$|E

5|$|Information {{is largely}} absent {{regarding}} any major administrative changes Salih {{made to the}} Emirate of Aleppo. His only known institutional innovation was the post of shaykh al-dawla (chieftain of the state) or raʾīs al-balad (municipal chief), who served as Salih's trusted confidant and permanent representative {{with the people of}} Aleppo. The post emulated that of the shaykh, who played a <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> to an amīr in a princely Kilabi clan. The shaykh al-dawla played an important political role in the city and came from a prominent leading family. Salih assigned Ibn Mustafad to the post and utilized the aḥdāth, which consisted of young armed men from the city's lower and middle classes, as a police force. Although they cooperated with Salih, the aḥdāth were still an independent force. Sometime during his reign, Salih also acquired a number of Turkish ghilmān, though details about them are lacking in the sources.|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean armies were {{initially}} based on heavy infantry, equipped with spears, large shields {{and in some}} occasion armor. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry and armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors, while the sword played a <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> in combat. Other offensive weapons used were bows, maces, axes, slings and javelins. The precise role and contribution of chariots on the battlefield {{is a matter of}} dispute {{due to the lack of}} sufficient evidence. It appears that chariots {{were initially}} used as fighting vehicles during the 16th to 14th centuries BC, while later, in the 13th century BC, their role was limited to battlefield transport.|$|E
5|$|Nautical units often play a <b>secondary</b> <b>role,</b> {{but can be}} {{essential}} to victory. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather fish. Merchant ships trade resources from the stockpile and exchange it for gold at another player's dock, {{with the amount of}} gold earned being relative to the distance between both docks. Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another. As well as attacking enemy ships, warships can be very effective in attacking land-based units close to the shoreline (because melee units cannot fight back). Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders (very effective against buildings near the shoreline).|$|E

50|$|His {{career in}} Romania was {{relatively}} short: he {{performed at the}} Romanian Opera for seven seasons between 1966 and 1971. He sang in 22 operas, mainly in <b>secondary</b> <b>roles,</b> but also in main roles such as Rinuccio (Gianni Schicchi), Rodolfo (La bohème), Il Duca di Mantova (Rigoletto), Ernesto (Don Pasquale), and Tamino (Die Zauberflöte, which was his last performance in Romania, on 23 June 1972). He also appeared in <b>secondary</b> <b>roles</b> on the first opera LPs from Electrecord,(La traviata, Samson et Dalila and Carmen).|$|R
5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the venom hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, {{the fact that the}} canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E
5|$|India {{came out}} to bat with Tendulkar and Sehwag. McGrath opened the bowling for Australia. Tendulkar hit a {{boundary}} off the fourth ball of the over but was dismissed off the next delivery. Ganguly joined Sehwag and the pair scored at a run-a-ball before the former was dismissed by Lee in the tenth over. Kaif, the next man, was dismissed in the same over with the score 59 runs for 3 wickets. Dravid and Sehwag scored steadily from then on until the seventeenth over, when rain interrupted play with the score at 103 runs. After play resumed, Ponting brought in Australia's spinners, Brad Hogg and Darren Lehmann. Sehwag was more aggressive against both, hitting Lehmann for three consecutive fours and Hogg for a four and six; Dravid played a <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> to Sehwag, pushing often for singles. They were dismissed in quick succession after making 82 (off 81 balls) and 47 (off 57 balls) respectively. Following that, India began to lose wickets at regular intervals. Except for Yuvraj Singh (24) and Dinesh Mongia (12), {{the rest of the}} players were out for single-digit scores. India were bowled out for 234 runs in 39.2 overs when Zaheer Khan was dismissed by McGrath. Australia won the match by 125 runs, the largest margin of victory by runs in a World Cup final. It was their second successive World Cup trophy and their third overall. Ponting was declared the Man of the match for his 140 not out.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of Disney's princesses, Jasmine {{holds the}} {{distinction}} of being a supporting character in her own film, having been relegated to the <b>secondary</b> <b>role</b> of love interest. The character has garnered mixed reviews, with much denunciation directed towards her storyline and personality, both of which critics have dismissed as uninteresting and unoriginal; they have also accused Jasmine of lacking the depth of her predecessors Ariel and Belle from The Little Mermaid (1989) and Beauty and the Beast (1991), respectively, to whom she continues to be heavily compared. However, as the sixth Disney Princess and the franchise's first non-white member, the character is credited with introducing racial diversity to Disney's princess genre, although she has at the same time been criticized for being Westernized and Anglicized in both appearance and demeanor. Jasmine has made subsequent appearances in Aladdins sequels The Return of Jafar (1994) and Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996), as well as its television series and a Broadway musical adaption of the film. Both Larkin and Salonga have been awarded Disney Legends for their contributions to the role. Naomi Scott is set to play a live-action version of the character in a live action adaptation of the 1992 film.|$|E
