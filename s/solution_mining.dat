25|$|In-situ {{leaching}} (ISL), {{also known}} as <b>solution</b> <b>mining,</b> or in-situ recovery (ISR) in North America, involves leaving the ore where {{it is in the}} ground, and recovering the minerals from it by dissolving them and pumping the pregnant solution to the surface where the minerals can be recovered. Consequently, there is little surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock generated. However, the orebody needs to be permeable to the liquids used, and located so that they do not contaminate ground water away from the orebody.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium {{chloride}} is {{the name}} for the chemical compound with the formula MgCl2 and its various hydrates MgCl2(H2O)x. These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water. In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from Great Salt Lake brine. It is extracted in a similar process from the Dead Sea in the Jordan valley. Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral bischofite, is also extracted (via <b>solution</b> <b>mining)</b> out of ancient seabeds; for example, the Zechstein seabed in northwest Europe. Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater. Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.|$|E

By 1035 AD, Chinese in the Sichuan area were using percussion drilling to recover deep brines, a technique that would not be introduced to the West for another 600 to 800 years. Medieval and modern European travelers to China between 1400 to 1700 AD reported salt and natural gas production from dense networks of brine wells. Many of the wells were sunk deeper than 450 m and at least one well was more than 1000 meters deep. The medieval Venetian traveler to China Marco Polo reported an annual production in a single province of more than 30,000 tonnes of brine during his time there.|$|E
2500|$|Once a salt {{feature is}} {{discovered}} {{and found to}} be suitable {{for the development of}} a gas storage facility a cavern is created within the salt feature.

The early signs of unstable evolution were detected during spring 2008 : shifts in microseismic background regime end recurrent microseismic episodes were associated to a general upwards process of rock failure of the roof cavern, with no ground surface movement detected.

40|$|In the {{northern}} part of The Netherlands the magnesium salts carnalite and bischofite are mined in a deep <b>solution</b> <b>mine.</b> For optimal production and also for environmental impact such as subsidence, it is vital to understand the process of salt production. To this aim, it is studied whether seismic in time-lapse mode may help to visualize and quantify the changes due to the salt production. The main questions addressed are: Can changes due to salt production be detected in seismic time-lapse mode? And if so, how big are these changes? To address these issues, a modelling study was performed. Seismic data were synthesized using acoustic and elastic finite-difference schemes, and further processed to obtain migrated seismic images. For the models themselves, different production scenarios were studied. Analysis of these data clearly shows that salt mining causes detectable changes in time-lapse seismic signals and can be quantified.

As algorithms increasingly support different aspects of modern life, a greater level of transparency is sorely needed, not least because discrimination and biases have to be avoided.
