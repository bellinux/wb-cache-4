40|$|A {{circular}} sharp-crested weir is {{a circular}} control section used for measuring flow in open channels, reservoirs, and tanks. As flow measuring devices in open channels, these weirs are placed {{perpendicular to the}} sides and bottoms of straight-approach channels. Considering the complex patterns of flow passing over circular sharp-crested weirs, an equation having experimental correlation coefficients was used to extract a <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relation</b> for weirs. Assuming the occurrence of critical flow over the weir crest, a theoretical <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relation</b> was obtained in this study by solving two extracted non-linear equations. To study the precision of the theoretical <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relation,</b> 58 experiments were performed on six circular weirs with different diameters and crest heights in a 30 cm-wide flume. The results show that, for each stage above the weirs, the theoretically calculated discharge {{is less than the}} measured discharge, and this difference increases with the stage. Finally, the theoretical <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relation</b> was modified by exerting a correction coefficient which {{is a function of the}} ratio of the upstream flow depth to the weir crest height. The results show that the modified <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relation</b> is in good agreement with the measured results...|$|E

40|$|The stages {{produced}} by the major floods on developed rivers (like the Rhine in Europe, the Mississippi and the Red rivers in the USA) indicate that existing stage-discharge relationships are usually several feet higher than the stage-discharge relationship if the rivers were natural or partially developed. The objectives of this paper are to discuss the problem of estimating the flowline for the design flood on developed rivers, and {{in so far as}} is possible with existing data, point to a rational methodology for developing this estimate. The problem is approached in two stages. First, the <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relations</b> in undeveloped and developed rivers are analysed and contrasted qualitatively to provide an indication of expected trends. Second, stage-discharge records on a developed river and an estimate of the energy gradient are combined with a computer solution of several methods for computing channel roughness to provide a plot of roughness (Manning’s n) versus discharge.

A survey of the available literature was made and from this {{it appeared that the}} most logical procedures proposed have been those based on the routing of a catchment time-area diagram through the catchment storage. This type of procedure was adopted. The relevant unitgraph parameters were determined by trial and error from the catchment time-area diagram and average unitgraph. An objective method of deriving the unitgraph parameters was also developed. It was shown that the unitgraph parameters defined by other workers were unsatisfactory for the catchments used in this study. The adopted unitgraph parameters were correlated, by trial and error, with combinations of catchment characteristics and a relationship between the catchment characteristics and unitgraph parameters was proposed. Relationships proposed by other workers were examined and generally found to be inapplicable to the catchments studied.

40|$|Abstract: A {{method for}} calculating <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relations</b> (rating curves) and {{suspended}} sediment concentrations in gravel bedded streams is presented {{and applied to}} a reach downstream from a U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) gaging station on Little Prickly Pear Creek, MT. The approach uses a fluid-mechanically based model to convert measurements of stage into discharge and boundary shear stress fields appropriate for determining sediment transport. The model does not use empirical roughness coefficients, such as the Manning coefficient, but rather determines channel roughness from field measurements of the channel geometry and the dominant physical and biological roughness elements in the modeled reach. The theoretical flow rating curve produced by the model is in excellent agreement with direct measurements of discharge made by the USGS. An empirical relation between the concentration of fine sediment near the bed {{and the rate of}} bedload transport is developed using station sediment data. This relation and a point measurement of concentration as a function of grain size are employed by the model to calculate suspended sediment concentration fields and fluxes in the reach. The approach also can be used to generate a sediment rating curve. Our method has the potential of providing accurate estimates of stream flow and suspended sediment loads less expensively than conventional gaging methods...|$|R
40|$|Variable {{effects of}} backwaters complicate the {{development}} of rating curves at hydrometric measurement stations. In areas influenced by backwater, single-parameter rating curve techniques are often inapplicable. To overcome this, several authors have advocated {{the use of an}} additional downstream level gauge to estimate the longitudinal surface level gradient, but this is cumbersome in a lowland meandering river with considerable transverse surface level gradients. Recent developments allow river flow to be continuously monitored through velocity measurements with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (H-ADCP), deployed horizontally at a river bank. This approach was adopted to obtain continuous discharge estimates at a cross-section in the River Mahakam at a station located about 300 km upstream of the river mouth in the Mahakam delta. The discharge station represents an area influenced by variable backwater effects from lakes, tributaries and floodplain ponds, and by tides. We applied both the standard index velocity method and a recently developed methodology to obtain a continuous time-series of discharge from the H-ADCP data. Measurements with a boat-mounted ADCP were used for calibration and validation of the model to translate H-ADCP velocity to discharge. As a comparison with conventional discharge estimation techniques, a <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relation</b> using Jones formula was developed. The discharge rate at the station exceeded 3250 m 3 s&minus; 1 . Discharge series from a traditional <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relation</b> did not capture the overall discharge dynamics, as inferred from H-ADCP data. For a specific river stage, the discharge range could be as high as 2000 m 3 s&minus; 1 , which is far beyond what could be explained from kinematic wave dynamics. Backwater effects from lakes were shown to be significant, whereas interaction of the river flow with tides may impact discharge variation in the fortnightly frequency band. Fortnightly tides cannot easily be isolated from river discharge variation, which features similar periodicities...|$|E

The total flood water was 95 % {{of the volume of}} Pamlico Sound, and many locations exceeded the record for rainfall in a 24 -hour period. North Carolina flood mapping and hydrology projects were started after Floyd. The high water mark signs in the community reflect the social and policy legacy of the storm. When looking at long-term effects, the researchers did not see many changes in flow or channel characteristics based on <b>stage–discharge</b> <b>relations</b> and USGS rate curves. Data from three gauges were examined based on the NWS flood modeling program. At Rocky Mount, upstream of the Tar reservoir, flow is regulated. The inundation model is highly correlated with a well established relationship between stage and discharge. The timeline of Floyd follows the model very well; however, a moderate flood causes a different relationship between stage and discharge. The Tar River at Tarboro, using the same rating curve, showed change after Floyd. In Greenville, a partial duration series showed that, during extreme floods, the relationships are about the same, but there were changes at minor to moderate flood stage. Minor to moderate flood inundation maps might be different than the typical inundation maps currently used...|$|R

A rating-curve-based methodology is adopted to derive water discharge from altimetric data provided by Envisat at 444 virtual stations (VS). The <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relations</b> at VS are built based on radar altimetry and outputs from a global flow routing scheme. In order to quantify the impact of modeling uncertainties on rating-curve based discharges, another experiment is performed using simulated discharges derived from a simplified data assimilation procedure. Discharge estimates at 90 VS are evaluated against observations during the curve fitting calibration (2002 – 2005) and evaluation (2006 – 2008) periods, resulting in mean relative RMS errors as high as 52 % and 12 % for experiments without and with assimilation, respectively. Without data assimilation, uncertainty of discharge estimates can be mostly attributed to forcing errors at smaller scales, generating a positive correlation between performance and drainage area. Mean relative errors (RE) of altimetry-based discharges varied from 15 % to 92 % for large and small drainage areas, respectively.

40|$|Discharge {{time series}} in {{rivers and streams}} are usually based on simple stage-discharge {{relations}} calibrated using a set of direct stage-discharge measurements called gaugings. Bayesian inference recently emerged as a most promising framework to build such hydrometric rating curves accurately and to estimate the associated uncertainty. In addition to providing the rigorous statistical framework necessary to uncertainty analysis, the main advantage of the Bayesian analysis of rating curves arises from the quantitative assessment of i) the hydraulic controls that govern the <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relation,</b> and of ii) the individual uncertainties of available gaugings, which often differ according to the discharge measurement procedure and the flow conditions. In this paper, we introduce the BaRatin method for the Bayesian analysis of stationary rating curves and we apply it to three typical cases of hydrometric stations with contrasted flow conditions and variable abundance of hydraulic knowledge and gauging data.

40|$|Most {{approaches}} to interpreting alluvial records in drylands fall {{into one of}} two categories: (1) The 2 ̆ 2 arroyo problem, 2 ̆ 2 wherein workers study cycles of streambed aggradation and degradation in broad, unconstricted alluvial valleys; and (2) paleoflood hydrology, where alluvial sequences in constricted bedrock canyons are interpreted as paleoflood deposits from streams with stable channel grade and geometry. Both approaches can be valid in their end-member settings, but there is confusion about how the two record types relate in a single drainage. We address this disconnect in Buckskin Wash, an ephemeral stream that consists of a broad alluvial reach draining into a tightly constricted slot canyon. By employing detailed sedimentology, stratigraphy, and geochronology in both the alluvial and constricted reaches of the watershed, we test the hypothesis that the slot canyon deposits are anticorrelated to valley-fill deposits upstream, implying that arroyo cutting is driven by episodic flooding. Alluvial reach deposits are characterized by stratal packages representing incremental, long-term aggradation bound by erosion surfaces representing channel entrenchment. At least four packages younger than 3 ka are present, the youngest spanning 0. 7 - 0. 15 ka. Each is composed of interfingering imbricated gravels, laminated sands, and massive silty clays. Constricted reach deposits consist of five discrete packages, each composed of tabular beds of laminated silty sand that were deposited relatively rapidly. The oldest package dates to 1. 9 - 1. 1 ka, whereas the rest of the deposits are younger than 0. 15 ka. Traditional paleoflood techniques would suggest that the constricted reach deposits record a 1000 -year absence of paleofloods followed by 100 years of frequent, high-magnitude flooding that indeed correlate to arroyo cutting upstream. We argue instead that the constricted reach deposits record an episode of higher preservation potential. Transport of sediment from the alluvial reaches during historic arroyo cutting likely led to a pulse of sediment storage and changed <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relations</b> in the slot canyon downstream, allowing even moderate floods to overtop existing deposits and be preserved. This new interpretation suggests that, because preservation may be a function of episodic sediment loading from upstream, constricted-reach deposits may not accurately record the paleoflood history of a stream...|$|R

D. {{research}} analyses {{the flow}} in straight and meandering compound channels having wide floodplains of large width ratio of value of nearly 12 and main channel aspect ratio {{of more than}} 5, which is very significant {{in the field of}} river hydraulics. Experiments were conducted in the Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics laboratory of National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India by casting smooth and rigid, straight and meandering compound channels inside a tilting flume. The research investigates the distribution of longitudinal velocity; depth averaged velocity for inbank and overbank flow cases in both straight and meandering compound channels. The measurement of the boundary shear stress for those flow conditions was done by Preston tube technique. As a complementary study to the experimental research undertaken in this work, two numerical hydrodynamic tools viz. Conveyance Estimation System (CES) developed by HR Wallingford,UK and CCHE 2 D developed by NCCHE, University of Mississippi,US are applied to simulate the overbank flow cases for both straight and meandering compound channels, for large scale EPSRC-FCF experiments and for a natural river. All the important flow parameters are also extracted numerically from the simulation results to study them vis a vis their observed values.

Micro-ADV, Preston tube, notch, pointer gauge, manometers and other hydraulic equipment {{have been used to}} measure 3 -d velocity, boundary shear stress, and water surface profile at different sections of the channels. The research investigates the modeling of water surface profile, distribution of longitudinal velocity, depth-averaged velocity, boundary shear stress and energy loss for overbank flow cases in both prismatic and non-prismatic sections of converging compound channels. As a complementary study to the experimental research, numerical hydrodynamic tools viz. ANSYS is applied to simulate the flow for both prismatic and non-prismatic sections of converging compound channels. All the important flow parameters are extracted numerically from the simulation results to study them vis a vis their observed values. As a prediction of flow variables in a non-prismatic converging compound channel is a much complex phenomenon, so an ANN has also been employed for prediction of depth-averaged velocity, boundary shear, and energy loss for different flow conditions. From the experimental study, new expressions for the water surface, energy loss and stage-discharge relationship for converging compound channels have been developed and validated with the present data and data sets from previous research projects.

40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of river discharge is time consuming and financially demanding. Continuous river discharge measurements are therefore generally derived from continuous stage measurements, through a <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relation,</b> also called a rating curve. Rating curves {{are determined by}} fitting a curve to {{a limited number of}} points (hi, Qi), whereby hi and Qi represent stage and discharge measured in a certain cross-section of a river at a fixed geographical location. Commonly these points (hi, Qi) originate from measurements done under regular flow conditions, due to which a considerable part of the curve is based on interpolation and extrapolation. Therefore the uncertainty in the rating curve particularly during floods can be considerable, which directly translates into uncertainty in the discharge data. Calibrating a model on uncertain discharge observations leads to biased model parameter estimates, which directly lead to biased model predictions. This research shows an approach whereby a conceptual rainfall-runoff model is calibrated on the basis of stage data only. In addition to the existing conceptual model parameters, extra parameters have been added that define the rating curve. A stepwise calibration method has been applied whereby first the rating curve parameters were determined and subsequently the remaining model parameters. Once the rating curve parameters had been fixed, the reanalysed hydrograph was established using the observed stage readings. Subsequently, the model hypotheses on catchment behaviour were tested by conventional methods. In this research these methods have been applied to the scarcely gauged Endau River catchment, located in the South-East of peninsula Malaysia. The initial results are promising. It was found that the rating curve parameters are well defined and optimise to values that correspond to the physical property they represent. When comparing the reanalysed rating curve with the original rating curve {{it can be seen that}} the initial part of the rating curve overlaps, corresponding with the most reliable part of the original rating curve. When comparing the reanalysed rating curves with discharge measurements, a high correspondence is observed, while the similarity between the measurements and the original rating curve is very low. Finally, the modelled hydrographs appear to be relatively well able to mimic the reanalysed hydrograph, even though it was impossible to find a proper model for the original hydrograph. To test the sensitivity of the calibrated rating curve to model structure, both a lumped and a topography driven model structure have been tested. Additionally, these models were exposed to two rating curve definitions and a variable model forcing. The results of this sensitivity analysis show that the calibrated rating curve is relatively insensitive to model structure and relatively sensitive to the number of parameters used for the rating curve definition. Concerning the forcing, the rating curve is highly sensitive to precipitation and less sensitive to potential evaporation. The reason for this sensitivity is that the established rating curve is strongly determined by the water balance, which is dominated by the primary driver P. The calibrated models have been validated on independent data by split-sample validation and by transfer to a different catchment. The topography driven models appear to perform best during both forms of validation. An additional way of validating was carried out by coupling the best performing rainfall-runoff model to a steady state salt intrusion model: a novel approach which offers mutual model validation. The results show that the predicted discharge of the rainfall-runoff model corresponds rather well with the discharge determined by the salt model. So, the most important conclusions from this research are: calibration of a rainfall-runoff model on stage reduces discharge uncertainty in scarcely gauged basins; topography driven models are better transferable than lumped models; and linking a salt intrusion model to a rainfall-runoff model offers mutual model improvement.

SSC fluctuated in close correspondence with discharge, and the highest measured concentration was 555 mg L- 1. Each year, approximately 50 percent of the suspended sediment discharge (SSQ) occurred during only 10 percent of the field season. Daily SSQ was strongly associated with air temperature at the median watershed elevation (r = 0. 70, 0. 92; entire field seasons 1991, 1992). These results demonstrate that sediment transfer to Lake C 2 is a response to snowmelt. ^ Among meteorological variables measured at weather station Alert (ca. 225 km east), rawinsonde sounding temperatures at 600 m were most closely associated with daily SSQ into Lake C 2. Accordingly, an exponential equation, based on pooled 1990 and 1992 data, was used to predict daily watershed SSQ for the period of record (1951 - 89). The series of annual predicted sediment loads were found to be in excellent agreement with a normalized varve thickness series. This study indicates that laminated sediments in Lake C 2 contain a high-resolution record of regional summer temperature. ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to examine the {{relations}} among stream flow diversions, inchannel processes, and the geomorphic framework of river basins. An essential component of this research program is a spatially distributed characterization of streamflow and sediment flux in a channel network affected by multiple diversions and tributary junctions. These data indicate that operation of diversions during the snowmelt runoff season affects the timing and spatial distribution of water and sediment flux. We measured stream flow and sediment transport and developed a geomorphic characterization of the study area. The study area extends from the confluence of Carter Creek to the mouth of the Cub River canyon, near Franklin, Idaho. It is 17 km long and drains approximately of 155 km 2. Stream gradient varies from 0. 001 to 0. 033 and the average peak flow is 17 m 3 /s. Within the study area two major diversion structures are operated from May through mid-October for irrigation. A third diversion is operated nearly year-round for reservoir filling. We divided the study area into four segments, separated by the three diversions and established study sites in each segment. We measured streamflow at the first three sites and developed <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relations.</b> We used an acoustic stage-measurement device at one site, which allowed us to construct a continuous record of stage and discharge for most of the runoff season at that location. We also obtained daily measurements of flow for each of the three diversions. We made periodic measurements of flow in the Upper and Lower Diversion to compare these records. We collected 212 bedload measurements during the 2006 runoff season in the Cub River and the diversion canals. Each of the measurements represents a set of three to six individual samples. Measurements were taken with bedload traps (0. 3 m x 0. 2 m nozzle) and hand-held Elwha sampler (0. 2 m x 0. 1 m nozzle). Bedload traps were mounted to the bed of the river for 60 minutes. Hand-held measurements were taken for 3 or 5 minutes depending on the flow. At each of the sites we collected at least 20 measurements with bedload traps and 10 measurements with hand-held sampler. We collected additional hand-held samples from nearby sites at road bridges during the peak flows. The measurements indicate a longitudinal variation in bedload similar to the longitudinal variation in discharge. The highest flow and highest sediment transport occurred in downstream reaches that were affected by tributaries earlier in the season, while natural snowmelt resulted in the greatest flow and sediment transport in the upper watershed later in the season. The grain size distribution of the bed load was much finer than the bed surface and similar or finer to that of depositional bars. The bed D 50 decreases downstream, but the D 50 of the gravel bars is similar throughout the study area. Thus, during a year of average peak runoff, depositional bars appeared to be fully mobilized while the bed was only partially mobilized...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a hydrological forecasting model is conditioned by the available data collected in the entire hydrological catchment for which discharge has to be predicted. The forecast quality not only depends on the available historical data {{but also on the}} continuously measured data that is necessary to update the model in real time according to the observed conditions. Consequently, the data type, their quality, reliability and the ease of data acquisition highly influence the final model choice. In Colombia, numerous catchments in the interior of the country are equipped with pluviometric and some of them with limnimetric stations but with often incomplete measurement series. For some catchments, temperature and evaporation data are also available but measured only on a sporadic basis. The acquisition of these data is often difficult, due to the accessibility, the size of the country and related costs. These factors have to be considered for the model development to ensure the use of representative and stable data. The present study analyses only one catchment, the one of the Rio Magdalena. It has been chosen for strategic and security reasons, in agreement with the persons in charge of the national hydrological service. For this catchment, the available data include water level measurements at different locations along the river (see the map in Section 3) and precipitation data measured at these limnimetric stations. The available <b>stage-discharge</b> <b>relations</b> are not reliable enough to build a discharge forecast model. A detailed measurement of the precipitation falling onto the catchment is difficult to carry out by conventional methods. The developed forecast models are of a so-called black-box type. They correspond to an autoregressive moving average model with exogenous variables. Each of them predicts river stages at a given point of the studied river. The explicative variables are either river stages or precipitation amounts, measured at the studied location or at other upstream stations. The forecast time step is one day and the forecasts are completed from one to five days ahead. The calibration of the model parameters is part of the model development process. For each limnimetric station, the resulting parameter values encode a model adapted to the available data and the considered forecast lag (time period between the forecast emission and the predicted event). In a first step, the developed models only include limnimetric data. In a second step, these models are further validated and affined considering pluviometric data. Models have been developed for all main stations of Rio Magdalena (see map at p. 24) but only the results for Barranca station are presented in details in this report. The obtained results can be considered as being good and reliable, as illustrated by the graphs and statistical tests presented in Section 5 and 6. A summary of the best model for each station and each forecast time lag given the available data is presented at Table 10 (Section 7, p. 57). The numerical developments have been realized in the programming environment MATLAB 6. 1 ®. The available data has been transformed into Excel format before using it as input data for the model development and application. The developed software has a graphical user interface. A CD-ROM containing the original software code and a compiled version is attached to the present report. The original source code can only be used in connection with Matlab®. iii The analysis underlying the present report can easily be transposed to other stations of the Magdalena river or include other available data. It can also be applied to other Colombian rivers having the same characteristics. A technician who is used to deal with hydrological forecasts can complete the necessary work and model testing. A specific training will be given to potential users during the visit of the expert accompanied by one of his co-workers. A generalization of the developed models will ask for an extension of the programs in order to enable their automatic use under any circumstances. The availability of the latest Matlab® version will be necessary. These questions will be discussed during the next expert mission. Finally, it is noteworthy that the {{development of}} an operational forecasting tool will require an important amount of additional work to integrate the real-time data measured in the field. This data will namely enable a real-time update of the model and its forecasts according to the errors between the observed data and the realized forecasts. Recursive parameter estimation could also highly improve the forecast quality but would need more sophisticated models and accordingly an appropriate training of the users...|$|R
