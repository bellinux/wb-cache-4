The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene, has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being excessively reductionist; she {{has suggested that the}} popularity of Dawkins's work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.|$|E
5|$|Recent DNA studies <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no {{more than}} three or four {{subspecies}} of elk. All American forms seem to belong to one subspecies (Cervus canadensis canadensis). Even the Siberian elk (Cervus canadensis sibiricus) are more or less identical to the American forms and therefore may belong to this subspecies, too. However the Manchurian wapiti (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) is clearly distinct from the Siberian forms, but not distinguishable from the Alashan wapiti. The Chinese forms MacNeill's deer, Kansu red deer, and Tibetan red deer belong also to the wapitis and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial DNA studies. These Chinese subspecies are sometimes treated as a distinct species, namely the Central Asian red deer (Cervus wallichi), which also includes the Kashmir stag.|$|E

25|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to map Protein–protein interactions among phage and their host. For instance, bacteriophage lambda was found to interact with its host E. coli by 31 interactions. However, a large-scale study revealed 62 interactions, most of which were new. Again, the significance of many of these interactions remains unclear, but these studies <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> most likely several key interactions and many indirect interactions whose role remains uncharacterized.|$|E

25|$|Waldorf schools build close {{learning}} communities, {{founded on}} the shared values of its members, in ways {{that can lead to}} transformative learning experiences that allow all participants, including parents, to become more aware of their own individual path, but which at times also risk becoming exclusive. Reports from small-scale studies <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> lower levels of harassment and bullying in Waldorf schools and that European Waldorf students have extremely lower rates of xenophobia and gender stereotypes than students in any other type of schools. Betty Reardon, a professor and peace researcher, gives Waldorf schools as an example of schools that follow a philosophy based on peace and tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Single gene {{mutations}} {{can cause}} Mendelian forms of high blood pressure; ten genes {{have been identified}} which cause these monogenic forms of hypertension. These mutations affect blood pressure by altering renal salt handling. There is greater similarity in blood pressure within families than between families, which indicates a form of inheritance, {{and this is not}} due to shared environmental factors. With the aid of genetic analysis techniques, a statistically significant linkage of blood pressure to several chromosomal regions, including regions linked to familial combined hyperlipidemia, was found. These findings <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many genetic loci, in the general population, each with small effects on blood pressure. Overall, however, identifiable single-gene causes of hypertension are uncommon, consistent with a multifactorial cause of essential hypertension.|$|E
25|$|The {{gradient}} {{in chemical}} potential {{is related to}} the moisture content gradient as explained in above equations (Keey et al., 2000). The diffusion model using moisture content gradient as a driving force was applied successfully by Wu (1989) and Doe et al. (1994). Though the agreement between the moisture-content profiles predicted by the diffusion model based on moisture-content gradients is better at lower moisture contents than at higher ones, {{there is no evidence to}} <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> significantly different moisture-transport mechanisms operating at higher moisture contents for this timber. Their observations are consistent with a transport process that is driven by the total concentration of water. The diffusion model is used for this thesis based on this empirical evidence that the moisture-content gradient is a driving force for drying this type of impermeable timber.|$|E

25|$|Indians {{have been}} living in Indonesia for centuries, {{from the time of the}} Srivijaya and Majapahit Empire both of which were Hindu and heavily {{influenced}} by the subcontinent. Indians were later brought to Indonesia by the Dutch in the 19th century as indentured labourers to work on plantations located around Medan in Sumatra. While the majority of these came from South India, a significant number also came from the north of India. The Medan Indians included Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. They have now been in Indonesia for over four generations and hold Indonesian passports. While local statistics continue to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some 40,000 PIOs in Sumatra, the vast majority are now completely assimilated into Indonesian society, though some elements of the Tamil, Punjabi and Odia communities still maintain their cultural traditions.|$|E
25|$|A species {{could benefit}} greatly from better {{abilities}} to reason about, predict {{and understand the}} world. French social and cognitive scientist Dan Sperber, with his colleague Hugo Mercier, describes {{the idea that there}} could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. Sperber points out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs. Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective - as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. Sperber says this could <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> not just individual, but group selection pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. They also claim that reason may {{have more to do with}} winning arguments than with the search for the truth.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory of}} {{creative}} {{people is the}} investment theory of creativity. This approach <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the investment sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into {{something that has been}} overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea {{to the point that it}} is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This investment theory of creativity views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.|$|E

25|$|Psychopathy is {{associated}} with several adverse life outcomes as well as increased risk of disability and death due to factors such as violence, accidents, homicides, and suicides. This, {{in combination with the}} evidence for genetic influences, is evolutionarily puzzling and may <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> compensating evolutionary advantages, and researchers within evolutionary psychology have proposed several evolutionary explanations. According to one hypothesis, some traits associated with psychopathy may be socially adaptive, and psychopathy may be a frequency-dependent, socially parasitic strategy, which may work {{as long as there is}} a large population of altruistic and trusting individuals, relative to the population of psychopathic individuals, to be exploited. It is also suggested that some traits associated with psychopathy such as early, promiscuous, adulterous, and coercive sexuality may increase reproductive success. Robert Hare has stated that many psychopathic males have a pattern of mating with and quickly abandoning women, and thereby have a high fertility rate, resulting in children that may inherit a predisposition to psychopathy.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{universal}} behaviors in the furry fandom {{is the creation of}} a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona – an anthropomorphic avatar or representation of themselves. Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas; in part, {{this is due to the}} fact that, for many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their ideal self. The most popular fursona species include wolves, foxes, dogs, large felines, and dragons. Data <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> generally no associations between personality traits and different fursona species. However, furries, along with sport fans, report different degrees of personality traits when thinking of themselves in their everyday identity compared with their fan identity. Some furries identify as partly non-human: 35% say they do not feel 100% human (compared with 7% of non-furries), and 39% say they would be 0% human if they could (compared with 10% of non-furries).|$|E
25|$|More recent {{research}} has extended established findings of age related decline in executive functioning, by examining related cognitive processes that underlie healthy older adults’ sequential performance. Sequential performance refers to the execution of a series steps needed to complete a routine, such as the steps required to make {{a cup of coffee}} or drive a car. An important part of healthy aging involves older adults’ use of memory and inhibitory processes to carry out daily activities in a fixed order without forgetting the sequence of steps that were just completed while remembering {{the next step in the}} sequence. A recent study examined how young and older adults differ in the underlying representation of a sequence of tasks and their efficiency at retrieving the information needed to complete their routine. Findings from this study revealed that when older and young adults had to remember a sequence of 8 animal images arranged in a fixed order, both age groups spontaneously used the organizational strategy of chunking to facilitate retrieval of information. However, older adults were slower at accessing each chunk compared to younger adults, and were better able to benefit from the use of memory aids, such as verbal rehearsal to remember the order of the fixed sequence. Results from this study <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> age differences in memory and inhibitory processes that affect people’s sequence of actions and the use of memory aids could facilitate the retrieval of information in older age.|$|E
