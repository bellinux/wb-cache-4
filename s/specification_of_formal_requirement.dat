40|$|Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are {{a proven}} {{methodology}} for the precise high-level <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> in early phases of software design. Many extensions to ASMs {{have been proposed}} and used widely, including Distributed ASMs, Turbo ASMs, Gurevich 2 ̆ 7 s partial updates, and syntactically convenient rule forms. This, coupled {{with the fact that}} ASMs do not bind the user to any predetermined data types or operators, allows for extreme flexibility in exploration of the problem space. Striving to provide this same level of freedom with executable ASMs, the CoreASM engine and language have been designed with syntactic and semantic extensibility in mind. We formally specify extensibility mechanisms that allow for language augmentation with arbitrary data structures supporting simultaneous incremental modification, new operators, and additional language syntax. Our work is a major step toward providing an environment suitable for both further experimentation with ASMs and for the machine-aided creation <b>of</b> robust software <b>specifications...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{details the}} design of an {{autonomous}} vehicle CAD toolchain, which captures <b>formal</b> descriptions <b>of</b> driving scenarios {{in order to develop}} a safety case for an autonomous vehicle (AV). Rather than focus on a particular component of the AV, like adaptive cruise control, the toolchain models the end-to-end dynamics of the AV in a formal way suitable for testing and verification. First, a domain-specific language capable of describing the scenarios that occur in the day-to-day operation of an AV is defined. The language allows the description and composition of traffic participants, and the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>formal</b> correctness <b>requirements.</b> A scenario described in this language is an executable that can be processed by a specification-guided automated test generator (bug hunting), and by an exhaustive reachability tool. The toolchain allows the user to exploit and integrate the strengths of both testing and reachability, in a way not possible when each is run alone. Finally, given a particular execution of the scenario that violates the requirements, a visualization tool can display this counter-example and generate labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on five autonomous driving scenarios drawn from a collection of 36 scenarios that account for over 95 % of accidents nationwide. These case studies demonstrate robustness-guided verification heuristics to reduce analysis time, counterexample visualization for identifying controller bugs in both the discrete decision logic and low-level analog (continuous) dynamics, and identification of modeling errors that lead to unrealistic environment behavior...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{illustrates}} {{a framework for}} the definition <b>of</b> <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> {{on the behavior of}} Web service compositions. The framework exploits Quantified Linear Time Logics (QLTL) as formal specification language. The paper also discusses two ap-proach for the verification <b>of</b> such <b>formal</b> <b>requirements.</b> The first approach, which is classical, transforms QLTL formulas into (non-quantified) Linear Time Logic formulas by expanding the quantifiers, and then exploits SAT-based Bounded Model Checking techniques on the resulting LTL formulas. The second approach, which is novel, exploits Bounded Model Checking techniques based on Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), thus avoiding the explicit expansion of the quantifiers. ...|$|R

Formally specified requirements can be validated by both direct execution and by proving properties at the specification level. We first discuss how the timing characteristics of a system can be specified by a formalism based on high-level Petri nets. Then we show how its temporal properties can be proven {{by means of a}} symbolic execution-based proof method for time reachability analysis. Depending on the complexity of the model of the specified system, the method may contain some undecidable steps and require interaction with the user. In many practical cases, however, the method can be performed mechanically and has acceptable response times...|$|R

40|$|Requirements play an {{important}} role in software systems developments. The impact of errors in requirements is costly, especially for safety and critical systems. Two kinds of properties are necessary in a <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> speci cation, applicationindependent properties and application properties. Application-independent properties are simple properties derived from the underlying <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> model and speci cation notation. Although detecting the failure to satisfy the application-independent properties is usually simple, the large size of requirements documents means that reviewers must spend considerable time and e ort checking them. Computer-supported preliminary checking tools are necessary for industrial application <b>of</b> <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> methods and improving the quality of requirements documents. In this thesis, a Preliminary Requirements Checking Tool (PRCT) is developed for this purpose. It checks the application-independent properties for SCR style requirements.

40|$|Abstract. For {{application}} scenarios such as {{the management}} of business process variants or business process quality, business objective models assume the role <b>of</b> <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> definitions as in software engi-neering. However, effective concepts in this area still constitute {{a gap in the}} presently available array of business process management meth-ods. To address this issue, this paper develops and shortly evaluates a refined business objective modeling approach. Our approach builds on use case-based effectiveness criteria, and on insights gained from assess-ing the state of the art. It derives required constructs and interrelations from application scenarios, and integrates these into a business objective meta-model. As an initial validation of our concept, we model a sample scenario and match the results against effectiveness criteria...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{business}} process design, business objective models can ful-fill the role <b>of</b> <b>formal</b> <b>requirement</b> definitions. Matching process models against objective models would, for instance, enable sound comparison of implementation alternatives. For that purpose, objective models {{should be available}} independently of their concrete implementation in a busi-ness process. This issue is not addressed by common {{business process}} management concepts yet. Moreover, process models are currently not sufficiently expressive to determine business process efficacy {{in the sense of}} fulfilling a business objective. Therefore, this paper develops and in-tegrates constructs required for efficacy-aware process modeling and apt to extend common modeling approaches. The concept is illustrated with a sample scenario. Overall, it serves as an enabler for progressive appli-cations like automated process optimization...|$|R
