25|$|Late in {{the regular}} season, while the Nationals were on their final road trip of the year between September 19 and 27, a new organ was {{installed}} at Nationals Park, fulfilling the Nationals organization's long-held goal of upgrading the stadium's organ. The Viscount Sonus 60, priced at $20,000 on European Web sites, was manufactured in Mondaino, Italy, and tuned in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was installed in a former radio booth {{on the second floor}} of the stadium′s press box, replacing a less-capable portable Hammond organ that had been located in a corner of the stadium′s <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> control <b>room.</b> The new location gave the organist a private room for the first time, as well as a better view of the field and crowd.|$|R
40|$|Similar {{to their}} optic counterparts, {{acoustic}} components are anticipated to flexibly tailor {{the propagation of}} sound. However, the practical applications, e. g. for audible sound with large wavelengths, are frequently hampered by the issue of device thickness. Here we present an effective design of metasurface structures that can deflect the transmitted airborne sound in an anomalous way. This flat lens, made of spatially varied coiling-slit subunits, has a thickness of deep subwavelength. By elaborately optimizing its microstructures, the proposed lens exhibits high performance in steering sound wavefronts. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. This study may open new avenues for numerous daily life applications, such as controlling indoor <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> by decorating <b>rooms</b> with light metasurface walls.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to explore how {{children}} may perceive <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> in the specially written radio saga made for this paper Ninjas Detektivbyrå (Ninja’s Detective firm). If <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> in any way can contribute to children perceiving more details, if specific <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> may bestow in creating a more monogamous distinction of signs and whether the dramaturgical structure possibly can become clearer when combining dialog with <b>sound</b> <b>effects.</b> The study was made possible with the help of two groups of children whom each listened to a version of the stimulus material, one with <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> and the other one without <b>sound</b> <b>effects,</b> and by qualitative interviews relaying on theories regarding communication, classical dramaturgy and research on how <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> impact on audience.
