500|$|On 13 October 2005, the Swedish Academy {{announced}} that it had decided to award the Nobel Prize in Literature for that year to Pinter, who [...] "in his plays uncovers the precipice under everyday prattle and forces entry into oppression's closed rooms". Its selection instigated some public controversy and criticism relating both to characteristics of Pinter's work and to his politics. [...] When interviewed that day about his reaction to the announcement, Pinter said: [...] "I was told today {{that one of the}} Sky channels <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that 'Harold Pinter is dead.' [...] Then they changed their mind and said, 'No, he's won the Nobel prize.' So I've risen from the dead." [...] The Nobel Prize Awards Ceremony [...] and related events throughout Scandinavia took place in December 2005. [...] After the Academy notified Pinter of his award, he had planned to travel to Stockholm to present his Nobel Lecture in person. In November, however, his doctor sent him to hospital and barred such travel, after a serious infection was diagnosed. Pinter's publisher, Stephen Page of Faber and Faber, accepted the Nobel Diploma and Nobel Medal at the Awards Ceremony in his place.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 February 2004, Short alleged on the BBC Today radio {{programme}} that British spies regularly intercept UN communications, {{including those of}} Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General. The claim was made {{the day after the}} unexplained dropping of whistleblowing charges against former GCHQ translator Katharine Gun. Reacting to Short's statement, Tony Blair said [...] "I really do regard what Clare Short has <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> as totally irresponsible, and entirely consistent [...]" [...] Blair also claimed that Short had put British security, particularly the security of its spies, at risk. The same day, on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Short called Blair's response [...] "pompous" [...] and said that Britain had no need to spy on Kofi Annan. Blair did not explicitly deny the claims but Robin Cook, former Foreign Secretary, wrote that in his experience he would be surprised if the claims were true.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. HOPE. Well, if I'd thought you'd have {{forgotten}} what you <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and turned about like this, d'you suppose I'd {{have spoken to}} you at all? Now, do you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear I {{am getting}} too strong to burden you much longer," [...] <b>said</b> Redclyffe, <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> [...] "I have no pretence to be a patient now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{we went to}} bed, {{but were}} too excited to sleep. Really, as Susan <b>said</b> solemnly <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> 'Mrs. Dr. dear, I think {{politics}} are too strenuous for women.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I wish to {{be alone}} with you for a few minutes. Since what I <b>said</b> to you <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> you have written to Colonel Osborne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This afternoon," [...] recounts Mrs. Bore, [...] "we were {{determined}} to come. 'John, dear,' I <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> 'I shall go and see dear Mrs. Bounder this afternoon, no matter what happens.'" ...|$|E
60|$|My father <b>said,</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> when my {{face was}} in repose and thoughtful, that I looked {{precisely}} as young Edward Twichell of Hartford used to look some is months ago--chin, mouth, forehead, expression--everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me now, my dear host," [...] the Prince began, {{with some}} eagerness in his tone, [...] "continue and, I trust, {{conclude}} {{the conversation to}} which all that I <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> was merely the prelude." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{yet it is}} {{very easy}} now to get to Jerusalem,' said Tancred; 'the great difficulty, as a very {{remarkable}} man <b>said</b> to me <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> is {{to know what to do}} when you are there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I was saying, Squire," [...] the farmer's wife said, {{speaking}} for the first time--for during the first portion of the conversation she had been crying quietly, and had since been busying herself in placing decanters and glasses and a huge homemade cake on the table. [...] "We all {{hope that you will}} soon bring a mistress home. I <b>said</b> only <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that you would never be settling down until you did.|$|R
6000|$|This did {{not quite}} satisfy Buckingham, for, {{conscious}} of his own rash purpose, he could not but apprehend discovery. After a moment's silence, [...] "Chiffinch," [...] he said abruptly, [...] "did you mention to any one what the King <b>said</b> to me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> touching the Lady Anne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{can keep}} {{them for the}} present," [...] {{answered}} Joseph Morris. [...] "Indeed, I don't think my wife will care to give them up in a hurry. She <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> the youngsters had taken a tight hold of her heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That won't do. The girl <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{that she}} should ask the {{landlord}} of the hotel {{for the name of}} one of the most respectable lawyers in our place, and should go with us when we give our instructions to him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, dear, how my head does ache!" [...] {{thought she}} to herself; [...] "and poor mother! she <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{she was afraid}} another of her sick turns was coming on, and we have all this work to pull out and do over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the second}} time I have been over the bridge to-day," [...] he <b>said,</b> [...] "and <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> very early, I saw, for the first time, your father's ship, which was lying below the town. It is a fine vessel, so far as I can judge, being a landsman." ...|$|R
6000|$|Inside the shoe-store, the {{proprietor}} was excited. [...] "Why," [...] he exclaimed to his assistant, [...] "that must be Appleby, the pedestrian--fellow you read so much about--the Indianapolis paper <b>said</b> just <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{that he was}} some place {{in this part of}} the country--you know, the fellow who's tramped all over Europe and Asia with his wife, and is bound for San Francisco now." [...] His one lone clerk, a youth with adenoids, gaped and grunted. It was incredible to him that any one should walk without having to.|$|R
5000|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critic Chris Nashawaty <b>said</b> [...] "Before <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I {{would have}} said that there was nothing funny about Donald Trump's run for the presidency. Then, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{something}} arrived like a Christmas present that came 10 months early: Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie. It's utterly demented, slightly terrifying, and most of all hilarious. It's also one of the giddiest and most stinging political satires since Thomas Nast took on Tammany Hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of what Mrs. Saltonstall <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> She asked me if I {{would like to go}} to Paris with her for the winter. It has always been one of my dreams to go abroad, and I do hope I shall not be disappointed." ...|$|E
60|$|GILBEY. No, I'm {{not going}} to ask. Juggins <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> he wanted to speak to me. If he likes to tell me, let him; but I'm {{not going to}} ask; and dont you either. [Juggins appears at the door]. You {{said you wanted to}} say {{something}} to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{child is}} doing well," [...] he said, [...] "and {{now that it}} has got its mother again, it will, I think, improve rapidly. The doctor <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that he {{considered}} it out of danger, but that it needed its mother sorely, to cheer and pet it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let them {{settle the}} grave affairs of State over there," [...] she had <b>said</b> to him <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> when first {{she made her}} curtsey before him. And with a provocative smile {{she pointed to the}} serious-looking group of grave gentlemen that {{surrounded}} his bedside, and also to the compact row of backs which stood in serried ranks round Mme. la Marquise d'Eglinton in the embrasure of the central window. [...] "Life is too short for such insignificant trifles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O-lo-a, Princess of Pal-ul-don," [...] said one, {{addressing}} her, [...] "the {{stranger who}} {{told us that he}} was the son of Jad-ben-Otho has but just fled from the wrath of Lu-don, the high priest, who exposed him and all his wicked blasphemy. The temple, and the palace, and the city are being searched and we have been sent to search the Forbidden Garden, since Ko-tan, the king, <b>said</b> that only <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> he found him here, though how he passed the guards he could not guess." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{two sisters}} did reunite, albeit briefly, on October 1, 1987, when they {{received}} a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, even singing a few bars of [...] "Beer Barrel Polka" [...] for the Entertainment Tonight cameras. An earthquake shook the area that very morning and the ceremony was nearly cancelled, which caused Patty to joke, [...] "Some people <b>said</b> that earthquake <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> was LaVerne because she couldn't be here, but really it was just Maxene and me on the telephone." [...] Besides this, and a few brief private encounters, they remained somewhat estranged {{for the last few}} years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, to {{tell the}} truth, when I got inside I felt as if I didn't care much about it. The place {{depressed}} me {{almost as much as}} it did you--it was ugly. And then I thought of what you had <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> as to whether we ought." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Geoffrey. [...] "I don't go {{back from}} my word; I stick to what I <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It's my {{endeavor}} {{to make you}} a good husband. It's my wish to make it up." [...] He paused, and then added his last reason: [...] "I'm fond of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she added, with an adorable uptilting of {{her little}} chin, [...] "I am not {{promising}} what I cannot fulfil. M. le Comte de Nolé only <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> apropos of dog thieves, that he would gladly give ten thousand francs to anyone who succeeded in ridding society of such pests." ...|$|E
6000|$|She glanced {{quickly at}} him, and her eyebrows straightened. He had risen, his face white and his gray eyes widely opened. [...] "I suppose you are right," [...] he went on, [...] "because {{you are saying}} to me what my {{partners}} <b>said</b> to me <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> when I offered to share my wealth with them, God knows as honestly as I offered to share my heart with you. I suppose that you are both right; {{that there must be}} some curse of pride or selfishness upon the money that I have got; but I have not felt it yet, and the fault does not lie with me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott {{was quoted}} as having <b>said,</b> [...] "Snow <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and now <b>this.</b> I don't believe it. I feel cheated. This isn't {{supposed}} to happen to us, not in Cincinnati. This is our history, our tradition, our team. Nobody feels worse than me." [...] Schott's statement was criticized as a public gaffe, though supporters contended that {{she was thinking of}} the some 50,000 fans who had expected to see a baseball game and might be unable to attend a makeup game. Schott sent flowers to the umpire dressing room, but a story in the Dayton Daily News later said that the flowers had been given to Schott on Opening Day by Reds television affiliate WLWT in Cincinnati. According to the story, Schott hastily wrote a sympathy note and attached it to the flowers.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{haunting}} me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> when I woke up," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>this</b> {{time her}} face straight ahead {{so that she}} might avoid a rope of wild grapevine that hung close to {{her side of the}} trail.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was for {{you that}} I called," [...] the woman said. [...] "By what you <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I judged you would be {{returning}} about this hour, {{and it was in}} hopes you might hear me that I cried out, for I knew well that no one else would be likely to be within earshot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just go on, and do {{it again}} {{whenever}} you feel like it. I know what loneliness is, and how telling worries often cures them. I meant every word I <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and will prove it by doing any thing in the world I can for you. Believe this, and let me be your friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{was not all}} out of {{a spirit}} of contradiction,' said Anne, 'though she <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{that she was very}} tired and very cross {{yesterday}} evening. But, Mamma, she also said that she thinks the time she spends in company wasted, and she really believes that no one dares to talk sense, or that if he does, everyone dislikes him.' ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{matter was}} {{reported}} to police <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and the incident is currently being investigated", the statement <b>said.</b> <b>This</b> event mirrors a series of incidents that occurred at last year's event, when several men attending the tournament were arrested for taking upskirt photographs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye {{could hardly}} weel be <b>said</b> to breakfast <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> my Lord Evandale, and ye maun e'en partake {{of a small}} {{collation}} before ye ride, such as this poor house, whose inmates are so much indebted to you, can provide in their present circumstances. For my ain part, I like to see young folk take some refection before they ride out upon their sports or their affairs, and I said as much to his most sacred Majesty when he breakfasted at Tillietudlem {{in the year of}} grace sixteen hundred and fifty-one; and his most sacred Majesty was pleased to reply, drinking to my health {{at the same time in}} a flagon of Rhenish wine, 'Lady Margaret, ye speak like a Highland oracle.' These were his Majesty's very words; so that your lordship may judge whether I have not good authority to press young folk to partake of their vivers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh, Frank Levitt," [...] <b>said</b> <b>this</b> new-comer, {{who entered}} with a hop, step, and jump, which at once {{conveyed}} {{her from the}} door into the centre of the party, [...] "were ye killing our mother? or were ye cutting the grunter's weasand that Tam brought in <b>this</b> <b>morning?</b> or have ye been reading your prayers backward, to bring up my auld acquaintance the deil amang ye?" ...|$|R
