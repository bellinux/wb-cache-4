These solids (often referred to as the tank 'heel') were sampled in 2010 and chemically and mineralogically analyzed in the 222 -S Laboratory. Additionally, dissolution tests were performed to identify the amount of undissolvable material after using multiple water contacts. This report covers the solid phase characterization of six samples from these tests using scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The chemical analyses, particle size distribution analysis, and dissolution test results are reported separately. Two of the samples were from composites created from as-received material - Composite A and Composite B. The main phase in these samples was sodium-fluoride-phosphate hydrate (natrophosphate) - in the X-ray diffraction spectra, this phase was the only phase identifiable. Polarized light microscopy showed the presence of minor amounts of gibbsite and other phases. These phases were identified by scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy as <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminosilicates,</b> <b>sodium</b> diuranate, and sodium strontium phosphate hydrate (nastrophite) crystals. The natrophosphate crystals in the scanning electron microscopy analysis showed a variety of erosive and dissolution features from perfectly shaped octahedral to well-rounded appearance. Two samples were from water-washed Composites A and B, with no change in mineralogy compared to the as-received samples. This is not surprising, since the water wash had only a short period of water contact with the material as opposed to the water dissolution tests. The last two samples were residual solids from the water dissolution tests. These tests included multiple additions of water at 15 C and 45 C. The samples were sieved to separate a coarser fraction of > 710 {mu}m and a finer fraction of < 710 {mu}m. These two fractions were analyzed separately. The coarser fraction contained mostly gibbsite with minor amounts of <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminosilicates</b> (cancrinite) and bismuth aluminum-rich phases.

40|$|Zeolite A is {{a commercially}} and {{environmentally}} important microporous material, which is commonly synthesized from calcined kaolin. One major drawback inherent to {{this approach is}} that the properties (i. e., purity, particle size, morphology, and cation-exchange capacity) of the final product depend largely {{on the quality of the}} raw kaolin ores. Herein we report on a new hydrothermal route for the synthesis of high purity zeolite A with controllable particle size and morphology, from natural kaolin without conventional high temperature calcination. This route starts with hydrothermal reaction of natural kaolin with NaOH to form hydrous <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminosilicates</b> (i. e. hydroxycancrinite and nepheline hydrate), which are then dissolved in dilute HCl. The resulting acid solution, after filtration to remove unreacted impurity minerals such as quartz and muscovite, is then adjusted to pH = 7 to form an amorphous Si and Al gel, which is used for the hydrothermal synthesis of zeolite A. A comparative study of zeolite A samples synthesized from this new route and those from the conventional calcination method reveals that the former have more controllable size and morphology than the latter, giving rise to higher brightness and enhanced cation-exchange capacity. Another major advantage of this new method is that the common impurity minerals such as quartz, muscovite and feldspars in natural kaolin can be removed, giving rise to high purity zeolite A and possibly expanding this technique to the use of low-grade kaolin. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Publication Date (Web) : December 12, 2015 In this paper, {{results are}} {{presented}} of experiments performed to assess control techniques to counteract the operational problems of agglomeration during gasification of a South Australian low-rank coal in a pilot scale circulating fluidized bed gasification (CFBG) plant. Kaolinite-rich clay additives {{were used in the}} experiments {{in order to reduce the}} problems associated with sodium present in coals. The effect of refreshing and removing the bed material during continuous gasification was also studied experimentally. Agglomerates were observed to form during tests that occurred without the addition of kaolinite; the joints of the agglomerates were found to be comprised principally of sodium and silicon, presumably as sodium silicates. Sodium silicates were also observed to contribute to deposition of bed material and ash in some parts of gasifier. Deposition occurred mainly just above the air delivery inlets to the riser and at the bottom of the recirculation leg. At both of these points, local higher temperatures than in the other parts of the gasifier would be expected, with temperature having a large influence on the viscosity and stickiness of silicate layers and their tendencies to stick to reactor surfaces. The addition of kaolinite clay reduces the formation of sodium silicates. Instead, sodium reacts with kaolinite to form <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminosilicates,</b> which do not melt at fluidized bed gasification conditions. Agglomeration during normal operating conditions was not observed during clay addition tests. These results further show that the formation of coating and agglomerates in the sand bed can be practically eliminated, and with fine-tuning of the Kingston coal gasification process, the problem of agglomeration and/or defluidization can potentially be overcome during operation of a commercial-scale gasifier.

A total of 275 one-day-old birds were randomly divided into 11 treatments, with 5 replicate pens per treatment and 5 chicks per pen. The 11 treat-ments included 3 diets without any adsorbent contain-ing either 0, 1, or 2 mg/kg of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) plus 8 additional treatments employing 2 dietary levels of AFB 1 (1 or 2 mg/kg), 2 different adsorbents [Solis (SO) and MTB- 100 (MTB) ], and 2 different levels of each absorbent (0. 1 and 0. 2 %) in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial ar-rangement. Solis is a mixture of different HSCAS and MTB is a combination of clay and yeast cell wall. Feed and water were provided ad libitum throughout the 21 -d study period. Body weight gain and feed intake were depressed and relative liver weight was increased in chicks fed AFB 1 compared with the positive control (P < 0. 05). Severe liver damage was observed in chicks fed 2 mg/kg of AFB 1 with lesions consistent with afla-toxicosis, including fatty liver and vacuolar degenera-tion. Serum glucose, albumin, total protein, Ca, P, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations were reduced by AFB 1 (P < 0. 05). The addition of either SO or MTB ameliorated the negative effects of 1 mg/kg of AFB 1 on growth performance and liver damage (P < 0. 05). How-ever, supplemental MTB failed to diminish the negative effects of 2 mg/kg of AFB 1, whereas SO was more ef-fective compared with MTB at 2 mg/kg of AFB 1 (P < 0. 05). These data indicate that the HSCAS prod-uct effectively ameliorated the negative effect of AFB 1 on growth performance and liver damage, whereas the yeast cell wall product was less effective especially at the higher AFB 1 concentration.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of hydrate <b>sodium</b> calcium <b>aluminosilicate</b> (HSCAS) {{to reduce the}} concentrations of free lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rumen fluid of cows was investigated. Six, rumen-fistulated crossbred Holstein, non-pregnant, dry cows {{were randomly assigned to}} three experimental rations in a study with a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. During the first 20 days of each experimental period, cows were offered concentrate (5. 4 kg dry matter; DM) without HSCAS and rice straw ad libitum. On day 21, cows were fasted for 12 h prior to commencement of a 7 -d measurement period during which time cows were offered concentrate (10. 5 kg DM) containing either 0, 5 or 10 g/kg of HSCAS and 1. 5 kg DM rice straw. Rumen fluid was collected on days 1, 3 and 7 during the measurement period for analysis of pH, LPS and volatile fatty acids (VFA). Supplemental HSCAS did not affect the pH or the concentrations of total and individual VFA in the ruminal fluid. Mean postprandial rumen pH was reduced to values below 5. 6 at all times. Rumen LPS concentrations significantly increased from day 1 to 7 during each measurement period with values ranging from 4489 to 104, 000 EU/mL but they were not significantly affected by supplemental HSCAS...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{has focused on}} the effects of fluid flow on solids deposition from solutions that simulate the feed to the 2 H evaporator at the Savannah River Site. Literature studies indicate that the fluid flow (or shear) affects particle-particle and particle-surface interactions and thus the phenomena of particle aggregation in solution and particle deposition (i. e., scale formation) onto solid surfaces. Experimental tests were conducted with two configurations: (1) using a rheometer to provide controlled shear conditions and (2) using controlled flow of reactive solution through samples of stainless steel tubing. All tests were conducted at 80 C and at high silicon and aluminum concentrations, 0. 133 M each, in solutions containing 4 M sodium hydroxide and 1 A 4 each of sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite. Two findings from these experiments are important for consideration in developing approaches for reducing or eliminating evaporator scaling problems: (1) The rheometer tests suggested that for the conditions studied, maximum solids deposition occurs at a moderate shear rate, approximately 12 s{sup - 1 }. That value is expected to be on the order of shear rates that will occur {{in various parts of the}} evaporator system; for instance, a 6 gal/min single-phase liquid flow through the 2 -in. lift or gravity drain lines would result in a shear rate of approximately 16 s{sup - 1 }. These results imply that engineering approaches aimed at reducing deposits through increased mixing would need to generate shear near all surfaces significantly greater than 12 s{sup - 1 }. However, further testing is needed to set a target value for shear that is applicable to evaporator operation. This is because the measured trend is not statistically significant at the 95 % confidence interval due to variability in the results. In addition, testing at higher temperatures and lower concentrations of aluminum and silicon would more accurately represent conditions in the evaporator. Without further testing, it does not appear advisable to depend on increased agitation as the primary means for reduction of scale in the 2 H, evaporator. (2) The tubes used in the flow tests became clogged with solids when the solutions were below 80 C at the start of the test; a very striking difference from experiments with fully preheated solutions, which yielded only thin films of solids on the tubes. These results suggest that significant differences are found in the ''stickiness'' of solids formed at different temperatures. This may provide opportunities for engineering approaches to reduce solids deposition, such as feed dispersion or feed preheating. It is recommended that further studies be undertaken to determine what forms of <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminosilicates</b> adhere to stainless steel surfaces, under what conditions these materials are created, and what changes in evaporator operation could be made to minimize their formation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In vitro and in vivo {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the efficacy of a hydrated <b>sodium</b> calcium <b>aluminosilicate</b> (Improved Milbond-TX®, IMTX) to alleviate the toxic effects of aflatoxin (AF) B 1 in chicks. In vitro results indicated that IMTX was able to bind 100 % of AFB 1 at pH 3 to 9. In the in vivo study, five pen replicates of six chicks were assigned to each of four dietary treatments, which included: 1) basal diet containing neither IMTX nor AFB 1 (control); 2) basal diet supplemented with 1 % IMTX; 3) basal diet supplemented with 4 mg AFB 1 /kg diet; and 4) basal diet supplemented with 1 % IMTX and 4 mg AFB 1 /kg diet. The addition of IMTX to chick diets {{at a level of}} 1 % did not negatively affect chick performance, organ weights, or serum chemistry, or cause pathological changes. Improved Milbond-TX ® completely prevented the reduced performance, changes in organ weights, serum chemistry changes, and gross pathology observed in chicks fed AFB 1. The IMTX dramatically reduced the incidence and severity of the hepatic histopathology changes associated with aflatoxicosis and completely prevented the renal lesions of aflatoxicosis. These results indicated that IMTX was effective in preventing the toxic effects of AF that may be present in poultry rations at levels up to 4 mg/kg feed...|$|R
