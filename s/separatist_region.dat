40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedGeorgia has a resume of achievements in {{its relations with}} NATO since 1992. However, at the 2008 Bucharest Summit, the NATO Allies chose not to offer Georgia a Membership Action Plan. At the 2009 Strasbourg-Kehl Summit, the NATO Allies again chose not to offer Georgia such a plan. This thesis examines Georgia's prospects for NATO membership. It investigates the hypothesis that Georgia's membership aspirations are affected by two sets of variables [...] internal and external. The two key internal variables that affect Georgia's prospects for membership are Tbilisi's progress on reforms and the unresolved conflicts with the <b>separatist</b> <b>regions</b> of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The NATO Allies will continue to evaluate Georgia on its efforts to democratize, develop a market economy, and create a professional military that contributes to Euro-Atlantic security. Georgia notes that the <b>separatist</b> <b>regions</b> are within its internationally recognized borders, but neither region desires to be reconciled with the government in Tbilisi. The primary external variable remains Russia's policy toward Georgia. Russia is opposed to Georgia joining NATO and has since the August 2008 Georgia-Russia war recognized the <b>separatist</b> <b>regions</b> of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states.

50|$|The {{most serious}} foreign policy event during Medvedev's {{presidency}} {{has been the}} 2008 South Ossetia war. Tensions between Georgia and Russian-supported <b>separatist</b> <b>regions</b> of Abkhazia and South Ossetia had been rising throughout the year 2008, with both sides accusing each other of preparing for a war. In the night of 7-8 August, Georgia launched a massive military attack against South Ossetia. 7 Russian peacekeepers stationed in the region {{were killed in the}} attack. On 8 August, Russia reacted by sending its military forces into South Ossetia and launching air strikes against Georgian military infrastructure. Russia and Abkhazia opened a second front by attacking the Kodori Gorge, held by Georgia. In five-days of fighting, the Georgian assault was repelled and its forces were expelled from both of the <b>separatist</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|R
25|$|Relations with Russia {{remained}} problematic due to Russia's continuing political, {{economic and}} military support to separatist governments in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russian troops still remained garrisoned at two military bases and as peacekeepers in these regions. Saakashvili's public pledge to resolve the matter provoked criticism from the <b>separatist</b> <b>regions</b> and Russia. In August 2004, several clashes occurred in South Ossetia.|$|R

In 1921 Georgia was invaded and occupied by Bolshevik Russia to form the Soviet Union in 1922. When the country regained independence in 1991, the bilateral Russo-Georgian ties were once again strained due to Moscow's support of the <b>separatist</b> <b>regions</b> within Georgia, Georgia's independent energy policies and most recently, its intentions to join NATO.|$|R
