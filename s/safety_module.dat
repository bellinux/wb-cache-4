40|$|This {{report is}} {{an account of}} the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research {{contribution}} to a definition study into the possibilities of incorporating a traffic <b>safety</b> <b>module</b> into a module (called EVV) for evaluating transport and traffic prognoses on various aspects. Main aggregated figures should be available in order to answer policy questions. More disaggregated figures are needed in order to compute these figures. The report describes how, from the need for main aggregate figures, it can be figured out which risk figures are necessary. The risk figures can be divided into figures: (1) for road sections; (2) for intersections; and (3) for inner regions (traffic space not part of the evaluated network). The report evaluated network). The report also deals with differences between various road types, and between figures for motorized traffic and for bicycle traffic. Attention is given to the problems related to the traffic risk development over time, for both the general safety level and for the different parts (for instance road type).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} controlled {{evidence from}} the child health literature on patient conditions and clinical procedures that resulted in unacceptable adverse outcomes. METHODS: Systematic searches of MEDLINE (1966 to 2001), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001) were done. Studies that met the eligibility criteria, were verified for quality of methodology and lack of conflicting studies. A knowledge base of Child Health <b>Safety</b> <b>Modules</b> was then developed. The knowledge base {{could be used to}} transfer controlled evidence on potentially harmful interventions into clinical decision support systems conforming with Arden Syntax, a widely applied computer standard. RESULTS: The searches identified knowledge to create 41 Child Health <b>Safety</b> <b>Modules</b> for medications and procedures in child health care, from 29 randomized controlled trials and 12 non-randomized controlled studies. The modules are focused on 28 medication interventions and 13 other clinical procedures. Eighty five percent of the studies were published between 1997 - 2001.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in human-robot collaboration {{is to ensure}} safety for humans being located in the workspace of the robot. Several new robots, referred to as collaborative robots, are pushing into the market. Most of these so-called co-bots have similar properties. They are small, lightweight and designed with big roundings to ensure safety {{in the case of}} a collision with a human. Equipped with torque sensors, external torque observers, tactile skins, etc., they are able to stop the robot when an emergency occurs. While developing more and more co-bots, the main focus lies on the robot itself. But to make a robot deployable, a special tool for a defined task is needed. These tools are often sharp-edged and dangerous in case of a collision with a human. In this paper we present a new <b>safety</b> <b>module</b> for robots to ensure safety for different tools in collaborative tasks. This module, filled with air pressure during the robot motion, covers mounted tools and carried workpieces. In case of a non or very slow moving robot, the <b>safety</b> <b>module</b> is able to pull back and the tool is uncovered. In our experiments we found out that we can increase the velocity up to 1 m/s while satisfying the requirements of the ISO/TS 15066 and retain the full functionality of the tool...|$|E

40|$|In recent {{research}} the CONDUITS performance evaluation framework for traffic management and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) was developed, {{consisting of a}} set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the strategic themes of traffic efficiency, safety, pollution reduction and social inclusion. Follow-up work has concentrated on integrating the developed CONDUITS KPIs with microscopic traffic simulation. The outcome has been a predictive evaluation tool for traffic management and ITS, called CONDUITS_DST, in which two of the four KPI categories have been integrated to date: pollution and traffic efficiency. The objective of the present study is to further extend the predictive evaluation framework to include the theme of traffic safety. Contributing {{to the development of the}} CONDUITS_DST traffic <b>safety</b> <b>module,</b> the paper identifies and proposes relevant models and metrics linking traffic characteristics with road safety impacts. In doing so, it enables the extraction of the necessary input data for each of the three CONDUITS KPIs for traffic safety (accidents, direct impacts, and indirect impacts) directly from microscopic traffic simulation models. The proposed models and metrics are tested in conjunction with the relevant CONDUITS KPIs for safety using data from simulation models before and after the implementation of a bus priority signalling system in Brussels. Testing takes place both at the network level, but also at the level of individual links, and the results show that the framework is able to capture the expected safety impacts adequately well, paving the way towards its implementation is the traffic <b>safety</b> <b>module</b> of CONDUITS_DST...|$|E
40|$|Road {{traffic safety}} has {{increasingly}} become {{in need of}} educated road safety professionals, {{as the number of}} accidents in the World Health Organization member countries exceeds one million. The profession itself is transitioning from experience based decision making to empirical, theoretical and mathematical based solutions. However, road traffic safety is a multidiscipline, crossing over many fields and requiring a high degree of communication between different institutions. There are very few institutions that provide programs in the field; furthermore, they employ traditional lecture-based teaching methods. The traditional teaching environment does not fulfill the educational needs of future traffic safety professionals due to its rigidity and lack of problem solving exercises. An alternative method, namely problem based learning, is recommended as an alternative teaching method in this paper. The thesis is constructed {{in such a way as}} to develop a complete road traffic safety educational module at graduate and post graduate level. The theoretical basis on which a road traffic <b>safety</b> <b>module</b> is later built is presented in the first part of the thesis. Major concepts in road traffic safety, as well as problem based learning methods are investigated. In addition, a literature review SWOT analysis based on literature is conducted. The module development consists of establishing the road traffic safety learning goals for each segment in the module, appropriate assessment criteria and group work format. The module contains gradual difficulty level problems, starting from the easiest topic and easiest format (closed ended problem) and ending with the hardest topic and hardest format (open ended problem).

30|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} on 151 firemen, truck drivers, regular drivers and student drivers, the management strategies {{in the event of}} a tunnel fire were investigated (Gandit et al. 2009).

Of those who wanted to evacuate 50 % looked for an emergency exit, 33 % said they would move to the tunnel exit, and 17 % towards the tunnel entrance. Gandit et al. (2009) concluded that although users are well aware of the safety devices, they do not use them automatically.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aims of {{this study}} are to {{determine}} construct validity for the HystSim virtual-reality (VR) training simulator for hysteroscopy via a new multimetric scoring system (MMSS) and to explore learning curves for both novices and experienced surgeons. METHODS: Fifteen relevant metrics had been identified for diagnostic hysteroscopy by means of hierarchical task decomposition. They were grouped into four modules (visualization, ergonomics, safety, and fluid handling) and individually weighted, building the MMSS for this study. In a first step, 24 novice medical students and 12 experienced gynecologists went through a self-paced teaching tutorial, in which all participants received clearly stated goals and instructions on how to carry out hysteroscopic procedures properly for this study. All subjects performed five repeated trials on two different exercises on HystSim (exploration and diagnosis exercises). After each trial the results were presented to the participants {{in the form of an}} automated objective feedback report (AOFR). Construct validity for the MMSS and learning curves were investigated by comparing the performance between novices and experienced surgeons and in between the repeated trials. To study the effect of repeated practice, 23 of the novices returned 2 weeks later for a second training session. RESULTS: Comparing novices with the experienced group, the ergonomics and fluid handling modules resulted in construct validity, while the visualization module did not, and for the <b>safety</b> <b>module</b> the experienced group even scored significantly lower than novices in both exercises. The overall score showed only construct validity when the <b>safety</b> <b>module</b> was excluded. Concerning learning curves, all subjects improved significantly during the training on HystSim, with clear indication that the second training session was beneficial for novice surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Construct validity for HystSim has been established for different modules of VR metrics on a new MMSS developed for diagnostic hysteroscopy. Careful refinement and further testing of metrics and scores is required before using them as assessment tools for operative skills...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Communication is {{critical}} between nodes in wireless sensor networks. Upgrades to their communication software {{need to be}} done reliably because residual software errors in the new module can cause complete system failure. We present a software architecture, called cSimplex, which can reliably upgrade multicast-based group communication software in sensor networks. Errors in the new module are detected using statistical checks and a stability definition that we propose. Error recovery is done by switching to a welltested, reliable <b>safety</b> <b>module</b> without any interruption in the functioning of the system. cSimplex has been implemented and demonstrated in a network of acoustic sensors with mobile robots functioning as base stations. Experimental results show that faults in the upgraded software can be detected with an accuracy of 99. 71 % on average. The architecture, which can be easily extended to other reliable upgrade problems, will facilitate a paradigm shift in system evolution from static design and extensive testing to reliable upgrades of critical communication components in networked systems, thus also enabling substantial savings in testing time and resources.
