500|$|Two tribe members {{dressed as}} {{tourists}} {{come down the}} aisle to ask the tribe why they have such long hair. [...] In answer, Claude and Berger lead the tribe in explaining the significance of their [...] "Hair". [...] The tourist lady states that kids should [...] "be free, no guilt" [...] and should [...] "do whatever you want, just {{so long as you}} don't hurt anyone." [...] She observes that long hair is natural, like the [...] "elegant plumage" [...] of male birds ("My Conviction"). [...] <b>She</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> coat to reveal that she's a man in drag. [...] As the couple leaves, the tribe calls her Margaret Mead.|$|E
500|$|Doggett tells Reyes that, {{in order}} to resolve the situation, she must turn off his {{respirator}} and allow him to die, but she refuses. Suspecting that Lukesh plans to kill Reyes next, Skinner convinces Reyes {{to go back to}} her apartment while he, Scully, and Follmer monitor her. She returns and is attacked by Lukesh. The team rush to her aid and Follmer shoots Lukesh in the head, killing him. Reyes then returns to the hospital, closing her eyes as she shuts off Doggett's respirator. [...] As <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> eyes, the scene changes back to her apartment at the moment Doggett had disappeared earlier. Reyes, stunned and fighting back tears, embraces Doggett as he, evidently unaware of any of the previous events, asks her what is wrong.|$|E

5000|$|Adi Parashakti means [...] "The Eternally Limitless Power". That is, {{she is the}} Power {{beyond this}} universe. She is the active energy that both creates and dissolves the entire universe.When there was nothing, {{suddenly}} a light emerged then that light {{took the form of}} adishakti. She had three eyes, carrying Trishul, shield, mace, bow, arrow, chakra, long sword and one hand as abhaya mudra. She looked here and there but saw nothing. After seeing nothing she took the form of Kushmanda. She was seated on a lioness. When <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> left eye Mahakali was born. When <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> third eye Mahasaraswati was born and when <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> right eye Mahalakshmi was born.

500|$|The video, which Beyoncé has {{considered}} intimate and romantic, begins as she stands against a wall, illuminated by light that {{passes through a}} window. In one scene, Beyoncé's character, dressed in a skin-tight leotard, performs a dance sequence while her love interest {{looks down at her}} from a balcony. According to Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly, the dance routines pay homage to the 1983 romantic drama film Flashdance. Beyoncé and Ealy later stare adoringly at each other as they snuggle on a sofa. During the climax of the video, Beyoncé is shown underwater, dressed in white, moving slowly upwards. As the chorus begins, <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> eyes; after Ealy kisses the back of her neck, the pair come face to face in the final scene, in which Beyoncé lies in bed, with Ealy above her. Jennifer Cady of E! Online wrote that the bright shiny lights in the video [...] "make [...] look like an angel". Alison Maloney of The Sun praised Beyoncé's [...] "amazing figure". The video was ranked at number 74 on BET's Notarized: Top100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E
500|$|While Smith was {{competing}} in Britain's Got Talent, Cowell arranged {{for her to}} receive free singing lessons from leading vocal coach Yvie Burnett, who had previously coached 2007 Britains Got Talent winner Paul Potts and 2006 The X Factor winner Leona Lewis. The story was broken by The Sunday Mirror; writing for the paper, Lara Gould characterised the lessons as [...] "secret", while writers for The Daily Mail claimed that the lessons were [...] "likely to upset fellow contestants", and were evidence that Smith was [...] "already being groomed for stardom". During her participation in the competition, Smith was offered record deals, but {{she and her family}} turned them down. Her father, Tony Smith, said [...] "We have had offers from people interested in Faryl. But when Simon Cowell, the big man, says your daughter is special, you listen." [...] Cowell described Smith's potential career during the show, saying [...] "I know she says Katherine [...] is her idol but she is far better than her. She {{is by far the most}} talented youngster I've ever heard. When <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> mouth her voice is just incredible." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{the singer}} {{was interviewed by}} Nobel Literature Prize-winning Colombian novelist and {{journalist}} Gabriel García Márquez, who was [...] "astonished by her fantastical work-rate" [...] and said that [...] "Shakira's music has a personal stamp that doesn't look like anyone else's {{and no one can}} sing or dance like her, at whatever age, with such an innocent sensuality, one that seems to be of her own invention." [...] In the United States and the United Kingdom, Shakira drew comparisons to American pop singer Britney Spears as they looked similar in appearance and sported [...] "bleached blonde curls and butter-wouldn't-melt smiles for the kids down the front." [...] However, critics argued that the Shakira's vocal style was very different from Spears', with Ted Kessler from The Observer calling the former an [...] "operatic diva" [...] and writing that [...] "as soon as <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> mouth, she slips into gear and motors powerfully past Britney's breathy bump'n'grind." [...] In 2009, Julia Llewellyn Smith from The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "Shakira makes comparable Spanish-English 'crossover' acts such as Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias seem like minnows." [...] In an interview with Latina magazine in 2011, Gloria Estefan was asked whether she felt another crossover artist like Shakira could emerge in her lifetime, to which she responded, [...] "I'm always hopeful that somebody, any Latino, is going to succeed in what they do. And of course in music, undoubtedly." [...] Shakira's crossover success also inspired other Latin artists to foray into the English language market and many compared Mexican singer Paulina Rubio's attempt to crossover with her English-language debut album Border Girl to that by Shakira.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the show}} itself was greatly lauded by some critics: Vernon Rice of the New York Post proclaimed, [...] "Irving Berlin has outdone himself this time. No use {{trying to pick}} a hit tune, for all the tunes are hits...Ethel Merman is at her lusty, free and easy best...She is now able to develop a {{consistent}} characterization and stay with it to the show's end. And when <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> mouth to sing, she sings!" [...] William Hawkins of the New York World-Telegram said that Merman was [...] "bright as a whip, sure as her shooting, and generously the foremost lady clown of her time" [...] and asserted that the show itself was {{comparable to those of}} Rodgers and Hammerstein, proclaiming, [...] "For verve and buoyancy, unslackening, there has seldom if ever been a show like it...the girls in Annie have the beauty and character of looks one associates with a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. And the production has in every way the distinction that has become their hallmark".|$|E

60|$|The {{influence}} {{which the}} school has thus exerted has always been cordially welcomed by my pupils, and approved, so far as I have known, by their parents, though four or five denominations, and fifteen or twenty different congregations have been, from time to time, represented in the school.
