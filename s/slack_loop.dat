40|$|The {{mechanical}} connections of the metathoracic femoral chordotonal organ (mtFCO) {{with its}} insertion at the femoro-tibial joint are described. The apodeme complex {{is shown to}} consist of a distal cuticular rod that is replaced proximally by dorsal and ventral ligaments. The dorsal ligament is a direct continuation of the distal rod but proximally it is replaced by ligamentous cells. The ventral ligament has no cuticular core and consists of ligamentous cells throughout its length. The ligaments are composed of bundles of connective tissue cells that are each enclosed in an extracellular matrix containing acid-fuchsin-staining fibrils. Inter-nally the cells are packed with microtubules. During extension and flexion of the joint, the two ligaments move differentially. During passive extension of the tibia, the ventral ligament remains taut but the dorsal one buckles to form a <b>slack</b> <b>loop.</b> Direct observation of living preparations shows that the loop is first detectable during extension of the tibia at joint angles greater than about 51 °. During flexion, the loop gradually tightens and disappears. It has completely disappeared at joint angles of less than about 36 °. Changes in loop shape were demonstrable using preparations in which the tibia was moved sinusoidally ± 10 ° about a mean femoro-tibial angle of 90 ° and photographs were taken using phase-locked illumination. Other details of the apodeme complex are described and {{the significance of the}} findings is discussed in relation to mtFCO function...|$|E

60|$|He {{held the}} end of the rope, but had been carried several yards down-stream, and the lost ground must be regained. The rope was rather a {{hindrance}} than a help, since the men on the bank could only haul him back to the skip and drag him under water, while he must pull the <b>slack</b> through the <b>loop</b> as he struggled to land. If {{he got out of the}} eddies he would be swept past the island, but he did not mean to let the rope go yet.|$|R

Now I will put this rope round you and round the tree, leaving a certain amount of <b>slack</b> in the <b>loop.</b> Now you get a grip of the tree with your knees. Then with your hands you shift the loop up as high as you can, and lean against it. Get a sort of purchase, and so shift your knees a bit higher. No doubt you will feel it awkward at first, but after a little {{practice}} you will find no difficulty whatever in going up at a fair rate of speed.” ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A new locking {{sliding knot}} (HK-Knot) was {{developed}} in the author’s institute. A biomechanical study was performed to compare the properties of HK-Knot with Revo knot, SMC knot and Duncan Loop. Methodology: A total of 80 knots (20 in each group) were tested. All the knots were tied by a single surgeon using No. 2 FiberWire®. The knot was created around two metal bars separated by 10 mm {{with the help of a}} single-hole knot pusher. The biomechanical testing protocol of the original paper describing SMC knot was adopted (Kim, 2003). The initial <b>slack</b> in suture <b>loop,</b> average displacement at cyclic loading, load to clinical failure, ultimate load to failure and mode of failure were documented. Results were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical significance was assumed if p< 0. 05. Result: There was no difference between HK-Knot and SMC knot in both load to clinical failure (98 N versus 99 N) and ultimate load to failure (139 N versus 149 N). The result of the current study compared favourably with the data of SMC knot published by Kim (92 N and 107 N respectively). HK-Knot had the best performance in loop security (0. 13 mm, p < 0. 001, Kruskal-Wallis test). The average initial slack in Revo knot, SMC knot and Duncan Loop were 0. 43 mm, 0. 3 mm and 0. 17 mm respectively. Discussion and Conclusion: Among all the four knot configurations studied, HK-Knot had the optimal balance between knot strength and loop security...|$|R
