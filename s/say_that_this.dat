5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is demerit (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> refers only to some types of merit.|$|E

25|$|The core {{elements}} of the bodily-kinesthetic intelligence are control of one's bodily motions {{and the capacity to}} handle objects skillfully. Gardner elaborates to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> also includes a sense of timing, a clear sense of the goal of a physical action, along with the ability to train responses.|$|E
25|$|Today the Komondor is {{a fairly}} common breed in Hungary, its country of origin. Many Komondors were killed during World War II and local stories <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is because when the Germans (and then the Russians) invaded, they had to kill the dog before they could capture a farm or house that it guarded.|$|E

25|$|It was Laplace {{who found}} the first answers {{explaining}} the remarkable dance of the Galilean moons (see below). It is fair to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> general field of study has remained very active since then, with plenty more yet to be understood (e.g., how interactions of moonlets with particles of the rings of giant planets result in maintaining the rings).|$|E
25|$|Kushner {{states that}} the letter Shin (ש) is of special interest.

According to these scholars, the coming revelation of the name and pronunciation of this letter will be what repairs the universe.|$|E

25|$|According to Walter Cronkite, Khrushchev {{would go}} on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{incident}} was the beginning of his decline in power as party chairman, perhaps because he seemed unable to negotiate the international arena and the communist hardliners at home.

25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to exactly {{why such a}} murder occurred or who was behind it. Marlovians <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> confusion arises from scholars asking the wrong question. Instead of {{trying to find out}} why he was killed, they should be asking why those particular people would have met at that particular place on that particular day. The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting to have taken place would have been to fake his death.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 2009, Bloomberg {{reported}} {{that more than}} 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders had nonperforming loans above 5% of their total holdings. This is important because former regulators <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the level that can wipe out a bank's equity and threaten its survival. While this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt, {{it is an important}} indicator for future FDIC activity.|$|E

In short, for the sum of Cobb-Douglas production functions to equal a Cobb-Douglas, the production functions for all of the different sectors have to have the same values of A and a.|$|E
