50|$|Inside most {{tubes are}} <b>springs,</b> <b>fork</b> oil, and air, {{creating}} a shock absorber. Some forks allow pressurized air {{to be added}} through a valve {{in the top of}} the fork to stiffen the suspension. Quality forks have a flexible air tube between both fork tubes in order to balance the air pressure in both forks. Modern fork tubes have a method which employs a screw to compress <b>fork</b> <b>spring</b> to increase or decrease spring pre-load.|$|R

50|$|James Harvey Crawford {{was born}} March 30, 1845 {{on his father}} John Edward Crawford's farm along <b>Spring</b> <b>Fork</b> Creek, six {{miles south of the}} present town of Sedalia, Missouri. His future wife, Margaret Emerine Bourn, lived on the {{adjacent}} farm. James enlisted in the Union Army, Company E, 7th Missouri State Militia Cavalry, on February 10, 1862, while only 16. He was promoted to Second Sergeant on April 12 and to First Lieutenant on November 8. During the Civil War, he served briefly in both Arkansas and Kansas, but spent most of the time in central and southern Missouri. On May 25, 1865, one month after he was mustered out of service, James and Margaret married. They bought land near their parents' farms, and for seven years led the quiet life of farmers. Three of their four children were born on the farm: Lulie on March 25, 1867, Logan on September 9, 1869, and John on February 8, 1873 (their fourth child Mary was born on March 27, 1882 in Boulder, Colorado).|$|E

The bachelor thesis presents individual suspension functions, it describes and explains function of air spring and coil <b>spring</b> <b>forks,</b> analyzes the damping system and shows the options for settings of the forks. It compares the design of the forks used in production motocross motorcycles from 2016 and 2017 and refers to their potential advantages or disadvantages. The forks d iffer from each other mainly by the type of spring, and whether each leg contains spring and damper or they have a separate function. Each solution has its advantages and disadvantages, it depends mainly on the overall setting of the fork...|$|R
50|$|Spring Creek {{is formed}} {{just south of}} the city of Spencer in {{northern}} Roane County by the confluence of the Left <b>Fork</b> <b>Spring</b> Creek, 8 mi long, which rises near the community of Clover and flows northwestward, paralleled for most of its course by West Virginia Route 36; and the Right <b>Fork</b> <b>Spring</b> Creek, 7.8 mi long, which rises near the community of Speed and flows northward, paralleled for most of its course by U.S. Route 119.

50|$|The BSA C15S was the motorcross {{competition}} {{version of}} the 250 cc Star produced between 1959 and 1965. As with the trials version, the C15S saved {{the weight of a}} battery through an 'energy transfer' electrical system which was notoriously unreliable. The problem was that the timing and points gap required far too much careful setting for a rugged competition motorcycle. The scrambler C15 was unsilenced and had special tyres and strengthened <b>fork</b> <b>springs</b> with rubber <b>fork</b> gaiters to protect the seals.|$|R
25|$|The company {{developed}} and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle {{with the engine}} in the centre and 'springer' front forks which was ahead of its time. This first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, bottom-bracket engine and mechanically operated valves. With a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904. The following year, however, Rover stopped motorcycle production to concentrate on their 'safety bicycle' but in 1910 designer John Greenwood was commissioned {{to develop a new}} 3.5hp 500cc engine with spring-loaded tappets, a Bosch magneto and an innovative inverted tooth drive chain. It had a Brown and Barlow carburettor and Druid <b>spring</b> <b>forks.</b> This new model was launched at the 1910 Olympia show and over 500 were sold.|$|R
5000|$|Montgomery Motorcycles was a {{pioneering}} British motorcycle manufacturer.

[...] Following the first war manufacturing moved to Coventry. Like Brough, Montgomery made use of the best proprietary components from other specialist companies and concentrated on the production of frames and forks in-house - and Montgomery supplied a number of frames and its own <b>sprung</b> <b>fork</b> to George Brough. [...] In an advert from the time Montgomery claimed [...] "These Montgomery machines are for the men who prefer a distinctive mount in appearance and performance. That extra degree of soundness - those little touches which distinguish the 'super' machine from the mere motorcycle, come naturally to the Montgomery and at a price that is amazingly low." ...|$|R
