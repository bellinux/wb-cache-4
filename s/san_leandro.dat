5|$|The {{region has}} {{considerable}} vertical relief in its landscapes {{that are not}} in the alluvial plains leading to the bay or in inland valleys. The topography, and geologic history, of the Bay Area can largely be attributed to the compressive forces between the Pacific Plate and the North American plate. The three major ridge structures in the Bay Area, part of the Pacific Coast Range, are all roughly parallel to the major faults. The Santa Cruz Mountains along the San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Hills in Marin County follow the San Andreas fault, The Berkeley Hills, <b>San</b> <b>Leandro</b> Hills and their southern ridgeline extension through Mission Peak roughly follow the Hayward fault, and the Diablo Range, which includes Mount Diablo and Mount Hamilton and runs along the Calaveras fault.|$|E

25|$|Donaire's {{father was}} an amateur boxer who competed in the U.S. in the early 1990s. His {{paternal}} grandfather was born in Hawaii, United States and this gave Donaire US citizenship under the principle of Jus Sanguinis.

25|$|IRV is {{more likely}} to elect the Condorcet winner than {{plurality}} voting and traditional runoff elections. The California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and <b>San</b> <b>Leandro</b> in 2010 provide an example; there were a total of four elections in which the plurality-voting leader in first-choice rankings was defeated, and in each case the IRV winner was the Condorcet winner, including a San Francisco election in which the IRV winner was in third place in first choice rankings.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Donaire and {{his brother}} became {{professional}} boxers. They signed contracts with a promoter, Jackie Kallen. Donaire was paid a monthly salary of $1,500. In 2001, after a controversial decision, Donaire lost his second fight against Rosendo Sanchez. This impassioned him to win his fights which he did until April 2013. After four professional bouts, Donaire {{and his brother}} left their contracts with Kallen and returned to Manila and then to <b>San</b> <b>Leandro,</b> where there were fewer distractions.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century many parishes were formed in Berkeley, Fremont, Livermore, Hayward, Oakland and <b>San</b> <b>Leandro</b> to reflect the growing populations in the East Bay. After World War II rapid growth in the San Francisco region led Pope John XXIII to {{establish}} the Diocese of Oakland in 1962 from the eastern portion of the San Francisco Archdiocese. Saint Frances de Sales was established as the diocesan mother church and Floyd Begin of Cleveland, Ohio was installed as Oakland's first bishop.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, filmmaker Ryan Coogler premiered Fruitvale (later retitled Fruitvale Station). The drama {{portrays the}} last 24 hours of Grant's life. Coogler {{used some of}} the {{eyewitness}} footage made during the BART incident. Principal photography included locations in Oakland, San Francisco, <b>San</b> <b>Leandro,</b> and San Quentin State Prison. It starred Michael B.

25|$|An {{investigation}} was launched {{to determine whether}} any other officers should be disciplined. On January 12, investigation results were forwarded to the district attorney. The investigation, which interviewed seven police officers and 33 other witnesses, came to no conclusion and made no recommendations. The details were forwarded to Meyers Nave, an outside law firm, for an independent investigation. It was led by Jayne Williams, the former city attorney for <b>San</b> <b>Leandro,</b> and was estimated to cost $250,000. In August, the law firm provided two reports to BART but only released one publicly. The report said officers failed to follow recommended procedures, failed {{to work as a}} team, and had lapses in both tactical communication and leadership.|$|E
25|$|Oakland {{has more}} than 50 {{distinct}} neighborhoods. The city's greater divisions include downtown Oakland and its greater Central Business District, Lake Merritt, East Oakland, North Oakland, West Oakland, and the Oakland Hills. East Oakland, which includes the East Oakland Hills, encompasses {{more than half of}} Oakland's land area, stretching from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of Lake Merritt southeast to the <b>San</b> <b>Leandro</b> border. North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods between downtown and Berkeley and Emeryville. West Oakland is the area between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the Oakland Point, and encompassing the Port of Oakland. In 2011, Oakland was ranked the 10th most walkable city in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the freeway}} {{was built in}} Milpitas, Fremont, Hayward and Oakland, SR 17 {{followed}} what is now Old Oakland Road (San Jose), Main Street (Milpitas) and Warm Springs Boulevard (southern Fremont); from the Irvington section of Fremont, the route proceeded along what is now Fremont Boulevard, which becomes Alvarado Boulevard in Union City. From there, the route proceeded along Hesperian Boulevard in Hayward and Washington Avenue in <b>San</b> <b>Leandro,</b> joining with East 14th Street as it proceeded into Oakland. From Oakland, SR 17 would follow US 40 along San Pablo Avenue up to its split in Albany. SR 17 then followed what is now Interstate 580 over the San Rafael Bridge (formerly a ferry crossing), terminating at US 101 in San Rafael.|$|E
25|$|Within the neighborhood, AC Transit's 26 line carries {{passengers}} {{to and from}} the neighborhood along 14th Street, routing directly to nearby BART stations. AC Transit's Uptown Regional Transit Center bus mall on nearby Thomas L. Berkeley Way (20th Street) is now in full farebox service, and features multiple bus shelters with seating, NextBus arrival prediction signs, local and Rapid Bus service to Oakland's streetcar suburbs. These stations host local service, Rapid service, Transbay Express, and All Nighter service. A Translink Add Value Machine is located at AC Transit Headquarters on Franklin Street. The number 1 line running along the neighborhood on 12th Street, between <b>San</b> <b>Leandro</b> and Berkeley, is years into the planning process for the implementation of a full scale bus rapid transit line. The most substantial planning alternative proposed for this system would feature double-articulated buses with five to six doors at boarding platform level, a separated bus-only lane, center median platforms with proof-of-payment ticket machines to speed boarding, and signalization priority to allow bus drivers to change traffic lights in their favor.|$|E
25|$|Mervin G. Morris {{founded the}} first Mervyn's store in San Lorenzo, California on July 29, 1949. The store was {{supposed}} to be named Mervin's, but the architect suggested that a spelling with a y instead of an i would be more visually appealing. Mervyn's was located in the midst of San Lorenzo Village, a planned residential community nestled between the cities of Hayward and <b>San</b> <b>Leandro,</b> composed of two- and three-bedroom tract homes built between 1944 and the 1950s. Mervyn's carved a niche for itself by having a relatively no-frills shopping environment that reduced overhead, enabling the store to price merchandise lower than competing department stores in the area. Mervyn's also offered significantly-discounted factory seconds of basics such as jeans, t-shirts, underwear and similar garments, as well as household linens, with flaws minor and undetectable by most. During the 1950s and 1960s, this made Mervyn's popular with the young families comprising the majority of San Lorenzo's population. This marketing strategy was later abandoned before Mervyn's expanded beyond its original single location, but Mervyn's remained popular as a lower-priced alternative to national department store chains.|$|E
25|$|Ralph Bullard’s {{first meeting}} with Dr. O'Brien led him to adopt the school’s {{educational}} philosophy — The Principle Approach to America’s Christian History, Government, and Education. In her office he saw two reference volumes: Christian History of the Constitution of the United States of America and Teaching and Learning America’s Christian History. Remembering these titles, he ordered a set for the school. Under the influence of these key texts, Christian Heritage Academy came to enjoy many years of association with R.J. Rushdoony associates and Miss Verna M. Hall and Miss Rosalie I. Slater, {{the authors of the}} books and officers of The Foundation for American Christian Education in San Francisco, California, and later with many other friends and associates in the work: Mr. John Talcott, member of the Evangelical Council for National Policy, a director of the Ocean Spray Corporation and founder of Plymouth Rock Foundation, whose Plymouth Rock Seminars were foundational to the school’s philosophical development; Miss Katherine Dang, then the principal of the Chinese Christian Schools of <b>San</b> <b>Leandro,</b> California, and teacher at the pilot school in Hayward, CA under the direction of CHA development contributor James B. Rose; and Mrs. Ruth Smith of Pilgrim Institute. All of these friends provided counsel and advice to the school as CHA developed its program and became one of the leaders in the American Christian History movement (see Dominionism).|$|E
25|$|Russ Meyer {{was born}} in <b>San</b> <b>Leandro,</b> California, the son of Lydia Lucinda (Hauck) and William Arthur Meyer, an Oakland police officer. His parents were both of German descent. Meyer's parents {{divorced}} soon after he was born, and Meyer was to have virtually no contact with his father during his life. When he was 14 years old, his mother pawned her wedding ring in order to buy him an 8mm film camera. He {{made a number of}} amateur films at the age of 15, and served during World War II as a U.S. Army combat cameraman for the 166th Signal Photo Company. Even then he already demonstrated a corny directing style and included nudity, like in scenes of naked GIs bathing in the Rhine in March 1945. In the Army, Meyer forged his strongest friendships, and he would later ask many of his fellow combat cameramen to work on his films. Much of Meyer's work during World War II can be seen in newsreels and in the film Patton (1971). On his return to civilian life, he was unable to secure cinematography work in Hollywood {{due to a lack of}} industry connections. He made industrial films, freelanced as a still photographer for mainstream films (he did the still photography for Giant), and became a well known glamour photographer whose work included some of the initial shoots for Hugh Hefner's Playboy magazine. Meyer would go on to shoot three Playboy centerfolds during the magazine's early years, one of his wife Eve Meyer in 1955. He also shot a pictorial of then-wife Edy Williams in March 1973.|$|E

Best {{left the}} Holt Manufacturing Company {{where he had}} been general manager and re-established his father's company under the name C.L.Best Gas Traction Co. in Elmhurst, near <b>San</b> <b>Leandro,</b> California. Holt {{immediately}} sued, claiming breach of contract and infringement because as owner of the Best Manufacturing Company, he believed he also owned the [...] "Best" [...] name. Holt did not prevail and Best continued to produce tractors that directly competed with Holt's models.|$|E
500|$|Since 1870, {{rainbow trout}} have been artificially {{propagated}} in fish hatcheries to restock streams and to introduce them into non-native waters. The first rainbow trout hatchery was established on <b>San</b> <b>Leandro</b> Creek, {{a tributary of}} San Francisco Bay, in 1870, and trout production began in 1871. The hatchery was stocked with the locally native rainbow trout, and likely steelhead of the coastal rainbow trout subspecies [...] The fish raised in this hatchery were shipped to hatcheries out of state {{for the first time}} in 1875, to Caledonia, New York, and then in 1876 to Northville, Michigan. In 1877, another California rainbow trout hatchery, the first federal fish hatchery in the National Fish Hatchery System, was established on Campbell Creek, a McCloud River tributary. The McCloud River hatchery indiscriminately mixed coastal rainbow trout eggs with the eggs of local McCloud River redband trout [...] Eggs from the McCloud hatchery were also provided to the <b>San</b> <b>Leandro</b> hatchery, thus making the origin and genetic history of hatchery-bred rainbow trout somewhat diverse and complex. In the U.S., there are hundreds of hatcheries operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and various state agencies and tribal governments propagating rainbow trout for conservation and recreational sport fishing. [...] Six of ten Canadian provinces have rainbow trout farms, with Ontario leading production.|$|E
500|$|In 1905, {{a patent}} {{infringement}} lawsuit ensued between Best and Holt. After {{three years of}} legal battles, the two companies decided to settle out of court. The parties resolved two suits when Holt made a cash payment to C.L.Best and provided C.L.Best a license giving them access to all Holt patents applying to manufacturing the C.L.Best's [...] "Tracklayers." [...] In 1916, C.L.Best bought his father's old factory in <b>San</b> <b>Leandro,</b> which Holt had closed after acquiring the company. C.L.Best built a new factory on the same location. His company gained attention for its continued improvements to its products.|$|E
500|$|In California, the Best Manufacturing Company of <b>San</b> <b>Leandro</b> and the Holt Manufacturing Company were direct competitors. In 1905, they {{resolved}} {{a patent}} infringement lawsuit when Daniel Best retired and gave one-third of Best Manufacturing Company to his son, Clarence Leo ("C.L.") Best. He sold the remaining two-thirds to Benjamin Holt for US$325,000 (roughly equivalent to $ today). C.L.Best was made plant {{manager of the}} new concern, but Holt retained effective control. C.L. did not stay long, however, but left in 1910 to form the C.L.Best Gas Traction Company to replace his father's firm, resulting in further difficulties between the two men. Holt registered [...] "Caterpillar" [...] as a trademark in 1911.|$|E
500|$|Harry H. Fair of {{the bond}} {{brokerage}} house of Pierce, Fair & Company of San Francisco was involved in funding C.L.Best's debt, when Holt shareholders approached him about their company's financial plight. He concluded that both companies might not survive and recommended that the Holt and Best companies should consolidate operations. In April and May 1925, the financially stronger C.L.Best merged with the market leader Holt Caterpillar to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. [...] Baxter had been removed as CEO earlier in 1925, and Clarence Leo Best assumed the title of CEO, and remained in that role until October 1951. The new company was headquartered in <b>San</b> <b>Leandro</b> until 1930, when {{under the terms of}} the merger it was moved to Peoria.|$|E
500|$|Anderson met Cora Ann Cremeans in Bend, Oregon, in 1944; {{they married}} three days later, on 3 May, {{claiming}} that they had encountered each other before in the astral realm. Born in Nyota, Alabama, in January 1915, Cora {{had been exposed to}} folk magical practices from childhood; reputedly, her Irish grandfather was a [...] "root doctor" [...] who was known among locals as the [...] "druid". The Andersons claimed that one of their first acts after their marriage was the erection of an altar. The following year, a son was born, and they named him Victor Elon, with the latter being the Hebrew word for oak; Cora claimed that she had received the name in a dream. After the birth, a ritual was held to dedicate the infant to the Goddess. In 1948, the family moved to Niles, California, later that year purchasing a home in <b>San</b> <b>Leandro.</b> There, Anderson {{became a member of the}} Alameda Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, and he subsequently remained so for forty years.
