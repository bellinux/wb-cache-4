50|$|CERES {{operates}} in three scanning modes: across the satellite ground track (cross-track), along {{the direction of}} the satellite ground track (along-track), and in a Rotating Azimuth Plane (RAP). In RAP mode, the radiometers <b>scan</b> <b>in</b> <b>elevation</b> as they rotate in azimuth, thus acquiring radiance measurement {{from a wide range of}} viewing angles. Until February 2005, on Terra and Aqua satellites one of CERES instruments scanned in cross-track mode while the other was in RAP or along-track mode. The instrument operating in RAP scanning mode took two days of along-track data every month. However the multi-angular CERES data allowed to derive new models which account for anisotropy of the viewed scene, and allow TOA radiative flux retrieval with enhanced precision.|$|E

We determined that in a controlled environment, the two systems can attain an NH 3 agreement of 1 - 3 % at concentrations above 500 ppb. Due to the short path length (~ 10 m) in the lab, 500 ppb was the detection limit of the two systems. Path lengths in a field are much longer, allowing a lower detection limit. Average agreement in the field was 1 - 6 %. This difference in agreement from the laboratory is likely due to the non-homogeneous distribution of the pollutant...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of linear phase arrays {{based on the}} slitted asymmetric ridge waveguide: a structure that is, at the same time, easy to manufacture and very flexible in terms of electrical characteristics is presented. Scanning is obtained in leaky-wave fashion (frequency <b>scan)</b> <b>in</b> <b>elevation</b> (longitudinal plane), and by phase shifters in azimuth (cross-plane). The analysis {{is based on the}} development of an accurate transverse equivalent network and on the derivation of a dispersion relation which gives the complex longitudinal propagation constant in terms of the structural parameters. Both cases of air-filled and dielectric-loaded ridge waveguide are studied. The effects of mutual coupling between the various line sources of the array are taken into account using the unit-cell approach. A detailed parametric analysis is carried out showing how the real and imaginary parts of the complex propagation constant, which are related to the radiation characteristics, can be controlled with a good degree of independence from each other. Moreover, no blind spots are introduced in the scanning process. While the grating lobes an avoided, due to the choice of the cross-section. This approach has been applied to two other linear phased arrays of leaky-wave line sources, based on an asymmetric NRD guide and on a printed-circuit version of an offset groove guide...|$|E

40|$|The antenna {{model used}} for {{correcting}} {{the influence of}} the antenna pattern on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images requires on-ground validation and in-flight verification. A methodology for the in-flight verification that is based upon the measurement of azimuth antenna patterns using ground receivers has been successfully demonstrated for the operational SAR modes of the TerraSAR-X (TSX) and TanDEM-X (TDX) missions. Recently, the novel (terrain observation by progressive scans) TOPS mode was for the first time implemented as an experimental mode on TerraSAR-X to demonstrate its feasibility in support of its implementation on ESA's Sentinel- 1 mission.

40|$|During {{the past}} several years, the 440 -MHz radar at Millstone Hill has been {{modified}} to detect coherent echoes from clear-air turbulence in the stratosphere/troposphere (S/T) over the altitude range 4 - 25 km. Two distinct modes of data acquisition have been developed, and data reduction programs have been completed {{for one of these}} modes. This mode (I-mode) transmits a 10 microsec (1. 5 km) pulse on the fully steerable antenna. Typically, the antenna is set at a low elevation angle (e. g., 15 deg.) to reduce the altitude resolution to approximately 1 km., and power spectra are collected at some 40 range gates. The antenna may be <b>scanned</b> <b>in</b> azimuth to obtain the total wind vector, held fixed to monitor wave motion, or <b>scanned</b> <b>in</b> <b>elevation</b> to monitor the horizontal extent of the turbulent activity. This steerability gives Millstone a flexible system to focus on localized events, such as lee waves or convective storms. An additional advantage at low elevations is the relatively large Doppler shift of the signal, since the LOS velocity contains a large component of the horizontal velocity. This shift separates the turbulence signal sufficiently far from the ground clutter to allow the spectral moments to be readily inferred. Some 500 hours of S/T I-mode data have been reduced to geophysical parameters, and reside on a data base at Millstone Hill...|$|R

On January 4, 1978, the spacecraft twice crossed an east-west aligned auroral arc at widely spaced longitudes, spanning more than 3 hours in local time. The Chatanika radar was <b>scanning</b> <b>in</b> <b>elevation</b> at a magnetic longitude equidistant {{from the two}} AE-C crossings.

The east-west field was small and almost constant across the arc. The same arc was observed by the radar for about 1 hour, and this electric field pattern did not change, even though the arc location, intensity, and width changed substantially. For a given electric field the AE-C measured ion temperature was substantially different during each of the arc crossings. This dissimilarity is attributed to differences in the F region neutral wind at the two longitudes.

50|$|The taper {{design for}} {{controlling}} the sidelobe level would therefore involve only the relative unbalance Δb/bm.The transverse equivalent network is slightly {{complicated by the}} presence of two additional changes in height of the waveguide,which can be modeled by means of shunt susceptances and ideal transformers.The ideal transformer accounts for the change in the characteristic impedance, while the storing of reactive energy is taken into account through the susceptance.Scanning arrays achieve <b>scanning</b> <b>in</b> two dimensions by creating a one-dimensional phased array of leaky-wave line-source antennas. The individual line sources are <b>scanned</b> <b>in</b> <b>elevation</b> by varying the frequency.Scanning in the cross plane, and therefore in azimuth, is produced by phase shifters arranged in the feed structure of the one-dimensional array of line sources.The radiation will therefore occur in pencil-beam form and will <b>scan</b> <b>in</b> both <b>elevation</b> and azimuth <b>in</b> a conical-scan manner.The spacing between the line sources is chosen such that no grating lobes occur, and accurate analyses show that no blind spots appear anywhere.The described arrays have been analyzed accurately by unit-cell approach that takes into account all mutual-coupling effects.Each unit cell incorporates an individual line-source antenna, but in the presence of all the others.The radiating termination on the unit cell modifies the transverse equivalent network.A key new feature of the array analysis is therefore the determination of the active admittance of the unit cell in the two-dimensional environment as a function of scan angle.If the values of β and α did not change with phase shift, the scan would be exactly conical.However, it is found that these values change only a little, so that the deviation from conical scan is small.We next consider whether or not blind spots are present.Blind spots refer to angles at which the array cannot radiate or receive any power; if a blind spot occurred at some angle, therefore, the value of α would rapidly go to zero at that scan angle.To check for blind spots, we would then look for any sharp dips in the curves of α/k0 as a function of scan angle. No such dips were ever found.Typical data of this type exhibit fairly flat behavior for α/k0 until the curves drop quickly to zero as they reach the end of the conical-scan range, where the beam hits the ground.|$|R
