In this work, LSI is integrated with spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to suppress multiple scattering and absorption effects. First, depth sensitive <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> is shown in phantoms by separating a deep source (4 mm) from a shallow source (2 mm) of <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> by using a high spatial frequency of illumination (0. 24 mm− 1).

In this study, we build a novel SAR aircraft detection framework. Compared to traditional methods, an improved saliency-based method is proposed to locate candidates coarsely and quickly in large scenes. This proposed method is verified to be more efficient compared with the sliding window method. Next, we design a convolutional neural network fitting in SAR images to accurately identify the candidates and obtain the final detection result. Moreover, to overcome the problem of limited available SAR data, we propose four data augmentation methods comprising translation, <b>speckle</b> noising, <b>contrast</b> enhancement, and small-angle rotation.

40|$|Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI) is fast, noninvasive {{technique}} to image particle dynamics in scattering media such as biological tissue. While LSI measurements {{are independent of}} the overall intensity of the laser source, we find that spatial variations in the laser source profile can impact measured flow rates. This occurs {{due to differences in}} average photon path length across the profile, and is of significant concern because all lasers have some degree of natural Gaussian profile in addition to artifacts potentially caused by projecting optics. Two in vivo measurement are performed to show that flow rates differ based on location with respect to the beam profile. A quantitative analysis is then done through a <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> forward model generated within a coherent Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (cSFDI) formalism. The model predicts remitted <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> as a function of spatial frequency, optical properties, and scattering dynamics.

40|$|When {{laser light}} {{illuminates}} a diffuse object, {{it produces a}} random interference effect known as a speckle pattern. If there is movement in the object, the speckles fluctuate in intensity. These fluctuations can provide information about the movement.

40|$|The spatial {{coherence}} of laser sources has limited their application to parallel imaging and projection due to coherent artifacts, such as <b>speckle.</b> In <b>contrast,</b> traditional incoherent light sources, such as thermal sources or {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs), provide relatively low power per independent spatial mode.

Although laser <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> imaging technology is well accepted as a noninvasive methodology for assessing microvascular endothelial function, {{it has never been}} used to compare male patients with coronary artery disease with male age-matched healthy controls. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether laser <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> imaging could be used to detect differences in the systemic microvascular functions of patients with established cardiovascular disease (n= 61) and healthy age-matched subjects (n= 24). Cutaneous blood flow was assessed in the skin of the forearm using laser <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> imaging coupled with the transdermal iontophoretic delivery of acetylcholine and post-occlusive reactive hyperemia. The maximum increase in skin blood flow induced by acetylcholine was significantly reduced in the cardiovascular disease patients compared with the control subjects (74 vs 116 %; P< 0. 01).

The linear birefringence (LB), linear diattenuation (LD), circular birefringence (CB), circular diattenuation (CD), and depolarization properties of chitosan hydrogel films crosslinked in citrate acid buffer solution (CBS) are extracted using an analytical Mueller matrix method. It is shown that the optical phase retardance property of the hydrogel films provides a reliable indication of both the chitosan concentration of the film and the pH value of the CBS crosslinking environment. In addition, chitosan hydrogel suspension with low-concentration crosslinked in CBS environments with various pH values are studied by the <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> of the projected images obtained when illuminating the suspension with a scanned laser pico-projector (SLPP). It is found that for the samples crosslinked in an acidic environment, the <b>speckle</b> <b>contrast</b> decreases with an increasing pH value.

40|$|International audienceThe {{measurement}} of optical contrasts within thick biological tissues {{can be performed}} with the hybrid technique of acousto-optic imaging, {{but it has been}} shown that an acquisition rate in the 1 − 10 kHz range is required for a good efficiency. This comes from the interferometric nature of the signal, blurred by speckle decorrelation in a time c, due to a decrease of the <b>speckle</b> pattern <b>contrast</b> at the exit of the sample. An holographic setup that associates a fast and large area single photodetector and a photorefractive crystal, can measure in real-time the acousto-optic signal: this is the so-called self-adaptive wavefront holography technique. Nevertheless, it is essential to size the photorefractive response time (PR) of the crystal with c in order to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement. This time mainly depends on the overall light intensity within the crystal. We have developed an original in situ method to determine PR with the combination of acoustic pulses and a frequency de-tuning of the reference beam. We can measure precisely this time but also monitor it according to a theoretical model that we have previously described.
