25|$|The Ancient Images Laboratory is {{equipped}} with a Nikon Metrology microtomography (microCT) scanner, a Faxitron digital x-ray, a 3D Systems Projet 660 Pro3D printer, and artifact photography stations. The microCT and digital x-ray are used to conduct non-invasive studies of a range of archaeological and bioarchaeological materials, to facilitate the study of internal structures and features. Sustainable Archaeology's 3D <b>scanning</b> <b>equipment</b> consists of five 3D scanners: a Konica Minolta Vivid 9i, and four structured-light 3D scanners from 3D3 Solutions. Imaging data and 3D scans produced at Sustainable Archaeology are integrated into the database and research platform, and are used to re-construct virtual archaeological environments.|$|E

50|$|In March 1977, Yu-4A {{went through}} first oceanic tests and was {{considered}} meeting most of the requirements. Further tests in September, 1979 indicated that the last two problems still existed: {{the high level of}} noise generated by the motor and the accidental arming of the fuse. After efforts were spent to attack the problems, the sample Yu-4A torpedoes were once again tested in June, 1980, proving that the problems appeared to be solved. However, after 78 sample torpedoes had been test fired in July, 1981, it was revealed that the problem of the fuse still existed despite drastic reduction of the occurrence, and more worked was needed. Finally, in December 1982, all problems were solved and Yu-4A went into series production, and the export version was designated ET31. Yu-4B, on the other hand, experienced more difficulties and new measures had to be developed, including replacing the original mechanically <b>scanned</b> <b>equipment</b> with electronically <b>scanned</b> <b>equipment</b> to improve the accuracy of depth setting and a new electro-magnetic fuse. In March 1987, after the final test of 63 torpedoes, Yu-4B was accepted into service and went into series production.|$|R

At that point, even if all the challenged ballots were thrown out, Murkowski would still lead by about 2,200 votes. Hoping to pick up additional votes, the Miller campaign demanded a hand recount of the entire election, claiming that because Murkowski's votes were all verified by visual inspection, Miller's should also have the same, individualized treatment.

50|$|Optical scan voting systems {{produce an}} {{electronic}} tally, {{while maintaining the}} original paper ballots which can be rescanned or manually hand-counted to provide an ostensibly corroborative tally. However, the correctness {{of each of these}} tallies requires the voter to either trust that the software is error-free and has not been hacked, or that the physical chain-of-custody of the ballots has not been broken at any point. Other E2E voting systems such as Punchscan and ThreeBallot, address these issues but require existing polling place equipment and procedures to be greatly altered or replaced. In contrast, Scantegrity is an add-on meant to be used in conjunction with existing optical <b>scan</b> <b>equipment,</b> thereby requiring fewer hardware and software and procedural modifications. For all other voters, the ballot marking procedure is essentially identical to conventional optical scan paper-ballots. Similarly, the underlying system still produces both an electronic tally as well as a human readable paper trail through which manual recounts can still be conducted.|$|R
