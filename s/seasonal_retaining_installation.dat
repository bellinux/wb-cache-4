40|$|Abstract. In this article, device-free human {{presence}} detection method based on {{principal components analysis}} of the radio signal strength variations is proposed. The method increases user awareness for automated power management interaction in residential power saving systems. Motivation comes from a need for decreasing the installation complexity and development costs induced by the integration of specific {{human presence}} detection sensors. The method exploits {{the fact that a}} human body interferes with radio signals by introducing irregularities in the radio signature which indicate possible human presence. By analyzing radio signals between radio transceivers embedded in 2. 4 GHz wireless power outlets, the original environment is not visually modified and a certain level of sensorial intelligence is introduced without additional sensors. The analysis of the signal strength variations in principal components space enhances the detection accuracy level of human presence detection method, <b>retaining</b> low <b>installation</b> costs and improving overall energy conservation...|$|R

Indeed, the influence of diaphragm wall installation prior to excavation works may affect the soil response and lateral wall deflection induced by excavation process. The first part of this paper gives a short review of the numerical methods aimed to reproduce the <b>retaining</b> wall <b>installation.</b> Numerical analysis of a deep excavation in two-dimensional and three-dimensional conditions is then performed according to the methods previously presented. In three-dimensional conditions, diaphragm wall installation is performed considering a sequence of panels, described by their number and length. Results of three-dimensional calculations confirm that stress state is disturbed by wall installation, which has a sensitive effect on the ground response induced by soil excavation. It is also noted that these results are not easily reproduced in two-dimensional...|$|R

40|$|Policies {{to decarbonize}} heat {{provision}} involve {{the diffusion of}} low carbon thermal technologies (e. g. ground-source heat pumps and wood pellet boilers). In domestic buildings, such efforts presume the compatibility of novel technologies with practices of home-making, in terms of comfort, cosiness and sociability. However, research on engagement with low carbon technologies post-installation is limited, particularly with older adults, a growing social group in an ageing society. This study explores how older adults living with low carbon thermal technologies represent thermal comfort, drawing on in-depth interviews in diverse UK home environments (owner-occupied and rented; extra-care, sheltered and care homes; urban and rural). Findings indicate that cosiness and glow are highly valued by and for older adults, and achieved in diverse ways that may run counter to policy goals. In owner-occupied, rural homes, wood-burning stoves were <b>retained</b> after <b>installation</b> of under-floor heating/heat pumps to provide a visible glow and hospitality to guests. In care homes, fake fireplaces provide cosiness and glow without compromising concerns about risk. The research suggests that presumed emissions savings from the deployment of low carbon heating technologies may be overestimated, as home-making practices lead to the supplementing of these devices to provide comfort, cosiness and sociability...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since the early 1990 s, the Army has reduced its force presence in Europe by bringing troops and their families back to the United States and consolidating remaining forces and infrastructure at fewer locations. In 2004, the Department of Defense (DOD) announced an overseas basing strategy that called for further decreases of U. S. forces in Europe. As a result, the Army initiated actions to reduce personnel stationed in Europe by 30, 000 personnel by fiscal year 2013 and {{reduce the number of}} Army brigade combat teams in Europe from four to two. Since 2004, the Army has consolidated operational forces close to the European training facility at Grafenwoehr, Germany and at Vicenza, Italy. The consolidation included significant investments to construct new or renovate facilities at remaining bases {{to improve the quality of}} life for soldiers and their families. To help offset the costs of these investments, the Army closed some bases in Germany and has planned additional closures. Amid the implementation of the Army's draw down in Europe, DOD announced in the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review that it would retain the four Army brigade combat teams in Europe, rather than return two to the United States as originally planned, pending the outcome of a review of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization strategic concept and ongoing U. S. defense posture reviews. The DOD announcement cast considerable uncertainty on the Army's future force structure in Europe. For instance, the Army will now <b>retain</b> <b>installations</b> to house the brigades for an indefinite period of time while decisions are made. Regardless of these decisions, the Army is planning future investments of almost $ 200 million in Europe to construct a new theater-level Army headquarters facility at Wiesbaden, Germany and the TRICARE Management Agency is planning a future investment of approximately $ 1. 2 billion to replace aging medical facilities at Ramstein and Landstuhl, Germany with a new consolidated medical center adjacent to Ramstein Air Base in Kaiserslautern, Germany. In light of these significant investments and the uncertainty about the Army's future force structure in Europe, Congress asked us to assess (1) the cost implications of potentially keeping more Army forces in Europe than originally planned, and the extent to which the Army's plans align with an evolving European strategic concept and U. S. posture plans, and (2) whether the process used by the Army to determine facility requirements provides an adequate basis for its infrastructure plans. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} awareness of the radiological impact of non-nuclear industries that extract and/or process ores and minerals containing naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM). These industrial activities may result in significant radioactive contamination of (by-) products, wastes and plant installations. In this study, scale samples were collected from a decommissioned phosphoric acid processing plant. To determine the nature and concentration of NORM retained in pipe-work and associated process plant, four main areas of the site were investigated: (1) the 'Green Acid Plant', where crude acid was concentrated; (2) the green acid storage tanks; (3) the Purified White Acid (PWA) plant, where inorganic impurities were removed; and (4) the solid waste, disposed of on-site as landfill. The scale samples predominantly comprise the following: fluorides (e. g. ralstonite); calcium sulphate (e. g. gypsum); and an assemblage of mixed fluorides and phosphates (e. g. iron fluoride hydrate, calcium phosphate), respectively. The radioactive inventory is dominated by U- 238 and its decay chain products, and significant fractionation along the series occurs. Compared to the feedstock ore, elevated concentrations (<= 8. 8 Bq/g) of U- 238 Were found to be <b>retained</b> in <b>installations</b> where the process stream was rich in fluorides and phosphates. In addition, enriched levels (<= 11 Bq/g) of Ra- 226 were found in association with precipitates of calcium sulphate. Water extraction tests indicate that many of the scales and waste contain significantly soluble materials and readily release radioactivity into solution. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractTaking {{advantage}} of the spatially dense, multi-year time series of global Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) from two concurrent satellite missions, the spatial and temporal decorrelation scales of SSS in the Tropical Atlantic 30 °N– 30 °S are quantified {{for the first time}} from SMOS and Aquarius observations. Given the dominance of the seasonal cycle in SSS variability in the region, the length scales are calculated both for the mean and anomaly (i. e. seasonal cycle removed) SSS fields. Different 7 – 10 days composite SSS products from the two missions are examined to explore the possible effects of varying resolution, bias corrections and averaging characteristics. With the <b>seasonal</b> cycle <b>retained,</b> the SSS field is characterized by strongly anisotropic spatial variability. Homogeneous SSS variations in the Tropics have the longest zonal scales of over ~ 2000 km and long temporal scales of up to ~ 70 – 80 days, as shown by both SMOS and Aquarius. The longest meridional scales, reaching over ~ 1000 km, are seen in the South Atlantic between ~ 10 °– 25 °S, most discernible in Aquarius data. The longest temporal scales of SSS variability are reported by both satellites to occur in the North-West Atlantic region 15 °– 30 °N, at the Southern end of the Sargasso Sea, with SSS persisting for up to 150 – 200 days. The removal of the seasonal cycle results in a noticeable decrease in the spatio-temporal decorrelation scales over most of the basin. Overall, {{with the exception of the}} differences in the South Atlantic, there is general agreement between the spatial and temporal scales of SSS from the two satellites and different products, despite differences in individual product calibration and resolution characteristics. These new estimates of spatio-temporal decorrelation scales of SSS improve our knowledge of the processes and mechanisms controlling the Tropical Atlantic SSS variability, and provide valuable information for a wide range of oceanographic and modelling applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades much effort has been spent to {{investigate}} the installation effects of diaphragm wall panels in an overconsolidated deposit. Conversely, in the literature there is relatively little focus on the effects of bored pile construction. In this thesis a number of three dimensional finite difference analyses using FLAC 3 D have been carried out to investigate the stress changes and consequent movements due to bored pile and diaphragm wall installation in stiff clay. The three-dimensional numerical models developed to carry out these analyses were used to analyse, interpret and explain the instrumented data of ground stress changes during bored pile wall installation in an overconsolidated clay deposit in connection with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL; now HS 1) at Ashford. Two different soil models were implemented in the three dimensional finite difference analyses, having linear and non-linear stress strain characteristic. It was found that both analyses could capture the observed pattern of changes in stresses. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} difference in stress changes and ground movements after a single pile or panel installation were primarily a consequence of the different geometry between pile and panel. In the literature, only limited research has been carried out to quantify the three dimensional effects of diaphragm wall installation. For this thesis a number of three dimensional finite difference analyses, using FLAC 3 D, were carried out, to investigate the installation effects of a group of panels in an overconsolidated clay deposit. One of the key uncertainties associated with the design of in situ embedded retaining walls in an overconsolidated deposit concerns the long-term horizontal stress acting on the wall. There is some concern that the high in situ horizontal stresses in an overconsolidated deposit may become re-established in the long-term, despite the reductions that occur during <b>retaining</b> wall <b>installation</b> and subsequent excavation in front of the wall. This thesis also presents long term case record from an embedded retaining wall that forms part of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link at Ashford, Kent, and a retaining wall at Coventry are also presented. Approximately 13 years of lateral stress monitoring around the embedded retaining wall at Ashford are presented and discussed. The long term field data shows that the in situ total horizontal stresses in the ground close to a retaining wall in an overconsolidated clay deposit did not re-establish in the long ter...|$|R
40|$|Demand for {{underground}} {{space in}} the urban environment for infrastructure schemes has increased drastically in recent years. Diaphragm walls are often implemented to support the sides of deep excavations and it is becoming increasing necessary to install these close to existing structures. This type of cast-in-situ permanent <b>retaining</b> structure <b>installation</b> can result in substantial soil deformations and also cause damage to adjacent structures. A better understanding of this soil-structure interaction problem is urgently needed so that safe and economic designs can be achieved. The installation effects of diaphragm walls on an adjacent single pile in dry dense fine sand were studied {{by means of a}} series of small-scale model tests in the geotechnical centrifuge. A model construction system was developed to simulate the construction sequence (excavation and casting) of diaphragm wall panels. Instrumented model piles, capable of measuring axial force, bending moment and radial stress along their length, were driven in-flight and a constant force was maintained at the pile heads to simulate axially loaded driven piles. The load distributions recorded during pile installation were similar to the general observations, suggesting that the prototype situation was modelled realistically. Miniature pressure cells were used to monitor soil stress changes during wall construction and subsequent reduction in slurry level. Stress redistribution around the trench was clearly observed and its direction and magnitude depended on the relative changes in soil stresses caused by disturbances in trench pressures. Soil settlement was also recorded during the reduction in trench pressure or vice versa. A progressive development of craters occurred when the slurry head was being dropped. The presence of a pile reduced the size of the crater, however, destabilisation of the soil behind the pile was observed after the pile had started moving significantly. Thin layers of coloured sand were placed at equal depth intervals to locate the soil failure surfaces. Distinct soil failure zones were identified {{at the end of the}} tests, i. e. shallow, triangular wedge-shaped and end-bearing failure zones. Their development depended on the layout and sequence of the wall construction. Diaphragm walling also induced substantial changes in pile behaviour, the magnitude of which depends on the trench pressure, pile location relative to the trench, the trench length and the presence of adjacent pre-installed concreted panels. Based on the test results, a progressive failure mechanism for this soil-structure interaction problem is proposed and the associated soil-pile interface stress path is generalised into three phases. A simplified three-dimensional limit equilibrium analysis was carried out and good agreement between the predictions and the centrifuge test results was found. By adopting a critical state soil friction angle, this approach should provide a safe way of assessing the failure load of a pile installed at various slurry levels and offset distances away from a single trench, of which the length also varies. In general, the stability of the system could be improved by reducing the trench length, increasing the pile offset distance away from the trench, or pre-constructing a pair of adjacent stiff panels either side of the panel to be constructed.

40|$|In {{first part}} of the study we discuss impact of {{dynamical}} core in simulation of tropical rainfall. Over years many new dynamical cores have been developed for atmospheric models to increase efficiency and reduce numerical errors. CAM 3. 1 gives an opportunity to study the impact of the dynamical core on simulations with its three dynamical cores namely Eulerian spectral(EUL), Semilagrangian dynamics(SLD) and Finite volume(FV) coupled to a single parametrization package. A past study has compared dynamical cores of CAM 3 in terms on tracer transport and has showed advantages using FV in terms of tracer transport. In this study we compare the dynamical cores in climate simulations and at their optimal configuration, which is the intended use of the model. The model is forced with AMIP type SST and rainfall over seasonal, interannual scales is compared. The significant differences in simulation of seasonal mean exist over tropics and over monsoon regions with observations and among dynamical cores. The differences among EUL and SLD, which use spectral transform methods are lesser compared that of with FV clearly indicating role of numerics in differences. There exist major errors in simulation of seasonal cycle in all dynamical cores and errors in simulation of seasonal means over many regions are associated with errors in simulation of seasonal cycle such as over south china sea. Seasonal cycle in FV is weaker compared to SLD and EUL. The dynamical cores exhibit different interannual variability of rainfall over Indian monsoon region, the period of maximum power corresponding to a dynamical core differs substantially with another. From this study there seems no superiority associated with FV dynamical core over all climate scales as seen in tracer transport. The next part of the study deals with impact of diurnal ocean atmosphere coupling in an AGCM,CAM 3. 1. Due to relatively low magnitude of diurnal cycle of SST and lack of SST observations over diurnal scales current atmospheric models are forced with SSTs of periods grater than a day. CAM 3. 1 standalone model is forced with monthly SSTs but the interpolation is linear to every time step between any two months and this linear interpolation implies a linear diurnal and intraseasonal variation of SST which is not true in nature. To test the sensitivity of CAM 3. 1 to coupling of SST on diurnal scales, we prescribed over tropics(20 S 20 N) a diurnal cycle of SST over daily mean interpolated SST of different magnitudes and phase comparable to observations. This idea of using a diurnal cycle of SST <b>retaining</b> <b>seasonal</b> mean SST in an atmospheric model is novel and provides an interesting frame work to test sensitivity of model to interpolations used in coupling of boundary conditions. Our analysis shows a high impact of using diurnal cycle of SST on simulation of mean rainfall over tropics. The impact in a case where diurnal cycle of SST is fixed and retained to daily mean SST implies that changes associated with a coupled model are to some extent due to change in representation of diurnal cycle of SST. A decrease of excess rainfall over western coast of Bay of Bengal and an increase of rainfall over northern bay of Bengal in such case is similar to the improvement due to coupling atmospheric model to a slab ocean model. This also implies that problems with current AMIP models in simulation of seasonal mean Indian monsoon rainfall could be due to erroneous representation of diurnal cycle of SST in models over this region where the diurnal cycle of SST is high in observations. The high spatial variability of the impact in various cases over tropics implies that a similar spatial variation of diurnal cycle could be important for accurate simulation of rainfall over tropics. Preliminary analysis shows that impact on rainfall was due to changes in moisture convergence. We also hypothesized that diurnal cycle of SST could trigger convection over regions such as northern Bay of Bengal and rainfall convergence feedback sustains it. The impact was also found on simulation of internal interannual variability of rainfal...|$|R
