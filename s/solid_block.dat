5|$|Posing as a nurse, Eva wheels Diabolik past {{groups of}} people. He sneaks into the morgue where Valmont's {{body has been}} cremated, {{collects}} the eleven emeralds from his ashes and escapes. The police discover that Diabolik is still alive and offer a million-dollar reward for him. He reacts by blowing up the tax offices. Without tax revenue, {{the country is in}} debt and sells off some gold to buy currency. Twenty tons of gold is melted into one <b>solid</b> <b>block</b> to make it difficult to steal, and the block is loaded on a train. Diabolik and Eva divert the train by leaving a burning truck on the tracks and re-route it to a bridge where a bomb is placed. It explodes when the train arrives and the gold falls into the water below. Diabolik and Eva collect it and return it to their hideout.|$|E

25|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>block</b> weights can corrode and {{be damaged}} when dropped or {{impacting}} other weights. In flexible bag weights, the {{small pieces of}} lead shot will rub together when handled and used, releasing lead dust and corrosion products into the water. The amount of lead lost to the water is roughly proportional to the total surface area of the weights, {{and the amount of}} motion between contact surfaces and is greater for smaller sizes of shot.|$|E
25|$|First, {{a pattern}} {{is made from}} {{polystyrene}} foam, which {{can be done by}} many different ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a <b>solid</b> <b>block</b> of foam; if the geometry is simple enough it can even be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. Pre-expanded beads of polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made pouring basins, runners, and risers can be hot glued to the pattern to finish it.|$|E
25|$|In the Cairo museum may be {{seen the}} statue of {{a man from the}} period of the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{possibly}} 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of this or any other period. The figure is carved out of a <b>solid</b> <b>block</b> of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined on. The eyes are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent rock crystal forms the iris, while a tiny bit of polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The IV., V. and VI. dynasties cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these are not, like mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification (Maspero). As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these Ka statues, the features and proportions were closely copied.|$|E

500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} was transported to the NTSB lab in Washington, D.C., to see what data was salvageable. In its report, the NTSB identified the unit as an L-3 Communications, Fairchild Aviation Recorders model A-100A cockpit {{voice recorder}}—a device which records on magnetic tape. No usable segments of tape were found inside the recorder; according to the NTSB's report, [...] "he majority of the recording tape was fused into a <b>solid</b> <b>block</b> of charred plastic". On the other hand, all {{the data from the}} flight data recorder, which used a solid-state drive, was recovered.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, {{the design}} of the block was changed from a cutout block, {{consistent}} with a 1940s style front-engined Indy 500 car, to a <b>solid</b> <b>block.</b> The tires were also changed from narrow, hard plastic, to wider [...] "slicks." ...|$|E

50|$|Until {{well into}} the 19th century, sugar came in <b>solid</b> <b>blocks</b> called sugar loaves, which needed to be broken into smaller pieces to use. Only the wealthy could afford the effort needed to produce the small {{granules}} needed for a sugar caster.|$|R
5000|$|Many PBXes {{are safe}} to machine—to turn <b>solid</b> <b>blocks</b> into complex {{three-dimensional}} shapes. For example, a billet of PBX can, if necessary, be precisely shaped on a lathe or CNC machine. This technique {{is used to}} machine explosive lenses necessary for modern nuclear weapons.|$|R

5000|$|In January 1914, Herbert Payne {{was awarded}} the tender to remove eight decayed stumps from under the {{courthouse}} {{and replace them with}} <b>solid</b> <b>blocks.</b> The decayed floor boards at the [...] "bottom front verandah" [...] were also to be replaced and the building painted. The cost totalled £45.|$|R
2500|$|When {{he wished}} to print, he took an iron frame {{and set it on}} the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one <b>solid</b> <b>block</b> of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [...] was {{slightly}} melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 the PRR {{with its}} 119 {{surviving}} GG1s {{merged with the}} New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central. After its creation in 1971, Amtrak purchased 30 for $50,000 each, and [...] leased 21, of which 11 were for use on New York and Long Branch commuter trains. Amtrak renumbered the purchased GG1s #900–929 as a <b>solid</b> <b>block,</b> later renumbered with a prefix [...] "4". The leased units with conflicting numbers were then renumbered 4930–4939, except 4935 which kept its old PRR/PC number.|$|E
2500|$|The {{frame and}} {{structure}} of the Silver Dart were made of steel tube, bamboo, friction tape, wire and wood. The wings were covered with rubberized, silvery balloon cloth provided by Capt. Thomas Scott Baldwin of Hammondsport; hence the name the [...] "Silver Dart". Its Kirkham engine, supplied by Glenn Curtiss, was a reliable V-8 that developed [...] at 1,000 rpm. [...] The propeller was carved from a <b>solid</b> <b>block</b> of wood. The aircraft had what is now called a canard or an [...] "elevator in front" [...] design. Like most aircraft of its day the Silver Dart had poor control characteristics; likewise, it had no brakes.|$|E
5000|$|Lack {{of water}} in many {{countries}} and drastic water savings measures have led to difficulties with aging gravity networks with <b>solids</b> <b>blocking</b> in the pipes. Neither the lack of water nor solids affect resp. occur in vacuum sewer systems. That is why this technology becomes interesting for such kind of applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{characters}} and environment feature a line-free style with <b>solid</b> <b>blocks</b> of color. The camera focused on Winston {{and the food}} while leaving the human characters generally out of focus. Because the film consists {{of a series of}} very brief scenes cut together, the foods portrayed had to be appetizing and recognizable at first glance.|$|R
50|$|Surface area is {{important}} in chemical kinetics. Increasing the surface area of a substance generally increases the rate of a chemical reaction. For example, iron in a fine powder will combust, while in <b>solid</b> <b>blocks</b> it is stable enough to use in structures. For different applications a minimal or maximal surface area may be desired.|$|R
2500|$|The Swan in the High Street {{occupies}} the oldest premises: one owner {{died from the}} Black Death in 1349. [...] The central chimney stack with four orthogonal shafts predates the main structure from around 1600. Above the main doorway is a carved <b>solid</b> <b>block</b> of oak – possibly the oldest inn sign in England. [...] It {{seems to be the}} base of an oriel window taken from Clare Castle. [...] The central figure is of a chained swan with a crown round the neck – the badge of Henry IV. [...] Other symbols link it to Henry V, the Mortimers and de Burghs. [...] A grape vine suggests a link with Clare's fame as a wine producing area.|$|E
2500|$|Coretta Scott King {{eventually}} broadened {{her focus}} to include women's rights, LGBT rights, economic issues, world peace, {{and various other}} causes. As early as December 1968, she called for women to [...] "unite and form a <b>solid</b> <b>block</b> of women power to fight the three great evils of racism, poverty and war", during a Solidarity Day speech. On April 27, 1968, King spoke at an anti-war demonstration in Central Park in place of her husband. King {{made it clear that}} there was no reason [...] "why a nation as rich as ours should be blighted by poverty, disease and illiteracy." [...] King used notes taken from her husband's pockets upon his death, which included the [...] "Ten Commandments on Vietnam." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flying discs are {{disc-shaped}} objects thrown {{and caught}} for recreation, which are generally plastic and roughly 20 to 25 centimeters (8–10inches) in diameter, with a lip. The {{shape of the}} disc, an airfoil in cross-section, allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air while rotating. First known as the [...] "Whirlo-Way", the flying disc was invented in 1949 by Walter Frederick Morrison who combined his fascination with invention and his interest in flight. Carved from a <b>solid</b> <b>block</b> of a plastic compound known as [...] "Tenite," [...] Morrison sold his flying disc invention to WHAM–O, which introduced it in 1957 as the [...] "Pluto Platter." [...] In 1958, WHAM–O modified the [...] "Pluto Platter" [...] and rebranded it as a Frisbee flying disc to the world. It became an instant sensation.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>solid</b> <b>blocks</b> of ink are used, {{there is}} less waste {{generated}} than is with laser printers or inkjet printers, which produce empty ink or toner cartridges, in addition to packaging and packing materials. A loose ink block does not leave any residual cartridge after it is consumed - only a crushable, thin, plastic packing tray and a recyclable cardboard packaging box.|$|R
50|$|Polymer-bonded {{explosives}}, {{also known}} as Plastic-bonded explosives or simply PBX, are a relatively solid and inflexible explosive form containing a powdered explosive material and a polymer (plastic) binder. These are usually carefully mixed, often with a very thin coating of the polymer onto the powder grains of the explosive material, and then hot pressed to form dense <b>solid</b> <b>blocks</b> of PBX material.|$|R
50|$|The Super-Adaptoid {{used its}} new powers to imprison all the Avengers in <b>solid</b> <b>blocks</b> of force, {{and then began}} to create {{numerous}} other Adaptoids to replace all the world's humans. Captain America arrived and tried to trick the Adaptoid, and when the Adaptoid replicated Captain America's powers it was unable to replicate his fighting spirit and Captain America defeated the Adaptoid.|$|R
