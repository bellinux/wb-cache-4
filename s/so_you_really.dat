500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And I just thought he did that so great." ...|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> are <b>really</b> {{going to}} the far coast of Northumberland, Mr. Tomley, to {{exchange}} livings with the gentleman with the odd name? How brave of you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The final effect-—I won't say cure-—was {{from that}} book on {{education}} {{which said that}} a child should never know a cross word or look between father and mother. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> have forgotten how horrid I could be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{would just}} do for it. But of course I shan't {{ask him to}} sit, as my Jael would not like it. She would not consent to operate on so base a subject. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> are going down to Guestwick?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{with such}} a bang! [...] "It never will shut like any other cupboard-door," [...] Arthur explained. [...] "There's {{something}} wrong with the hinge. However, here's the cake and wine. And you've had your forty winks. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> must get off to bed, old man! You're fit for nothing else. Witness my hand, Arthur Forester, M.D." ...|$|E
6000|$|And he said, [...] "Very well, Una, I {{am sorry}} <b>you</b> think <b>so.</b> <b>You</b> would not think <b>so</b> if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> cared {{anything}} for me. It {{is just as}} well I have found out you don't. I am going away in two days' time and I shall not return in a hurry, Una." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'You haven't the power. You {{have only}} the ideas--the {{ideas and the}} little cheap impulses. How you could have kept at your work for ten years {{steadily}} is a mystery to me. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> are <b>really</b> going,--a month before you need?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dare say. But if <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> {{were the}} only person that did {{understand}} her. No doubt what she did was quite right, seeing that she was a saint; but we sinners would have thought it very wicked to have made such a will, and then to have trusted to the generosity of another person after we were dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|The epicure {{entered a}} protest. [...] "Good?" [...] he repeated. [...] "My dear fellow, it's {{absolute}} perfection. I don't like {{to cast a}} slur on English cookery. But think of melted butter, and tell me if anybody but a foreigner (I don't like foreigners, but I give them their due) could have produced this white wine sauce? <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> had no particular motive in going to America?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Lancaster," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield, {{speaking}} very quietly, [...] "if {{you decide}} to go to Miss Asher and ask her to marry you, I know you will do it, for I believe you are a man who keeps his word to himself, but I assure {{you that if you}} do it you will never marry her. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> need not bother yourself about going to her; you can simply decide to do it, and that will be quite sufficient; and you can stay here and hold these long-stemmed dahlias for me as I cut them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jove, Blagrove," [...] Wilkinson {{said when}} they had left the cabin, [...] "if you had told me all this before I should not have felt so {{doubtful}} about your fight with Condor. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> can <b>really</b> use your fists well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you, my dear?" [...] {{she said}} quite calmly. [...] "Will {{you have some}} tea? It's beastly, I know, been {{standing}} for hours, but Guy can ring for some fresh. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> are <b>really</b> going to marry my nephew?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hopes he does, Jack. There is a {{particular}} favour which {{you can do for}} me, Osborne, and which I am sure you will. Ernest Clay; you know Ernest Clay; a most excellent fellow is Ernest Clay, you know, and a great friend of yours, Osborne; I wish you would just step down to Connaught Place, and look at those bays he bought of Harry Mounteney. He is in a little trouble, and we must do what we can for him; you know he is an excellent fellow, and a great friend of yours. Thank you, I knew you would. Good morning; remember Lady Julia. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> fitted young Feoffment with the chestnut; well, that was admirable! Good morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope, Condor," [...] he {{said the}} first time he entered, [...] "that you will believe that I have come in because I am really sorry that you have been hurt so much, and not from any idea of triumphing over you. It was only natural that I should have got the best of it. I knew {{beforehand}} that I was sure to do so. I learned boxing for over two years from some of the best light-weight fighters in London. I worked very hard, {{and at the end of}} that time, except that I was of course their inferior in strength, I could hold my own very fairly with them. That was more than a year ago, and since then I have gained a lot in height, in length of reach, and in strength, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> need not feel mortified that you were so easily beaten, because I consider that if you had been twice as strong as you are, and four or five years older, it would have come to the same thing. A man who can box only in what you may call a rough-and-ready way has practically no chance whatever with a really scientific pugilist, which I may say I am. I hope you bear me no malice, and that we shall be friends in future." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You'll go {{back with}} me?" [...] he said. [...] "There's a train just now. I wonder how my aunt is by this time... And <b>so,</b> Sue, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> came on my account all this way! At what an early time {{you must have}} started, poor thing!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{point is}} here. If a child makes <b>you</b> <b>so</b> that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to spank it soundly, then soundly spank the brat. But {{know all the}} time what you are doing, and always be {{responsible}} for your anger. Never be ashamed of it, and never surpass it. The flashing interchange of anger between parent and child {{is part of the}} responsible relationship, necessary to growth. Again, if a child offends <b>you</b> deeply, <b>so</b> that <b>you</b> <b>really</b> can't communicate with it any more, then, while the hurt is deep, switch off your connection from the child, cut off your correspondence, your vital communion, and be alone. But never persist in such a state beyond the time when your deep hurt dies down. The only rule is, do what <b>you</b> <b>really,</b> impulsively, wish to do. But always act on your own responsibility sincerely. And have the courage of your own strong emotion. They enrichen the child's soul.|$|R

5000|$|In March 2008, McLeroy {{was criticized}} for racially and {{culturally}} insensitive remarks saying: [...] "What good {{does it do to}} put a Chinese story in an English book? ... <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> don't want Chinese books with a bunch of crazy Chinese words in them." [...] He later apologized.|$|E
50|$|Nely Galán {{chose to}} meet with the clients who were to judge this {{commercial}} {{in order to get a}} more effective message while Gene Simmons did not, believing that time was of the essence. Trump has commented in previous seasons that you should always talk to the clients <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> understand what you are looking for, but in an ironic twist, Hydra was the team that won the task (despite not seeing the client).|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly she saw Bianca. The {{meeting of}} these two was very like the {{ordinary}} meeting of a mistress and her maid. Bianca's face had no expression, except the faint, distant curiosity which seems to say: 'You are a sealed book to me; I have always found <b>you</b> <b>so.</b> What <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think and do I shall never know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank goodness, {{they did}} not know it then," [...] Tom said, [...] "for {{it would have been a}} deal worse to stand than the fire of a French battery. Well, Rhoda, and now as to yourself; <b>so</b> <b>you</b> have <b>really</b> been always very happy with aunt?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is <b>so,</b> too. Then <b>you</b> <b>really</b> don't {{know what}} is going on at the ranch? Come now, speak the truth," [...] and James Monday's voice grew stern.|$|R
5000|$|Stone held {{a private}} {{screening}} of Snowden {{at the former}} home of Ernest Hemingway in Sun Valley, for an invited audience of around two dozen, including actress Melissa Leo, who portrayed documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras. Guests were required to sign non-disclosure agreements. The film received critical praise from the attendees, and one audience member was quoted saying, [...] "What he did that's so brilliant is, he gave this kid's whole back story, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> like him." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Allman, “we {{went from}} {{talking about the}} idea, to me and Cyril writing a tune over email, to being in rehearsals, all in two months.” With the union of the three noted front men, the group next added bassist Wooton and drummer Scott to form the rhythm section. One unique aspect of the band is the wide {{difference}} in ages. At 37, Allman is the youngest while 63-year-old Cyril Neville is the eldest. Said Allman of the group:"It's like {{it was meant to}} be. We're not really reinventing the wheel here. We're just making sure it keeps rolling. I think certain fans out there really have an affinity for music based in soul and blues and rock, classic rock, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> get that with this band." [...] The group made its stage debut in September 2011 at the Rock ’n’ Bowl in New Orleans.|$|E
5000|$|CraveTV is {{available}} via the {{video on demand}} library of subscribers' set-top boxes, and as an over-the-top service via its website, mobile apps, video game consoles, smart TVs, and other devices. Bell did not indicate any plans to make CraveTV available on a standalone over-the-top basis, instead stating that CraveTV would [...] "enhance {{the value of the}} subscription television ecosystem" [...] and would be [...] "available to every TV provider in Canada". Former Bell Media president Kevin Crull explained that television content on any streaming service [...] "not exist if you didn't have the traditional TV system. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> can't sustainably have one without the other." [...] Further, he stated that the service would not [...] "cannibalize" [...] Bell's investment in traditional linear television services. Tying the service to a television service also counters the trend of [...] "cord cutting", in which one drops cable or satellite television in favor of exclusively obtaining television programming over-the-air and through SVOD services.|$|E
