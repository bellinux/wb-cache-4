In addition to his fantasy-named bats, Dickey's at-bat introduction song is the theme from Game of Thrones.|$|E

The building was also shortlisted for the World Building of the Year Award in the Civic and Community category at the 2015 World Architecture Festival in Singapore. Wired ranked it among the 10 most beautiful libraries in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Since RFID tags can be {{read through}} an item, {{there is no need}} to open a book cover or DVD case to scan an item, and a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> {{can be read}} simultaneously. [...] Book tags can be read while books are in motion on a {{conveyor}} belt, which reduces staff time. This can all be done by the borrowers themselves, reducing the need for library staff assistance. With portable readers, inventories could be done on a whole shelf of materials within seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Kirk {{became the}} first and only student at Starfleet Academy to defeat the Kobayashi Maru test, garnering a {{commendation}} for original thinking for reprogramming the computer to make the [...] "no-win scenario" [...] winnable. Kirk was granted a field commission as an ensign and posted to advanced training aboard the USS Republic. He was then promoted to lieutenant junior grade and returned to Starfleet Academy as a student instructor. Students could either [...] "think or sink" [...] in his class, and Kirk himself was [...] "a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> with legs". Upon graduating in the top five percent, Kirk was promoted to lieutenant and served aboard the USS Farragut. While assigned to the Farragut, Kirk commanded his first planetary survey and survived a deadly attack that killed {{a large portion of the}} Farraguts crew, including his commanding officer, Captain Garrovick. He received his first command, a spaceship roughly equivalent to a destroyer, while still quite young.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Richard James, a naval {{mechanical}} engineer {{stationed at the}} William Cramp and Sons shipyards in Philadelphia, was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas. James accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf, {{and watched as the}} spring [...] "stepped" [...] in a series of arcs to a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>books,</b> to a tabletop, and to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. James's wife Betty later recalled, [...] "He came home and said, 'I think if I got the right property of steel and the right tension; I could make it walk.'" [...] James experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year, and finally found a spring that would walk. [...] Betty was dubious at first, but changed her mind after the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it. She dubbed the toy Slinky (meaning [...] "sleek and graceful"), after finding the word in a dictionary, and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing.|$|E

5000|$|Along with Metzger, John Latham {{was another}} {{influential}} destructive artist. Latham {{had an interest}} in “temporality” and “time based” destruction. His most recognized piece was the Skoob Tower Ceremonies. Latham used <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> to create towers that he then set on fire. This demonstration was controversial due to the recent Nazi attacks and book burnings that took place. Latham noted that he was not against the content in the books, but rather the idea that books are the only source of knowledge.|$|R
2500|$|A Slinky or [...] "Lazy Spring" [...] is a toy {{consisting}} of a helical spring that stretches and can bounce up and down. It can perform a number of tricks, including traveling {{down a flight of}} steps end-over-end as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum. The Slinky was invented in 1943 by American engineer Richard T. James while working in his home laboratory to invent a set of springs {{that could be used to}} support sensitive instruments on board ships and stabilize them even in rough seas. When he once accidentally knocked one of his springs off a shelf, James saw that, rather than flopping in a heap onto the floor, the spring [...] "stepped" [...] in a series of arcs from the shelf, to a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>books,</b> to a tabletop, to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. In 1945, the James first exhibited his new toy at the Gimbels, a department store located in Philadelphia. He sold 400 Slinkys in 90 minutes which was the start of a sensation that continues to this day.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinctive}} original {{building was}} {{designed in the}} late 1960s by William Pereira {{to sit at the}} head of a canyon. The buildings arches, in combination with the design of the individual floors, is made to look like hands holding up a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>books.</b> William Pereira & Associates prepared a detailed [...] in 1969. Pereira originally conceived a steel-framed building, but this was changed to reinforced concrete to save on construction and maintenance costs. This change of material presented an opportunity for a more sculptural design. It was envisioned that future additions to the original building would form terraced levels around the tower base descending into the canyon. In keeping with the original master plan, these are [...] "deliberately designed to be subordinated to the strong, geometrical form of the existing library." [...] Within its two subterranean levels are the other library sections as well as study spaces and computer labs. The tower is a prime example of brutalist architecture. It rises 8 stories to a height of 110ft (33.5m). The five upper stories of the tower house collections, individual study space, and group study rooms.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{shots of the}} library and a book called [...] "The Story of Us". Swift narrates the story while {{standing}} between two bookshelves, sitting on a desk and lying across a table (and occasionally lying on top of [...] "The Story of Us") with a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> next to her, as we see scenes flashing {{back and forth between}} her and her ex-boyfriend, students in the library, some library staff, and her band playing the song. The scenes between her and her ex start with a private meeting between the two in the library, scenes where she is finding a place by herself without him in the library, to the awkward scene of finding him across the room from her. Swift hides behind a book she's holding when she notices her ex, then looks away pulling on her clothes and plays with her hair, in the attempt of not making him notice her. She doesn't notice that he noticed her too, later in the video, and was trying to avoid her too. They both eventually catch each other looking and they awkwardly try to give each other a silent and distant [...] "Hi" [...] as the video cuts to a scene where we see a girl who first pulls Swift's ex into a make out, then pulls away as the librarian passes by. When the librarian passes, Swift's ex pulls the girl back and kisses her again. This cheating caused the fall out between Swift and the guy. Swift eventually gives the first [...] "Hi" [...] which he returns and both get up to confront the other. The video ends with a break out of the other classmates and staff joining in, the classmates throwing away their papers and they and the staff begin dancing to the song while both Swift and her ex are face to face with each other in a very awkward moment, both trying to say how the other feels, but eventually they both shrug at each other and walk away. The last shot is of Swift closing the book of [...] "The Story of Us".|$|E
