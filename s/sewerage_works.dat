25|$|The manor of Marbury {{was later}} {{owned by the}} de Praers family of Baddiley, passing to John le Strange, Lord of Whitchurch, before 1349. A timber church was in {{existence}} in 1299, {{on the site of}} the present parish church; Marbury church was considered a parochial chapel of Whitchurch until 1870. The remains of a medieval road were uncovered near Marbury Big Mere during <b>sewerage</b> <b>works.</b> They consist of a brushwood base covered by several layers of logs, with cobbles lying on top of the wood.|$|E
50|$|East Gordon Street <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Works</b> is a heritage-listed {{pumping station}} at <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Works</b> Buildings, 38 East Gordon Street, Mackay, Mackay Region, Queensland, Australia. It was {{designed}} by A E Harding Frew and built in 1936. It {{is also known as}} Pump Stations. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 July 2009.|$|E
50|$|After {{completion}} of the town's sewerage scheme in 1934 considerable development {{took place in the}} Worcester Municipal area. The <b>sewerage</b> purification <b>works</b> was completed in 1962, with an estimated life span of 30 years.|$|R

50|$|In 1863 a brick drain, 18 {{inches in}} diameter, was laid from Edward Street to Eagle Street, but, prior to 1875, very little {{was done to}} provide Brisbane with a {{reliable}} water supply or an efficient drainage system. The Brisbane Drainage act of 1875 gave the Governor in Council {{the powers of the}} Municipal Council with respect to drainage and sewerage. The drainage and <b>sewerage</b> <b>work</b> was entrusted to the Department of Harbours and Rivers. William David Nisbet, Engineer for Harbours and Rivers, took charge of the design and construction of the city drainage. The primary concern was the creek downstream of the Albert Street and Adelaide Street intersection, which was then the only area developed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Classification schemes are an {{important}} but still rather unexplored issue in the collective use of large document collections. We have investigated the classification of technical documentations in two engineering domains: a steel mill and a sewerage plant company. In both cases we found a coexistence of different classification schemes and problems resulting from distributed local archive. In supporting human actors to maintain different classifications schemes while working on a common archive, we developed the concept of context grabbing. It allows assigning context information efficiently {{in the form of}} metadata. Based on a document management system, a tool kit for context grabbing was developed. It was introduced into the <b>sewerage</b> <b>work</b> company to maintain different classification schemes on a shared archive...|$|R
50|$|Along {{with other}} {{watercourses}} draining the Potteries such as Ford Green Brook and the Fowlea Brook, Lyme brook suffered from pollution {{as the area}} developed following the Industrial Revolution with sewage effluent from Newcastle being discharged into the brook.

50|$|On the {{northern}} {{side of the}} Warrego Highway, the <b>Sewerage</b> Treatment <b>Works</b> and the nearby Pump House on Lockyer Creek are important in illustrating the principal characteristics of early 1940s facilities of this type, and important historically for their association {{with the presence of}} an American military hospital at the College during the Second World War. The timber Dressing Shed beside Lockyer Creek at the northwest end of the campus is a rare known surviving example of this type of recreational structure.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the latter}} half of the 1800s until the mid-1980s, the area around Claise Brook and Claisebrook Cove was used for mainly {{industrial}} purposes and the water quality and surrounds were badly degraded. During this period it was also widely referred to as Claisebrook Drain. In the late 1800s and early 1900s it had become an effluent outlet into the river. In 1906 the Claisebrook and Burswood <b>Sewerage</b> Treatment <b>Works</b> was built. <b>Sewerage</b> was pumped across the river from Claise Brook to ponds and filter beds on Burswood Island.|$|R

In appreciation of his efforts, the authorities promoted him to Managing Director of NWSC in 1983.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> for York, {{covering}} about 20 acres, {{was opened}} beside {{the river in}} Naburn in 1895 and has been extended several times. A narrow gauge railway operated at the sewage works and consisted of a short stretch of line and a siding.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{began on}} the sewers in 1892 and the first house {{connections}} were made from 1897.

50|$|In the {{surroundings}} of Rheinhausen, there are traces of settlements {{dating back to}} the Roman period. Remains of a guardhouse on the Roman boundary, the Limes, have been found during <b>sewerage</b> <b>works.</b> Later, the Irish bishop Ludger is said to have done missionary work in this region.|$|E
50|$|After the Municipal Abattoir was {{relocated}} from Freeman's Bay to Westfield and Southdown, Onehunga {{started to}} suffer from the toxic discharges the freezing works pumped into the harbour. This effectively {{put an end to}} Onehunga's emerging role as a seaside resort and also made it a less attractive place to live. By the late 1930s the water quality of the harbour was quite poor, with a discernible downturn in fish and wildlife numbers. It became unsafe to eat any shellfish for example and fish numbers dwindled. The installation of a large Sewerage Treatment Plant in the harbor in the 1960s only made things worse. Since the decommissioning of the Freezing Works at Westfield & Southdown and a massive redesign of the Manukau <b>Sewerage</b> Treatment <b>Works</b> the quality of the water has increased significantly.|$|R
50|$|A {{list of the}} longest, {{highest and}} deepest Roman {{structures}} {{can be found in}} the List of ancient architectural records.Roman building ingenuity extended over bridges, aqueducts, and covered amphitheatres. Their <b>sewerage</b> and water-supply <b>works</b> were remarkable and some systems are still in operation today. The only aspect of Roman construction for which very little evidence survives is the form of timber roof structures, none of which seem to have survived intact. Possibly, triangulated roof trusses were built, this being the only conceivable way of constructing the immense spans achieved, the longest exceeding 30 metres (see List of ancient roofs).|$|R
50|$|The Civil Engineering & Development Department {{awarded a}} $407 million {{contract}} for stage-one infrastructure {{works at the}} former Kai Tak Airport on 2 September 2009. Works started on 4 September for completion in four years. The contract comprises {{the construction of a}} 1.8 km-long two-lane road, associated drainage, <b>sewerage</b> and water <b>works,</b> and a fireboat berth and public landing steps. The works will provide infrastructure to serve the early development of {{the southern part of the}} former runway area, which includes the first cruise terminal berth and a park. The works have been designed by AECOM Asia which will also supervise construction.|$|R
50|$|At {{the opening}} of the East Gordon Street <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Works</b> on 25 January 1936 the {{chairman}} of the Mackay Harbour Board, Charles Frederick Bagley, paid tribute to the city council for its initiative in carrying out the scheme and to the consulting engineer AE Harding Frew who designed it.|$|E
50|$|At {{the opening}} of the works Bagley reiterated the view of the day that, with the {{completion}} of the <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> and the Outer Harbour Scheme, Mackay would become even more important, and the Government Medical Officer, Dr Ernest Wesley Chenoweth, emphasised the public health advantages of the new sewerage scheme.|$|E
50|$|The 1936 <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Works</b> {{is located}} on a level {{allotment}} in East Gordon Street, Mackay. The two principal early structures on the site are the pump house and chlorinator building. These are small, white, concrete buildings with castellated parapets. The larger is to the rear and the smaller {{to the front of}} the block.|$|E
50|$|Since then archaeological {{excavations}} {{have been}} carried out, mainly involving the drainage, water and <b>sewerage</b> systems. However, <b>works</b> have also been carried out resulting in some damage to the property. These works include the removal of black soil overburden, the provision of water, power and telephone, the installation of a toilet block and septic system, excavation for rebuilding of verandah walls, {{the construction of a}} shed, and the verandahs have been largely removed. The roof has been repaired, with some new structural members being inserted, and resheeted with corrugated iron with some of the original timber shingles being retained in situ.|$|R
40|$|This study {{employed}} complementary geochemical {{techniques and}} distributed hydrological modelling to investigate multiple sources of catchment macronutrients and characterise their changes in contrasting storm and baseflow conditions. This approach was demonstrated for the Beult catchment {{in the county}} of Kent (England), a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) indentified as failing to meet water quality standards for key nutrients under the Water Framework Directive. Significant changes in nutrient stoichiometry and bioavailability are observed for surface waters under contrasting flow regimes. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations are approximately twice as high during baseflow compared to high flow, while the inverse is true for particulate, colloidal and dissolved hydrolysable phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon and nitrate. Nitrogen (N) :phosphorus (P) ratios are lower during baseflow for most surface waters impacted by diffuse sources of pollution. Fluorescence indices of dissolved organic matter (DOM) show that waste water inputs may be locally important sources of more complex low molecular weight DOM, particularly during baseflow. Nitrate N and O isotope signatures, combined with other dissolved chemical tracers, confirm the dominance of wastewater N inputs at sites downsteam of <b>sewerage</b> treatment <b>works</b> during baseflow, with a shift towards the soil N pool in surface waters across the catchment during high flow. Distributed hydrological modelling using the Grid-to-Grid model reveal areas with the greatest runoff also export higher N and P concentrations, and hence deliver a greater flux of macronutrients, while forested areas with low nutrient concentrations reduce runoff and nutrient fluxes. During periods of high runoff, nested sampling indicates that nutrient fluxes scale with catchment area. This combined approach enables a more thorough assessment of the macronutrient sources and dynamics, better informing management options in nutrient impacted catchments. ...|$|R
40|$|The UK horticultural and {{agricultural}} industries rely on large inputs of phosphate fertilisers to maintain crop yields and quality. However, {{the use of}} manufactured phosphate fertilisers is unsustainable. World-wide, over 33 million metric tonnes of manufactured phosphates are consumed annually (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2005). This requires over 130 million metric tonnes of rock phosphate. Furthermore, the manufacture of phosphate fertilisers depletes finite resources. Rock phosphate reserves will exhaust over the coming decades (Runge-Metzger, 1995) and approximately 50 % of mined sulphur is used as sulphuric acid by the phosphate fertiliser industry (Sauchelli, 1965). Thus, the use of alternatives to chemical P-fertilisers is an immediate priority. The aim of this project was to investigate struvite {{as an alternative to}} chemical P fertilisers. Struvite [(NH 4) Mg(PO 4) · 6 (H 2 O) ] is a natural waste product. Preliminary observations indicated that struvite may be a good alternative phosphate (nitrogen and magnesium) fertiliser for crop production (Johnston and Richards, 2003). Struvite precipitates out of sewerage sludge and animal waste, and can build up in sewers and in <b>sewerage</b> treatment <b>works.</b> This causes operational difficulties and decreased efficiency (Jaffer et al., 2002). The physical removal and disposal to landfill of crystallised struvite is expensive and unsustainable. Therefore, the use of struvite as an alternative fertiliser is an attractive proposition. In addition, struvite can also be recovered from animal wastes, principally pig slurry but also chicken litter (Battistoni et al., 1997; Greaves et al., 1999). Because conventional disposal of untreated animal wastes increases the risk of pollution, and because such practices are becoming legally restricted, alternative disposal routes for struvite must be considered. Since it may be economical to recover struvite from both industrial {{and agricultural}} sources for use as an alternative P fertiliser, this project investigated the potential of using struvite as a P fertiliser for potato production...|$|R
