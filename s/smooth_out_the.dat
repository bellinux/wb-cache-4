5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
5|$|M-49 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1930, running along its current routing between M-9 (now M-99) in Litchfield and the Ohio state line south of Camden. Near the state line, the highway jogged along Territorial Road for a short {{distance}} to make the connection with the continuation of SR49. The second version of M-120 ran concurrently with M-49 on this section of Territorial Road starting in 1939. This concurrency was removed in late 1946 or early 1947 when M-49 was realigned to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> corners in the roadway at M-120. The routing of M-49 has remained the same since. It is currently the only state highway that connects with a like-numbered state highway from another state. The only other highways in Michigan to share a number with a cross-border connection are components of the Interstate Highway System or the United States Numbered Highways.|$|E

Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> creases to learn what happens next.|$|E

5|$|In early 2015, the two again began {{showing signs}} of tension between them - with Stardust {{becoming}} further entrenched in his gimmick, leaving Goldust to {{have to try to}} communicate with his brother, Cody; through his new entity. Stardust would respond to this by walking out on Goldust before their match had concluded on the February 5 episode of SmackDown. On the February 16th edition of Raw - {{for the first time since}} their debut, Dusty Rhodes returned to speak to his sons as a way to commiserate and <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> problems they were having. Though at first Cody seemed to be in agreement with his family, after Goldust took the loss for his team against The New Day, Stardust hit his old finisher Cross-Rhodes thus dissolving their partnership entirely. After, when Dusty approached Stardust backstage, Stardust claimed that it was he and his brother that were responsible for the pressure Cody was subjected to from a young age. He then stated that Cody, and now his own family, were dead to him. A match between the two was set for Fastlane with Goldust promising to vanquish Stardust once and for all and to reclaim his brother and rekindle their partnership and brotherhood. Due to their father asking Goldust not to cause any real harm to Cody, Goldust won their first encounter via roll-up. Backstage, Stardust viciously assaulted Goldust and again proclaimed it was his family's fault for his mental decline.|$|E

Instead of using jagged phrasing to create rhythmic interest, as the early boppers had, these musicians {{constructed}} their improvised lines out of long strings of eighth notes and simply accented certain notes in the line to create rhythmic variety.|$|E
25|$|Glaciers {{grow and}} shrink due both to natural {{variability}} and external forcings.

Therefore, one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and/or over many individual glaciers to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate.|$|E
25|$|An anecdote {{often told}} of Zwicky {{concerns}} an informal experiment {{to see if}} he could reduce problems with turbulence hindering an observation session one night at Mount Wilson observatory. He told his assistant to fire a gun out through the telescope slit, in the hope it would help to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> turbulence. No effect was noticed, but the event shows the kind of lateral thinking for which Zwicky was famous.|$|E

25|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to {{eliminate}} turtles to improve upon the speed of bubble sort. Cocktail sort is a bi-directional bubble sort that goes from beginning to end, and then reverses itself, going end to beginning. It can move turtles fairly well, but it retains O(n2) worst-case complexity. Comb sort compares elements separated by large gaps, and can move turtles extremely quickly before proceeding to smaller and smaller gaps to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> list. Its average speed is comparable to faster algorithms like quicksort.|$|E

25|$|The CMU opened from Little Mill to Usk on 2 June 1856, and on 12 October 1857 it {{was opened}} {{as far as}} Monouth Troy station. Reaching Coleford, the primary object of {{building}} the line, required a crossing of the River Wye, and conversion of the Monmouth Railway. As well as relaying all of its permanent way, this would have involved considerable realignment to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> worst of the sharp tramroad curves, and opening out the tunnel profile. However at this stage the CMU had largely exhausted its financial resources.|$|E
25|$|Co-generation {{systems can}} reach 85% {{efficiency}} (40–60% electric + remainder as thermal).

Disadvantages of co-generation systems include slow ramping up and down rates, high cost and short lifetime.

In July 2009, NICTD announced its intention to relocate the Michigan City track south of its current location in order to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> curves, cut down the number of grade crossings, increase speed and reduce maintenance costs. The plan also calls for the replacement of both current stations with a single new station located a block west of the current 11th Street boarding location (between Franklin and Washington streets) with a modern, high-level platform and parking lot. The plan would require a demolition of residential and retail buildings currently located {{on the south side of}} 11th Street.|$|E

500|$|The B-1 has a blended wing body configuration, with variable-sweep wing, four {{turbofan}} engines, triangular fin {{control surfaces}} and cruciform tail. The wings can sweep from 15 degrees to 67.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). Forward-swept wing settings {{are used for}} takeoff, landings and high-altitude maximum cruise. Aft-swept wing settings are used in high subsonic and supersonic flight. The B-1's variable-sweep wings and thrust-to-weight ratio provide it with improved takeoff performance, allowing it to use shorter runways than previous bombers. [...] The length of the aircraft presented a flexing problem due to air turbulence at low altitude. To alleviate this, Rockwell included small triangular fin control surfaces or vanes near the nose on the B-1. The B-1's Structural Mode Control System rotates the vanes automatically to counteract turbulence and <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> ride.|$|E
500|$|The film's B movie-esque title {{generated}} {{a lot of}} pre-release interest on the Internet. One journalist wrote that Snakes on a Plane is [...] "perhaps the most internet-hyped film of all time". Much of the initial publicity came from a blog entry made by screenwriter Josh Friedman, who had been offered {{a chance to work}} on the script. The casting of Samuel L. Jackson further increased anticipation. At one point, the film was given the title Pacific Air Flight 121, only to have it changed back to the working title at Samuel Jackson's request. In August 2005, Samuel Jackson told an interviewer, [...] "We're totally changing that back. That's the only reason I took the job: I read the title."
