Four types of ceramic feedthroughs each having a diameter of 240 mm were tested. The cone-type alumina ceramic and the cylinder-type silicon nitride composite-ceramic feedthroughs produced good performances of 40 kV/ 30 minutes and 50 kV/ 10 seconds. The others had vacuum leaks when subjected to a long pulse duration. The temperature of the cone-type alumina ceramic feedthrough was measured during the ICRF operations. By using gas-cooling techniques, the temperature increase of the ceramic was substantially reduced and saturated within 20 minutes. Without any gas-cooling techniques, the temperature increased linearly and did not saturated. Therefore, this approach could not be used for <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>operation.</b> The RF dissipation on the ceramic was calculated using the finite element computer code (ANSYS). It was found that damaged feedthroughs had local high heat spots, which could result in vacuum leaks. A water-cooled co-axial transmission line of 240 mm diameter was designed and tested for <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>operation.</b> The specially designed connector components and Teflon insulator disks were tested. During the test operation, the insulation gases of nitrogen, sulfur hexafluoride and carbon dioxide were used to compare the capability of insulation for <b>steady</b> <b>state.</b> For the duration of a 10 -second pulse, these gases performed well up to 60 kV_ 0 P.

The simulation of batch distillation columns during <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>operations</b> is a very challenging modelling problem because of the complex dynamic behaviour. In order to verify this issue,simulation of this batch distillation column is to be performed by using computer aided design software and mathematical model so that {{the results can be}} validated. This study is required to model and simulate of fermentation product purification using batch distillation. In this study, simple mathematical models are proposed for the simulation of the dynamic behaviour during <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>operations</b> from product of fermentation. Simulation of simple batch distillation was done by using mathematical method and computer simulator, MATLAB ®. The results from these simulations were used as a basis to validate the results obtained from experimentally. As conclusion,distillate and bottoms composition for ethanol drop gradually over time by using graphical method and the trend from simulation showed that the distillate and bottoms composition for ethanol increase and decrease over the time respectively. The declining trend was due to the unsteady state nature of batch distillation, where the lighter component at the bottoms will deplete over time.
