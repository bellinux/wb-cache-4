The deposit is mineralogically and texturally complex due to supergene enrichment resulting {{in the presence of}} a variety of primary and secondary copper minerals. This necessitates the processing of ore through three separate circuits: <b>sulphide</b> <b>flotation,</b> mixed flotation and oxide leach, followed by solvent extraction and electro-winning. This study revisits the process mineralogy of the ore using modern mineralogy tools, which for such a large and complex deposit cannot but deliver significant value. Specific focus is given to copper mineralisation and the flotation of the sulphide ores in compliment to another MSc study from the Centre for Minerals Research focusing on mixed ore flotation (Kalichini, 2015). A series of hand samples and grab samples representing the variation in mineralogy and texture of the Kansanshi ore, as well as two run of mine sulphide ore flotation feed samples were used for this investigation.

40|$|While the {{influence}} of the grinding media alloy composition on the <b>flotation</b> performances of <b>sulphide</b> ores has been widely studied, its role in the flotation of mixed (oxide and sulphide) ores is poorly documented. For some deposits, the mixed ores zone is well developed and can be of great importance for the economics of a mining project. These ore types often present technical challenges for their beneficiation such as sulphides tarnishment, slimes generation, presence of hydrophobic gangue or presence of acid consuming gangue. This study highlights the importance of matching the right grinding media alloy to the mineralogy of the ore, particularly its degree of weathering and to the subsequent flotation scheme. Shifting the grinding media towards less electrochemically active alloys significantly enhanced the grade-recovery curves and the flotation kinetics of the sulphides fraction, particularly when high degrees of sulphides oxidation were induced within the orebody or during stockpiling. For ores with high acid consuming gangue and medium acid soluble copper content that require a preconcentration of the oxide fraction by flotation through activation by sulphidisation, the higher <b>sulphides</b> <b>flotation</b> rates achieved with the use of high chromium alloys limited the amount of sulphides entering the sulphidisation stages and led to a better selectivity between acid insoluble and acid soluble copper allowing better downstream extractive metallurgy performances...|$|R

40|$|The pulp {{chemistry}} of chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite is analyzed theoretically, with computer-aided modelling, and practically with ion chromatography. Ion chromatography {{is used for}} analyzing the inorganic and organic anion {{chemistry of}} <b>sulphide</b> <b>flotation.</b> The adaptation of modern, rapid analytical techniques to sampling in pulp environments has given valuable information on the metastable state of the processes. Data from the field measurements are then used to construct pulp chemistry models that satisfactorily explain observed phenomena in the flotation of sulphide minerals. The chemical models, presented mainly as predominance diagrams, incorporate the modelling concepts: 'surface molarity' which is the concentration of components emanating from a thin]aver of the mineral surface. 'thiosulphate metastability' which is modelled through adjusted formation constants of sulphite and sulphate species, 'hydroxoxanthates' as models of metal-xanthate surface compounds/complexes, 'operational line' which describes the pe-pH path of a process point in a pulp chemistry system.

In the chalcopyrite and coal flotation, air flow rate (AFR) was varied and different size fractions were considered in coal flotation. In complex <b>sulphide</b> <b>flotation,</b> the impeller speed (IPS) and air flow rate were varied, different size fractions were also considered individually. From the experimental results, the effect of air flow rate, impeller speed and particle size on the recovery and grade of concentrate are obtained, it is shown that an increase in air flow rate does not significantly increase recovery but reduce the grade of concentrate. High impeller speed can increase the recovery of fine and medium size, but it has very little effect on the coarse size. The effect of particle is that the medium size has the highest recovery in Fe minerals but the fine has the highest recovery in Zn and Cu minerals. The air flow rate, impeller speed and particle size affect on the kinetics of flotation is discussed from the model results. Where the modified models are used, the results show that an increase in air flow rate will increase the flotation rate of all size fraction, but an increase in impeller speed can only increase the flotation rate of the fine and medium size.

Improved gold and uranium flotation responses were observed with collector mixtures than with SIBX alone. Sulphur recoveries were not affected. Mineralogical analysis of flotation concentrates showed that gold and uranium were also hosted by kerogen.

40|$|Nchanga copper ore is {{a complex}} mixture of {{sulphide}} and oxide minerals and processing consists of <b>sulphide</b> <b>flotation</b> followed by sulphidisation and an oxide flotation step. The copper oxides have proved difficult to recover. The reason for poor recovery {{has been attributed to}} complex mineralogical characteristics of the ore. Previous laboratory test work carried out on the ore showed an improvement in the flotation recovery of oxide minerals after regrinding the sulphide rougher tails with mild steel media. However, further investigation showed that the increase in recovery was not due to increased liberation. This indicated that the increase was due to some other factors resulting from the regrind, such as change in the chemical environment. The influence of grinding media on the pulp chemical conditions and the resulting flotation performance of Nchanga underground copper ore has been studied to understand how grinding media affect the chemical conditions of the pulp. The media employed were stainless steel and mild steel, which created different chemical conditions in the pulp as measured by dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and pH. Better overall flotation performance was obtained in pulp ground by stainless steel media than by mild steel media. There was an improvement in the recovery of both sulphide and oxide minerals in the oxide flotation stage after regrinding by mild steel media. Stainless steel regrind did not increase the recovery but improved the grade of the oxide minerals in the oxide flotation stage. However, the flotation recovery of copper obtained after regrind by mild steel media was almost the same as that obtained without regrind by stainless steel media again indicating that the increased recovery obtained was not due to increased liberation.

40|$|Numerous organic {{reagents}} {{of diverse}} structural composition {{are employed in}} the froth flotation process for the beneficiation of non-metallic and sulphide ores. Alkyl xanthates are used as collectors for sulphide ores while amines and fatty acids are used for non-metallic ore beneficiation. Although these collector reagents react preferentially with the concerned minerals in the treated ore pulp, excess and unreacted concentration of these organic collectors {{end up in the}} mill process effluents. It has been known that even small concentrations of these organic reagents in water streams are toxic to water life, besides their deleterious influence on end stream processes during recycling. Bioremediation has long been recognised as an inexpensive, flexible and environmentally benign technique for waste water treatment. These organic flotation reagents are amenable to biological degradation. The major objective of this work is the degradation of solubilized collector reagents from aqueous solutions using a microbial technique. Bacillus polymyxa, a Gram-positive, neutrophilic, periflagellated heterotroph that occurs indigenously in soils and certain mineral deposits has been used in the bioremediation studies. Organic flotation reagents namely, dodecyl ammonium acetate (DAA), which is used as a collector for oxides and silicates, sodium isopropylxanthate which finds application in <b>sulphide</b> <b>flotation</b> and sodium oleate, mainly used for oxide and salt-type minerals, have been chosen for the degradation studies. Pure minerals of galena, pyrite, magnetite, quartz and calcite have been typically selected for these investigations. The growth of Bacillus polymyxa {{in the presence of the}}se organic reagents at different concentrations has been assessed and the degradation of these reagents monitored. Attempts have been made to grow the bacterium in the presence of the organic reagents, both in the absence and presence of sucrose, by adaptation technique. Electrokinetic studies on the chosen minerals namely, galena, pyrite, quartz, calcite and magnetite have been carried out both in the presence of the organic reagents and Bacillus polymyxa cells or metabolite. Biological stripping of the adsorbed collector reagents from the mineral surfaces have been examined through FTIR spectroscopy. The progress of bioremoval of the organic reagents along with the generation of newer reaction products has also been monitored through uv-visible spectroscopic technique. The results of this study highlight that Bacillus polymyxa and its metabolic products bring about the degradation of the chosen organic flotation collectors. Further, the bacteria are able to utilise the collector reagents as carbon source for their growth, in the absence of added organic carbon (sucrose).

As minor species, they commonly contain reduced sulphur compounds (RSC) (sulfoxyanions with sulphur in the oxidation state below (VI) such as SO 32 -, S 2 O 32 -, S 2 O 52 -, and S 4 O 62 -), cations of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, frothing molecules, residual chemical reagents and products of their degradation. Tailing ponds also host communities of chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms which {{play an important role in}} dictating their aqueous and solid phase chemical speciation. Consequently, the key step towards developing scientific approaches of recycling of the tailing waters is elucidation of how, in what extent, and why the tailing water components, taken singly or jointly influence flotation of sulphides. In this work, the influence of main process water components of calcium and sulphate on chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite flotation has been investigated through Hallimond flotation, zeta-potential and diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy measurements using pure mineral samples as well as bench scale flotation tests using complex sulphide ore. The significance of process water species in flotation has been assessed using deionised water, process water and simulated water containing calcium and sulphate ions in experiments. In addition, the effect of temperature in bench scale flotation tests has also been examined. Hallimond flotation indicated depression of chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite and activation of pyrite in the presence of calcium and sulphate ions with potassium amyl xanthate as collector. Calcium ions have significant influence on zeta-potential characteristics and xanthate adsorption behaviour of chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite compared to sulphate ions. FTIR studies revealed the presence of surface oxidised sulfoxy species and surface iron and calcium carbonates on chalcopyrite in the presence of process water and water containing calcium ions, surface oxidised sulfoxy and carbonate species on galena in the presence of deionised water, process water and water containing calcium and sulphate ions, hydrated surface oxidised species and surface iron and calcium carbonates on pyrite in the presence of process water and water containing calcium ions all at pH 10. 5 in which the surface species influenced xanthate adsorption. The presence of surface oxidised sulfoxy and carbonate species on sphalerite were also revealed at pH 11. 5 in the presence of deionised water, process water and water containing calcium and sulphate ions in which surface species does not influence xanthate adsorption. Bench scale flotation using two different complex sulphide ores showed that chalcopyrite recovery is better in process water than tap water and general depression of chalcopyrite at temperatures lower than 22 oC in either tap water or process water, activation of chalcopyrite at all temperatures in process water and depression of chalcopyrite when tap water containing calcium and sulphate ions was used at 22 oC. It also showed that galena recovery is better in tap water than process water and depression of galena at temperatures lower than 22 oC in either tap water or process water. It also showed that sphalerite recovery is better in process water than in tap water better recovery of sphalerite at temperatures lower than 22 oC in either tap water or process water.

40|$|The Bushveld {{complex is}} the largest ore body in the world hosting {{platinum}} group elements (PGEs). It is a stratified orebody with three major reefs namely, the Merensky reef, UG 2 reef and the Platreef. Platinum and palladium are the most abundant PGEs found in the Bushveld complex. They occur {{in the form of}} minerals/mineral phases with elements such as sulphur, tellurium, arsenic and iron. These minerals/mineral phases are associated with base metal sulphides occuring along grain boundaries. Unlike the Merensky and UG 2 reef, the Platreef is almost barren of PGE sulphides and the distribution of base metals sulphides and their association with PGMs is erratic. Froth flotation targeted at the recovery of base metal sulphides is implemented in PGM concentrators to concentrate PGMs. <b>Flotation</b> of <b>sulphide</b> minerals is achieved with the use of thiol collectors to create hydrophobicity, and copper sulphate is often used to improve hydrophobicity and therefore recovery.

The erratic mineral variations in the Platreef ore, however, raise the question of the effectiveness of the application of <b>sulphide</b> mineral <b>flotation</b> techniques on this ore.

Subsequently this work also aims to compare the behaviour of these reagents on sulphide PGMs and telluride PGMs...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. (Chemistry) The {{effect of}} crystal defects on the {{adsorption}} and flotation properties of zinc <b>sulphides</b> was examined. <b>Flotation</b> experiments were restricted to collectorless flotation, {{that is to}} the flotation of untreated and copper-activated samples. The effect of cyanide treatment was examined only so that an explanation could be found for the bonding characteristics of the adsorbed copper on regions where the crystallography was undisturbed and on those where it was distorted. The electrochemical method for the determination of copper permitted continuous and highly sensitive monitoring of the copper adsorption on the sphalerites. The {{first part of the}} thesis concerns the adsorption of copper on synthetic zinc sulphide crystals and natural sphalerites. It is stated that the degree of adsorption depends on the defect structure. Structure etching, gamma-ray irradiation, and selective grinding experiments are shown to justify the conclusions reached. The second part of the thesis describes the flotation of the samples. The adsorption characteristics of the samples are defined in the first part and the adsorption and flotation properties are correlated...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of gold from certain Carlin-type deposits, with numerous perceived and real recovery problems is quite challenging. These deposits are characterised as “double-refractory” {{because most of}} the gold values are locked in sulphide minerals (e. g. pyrite and arsenopyrite) and, therefore, cannot be leached directly with cyanide; pre-concentration of sulphide minerals by flotation followed by either roasting or pressure oxidation is necessary. Furthermore, these ores contain varying amounts of carbonaceous matter which is known to cause “preg-robbing” in the cyanidation stage that must be removed before cyanidation. Despite the numerous studies that have been performed on double-refractory gold ores in many laboratories globally, {{recovery of}} sulphide minerals remains low and selective separation between sulphide minerals and carbonaceous matter is quite poor. A review of the published literature on double-refractory gold ores showed that the reasons for their poor separation and recovery by flotation are unknown and that no detailed study investigating the causes of this behaviour has yet been conducted. This thesis investigated the possible causes for the poor flotation response and separation selectivity of a double-refractory gold deposit owned by Barrick Gold Corporation (Goldstrike deposit, BR- 22 ore). It was hypothesized that “The poor flotation response and selective separation of gold-bearing minerals in the Goldstrike double-refractory gold ore are mainly caused by certain non-sulphide gangue species, and can therefore be rectified in principle by an appropriate alternative processing strategy for separating the deleterious species from the value species”. To address this hypothesis, a comprehensive suite of analytical techniques including fire-assay, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray Diffraction, optical microscopy and image analysis techniques (Mineral Liberation Analyser) were used for detailed chemical and mineralogical characterisation of the ore. The distribution of gold in different gold bearing minerals was also identified using diagnostic acid leaching methods. Preliminary flotation experiments were performed to improve the flotation recovery and separation selectivity of the ore. To address the hypothesis a novel experimental design strategy was developed and applied. A gravity separation technique (i. e. Mozley separator) in conjunction with a tailored mixture experimental design was used to first isolate/separate mineral components, blend the separated mineral components in controlled proportions and characterize the blends metallurgically using flotation. In the course of the use of this suite of techniques, the effect of certain gangue minerals and mineral associations on the flotation response of the ore was studied. Through the detailed chemical and mineralogical characterisation of the ore, it was found that in order to obtain the adequate degree of liberation, the ore needed to be ground to a very fine P 80 of approximately 20 µm. But the preliminary flotation performance (i. e. recovery and separation selectivity) of the fine-grind Goldstrike double-refractory gold ore was quite poor and non-selective despite the minerals of interest being almost fully-liberated. The results of the flotation experiments on the blended components of the ore supported the hypothesis and showed that even a small increase in the mass proportion of non-sulphide gangue minerals had a detrimental effect on the recovery of sulphides and separation selectivity. The very fine size distribution and extensive free surface area of the existing non-sulphide gangue minerals especially clays and carbonates had a noticeable effect on the flotation recovery and separation selectivity of the ore. Therefore, it is postulated that effect of non-sulphide gangue minerals on the surface/pulp chemistry of sulphide minerals caused by existence of fine and fully-liberated non-sulphide gangue minerals may be the reason for the low recovery and poor separation selectivity of the gold bearing minerals. It is recommended that a comprehensive surface chemistry study be conducted for investigating the adsorption of reagents and oxidation on the surface of minerals. Also, spiking flotation experiments as a tool for examining the extent effect of non-sulphide gangue minerals (carbonaceous matter, clays and carbonates) on the flotation performance of sulphides should be considered. Moreover, by combining spiking tests with a surface chemistry study, {{it may be possible to}} understand the underlying mechanism of the adverse effect of certain gangue minerals on flotation performance of the double-refractory gold ore type. Finally, as a quick approach for increasing the recovery of sulphides before these additional studies, separation of non-sulphide gangue minerals especially clays and carbonates prior to the <b>sulphide</b> <b>flotation</b> stage is suggested for the Goldstrike double-refractory gold ore...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to environmental sustainability and improved process economy in sulphide minerals production is recycling of process water in flotation of complex sulphide ores. However process water chemistry {{may be a}} critical issue to flotation efficiency. Process water discharged from <b>sulphide</b> <b>flotation</b> circuits are usually gypsum (CaSO 4. H 2 O) saturated and have a high salinity. The major ionic species contained in the process water are Ca 2 + and SO 42 - ions. As minor species, they commonly contain reduced sulphur compounds (RSC) (sulfoxyanions with sulphur in the oxidation state below (VI) such as SO 32 -, S 2 O 32 -, S 2 O 52 -, and S 4 O 62 -), cations of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, frothing molecules, residual chemical reagents and products of their degradation. However, the key step towards developing scientific approaches of recycling the process water is elucidation of how, in what extent, and why the recycled water components (taken singly or jointly) influence flotation of sulphides. Therefore a research program was initiated to understand {{the influence of the}} major and minor process water species on flotation and how to flexibly control such effects if any. In this work, the influence of major components of calcium and sulphate ions in process water on flotation of chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite minerals were investigated by Hallimond tube flotation. The surface chemistry and xanthate collector adsorption on the minerals under the influence of process water species were also studied by zeta-potential measurement, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with diffuse reflectance attachment and Xray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy. The effects of the major components were also investigated on complex sulphide ores flotation using bench scale flotation equipment. The impact of the species in flotation was studied using deionised water, tap water, process water and simulated water containing equivalent amount of calcium and sulphate species in process water. Oxidation of sulphide minerals has been known to be a very critical issue during flotation of sulphide minerals while several authors had reported that pyrite, the most abundant metal sulphide and very common gangue mineral in sulphide ores can generate hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent stronger than oxygen. It was revealed that ferric defects on ground pyrite surfaces can generate OH• radicals upon interaction with water and combination of two OH• radicals yields H 2 O 2. However, participation of these species in non-selective oxidation of the sulphide ore pulp components and hence in deteriorating the concentrate grade and recovery of metal-sulphides has not still been explored yet. In an attempt to fill the gap, a preliminary study was done to estimate the concentration of H 2 O 2 in a complex sulphide ore pulp liquid during different times of ore grinding and compare them to oxidation of pulp solid. Study of possible ways of flexibly controlling H 2 O 2 formation through known chemical means was also attempted. Hallimond tube flotation results showed marginally lower recoveries of chalcopyrite and galena in process water and in the presence of calcium and sulphate ions in both deionised and process waters using potassium amyl xanthate as collector. Whereas sphalerite and pyrite floatability were little increased in process water. There is no significant effect of calcium and sulphate ions on sphalerite in deionised water using isobutyl xanthate as collector. Zeta-potential shows the adsorption of calcium ions on the minerals whereby the potential are seen to increase, while sulphate ions have no significant effect. FTIR and XPS studies revealed the presence of surface oxidised sulfoxy species and surface calcium carbonates and/or calcium sulphate on chalcopyrite in the presence of process water and water containing calcium ions. Surface oxidised sulfoxy and carbonate species were seen on galena in the presence of deionised water, process water and water containing calcium and sulphate ions. The studies also showed hydrated surface oxidised species and surface iron and calcium carbonates on pyrite in the presence of process water and water containing calcium ions all at flotation pH 10. 5. These surface species influenced xanthate adsorption on chalcopyrite, galena and pyrite. The presence of surface oxidised sulfoxy and carbonate species at the sphalerite flotation pH 11. 5 were seen in the presence of deionised water, process water and water containing calcium and sulphate ions, but the surface species does not influence xanthate adsorption. Formation of hydrogen peroxide was revealed during grinding of a complex sulphide ore {{for the first time in}} mineral processing application and its formation was reduced by diethylenetriamine (DETA). FTIR spectroscopy of the pulp solid fraction shows varying degree of oxidised surface species which is related to concentration of H 2 O 2 analyzed in pulp liquid. Addition of DETA at low concentration during grinding of complex sulphide ore depresses iron and copper minerals flotation during copper-lead flotation stage, DETA also depresses iron minerals during zinc mineral flotation. Consequently copper minerals flotation to copper-lead products is reduced and they are reporting to zinc products. However zinc minerals flotation to zinc product is improved. Tests performed on two different complex sulphide ores using bench scale flotation equipment showed that chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite minerals recoveries are better in process water than tap water. The results also showed general decrease of the minerals floatability at temperatures lower than 22 oC in either tap water or process water. An analysis of pulp liquid after flotation shows decreased calcium and increased sulphate ions. This indicates that there is adsorption of calcium ions on the minerals and dissolution and release of sulphate ions in solution. The studies showed that the process water can be recycled in flotation with no significant effect on grade and recovery of sulphide minerals.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 170 - 181). The Platreef {{is located}} in the northern limb of the Bushveld Complex of South Africa. This reef consists of a complex assemblage of rock types, with pyroxenites, serpentinites and calcsilicates being the most abundant. The predominant PGMs are the tellurides, arsenides, alloys and sulphides. The Pt and Pd tellurides contribute between 20 - 45 % of the PGMs present in the Platreef ore followed by the alloys (26 %), arsenides (21 %) and <b>sulphides</b> (19 %). <b>Flotation</b> is used in the processing of the Platreef ore to separate the siliceous gangue from the platinum group minerals (PGM) and base metal sulphides. The PGE arsenide and telluride minerals are considered to be slow floating when compared to other PGMs as there is evidence of them reporting to the tailings. This thesis aimed to investigate the flotation behaviour of these minerals and presents results which characterise the surface properties of synthetic cooperite (PtS), vysotskite (PdS), sperrylite (PtAS 2), palladoarsenide (Pd 2 As), moncheite (PtPd(BiTe) 2 and PtTe 2) and merenskyite (PdPt(BiTe) 2 and PdTe 2) and attempts to relate the flotation behaviour of the various minerals to these characteristics...|$|R

This surface alteration is of fundamental and applied interest. In this thesis, attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy {{has been used to}} monitor the adsorption kinetics and the orientation of heptyl xanthate when adsorbed onto three solid surfaces - germanium, zinc sulphide and lead sulphide in-situ. The choice of using the ATR technique is because it is very suitable when working with water as solvent, and the choice of germanium as internal reflection element is because of its small penetration depth due to a high refraction index. The Chemical Bath Deposition method has been used to deposit metal sulphides onto germanium internal reflection elements. For determining the adsorption of heptyl xanthate onto lead sulphide a novel method has been tested, and verified as capable in recovering information about surface reactions at a lead sulphide/aqueous interface. In the study of surface reactions the substrate is of vast importance, implying that the chemistry of the surface has to be well characterised. This work has utilized X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy, and ATR spectroscopy, in the characterisation of the different surfaces. The adsorption kinetics has been followed to adsorption equilibrium at different concentrations. In the case of heptyl xanthate adsorbed at the zinc sulphide/aqueous interface, an adsorption isotherm has been calculated from the equilibrium data. On the assumption that the adsorption step was rate controlling a second order rate equation was derived and adsorption rate data tested according to this equation. In addition, an orientation study of the heptyl xanthate molecule at the different interfaces was performed, which requires polarised infrared light. In the case of heptyl xanthate adorbed onto germanium, both surface excess and a degree of alignment of the alkyl chain from the surface normal has been calculated.

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{depression of}} coal <b>sulphides</b> in the <b>flotation</b> process means a healthier environment {{and may be}} essential for the sustainability of a coal operation. Nitric and ferric oxidative pre-treatment of coal pyrite have been tested to improve pyrite depression, {{and the results are}} compared with those from the process of raw, not pre-treated coal. The removal indexes point to nitric pre-treatment as the best, but depression is still low. The microscopic study of feed and products, coupled to Digital Image Analysis (DIA) in all the cases, provide important clues to understand the behaviour of pyrite, which can be related to quantitative parameters, such as the exposition ratio (ER), and to qualified interpretation of the textures. Pyrite shows in the first float an unexpected hydrophobic behaviour, which is due to its occurrence as framboids, or porous particles which may be intergrown with organic matter and behave as coal. In general, the flotation results can be predicted from the DIA-data, e. g. depression of liberated pyrite into the tailings, increased by oxidative pre-treatments by 300 % (ferric) or by > 400 % (nitric); or concentration of middlings with lower pyrite ER in the floats. DIA is an efficient tool to obtain some important quantitative informations which otherwise would be inaccessible (e. g. the morphological data on > 1, 000, 000 pyrite particles for this study), and its use should be enhanced to check ore processing...|$|R
