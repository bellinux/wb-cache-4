40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2008. Certain non-Newtonian fluids {{exhibit a}} yield stress {{which can be}} {{measured}} {{with a variety of}} instruments varying from very sophisticated rotary and tube viscometers to hand-held <b>slump</b> <b>cones</b> and cylinders of various sizes. Accurate yield stress measurement is significant for process design and disposal operations for thickenend tailings. The slump value was first related to the yield stress by Murata (1984). Later, that work was corrected by Christensen (1991) for an error in the mathematical analysis. Slump, based on a circular cylindrical geometry was first investigated by Chandler (1986). These concepts led to the study by Pashias et al., (1996) that formed the basis for the current research. The Flow Process Research Centre (FPRC) at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology developed a slump meter designed to lift the cone or cylinder vertically at controlled lifting speeds. In addition the simple hand-held cylinder which is an adaptation of <b>slump</b> <b>cones</b> which were originally developed by the concrete industry to determine the flowability of fresh concrete was also used. The vane technique was used as a control. Cones and cylinders made of stainless steel and PVC were fitted to the slump meter. The yield stresses of four non-Newtonian fluids at different concentrations were tested in four different configurations at different lift speeds to ascertain whether the measuring position, lift speed, slip, geometry, wall surface material, and stability has an effect on the value of yield stress measured. The effect of different predictive models was also ascertained. The cylinder, lump and <b>cone</b> models relating <b>slump</b> to yield stress was used in the dimensional analysis of the results. The objective of this work was to determine if the <b>slump</b> tests (<b>cone,</b> cylinder and the hand-held cylinder) would generate yield stress values comparable to those found using the vane technique. It was establised that there was no significant effect of lift speed, stability, geometry and wall surface material on the value of yield stress. The effect of measuring position on the value of yield stress calculated gave a difference of 25 %. Using dimensional analysis, the lump model (Hallbom, 2005) more accurately predicts the material yield stress when using the hand-held cylinder as well as all the cone results (due to its specific geometry), and cylinder configurations, thus affirming the work of Clayton et al., 2003. It is concluded that, although the materials and concentrations tested induced errors within 40 %, the hand-held cylinder shows promise as a reliable, quick and simple way of measuring the yield stress...|$|R

It has been found that some cement pastes and mortars perform better (ie flow faster and are workable for longer times without bleed and segregation) in some countries than in others. These problems may be solved on an empirical basis, but in this project the mechanisms involved are investigated in order to predict the performance of the cement pastes more effectively. To do this, a relationship between the rheological properties of the cement paste and the chemical components, especially the different kinds of sulphates, of the Portland cement is established. First a relationship between the simple industrial tests, such as the mini <b>slump</b> flow <b>cone</b> and the efflux flow cone, and the rheological properties obtained by a rheometer has to be established.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} rheological {{characterization of}} mine tailings and paste materials as saturated solid-liquid or homogenous mixtures. Thickened tailings and paste fill {{can be classified}} as viscoplastic or time-independent non-Newtonian fluid material. Viscoplastic fluids deform plastically when the applied shear stress {{is less than a}} critical stress, which is known as "yield stress". When the shear stress exceeds the yield stress this type of fluid flows like a viscous material with finite viscosity. In terms of pipeline design for transportation of mine tailings or paste material, {{one of the most important}} rheological parameters that must be measured would be yield stress. There are numerous techniques and equipment that can be used for rheological characterization and specifically for yield stress measurements. Literature review shows that the vane method is one of the best rheometery techniques for determining the yield stress of homogeneous fluids directly. There is also a method for calculating the yield stress from slump height. Any geometry of <b>slump</b> moulds, <b>cone</b> or cylinder, with different dimensions can be applied in this method. The standard conical slump test is basically used for controlling the workability of fresh concrete. This method was then modified for yield stress and viscosity calculation of cemented mixtures. These slump tests can be categorized as in-situ methods of yield stress measurements. Several rheometery and in-situ experiments were carried out to measure the yield stress of two mine tailings samples in this study. A rheometer was used in controlled shear rate and controlled shear stress modes for yield stress measurements with the vane method. The results were satisfactory for cemented and non-cemented mixtures. The effect of mixing time on the yield stress of material combined with cement was also assessed using the vane method. No significant difference emerged between increased yield stress of the mixtures after 4 minutes and 12 minutes of mixing. The accuracy of calculated yield stress values using in-situ methods was also determined by drawing comparisons between these series of data and actual yield stresses measured using a rheometer. Modified conical slump tests overestimated the values of yield stress and did not obtain reliable data for viscosity calculation of the mixtures...|$|R

Eight cements with different chemical composition and Na 2 O equivalent were used for production of LWAC specimens. Loose bulk density, water absorption, material density and porosity were determined for FGG. Properties of fresh LWAC, like density, flow table test and <b>cone</b> <b>slump</b> as well as air content were tested. Mechanical and physical properties, such as flexural and compression strength tests, were performed for 28 days old LWAC specimens. Tests with scanning electron microscope and microstructural investigations were performed for foam glass granules and hardened concrete specimens before and after exposure to alkali solution. The ASR test was performed according to RILEM TC 106 -AAR testing recommendations. Relative expansion of 0. 160 - 0. 205 % was detected which does not comply with standard recommendations (0. 054 %). Moreover, flexural strength reduction up to 73 % and compression strength reduction up to 43 % were detected due to deleterious ASR. It was detected that Na 2 Oeq. is only one of the criteria that determine choice of cement for production of sustainable LWAC.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals {{with the development of}} self-consolidating high performance concrete (SCHPC) incorporating rice husk ash (RHA) as a supplementary cementing material. Various SCHPCs were produced using the water-binder (W/B) ratios of 0. 30, 0. 35, 0. 40 and 0. 50, and RHA content in the range of 0 to 30 % of cement by weight. In addition, a number of pastes and mortars formulated from the concretes were prepared and tested for the filling ability. The paste and mortar filling abilities were tested with respect to flow time and flow spread, respectively, at various dosages of high-range water reducer (HRWR). Also, the mortars were tested for the air content at various dosages of air-entraining admixture (AEA). It was observed that the flow time of the pastes increased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content, whereas the flow spread of the mortars decreased with higher W/B ratio and greater RHA content. Both paste and mortar filling abilities increased with higher HRWR dosages. In addition, the air content of the mortars decreased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content for given AEA dosages. The fresh SCHPCs were tested for filling ability, passing ability, air-void stability, segregation resistance, unit weight and air content. The filling ability was determined with respect to slump and slump flow, inverted <b>slump</b> <b>cone</b> flow time and spread, and orimet flow time and spread. The passing ability was measured with regard to slump and slump flow with J-ring, inverted <b>slump</b> <b>cone</b> flow spread with J-ring, and orimet flow spread with J-ring. The air-void stability in several fresh SCHPC mixtures was investigated with respect to re-mixing of concrete and subsequent measurement of air content at different test stages. The test results obtained for the fresh properties showed that the inverted <b>slump</b> <b>cone</b> and orimet flow times increased with lower W/B ratio and greater RHA content. In addition, the slump flow, inverted <b>slump</b> <b>cone</b> flow spread, and orimet flow spread with and without J-ring increased considerably with lower W/B ratio and greater RHA content. However, the increases in slump with and without J-ring at lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content were not significant. The unit weight of concrete slightly decreased with higher W/B ratio and greater RHA content, and with higher air content. Achieving the target air content required greater AEA dosages for lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content. However, the presence of RHA had no adverse effect on the air-void stability of concrete. The segregation resistance of various SCHPCs was investigated by visual inspection of concrete in mixer pan, and during and after different flow tests. Slight bleeding and a thick layer of paste were noticed in mixer pan for several concretes. The dynamic segregation in the form of discontinuity or blockage of flow did not occur during the orimet and inverted <b>slump</b> <b>cone</b> flow tests for any concrete. No aggregate pile appeared in the slump flow, and orimet and inverted <b>slump</b> <b>cone</b> flow spreads of any concrete. But minor to severe mortar halos were noticed in the periphery of the flow spread of several concretes, particularly in the presence of high RHA content. The results of visual inspection suggest that both lower W/B ratio and greater RHA content improved the dynamic segregation resistance of concrete. In contrast, the higher RHA content resulted in a lower static segregation resistance, which was overcome in the presence of viscosity-enhancing admixture (VEA). The static segregation resistance of several SCHPCs was quantitatively determined by sieve and column apparatus. The segregation index given by the sieve increased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content, thus indicating a reduced static segregation resistance. In contrast, the segregation factor given by the column apparatus decreased with lower W/B ratio suggesting an increased static segregation resistance. However, the segregation factor increased with higher RHA content, and thus revealed a reduction in static segregation resistance. In the presence of VEA, both segregation index and segregation factor decreased significantly, indicating an improvement in the static segregation resistance of concrete. The hardened SCHPCs were tested for compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water absorption, total porosity and electrical resistivity. Test results revealed that the compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity and true electrical resistivity increased, whereas the water absorption and total porosity decreased with lower W/B ratio and higher RHA content. The entrained air-voids decreased the compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water absorption and total porosity, but slightly increased the electrical resistivity of concrete. In general, the hardened properties indicated good durability of the concretes. The empirical models for the filling ability (slump flow) and compressive strength of SCHPC were derived and verified with test data from this study and other data taken from the literature. The slump flow and compressive strength computed from the models were coherent with the measured values. Both filling ability and strength models were useful to develop a mixture design method for SCHPC with and without RHA...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{utilization}} {{of business and}} agricultural waste created by industrial processes has been {{the main focus of}} waste diminution analysis for economical, environmental, and technical reasons. Sugar-cane bagasse is a fibrous waste-product of the sugar refining industry, along with ethanol vapor. This waste product (Sugar-cane Bagasse ash) is already causing serious environmental pollution, which calls for urgent ways of handling the waste. Bagasse ash mainly contains aluminum ion and silica. In this paper, Bagasse ash has been chemically and physically characterized, and partially replaced in the ratio of 0 %, 5 %, 15 % and 25 % by weight of cement in concrete. Fresh concrete tests like compaction factor test and <b>slump</b> <b>cone</b> test were undertaken was well as hardened concrete tests like compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity at the age of seven and 28 days was obtained. The result shows that the strength of concrete increased as percentage of bagasse ash replacement increased...|$|E
40|$|Two key {{characteristics}} of self-consolidating concrete are flowability and segregation resistance. Quality control of flowability is typically {{predicted by the}} final diameter of the slump-flow test. In this paper, experimental results demonstrate that dynamic segregation of a self-consolidating concrete mix can also be predicted from the slump-flow test by measuring {{the time it takes}} for the flow to reach its final diameter. For a constant final diameter and aggregate content, increasing the time to final diameter led to a more stable mix. Two sets of slump-flow and segregation data were obtained for flow diameters of 65 and 70 cm, both with constant water-to-binder and aggregate-to-binder ratios. Dynamic segregation was determined by comparing the aggregate content in three regions: Within the diameter of the <b>slump</b> <b>cone,</b> between the diameter of the cone and a diameter of 50 cm, and between a diameter of 50 cm and the final diameter. In addition, the rapid penetration test was used to compare dynamic and static segregation characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Palm {{oil fuel}} ash (POFA) {{has been used}} {{successfully}} as a supplementary cementing material in various types of concrete. In the present study, self-consolidating concrete (SCC) was produced by using POFA as a partial replacement of ordinary portland cement (OPC). In total, sixteen SCC mixes were prepared by varying water to binder (W/B) ratio, POFA content, and high-range water reducer (HRWR). POFA was used by replacing 0 - 30 of OPC by weight at the W/B ratios ranging from 0. 25 to 0. 40. The filling ability, passing ability and segregation resistance of various SCC mixes were investigated. The filling ability was determined with respect to slump flow, 50 -cm slump flow time, inverted <b>slump</b> <b>cone</b> flow spread and time, and V-funnel flow time. The passing ability was examined with respect to J-ring flow. In addition, the segregation resistance was assessed with regard to sieve segregation index and column segregation factor. Based on the data obtained, the correlations for the fresh properties of SCC were sought. The experimental findings showed strong correlations between most of the fresh properties of SCC...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, fly ash and metakaolin as {{pozzolan}} while limestone {{powder and}} kaolin as filler material were used at replacement levels of 5, 10, 15, and 20 by weight of cement and sand, respectively. The {{effects of these}} powders on the fresh property of mortar mixes were studied and reported. Superplasticizer dosages were determined from flow test on cement paste and mortar with different powder content. A total of 33 mixes were prepared, mixed, and tested. The mini <b>slump</b> <b>cone</b> and mini V-funnel box tests {{were used to assess}} the flowability of the fresh mortar. In addition, the effect of mineral admixture on setting time of the mixes was also evaluated. In this study, the optimum dosage of superplasticizer was determined based on the desired flowability for self compactability. Superplasticizer at higher dosages than optimum reduced the stability due to bleeding. The results confirmed the role of the mineral powders in determining the desired stability and the flowability of mortar mixes which is crucial for self compacting concrete. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
