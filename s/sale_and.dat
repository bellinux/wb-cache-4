40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{forecast}} demand for existing single-family {{housing in the}} United States. We first find that <b>sales</b> volume (<b>sales)</b> <b>and</b> median <b>sales</b> price (price) have unit roots. We then find that <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> price are cointegrated. We develop a vector autoregressive (VAR) model with error correction to further examine the causality between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> price. We find that there exists a bidirectional causality relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> price. Price affects <b>sales</b> significantly <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> affects price weakly. With the VAR model we then forecast <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> price for existing single-family housing during the period 1991 to 1994 by using a recursive method. We find that our predictions for <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> price fit the actual data well...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{cross-functional}} {{partnerships between}} <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing functions are {{a priority for}} many organisations. Previous research proposes that organisational structure and/or location may be influential in creating greater collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. It {{has been suggested that}} high performing organisations may structure their <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing functions as single departments. This study tests both these propositions through a survey of managing directors and CEOs of large UK organisations. The results indicate that there is no relationship between structure or location of <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>and</b> collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. Further, high performing organisations structure their <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing functions both as separate departments and as single departments...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} antecedents and {{consequences}} of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. The results suggest that collaborative <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing functions have benefits for the organisation in terms of improved business performance. In addition, improvements in collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing will positively affect marketing orientation and leading to superior marketing quality. The research began with {{an exploration of the}} interface between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing through the available literature. The existing research conceptualises the relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing and highlights the benefits of interfunctional collaborative behaviour. Therefore, a study was designed to not only identify the antecedents of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing so that the relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing can be assessed and improved to the benefit of the organisation, but also to establish that business performance can be directly influenced by improvements in collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. The research was undertaken through a mixed methodology, utilising exploratory case studies, a large-scale quantitative survey and confirmatory interviews. The data analysis involved four distinct analytical methods: within-case analysis, crosscase analysis, statistical analysis and confirmatory interviews. The large-scale survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was sent to the Managing Directors/Chief Executives of large, UK-based organisations operating in the business-to-business arena. Through the findings from the survey five antecedents to collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing were identified - management attitudes towards co-ordination, conflict of interests, communications, market intelligence and organisational learning - and a revised conceptual framework was developed. The correlation and multiple regression analysis confirmed the weighting of each of the independent variables upon collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing and established a number of other relationships between the variables. The second part of the research focused on the consequences of improved collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. It was found through the survey that collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing may have a positive effect upon business performance. The research also established that marketing orientation was not an antecedent to collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing, but that collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing may have a positive influence on marketing orientation. In addition, it was established that collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing has a positive effect on business performance. This research identifies some of the antecedents of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing and clarifies the benefits of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing to the organisation.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> {{marketing}} interface and to identify some of the elements that may influence collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing and provide a framework demonstrating how these elements may interrelate. Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores the <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing relationship through qualitative research using one-to-one, tripartite interviews with senior executives <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing managers of three, UK-based business-to-business organizations. Findings – The paper indicates that there are two types of factor that affect collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. Those that are out of the control of <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing staff – management attitudes to coordination, interdepartmental culture and structure and orientation, and four that are internal to the interface – inter-functional conflict, communications, market intelligence and learning. The paper also identifies that senior managers play a critical role in influencing this interface. Research limitations/implications – Improving collaboration in the <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing interface should be a focus for senior managers. The paper is limited by the number of cases. Practical implications – The factors identified may be used by organizations to improve collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. Originality/value – The identification of factors that may improve collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing, and provide a conceptual framework for further study. The paper increases the understanding of the <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing interface by identifying two additional factors that may influence the interface – learning and market intelligence, and demonstrates how the various factors may interrelate to create improved collaboration...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The study {{seeks to}} explore the antecedents and {{implications}} of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing and further to identify whether there are benefits in terms of business performance of improving collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. Design/methodology/approach - Three exploratory case studies and {{a review of the}} literature are used to examine the antecedents to collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. The case studies allow this fuzzy and undefined area to be clarified and existing theories to be empirically tested. Findings - The study identifies that there are three types of factor influencing collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing: integrators, facilitators, and management attitudes towards coordination. The exploratory case studies establish that senior management plays a pivotal role in creating and improving collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing, and that there is a positive correlation between collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing, and improved business performance. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this study are that it is qualitative in nature and the conceptual framework needs be tested through a large-scale survey. In addition, the study considers only large UK organisations and, therefore, future research should consider expanding the study to overseas organisations. Practical implications - There appears to be an established relationship between the level of collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing and business performance. Further, the attitude of senior managers to improving coordination is critical to influencing collaboration between <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing. Originality/value - This study contends that <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> marketing need to collaborate rather than integrate and uses exploratory case studies to support the development of the framework. ...|$|R
