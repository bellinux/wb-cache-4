50|$|Users access an airline’s {{inventory}} {{through an}} availability display. It contains all offered flights {{for a particular}} city-pair with their available seats in the different booking classes. This display contains flights which are operated by the airline itself as well as code share flights which are operated in co-operation with another airline. If the city pair is not one on which the airline offers service, it may display a connection using its own flights or display the flights of other airlines. The availability of seats of other airlines is updated through standard industry interfaces. Depending {{on the type of}} co-operation, it supports access to the last seat (last seat availability) in real-time. Reservations for individual passengers or groups are stored in a so-called passenger name record (PNR). Among other data, the PNR contains personal information such as name, contact information or <b>special</b> <b>services</b> <b>requests</b> (SSRs) e.g. for a vegetarian meal, as well as the flights (segments) and issued tickets. Some reservation systems also allow to store customer data in profiles to avoid data re-entry each time a new reservation is made for a known passenger. In addition, most systems have interfaces to CRM systems or customer loyalty applications (aka frequent traveller systems). Before a flight departs, the so-called passenger name list (PNL) is handed over to the departure control system that is used to check-in passengers and baggage. Reservation data such as the number of booked passengers and <b>special</b> <b>service</b> <b>requests</b> is also transferred to flight operations systems, crew management and catering systems. Once a flight has departed, the reservation system is updated with a list of the checked-in passengers (e.g. passengers who had a reservation but did not check in (no shows) and passengers who checked in, but did not have a reservation (go shows)). Finally, data needed for revenue accounting and reporting is handed over to administrative systems.|$|R

50|$|For {{the purpose}} of the {{preservation}} of Tibetan culture and religion, Dagchen Rinpoche oversaw the religious activities and administration of the Monastery from itsinception. His spiritual leadership took various forms: leading meditations, giving teachingsand empowerments (spiritual initiations), conducting refuge ceremonies in which peopleformally become Buddhists, and holding <b>special</b> <b>services</b> upon <b>request.</b> When the Monastery was completed, Dagchen Rinpoche placed greater emphasis on education. The Virupa Educational Institute is devoted to the study of Tibetan Buddhism,Buddhism in general, religions, cultures, and sciences from around the world. Non-sectarianismand education were major components of Rinpoche’s teaching, in keeping with the beliefs of hisroot lamas. Sakya Monastery in Seattle has hosted visits from leading lamas of the four schoolsof Tibetan Buddhism, including H. H. the Dalai Lama.Dagchen Rinpoche’s interest in ecumenism stemmed from his training as a non-sectarian master,and from his experience as an immigrant who went to the United States seeking religious freedom. Like theFourteenth Dalai Lama, Rinpoche encouraged inter-religious and interdisciplinary meetingsand encounters for Tibetan Buddhists. He regularly travelled to teach in Asia, Europe, Canada,and throughout the United States.|$|R

In this paper, Minimum Dominating Forward Node Set based Service Discovery Protocol (MDFNSSDP) is proposed. MDFNSSDP has the following characteristics: 1) It minimizes the number of coverage demanding nodes in the current node’s 2 -hop neighbor set. 2) It minimizes the size of dominating forward node set used to cover all coverage demanding nodes. Forward nodes are selected based on local topology information and history information piggybacked in <b>service</b> <b>request</b> packets. Only these forward nodes are responsible for forwarding <b>service</b> <b>request</b> packets. 3) The coverage of <b>service</b> <b>request</b> packets is guaranteed. 4) Multiple <b>service</b> <b>requests</b> can be fulfilled in just one service discovery session.

40|$|When {{meeting the}} {{challenges}} in automatic and semi-automatic Web service composition, capturing the user’s service demand and preferences {{is as important as}} knowing what the services can do. This paper discusses the idea of semantic <b>service</b> <b>requests</b> for composite <b>services,</b> and presents a multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) based model of composite <b>service</b> <b>requests.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>requests</b> are modeled as user preferences and constraints. Two preference structures, additive independence and generalized additive independence, are utilized in calculating the expected utilities of service composition outcomes. The model is also based on an iterative and incremental scheme meant to better capture requirements in accordance with service consumers’ needs. OWL-S markup vocabularies and associated inference mechanism are used as a means to bring semantics to <b>service</b> <b>requests.</b> Ontology conceptualizations and language constructs are added to OWL-S as uniform representations of possible aspects of the requests. This model of semantics in <b>service</b> <b>requests</b> enables unambiguous understanding of the service needs and more precise generation of the desired compositions.
