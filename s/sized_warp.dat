The {{number of threads}} included in each <b>warp</b> (or <b>warp</b> <b>size)</b> affects divergence, synchronization overhead and the efficiency of memory access coalescing. Small warps reduce the performance penalty associated with branch and memory divergence {{at the expense of}} a reduction in memory coalescing. Large warps enhance memory coalescing significantly but also increase branch and memory divergence. Dynamic workload behavior, including branch/memory divergence and coalescing, {{is an important factor in}} determining the <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> returning best performance. Optimal <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> can vary from one workload to another or from one program phase to the next. Based on this observation, we propose Dynamic Warp Resizing (DWR).

40|$|High single {{instruction}} multiple data (SIMD) {{efficiency and}} {{low power consumption}} have made graphic processing units (GPUs) an ideal platform for many complex computational applications. Thousands of threads can be created by programmers and grouped into fixed-size SIMD batches, known as warps. High throughput is then achieved by concurrently executing such warps with minimal control overhead. However, if a branch instruction occurs, which assigns different paths to different threads, this warp will be broken into multiple warps {{that have to be}} executed serially, consequently reducing the efficiency advantage of SIMD. In this thesis, the contemporary fixed-size warp design is abandoned and a hybrid <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> (HWS) mechanism is proposed. Mixed-size warps are generated according to HWS and are scheduled and issued flexibly. Once a branch divergence occurs, split warps are squeezed according to the proposed algorithm, and <b>warp</b> <b>sizes</b> are downscaled wherever applicable. Based on updated <b>warp</b> <b>sizes,</b> <b>warp</b> schedulers calculate the number of cycles the current warp needs and issue the next warp accordingly. As a result, hybrid warps are pushed into pipelines as soon as possible and more pipeline stages are overlapped. The simulation results show that this mechanism yields an average speedup of 1. 20 over the baseline architecture {{for a wide variety of}} general purpose GPU applications. This work also integrates HWS with dynamic warp formation (DWF), which is a well-known branch handling mechanism aimed at improving SIMD utilization by forming new warps out of split warps in real time. The warp forming policy is modified to better tolerate warp conflicts. Also, squeeze operations are added before a warp merges with other warps. The simulation shows that the combination of DWF and HWS generates an average speedup of 1. 27 over the DWF-only platform for the same set of GPU benchmarks...|$|R

Thin-walled multicell beams made of composite materials, have important applications in aerospace structures. The torsion load on these beams is caused due to distance between Centre of Pressure (CP) and Centre of Gravity (CG) of aerospace vehicle in flight. Warping {{is a result}} of torsion load and its analysis is important to predict actual behavior of multicell beams. Study of warping displacements is necessary because prevention of warping leads to stress development. Enhancement in design requires design optimization generated by parametric modeling. Problem of cross-sectional distortion can be controlled through use of rigid diaphragms equally spaced along the length of beam. The aim of present study is to establish a procedure for parametric modeling in presence of rigid regions and simulate warping effects caused by torsion on multicell beams. Quasi-isotropic composite material has been used in multicell beams.

The purpose of introducing size, which is either a starchy substance for cotton or gelatinous mixture for woollen fibre, is to reduce the chances of threads fraying and breaking due to the friction of the weaving process. The size stiffens the thread and helps the fibres lie closely together. Many recipes for size can be found in textile manufacturing books. The recipes include flour, sago, china clay, types of soap, fats and some chemicals.|$|R

Currently, {{the number of}} threads in a <b>warp</b> (<b>warp</b> <b>size)</b> is 32, which is physically executed simultaneously. Besides proper memory usage, warp conflict avoidance is essential [27]. The vendor suggests block sizes multiple of the <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> to achieve the most efficient computation. However, in extreme situations, optimal block size can differ from the advised values [28]. If some threads in the warp choose different branches of operation based on the processed data, the threads within the warp may diverge. This is called warp desynchronization and results in the serialization of some threads which adds runtime delay. As a rule of thumb, the block size should be a multiple of 32 and each multiprocessor should execute at least six warps {{at the same time}} because the pipeline is six levels deep; therefore, 8 × 32 = 256 may be an ideal thread number.|$|R

Small warps reduce the performance penalty associated with branch divergence at the expense of a reduction in memory coalescing. Large warps enhance memory coalescing significantly but also increase branch divergence.

In this work our goal is to investigate the answer to this question. We analyze <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> impact on memory coalescing and branch divergence. We use our findings to study two machines: a GPU using small warps but equipped with excellent memory coalescing (SW+) and a GPU using large warps but employing an MIMD engine immune from control-flow costs (LW+).

40|$|Most textile mills use sizes {{based on}} {{synthetic}} agents. In practice {{these products are}} not or only partly biodegradable. Therefore they should not run into municipal treatment plants. Nevertheless the market share of these sizes has been increasing continuously {{during the last few}} years. The main reason is: synthetic sizes meet best the requirements of modern weaving technology, while starch based biogradable sizes don't do this satisfactory. Therefore the aim of the research project is to develop size agents based on modified starch which are high-efficient and well biogradable and/or to modifiy synthetic sizes to improve their biogradability and elimination rate in purification processes. These new products will be tested at sizing and desizing processes under practical conditions in weaving and finishing mills. Furthermore the disposability of the resulting effluent in municipal waste water treatment respectively its degradability in aerobic biological purification processes will be examined. The new products will also be tested for their recovery in the ultrafiltration processes as well as for biodegradability in anaerobic processes. The project is being realizes by the ITV Denkendorf together with industrial partners, such as leading manufactorers of size agents and weaving and finishing mills. The Kolb and Schuele AG, Kirchheim/Teck, performed broken end analysis on their normally <b>sized</b> <b>warps.</b> The results can b e a standard of comparison for forthcoming tests of new products.

Sizing {{is an essential}} process to impart protection to warp yarns and increase weaving efficiency. Cotton yarns have traditionally been sized with starch, modified starch derivatives, CMC, poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), or a combination thereof along with quite a few other fiber binding ingredients. Although starch and starch derivatives are extensively used for sizing, there can be several limitations including less-than-satisfactory sizing performance and difficulties in desizing starch based size.
