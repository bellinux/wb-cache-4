40|$|Abstract: A simple {{device for}} {{estimating}} snow settling force on tree branches {{was used to}} determine the distribution of snow settling force at various heights in a snowy mountainous region in Japan. A trapezoidal distribution of snow settling force was found to exist at all sites tested. It is thought that a zoning scheme based on the damaging potential of snow on young man-made forests would become possible, with the acquisition of CrvDtomeria D. Don. (Japanese cedar) Fig. 1. The types of snow damage to Cryptomeria [Iwatsubo and Nitta 19871 are shown in Fig. 2. Straight stems have much higher market value than crooked stems. Therefore in field survey, the aurhors classify every cryptomeria tree to One of the largest problems in Japanese forestry lies in the low survival rate of young man-made forests in the heavy snow areas. It is rare to see a beautiful conifer plantation where snow reaches over 4 m in depth because of mechanical damage caused by large snow pressure. Both on flat locations and gentle slopes, snow settlement causes branch and stem deformation which often brings fatal breakage. To decrease such unsuccessful plantings much basic data for forest zoning are indispensable. Out of such necessity the authors have devised and set new <b>snow</b> <b>poles</b> in mountains to obtain tree-deforming factors such as maximal snow depth and snow settling force without batteries or power Supply. The data from the new <b>snow</b> <b>poles</b> explain to us how severely snow loads work on young trees...|$|E

Statistically significant non-linear relationships were found between distinct location and topographical variables and the average depth of the April snowpack at 76 <b>snow</b> <b>poles</b> from 1985 to 2000. The joint effect of the predictor variables explained more than 73 % of the variance of the dependent variable. The performance of the model was assessed by applying a number of quantitative approaches to the residuals from a cross-validation test. The relatively low estimated errors {{and the possibility of}} understanding the processes that control snow accumulation, through the response curves of each independent variable, indicate that GAMs may be a useful tool for interpolating local snow depth or other climate parameters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of the {{objectives}} of the Centre d’Etudes de la Neige (Snow Study Centre of Météo-France) is to improve the modeling of snow cover evolution and avalanche risk forecasting. A numerical simulation of snow transport, related mechanical effects and snow distribution has been developed over the last years. The objective is to incorporate the wind effects in the Météo-France operational chain Safran-Crocus-Mepra (SCM) for avalanche risk forecasting. At present, an evaluation version of the model is applied to a well instrumented site (Col du Lac Blanc 2700 m, French Alps) in order to assess its performance and to validate its applicability. At this place, in addition to automatic weather stations, several specific snowdrift sensors and a range of <b>snow</b> <b>poles,</b> a novel remote sensing technique based on land-based photography is being applied. This paper describes the current state of snowdrift modeling and the new technique of result validation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{investigation}} of the spatial variability of snow depth in high alpine areas is an impor-tant topic in snow hydrology, glacier and avalanche research and the transport of snow by wind is an important process for the distribution of snow in mountainous regions. That's why, for 25 years IRSTEA (previously Cemagref) and Météo France (Centre for the Study of Snow) have joined together in studying drifting snow at Col du Lac Blanc 2700 m a. s. l. near the Alpe d'Huez ski resort in the French Alps. Initially, the site was mainly equipped with conventional meteorological stations and a network of <b>snow</b> <b>poles,</b> {{in order to test}} numerical models of drifting snow Sytron (CEN) and NEMO (Cemagref). These models are complementary in terms of spatial and temporal scales: outputs of Sy-tron model will form the inputs of NEMO model. Then new sensors and technologies appeared which allow to develop new knowledge dealing with thresholds velocity according to morphological features of snow grains, snow flux profiles including parameters such as fall velocity and Schmidt number, his-tograms of particle widths, aerodynamic roughness, gust factors. More recently, the coupled snow-pack/atmosphere model Meso-NH/Crocus has been evaluated at the experimental site.

40|$|Extensive air showers are {{detectable}} {{by radio}} signals with a radio surface detector. A promising {{theory of the}} dominant emission process is the coherent synchrotron radiation emitted by e+ e- shower particles in the Earth's magnetic field (geosynchrotron effect). A radio air shower detector can extend IceTop, the air shower detector on top of IceCube. This could increase the sensitivity of IceTop to higher shower energies and for inclined showers significantly. Muons from air showers are {{a major part of}} the background of the neutrino telescope IceCube. Thus a surface radio air shower detector could act as a veto detector for this muonic background. Initial radio background measurements with a single antenna in 2007 revealed a continuous electromagnetic background promising a low energy threshold of radio air shower detection. However, short pulsed radio interferences can mimic real signals and have to be identified in the frequency range of interest. These properties of the electromagnetic background was being measured at the South Pole during the Antarctic winter 2009 with two different types of surface antennas. In total four antennas are placed at distances ranging up to 400 m from each other.

40|$|Mountains are {{the water}} {{towers of the}} world, {{particularly}} in Asia, where rivers all are fed from the Tibetan plateau and adjacent mountain ranges. In this area, {{referred to as the}} Third <b>Pole,</b> <b>snow</b> and glacial melt are important hydrologic processes, such that climate change is expected to seriously affect melt characteristics and related runoff. The Third Pole provides water resources to nearly two billion people in Asia. However, uncertainty about key hydrological processes at high altitudes generally precludes the assessment of the potential impact of climate change on runoff. First we review recent geodetic and direct mass balances measurement of glaciers and we compare observations to a regional scale analysis of corrected mass balance anomalies based on gravitation measurements derived from the GRACE satellite. We then assess {{the state of the art}} in modeling the impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Third Pole at different scales. Our analysis first shows the regional differentiation in the importance of snow and glacial melt water to total runoff and how this may potentially change in the future for five major Asian river basins. For this analysis we use a lumped degree day factor hydrological model that we force using remote sensing data on snow cover and precipitation and which is calibrated using observed discharge data. We then focus on a number of smaller benchmark glaciated catchments that cover all climatic zone of the Third Pole. Using a model that explicitly simulates glacier movement in combination with major hydrological processes at a high spatial resolution, we show the diversified response of glaciated catchment to climate change and test whether this response is related to the west-east gradient in climate. We conclude by formulating the future research challenges and major uncertainties related to hydrological modeling on the Third Pole...|$|R

We present a quantitative data set of in situ snow reflectance, measured and modeled albedo, and BC and trace element concentrations from clean to heavily fossil fuel emission contaminated <b>snow</b> near South <b>Pole,</b> Antarctica. Over 380 snow reflectance spectra (350 - 2500 nm) and 28 surface snow samples were collected at seven distinct sites in the austral summer season of 2014 - 2015. Snow samples were analyzed for BC concentration via a single particle soot photometer and for trace element concentration via an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Snow impurity concentrations ranged from 0. 14 to 7000 part per billion (ppb) BC, 9. 5 to 1200 ppb sulfur, 0. 19 to 660 ppb iron, 0. 013 to 1. 9 ppb chromium, 0. 13 to 120 ppb copper, 0. 63 to 6. 3 ppb zinc, 0. 45 to 82 parts per trillion (ppt) arsenic, 0. 0028 to 6. 1 ppb cadmium, 0. 062 to 22 ppb barium, and 0. 0044 to 6. 2 ppb lead. Broadband visible to shortwave infrared albedo ranged from 0. 85 in pristine snow to 0. 62 in contaminated snow. LAP radiative forcing, the enhanced surface absorption due to BC and trace elements, spanned from less than 1 W m(exp. - 2) for clean snow to approximately 70 W m(exp. - 2) for snow with high BC and trace element content.
