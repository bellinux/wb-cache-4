Newer drugs such as BIMU-8 and CX-546 may be much more effective.|$|E

The most common <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to avelumab are immune-mediated <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> (pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, adrenal insufficiency, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and nephritis) and life-threatening infusion reactions.

50|$|Hyperkalemia is {{the most}} <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> to {{potassium}}. Hyperkalemia occurs when potassium builds up faster than the kidneys can remove it. It is most common in individuals with renal failure. Symptoms of hyperkalemia may include tingling of the hands and feet, muscular weakness, and temporary paralysis. The most serious complication of hyperkalemia {{is the development of}} an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), which can lead to cardiac arrest.|$|E
5000|$|Serious adverse {{reactions}} are serious adverse events {{judged to be}} related to drug therapy. A SUSAR (suspected unexpected <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction)</b> should be reported to a drug regulatory authority under an investigational license by using the CIOMS form (or in some countries an equivalent form). [...] "Unexpected" [...] means that for an authorised (approved) medicinal product that the event is not described in the product's labeling, {{or in the case of}} an investigational (unapproved) product that the event is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure.|$|E

According to various reports, the incident involved patients who had been receiving treatment at the hospital and had been prescribed with counterfeit antihypertensive medicines. The spurious medicine(s) triggered a <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> by depositing itself in the bone marrow and ending the body's resistance. The generation of white blood cells stopped in the body. Among the symptoms of the disease were a severe chest infection, change in skin colour/pigmentation, low platelet count and blood vomiting.|$|E
5000|$|One {{publication}} summarises {{the most}} important points about amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) as follows: [...] "The most <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> of amiodarone is pulmonary toxicity (AIPT). AIPT may manifest as chronic interstitial pneumonitis, organising pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary mass, or nodules. On radiological imaging, pulmonary infiltrates induced by amiodarone are usually high in attenuation. On biopsy, the presence of foamy macrophages confirms exposure to amiodarone but not necessarily proves that amiodarone is the responsible cause. Most patients with AIPT respond well to the withdrawal of amiodarone and to the addition of corticosteroid treatment, which is usually given for two to six months." ...|$|E
50|$|Clofazimine {{is given}} to treat sulfone-resistant leprosy or to {{patients}} who are intolerant to sulfones. It also exerts an antiinflammatory effect and prevents erythema nodosum leprosum, which can interrupt treatment with dapsone. This is a major advantage of clofazimine over other antileprosy drugs. Ulcerative lesions caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans respond well to clofazimine. It also has some activity against M. tuberculosis {{and can be used}} as last resort therapy for the treatment of MDR tuberculosis. The most disturbing adverse reaction to clofazimine is a red-brown discoloration of the skin, especially inlight-skinned persons. A rare but <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> is acute abdominal pain significant enough to warrant exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy. Other infrequent side effects include splenic infarction, bowel obstruction, paralytic ileus, and upper GI bleeding.|$|E

5000|$|This {{refers to}} ICSRs (individual case safety reports) that involve {{a serious and}} {{unlisted}} event (an event not described in the drug's labeling) that is considered related {{to the use of}} the drug. (Spontaneous reports are typically considered to have a positive causality, whereas a clinical trial case will typically be assessed for causality by the clinical trial investigator and/or the license holder.) In most countries, the timeframe for reporting expedited cases is 7/15 calendar days from the time a drug company receives notification (referred to as [...] "Day 0") of such a case. Within clinical trials such a case is referred to as a SUSAR (a Suspected Unexpected <b>Serious</b> <b>Adverse</b> <b>Reaction).</b> If the SUSAR involves an event that is life-threatening or fatal, it may be subject to a 7-day [...] "clock". Cases that do not involve a serious, unlisted event may be subject to non-expedited or periodic reporting.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the risk of}} <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to benzathine penicillin in pregnant women for preventing congenital syphilis. Methods: We searched for clinical trials or cohorts that assessed the incidence of <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to benzathine penicillin in pregnant women and the general population (indirect evidence). MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and other databases were searched up to December 2012. The GRADE approach {{was used to assess}} quality of evidence. Absolute risks of each study were calculated along with their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). We employed the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model in the meta-analyses. Results: From 2, 765 retrieved studies we included 13, representing 3, 466, 780 patients. The studies that included pregnant women were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of benzathine penicillin: no <b>serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> were reported among the 1, 244 pregnant women included. In the general population, among 2, 028, 982 patients treated, 4 died from an <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction.</b> The pooled risk of death was virtually zero. Fifty-four cases of anaphylaxis were reported (pooled absolute risk = 0. 002 %; 95 % CI: 0 %– 0. 003 % I 2 = 12 %). From that estimate, penicillin treatment would be expected to result in an incidence of 0 to 3 cases of anaphylaxis per 100, 000 treated. Any <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> were reported in 6, 377 patients among 3, 465, 322 treated with penicillin (pooled absolute risk = 0. 169 %; 95 % CI: 0. 073 %– 0. 265 % I 2 = 97 %).
