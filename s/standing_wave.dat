5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., <b>standing</b> <b>wave)</b> patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E
5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting {{in the growth of}} a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E
40|$|In oscillatory reaction-diffusion systems, {{time-delay}} feedback {{can lead}} to the instability of uniform oscillations with respect to formation of <b>standing</b> <b>waves.</b> Here, we investigate how the presence of additive, Gaussian white noise can induce the appearance of <b>standing</b> <b>waves.</b> Combining analytical solutions of the model with spatio-temporal simulations, we find that noise can promote <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> in regimes where the deterministic uniform oscillatory modes are stabilized. As the deterministic phase boundary is approached, the spatio-temporal correlations become stronger, such that even small noise can induce <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> in this parameter regime. With larger noise strengths, <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> could be induced at finite distances from the (deterministic) phase boundary. The overall dynamics is defined through the interplay of noisy forcing with the inherent reaction-diffusion dynamics. Comment: 8 two-columned pages, 5 figures; Published in PRE; URL: [URL]...|$|R
50|$|<b>Standing</b> <b>waves</b> {{are also}} {{observed}} in optical media such as optical wave guides, optical cavities, etc. Lasers use optical cavities {{in the form}} of a pair of facing mirrors. The gain medium in the cavity (such as a crystal) emits light coherently, exciting <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> of light in the cavity. The wavelength of light is very short (in the range of nanometers, 10−9 m) so the <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> are microscopic in size. One use for <b>standing</b> light <b>waves</b> is to measure small distances, using optical flats.|$|R

5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a <b>standing</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E

However, in this paper, {{the study of}} the stability of <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> relies heavily on the scale invariance for (1.2). Thus, adding an L^ 2 -subcritical perturbation to (1.2), which destroys the scale invariance, is of particular interest. In addition, the study of orbitally stable <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> for nonlinear Schrödinger equations is in the L^ 2 -subcritical case; see [16 – 21]. In the L^ 2 -critical case, the solution of (1.1) may blow up; see [1, 14, 22, 23]. It yields that the <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> may be unstable.

50|$|The {{interference}} {{phenomenon in}} optics occurs {{as a result}} of the wave propagation of light.

40|$|Abstract—Low-frequency {{transcranial}} ultrasound (< 1 MHz) {{is being}} investigated {{for a number of}} brain therapies, including stroke, tumor ab-lation, and localized opening of the blood–brain barrier. However, lower frequencies have been associated with the production of undesired <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> and cavitation in the brain. Presently, we examine an approach to suppress <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> during continuous-wave (CW) transcranial ap-plication. The investigation uses a small randomization in the frequency content of the signal for suppressing <b>standing</b> <b>waves.</b> The approach is stud-ied in an ex-vivo human skull and a plastic-walled chamber, representing idealized conditions. The approach is compared to single-frequency CW operation as well as to a swept-frequency input. Acoustic field scans demon-strate that the swept-frequency method can suppress <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> in the plastic chamber and skull by 3. 4 and 1. 6 times, respectively, compared to single-frequency CW excitation. With random modulation, <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> were reduced by 5. 6 and 2 times, respectively, in the plastic chamber and skull.

25|$|Another hazard is the {{resonance}} of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave is run without an object {{to absorb the}} radiation, a <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> will form.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. In the present paper, a new {{physically}} explicit theory of tyre <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> has been developed.
