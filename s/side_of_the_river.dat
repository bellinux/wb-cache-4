5|$|That evening Kouma led {{the patrol}} of two M26 Pershing tanks and two M19 Gun Motor Carriages in Agok, along the Naktong River. Kouma placed his patrol {{on the west}} side of Agok near the Kihang ferry. At 20:00 a heavy fog covered the river, and at 22:00 mortar shells began falling on the American-held <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> By 22:15 this strike {{intensified}} and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company's positions. American mortars and artillery began firing counter-battery. Some of A Company's men reported hearing noises on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> and splashes in the water.|$|E

5|$|Guglielmo Marconi, the {{inventor}} of wireless telegraphy, successfully transmitted radio signals across the Bristol Channel {{in the spring of}} 1897, from Penarth (near Cardiff) to Brean Down (just south west of Weston, on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Axe).|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> Ducharme's attack on Cahokia was easily repulsed. George Rogers Clark made a timely arrival to lead Cahokia's defense. Clark's {{reputation}} as a frontier fighter made the Indian force reluctant to pursue the attack.|$|E

5|$|Some of the emigrants {{established}} a settlement called Kanesville on the Iowa <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Others {{moved across the}} river into the area of present-day Omaha, Nebraska, and built a camp called Winter Quarters.|$|E
5|$|Beginning August 5, these {{divisions}} initiated numerous crossing {{attempts to}} assault the UN {{forces on the}} other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> {{in an attempt to}} capture Taegu and collapse the final UN defensive line. The U.S. forces were successful in repelling North Korean advances thanks to training and support, but forces in the South Korean sectors were not as successful. During this time, isolated reports and rumors of war crimes committed by both sides began to surface.|$|E
5|$|Cambridge won {{the coin}} toss and chose {{to start from}} the {{southern}} side, the Surrey <b>side,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Thames, based on the opinion that taking a lead early in the race would give them an advantage. However, the theory failed as Oxford stayed with Cambridge, and though Cambridge had a large push which gave them a slender lead after two minutes, Oxford were leading at the First Mile post, passing in 3 minutes 41 seconds, Cambridge a second behind.|$|E

5|$|Colonel William E. Peters {{was able}} to get his 21st Virginia Cavalry Regiment ready for the {{oncoming}} Union cavalry, but was driven back across the river. Earlier, Peters had refused to burn Chambersburg and General McCausland had him arrested. However, the arrest was revoked a short time later, and Peters led the rear guard when they left the burning town. He performed relatively well at Moorefield, leading portions of his regiment while they slowed the Federal advance on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Robert Kett led an {{uprising}} in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made {{across the river}} into the Hospital meadows, {{in an attempt to}} take Bishop Bridge, which would have given them access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which he turned on the Cow Tower, damaging the latter's parapets. The rebellion failed, and the tower {{does not seem to have}} required extensive repairs.|$|E
5|$|Lightburn {{responded to}} the threat by {{splitting}} his army into two brigades plus a few small posts. One brigade, commanded by Colonel Edward Siber, was positioned {{on the south side}} of the Kanawha River (between the river and Loring). The other brigade, commanded by Colonel Samuel A. Gilbert, was positioned on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Lightburn also sent six companies of the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry in pursuit of Jenkins's cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Longyearbyen {{is divided}} into several neighbourhoods. On the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> along the bay, lies the port and {{affiliated}} utility and industrial services. The western part of this area is called Bykaia and the eastern part Sjøområdet. Above lies Skjæringa, {{the site of the}} Governor's offices. Slightly up the valley on the west side lies Gamle Longyearbyen ("Old Longyearbyen") and the church. Even further up lies the graveyard, then Huset and the cinema, and finally Sverdrupbyen. Most of the residential, commercial and cultural institutions are located on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Along the bay the area is called Sjøskrenten. Further up lies the university centre and Gruvedalen, the largest residential area. Southwards from there is the main shopping area as well as the town hall. To the east is the residential area Lia and further up Haugen, which is also the location of the school. Furthest up in the valley is Mine 2b and Nybyen, which is mostly used as student housing. Westwards out of town towards Hotellneset is the airport and Mine 3. The remaining mines are located in Adventdalen, to the east of town.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} {{travellers}} were pilgrims. North-west of Banagher, on the Connacht <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> was the monastic establishment of Clonfert, with the more famous Clonmacnoise a short distance further north. Not far to the south-west {{on the same side}} was another monastic foundation, at Meelick. At Meelick, the three provinces, Leinster, Munster and Connacht meet and just south of Banagher in the direction of Birr, the four dioceses of Clonmacnoise, Meath, Killaloe and Clonfert meet.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1917, 114 {{officers}} and 1156 {{men of the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC) Armament School moved into Hillingdon House, with the RFC making a donation of £2289 12s 9d to the Canadian Red Cross. Needing a site for the training of recruits in ground gunnery, the RFC used parts of the estate not required by the Canadian hospital and established a firing range on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> from the house.|$|E

50|$|Neal, West Virginia {{is located}} on U.S. Route 52 just across <b>the</b> Big Sandy <b>River</b> from Neal, Kentucky. This is no {{coincidence}} as both communities were once the same and were named after the same family who owned property on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Prior to Kentucky becoming a state, {{it was part of}} Virginia making both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> in <b>the</b> same state. Also, before <b>the</b> canalizing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> was completed in the late 19th century, unless the water was high, it was possible to walk across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> making both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> accessible to persons living on either bank. Neal, West Virginia is also now a location of heavy industry and very little remains of it as well.|$|R
5000|$|The {{area was}} first settled around 1806 by <b>the</b> {{erection}} <b>of</b> a mill on <b>the</b> south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black <b>River.</b> Black River was previously called [...] "Lockport", and grew to include both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> {{as well as}} two small river islands.|$|R
5|$|On the {{opposite}} bank of the Mississippi, a second simultaneous attack on the nearby former British colonial outpost of Cahokia, occupied by Patriot Virginians, was also repulsed. The retreating Indians destroyed the crops and took captive civilians outside the protected area. The British failed to defend their <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> and, thus, effectively ended any attempts {{to gain control of}} the Mississippi River during the war.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury {{is home to}} Shrewsbury School, {{a public}} school, on a large site ("Kingsland") {{just south of the}} town centre {{overlooking}} the loop of the Severn. The school was once in the town centre, in the buildings that are now the main county library on Castle Street. Opposite it on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> is Shrewsbury High School, an independent girls' day school.|$|E
5|$|The {{city and}} {{government}} {{decided to change}} the type of development allowed near the river. The floodplain bordering the Red River was converted into a large park known as the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. This provided new recreation space for city residents, as well as space for future floodwaters to be absorbed naturally by trees and other plants, without damage to infrastructure. East Grand Forks developed a related greenway park on its <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> as it has also suffered extensive flooding that year.|$|E
