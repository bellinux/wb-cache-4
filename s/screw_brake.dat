50|$|The {{customary}} {{train consist}} was two coaches, the piston carriage, {{which included a}} guard's compartment and third class accommodation, and a first class carriage, with end observation windows at the rear. The guard had a <b>screw</b> <b>brake,</b> but no other control. Returning (descending) was done under gravity, and the guard had a lever which enabled him to swing the piston assembly to one side, so that the descent was made with the piston outside the tube.|$|E
50|$|John Baker's Mill is a four storey flint {{and stone}} tower mill with a stage at first floor level. When built, it had two Ccmmon sails and two spring sails.

50|$|As built, West Blatchington Windmill is a three-storey smock mill on a three-storey brick base, with a {{stage at}} third-floor level. In 1825 she had four Common sails but latterly was worked with four Patent sails. These were {{carried on a}} {{cast-iron}} Windshaft, mounted on a cross, similar to the Lincolnshire practice. The mill is fitted with Holloway's <b>screw</b> <b>brake.</b> The cap is in the Kentish style, winded by a fantail. The mill drove two pairs of underdrift millstones. The mill stood at the junction of three barns, {{one of the original}} barns remains standing today, and one of the others was replaced with a new build barn in 1997. Most of the machinery was removed in 1937, leaving the Brake Wheel and Upright Shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Each Toad {{had a large}} guards compartment/cabin {{extending}} {{about two-thirds}} of the length of the van, with the remaining [...] "veranda" [...] open on three sides, but covered with a roof. Full length external footboards and hand rails allowed the guard or a shunter to ride on the outside during shunting movements. On the veranda, in addition to the <b>screw</b> <b>brake</b> handle, sand boxes were fitted to the rear to allow the guard to sand the rails if necessary, to stop the wheels slipping. A full height door allowed access from the veranda to the cabin, matched by a door on the far end of cabin in most versions. Whilst all versions had side entrances on both sides onto the veranda, some version included additional full height side doors into the cabin. Inside the cabin were: tool boxes; cupboards; a light and other electrical systems powered by an axle mounted dynamo; a seat; a combined table/desk, often two, with one collapsible; and a stove powered by wood or coal collected from the lineside. Another two sandboxes were also fitted inside the 'closed' end of the van. These were operated by a linkage from the veranda when the van was travelling with the veranda trailing. The guard was first aid trained, and so the cabin contained the train's main first aid kit. Like the roof, the inside of the cabin was painted white for safety reasons, derived from the practice of the time in hospitals. Windows in both ends of the cabin allowed the guard to see out and keep an eye on his train, but actual operations were only possible from the open veranda, which made this a cold and weather-beaten job all year round.|$|E
50|$|The new {{artillery}} pieces {{consisted of}} a core tube and mantlet with a mechanism retainer, 28 rifles, Nordenfelt eccentric <b>screw</b> and hydraulic <b>brakes</b> with a spring system for returning the tube to position.

With {{the arrival of the}} new DP railmotors and the V class 0-6-0DM diesel shunters (mechanically similar to the DS class), these locomotives were progressively withdrawn from 1951 when DS 2 was withdrawn. The last, DS 7, was withdrawn from TGR service in 1958.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{passenger}} service {{consisted of}} two trains per day each way between Midland Junction (Lorneville) and Toronto; one of these trains extended to Coboconk; {{there was only one}} return trip each day from Sutton to Stouffville. The small narrow-gauge engines were able to cope with normal winter weather, but there was no money for snow clearing after severe storms and Gooderham and Worts sometimes paid for this work in order to maintain their distillery fuel supplies. Sometimes it took a month to clear the line with manual labour. There were few public accidents, but a severe toll of industrial fatalities to the operating staff. The most dangerous job was Brakesman, with many young men being crippled or killed when walking along the tops of vehicles to manually <b>screw</b> down <b>brakes,</b> and when manually coupling cars using the highly dangerous link and pin couplers. The worst accident occurred when the boiler of the Fairlie engine Shedden (see illustration above) exploded at Stouffville on January 31, 1874 due to the safety valves being tied down to increase haulage power, killing three enginemen.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} rail vehicles, {{such as the}} "Adler", a {{mechanical}} <b>screw</b> <b>brake</b> on the tender was enough in 1835 to slow the train down safely from its permitted speed of 28 km/h.

50|$|The Arai {{drum brake}} is used during long {{downhill}} descents where a rim brake might overheat the tire and possibly {{cause it to}} fail. The drum of the <b>brake</b> <b>screws</b> onto {{the left side of}} the tandem hub, which must be threaded for the drum. The shoe plate slips over the axle and a small reaction arm from the shoe plate engages with the bicycle frame to prevent the plate from turning. The drum brake is typically controlled by a friction shift lever like a BARCON or similar. The brake is designed to be engaged continuously during a descent to maintain a steady speed. The standard brakes can be used in addition as necessary.|$|R

25|$|The typical {{passenger}} service {{consisted of}} two trains per day each way between Owen Sound and Toronto; {{there was only one}} return trip each day from Teeswater to Orangeville. Orangeville had three trains a day to and from Toronto. Freight traffic over the Caledon Hills and the heights near Dundalk required powerful 4-6-0 and 2-8-0 locomotives, which seem to have handled the traffic comfortably, although trains often had to be divided between Mono Road and Charleston (Caledon). The small narrow-gauge engines were able to cope with normal winter weather, but there were major blockages of the line in the 'snowbelt' country above Orangeville, which sometimes closed the line for several weeks. The TG was sometimes unable, for many months, to pay the overtime wages for manually clearing these drifts. There were few public accidents, but a severe toll of industrial fatalities to the operating staff. The most dangerous job was Brakesman, with many young men being crippled or killed when walking along the tops of vehicles to manually <b>screw</b> down <b>brakes,</b> and when manually coupling cars using the highly dangerous link-and-pin couplers. The worst incident on the TG occurred at Arthur when a passenger was killed, by shots fired at a train crew, by drunken members of the Orange Order on July 12 1872.|$|R
50|$|Schauberger {{developed}} {{his own ideas}} {{based on what he}} observed in nature. In Implosion magazine, a magazine released by Schauberger's family, he said that aeronautical and marine engineers had incorrectly designed the propeller. He stated:As best demonstrated by Nature {{in the case of the}} aerofoil maple-seed, today’s propeller is a pressure-screw and therefore a <b>braking</b> <b>screw,</b> whose purpose is to allow the heavy maple-seed to fall parachute-like slowly towards the ground and to be carried away sideways by the wind in the process. No bird has such a whirling thing on its head, nor a fish on its tail. Only man made use of this natural brake-screw for forward propulsion. As the propeller rotates, so does the resistance rise by the square of the rotational velocity. This is also a sign that this supposed propulsive device is unnaturally constructed and therefore out of place.|$|R
5000|$|Behind {{the gearbox}} {{there was a}} [...] "locomotive" [...] {{transmission}} brake operated by a hand lever on the off-side of the gear lever. The brake's shoes were to some extent self-adjusting but might be regulated by two hand <b>screws.</b> [...] "This <b>brake</b> {{is intended to be}} more than just a parking brake". The four wheels had brakes operated by rods from the brake pedal. Compensation was made so that balance was preserved in the back and front sets of brakes. The application was partly taken by rods but finally by cables. The brake drums were enclosed and have outlets for water or oil. The front braking mechanism was simple, there was only one arm which had anchorage above the pivot pin and did not turn with the wheel. The cams were {{at the bottom of the}} drums and the steering pins were hollowed to allow the necessary expanding control.|$|R

[...] .007 pushed out gingerly, his heart in his headlight, so nervous that the clang of his own bell almost made him jump the track. Lanterns waved, or danced up and down, before and behind him; and on every side, six tracks deep, sliding backward and forward, with clashings of couplers and squeals of hand-brakes, were cars--more cars than [...] .007 had dreamed of. There were oil-cars, and hay-cars, and stock-cars full of lowing beasts, and ore-cars, and potato-cars with stovepipe-ends sticking out in the middle; cold-storage and refrigerator cars dripping ice water on the tracks; ventilated fruit--and milk-cars; flatcars with truck-wagons full of market-stuff; flat-cars loaded with reapers and binders, all red and green and gilt under the sizzling electric lights; flat-cars piled high with strong-scented hides, pleasant hemlock-plank, or bundles of shingles; flat-cars creaking to the weight of thirty-ton castings, angle-irons, and rivet-boxes for some new bridge; and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of box-cars loaded, locked, and chalked. Men--hot and angry--crawled among and between and under the thousand wheels; men took flying jumps through his cab, when he halted for a moment; men sat on his pilot as he went forward, and on his tender as he returned; and regiments of men ran along the tops of the box-cars beside him, <b>screwing</b> down <b>brakes,</b> waving their arms, and crying curious things.|$|R

Nor would any tramway company in the Real East have run its cars to catch a train that used to start last year, but now--rest its soul--is as dead as Queen Anne. This thing a queer little seven-mile tramway {{accomplished}} with much dignity. It owned a first-class car and a second-class car,--two horses to each,--and it ran them with a hundred yards headway--the one all but empty, {{and the other half}} full. When the very small driver could not control his horses, which happened on the average once every two minutes, he did not waste time by pulling them in. He <b>screwed</b> down the <b>brake</b> and laughed--possibly at the company who had paid for the very elaborate car. Yet he was an artistic driver. He wore no Philistine brass badge. Between the shoulders of his blue jerkin were done in white, three railheads in a circle, and on the skirts as many tram-wheels conventionalised. Only the Japanese know how to conventionalise a tram-wheel or make a key-pattern of railheads. Though we took twelve hours to cover the thirty miles that separated us from Yokohama, we admitted this much while we waited for our train in a village by the sea. A village of any size is about three miles long in the main street. Villages with a population of more than ten thousand souls take rank as towns.|$|R
40|$|The {{rigidity}} and firmness {{of wooden}} construction and furniture those {{are joined by}} metal screws depend on corrosion rate of these metals. This paper examines the weight-loss percentage of metal screws used in wood samples that have been treated with water-borne preser vative (i. e. 3 % borax boric acid and 3 % diffusol CB) and concurrently investigates the effect of brake fluid on preventing metal corrosion. Wood samples tested included three acacia and one eucalypts wood species which were grouped into sapwood and heartwood containing samples. Wood samples fastened with metal screws were freely suspended in glass jars that contained 25 ml of sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) to keep the humidity rate above 90 %. After 12 months, the metal screws lost their weight due to the corrosion {{brought about by the}} related factors either in separate individual or in combination, which comprised brake and fluid-dipping, wood species, wood portion (sapwood and heartwood), kinds of preser vatives used. Corrosion rates of metal screws fastened in eucalypts wood sample as indicated by the screw-weight loss (i. e. 5. 8 %) was more severe than that fastened in acacia wood. Furthermore, corrosion rate of metal screws as fixed firmly in sapwood sample proceeded faster than that in heartwood. This might be caused by the higher moisture content in sapwood. On the other hand, corrosion rate of the screws as fastened in waterborne-preser vative-treated wood samples was greater than that in non-preser ved wood due to electrokinetic characteristics and ionic potential exhibited by the preser vative thereby intensif ying the screw-corrosion process. Meanwhile, less severe corrosion was obser ved and recorded on the <b>screws</b> pre-dipped in <b>brake</b> fluid compared to those on the non-dipped screw...|$|R
