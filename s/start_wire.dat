40|$|A report revisits {{the subject}} matter of "High-Temperature Coils for Electromagnets" (LEW- 17164), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 26, No. 8, (August 2002) page 38. To recapitulate: Wires have been {{developed}} for use in electromagnets that operate at high temperatures. The starting material for a wire of this type can be either a nickel-clad, ceramic-insulated copper wire or a bare silver wire. The wire is covered by electrical-insulation material that is intended to withstand operating temperatures in the range from 800 to 1, 300 F (. 430 to. 700 C) : The <b>starting</b> <b>wire</b> is either primarily wrapped with S-glass as an insulating material or else covered with another insulating material wrapped in S-glass prior to the winding process. A ceramic binding agent is applied as a slurry during the winding process to provide further insulating capability. The turns are pre-bent during winding to prevent damage to the insulation. The coil is then heated to convert the binder into ceramic. The instant report mostly reiterates the prior information and presents some additional information on the application of the ceramic binding agent and the incorporation of high-temperature wire into the windings...|$|R

25|$|Only anecdotal {{reports of}} {{displaced}} fractures set by internal fixation predate Joseph Lister's 1865 introduction of antiseptic surgery, whereupon Lister reported silver wire on a displaced petellar fracture. Even before radiography, Lane found that conventional setting by manipulation and splints yielded poor outcomes—bone disunion and joint changes or wear in individuals under much physical activity—and Lane <b>started</b> with <b>wires</b> and screws in 1892. The conservative medical community was vehemently opposed, so revolutionary was Lane's approach that organizations certifying surgeons sometimes automatically dismissed students able {{to elaborate on}} such procedures, as nearly 50% of patients whose closed fractures were opened died by ensuing infections. Yet with aseptic surgical techniques previously unheard of, Lane forged ahead.|$|R
50|$|The {{system has}} given early warning of many {{boulders}} on the track, but two derailments have occurred where boulders evaded the screen: on 8 August 1946, when the fall occurred {{just as the}} train approached, too late for signals to give a warning, and 6 June 2010, when the fall <b>started</b> below the <b>wires.</b> There was an earlier derailment in 1881 before the screen was installed, when a falling boulder hit a train.|$|R
50|$|In {{combination}} {{with a series}} connection, T-segments are often produced as a phase compound {{in the form of}} a toothed chain. As is the case of single T-segments, the linear-winding technique as well as the flyer-winding technique are also applied in this context. When it comes to the winding of the teeth, the final wire of the first tooth is guided to the next tooth and then serves as the <b>starting</b> <b>wire</b> for the second tooth. This process continues, depending on the number of a phase's sub-segments. The design of the components does not show any substantial difference compared to the one of classic single teeth. The main reason for the processing of T-segments into one tooth chain lies in the reduced of number of contact points. Six contact points are required for three wound single tooth poles. However, only two contact points are needed if the just mentioned arrangement inside the winding machine is adopted. When using high current with low operating power, this type of manufacture is especially beneficial since it reduces contact resistances and potential errors. However, it is a very complex endeavor to form the tooth chains to a complete stator which is of disadvantage. It must be ensured, for example, that the end wires of each tooth are equipped with tension relief to ensure that the winding does not open during handling. Usually, it is taken care of with adhesive tape or pole or bag-type forming of the tooth's frontal insulation where the wire may be attached after the winding process. Single teeth are easy to handle, whereas tooth chains must be built in carefully, taking into account the risk of damaging the connecting wires.|$|R
50|$|In December 2016, Wire's whitepapers were {{reviewed}} by a security {{researcher at the}} University of Waterloo. The researcher praised Wire for its open approach to security, but identified serious issues that still need addressing. These included a man-in-the-middle attack on voice and video communications, possible audio and video leakage depending on unspecified codec parameters, {{the fact that all}} user passwords are uploaded to Wire's servers, significant attack surface for code replacement in the desktop client, {{and the fact that the}} server is not open sourced. The researcher described the security of Wire as weak in comparison to Signal, but also depicted its problems as surmountable. Wire's developers announced the addition of end-to-end authentication to Wire's calls on 14 March 2017, and <b>started</b> open-sourcing <b>Wire's</b> server code on 7 April 2017.|$|R
