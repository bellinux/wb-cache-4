As {{a component of}} an overall investigation of sound velocity variations, a temperature microstructure study of Monterey Bay was conducted on September 11, 1978. Repeated temperature microstructure profiles were measured every hour during a 6 hour period using a specially designed profiler; simultaneously, surface forcing functions were recorded. A <b>significant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> was evident and remained significant during the entire period of data collection. The inversion allowed investigation of {{the early stages of}} water mass convergence and the subsequent refinements of the initial large scale interleavings. Kelvin-He lmholtz phenomena and double diffusivity activity are suspected in many of the events observed during the 6 hour period. Spectra of both the gradients of the temperature as well as the perturbations on the mean profile were calculated. It was determined that the microstructure spectrum indicates an increase in density at frequencies greater than 1 cycle per meter. Cox numbers were calculated but are considered to be of marginal value since these data cover a portion of the ocean that consists of sharp gradients. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
50|$|<b>Significant</b> mid-winter <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> {{often occur}} in the Salt Lake Valley. These inversions, which often last for days and weeks, are most {{pronounced}} in mid-winter, although milder inversions sometimes occur during other seasons. Winter <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> cause cold, foggy and hazy valley conditions, with sunny and somewhat warmer conditions prevailing in the surrounding mountains. <b>Temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> trap valley air pollutants, which often rise to unhealthy levels. Humidity is only high enough and temperatures cold enough for fog to occur during mid-winter, although haze and smog can be found year-round. Inversions occur when strong areas of high pressure remain parked over the Great Basin. It usually takes a cold front to force out or break down the high pressure. Consequently, inversions are rare in spring and fall, when the weather takes on a more progressive pattern, with frequent fronts moving through. Such recurring and persistent patterns of inversions follow a unique timescale of about 30 days, providing a means for long-range weather prediction. Such prediction of persistent inversion up to 30 days has been made operational.|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{images and}} in situ {{hydrography}} and nutrient observations {{are used to}} study the three-dimensional structure of a penetrating front off the Changjiang mouth in the East China Sea. The satellite images of MODIS/Terra on October 16, 2006 show anomalously high concentrations of chlorophyll and total suspended sediments extending offshore from the mean coastal front off the Chiangjiang mouth. However, the sea-surface temperature image of the same satellite shows no signature of this extension at all. The in situ hydrography measured {{during the same time}} as the satellite images discloses that the surface layer of the front is occupied by low-salinity waters from the nearshore area, which suggests a cross-shelf jet covering a distance of about 50 km. A counter intrusion underneath the surface offshore jet is indicated by an increase of the subsurface temperature and salinity during the offshore excursion of the front, which leads to a <b>significant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> at the head of the front. The vertical temperature and salinity distribution shows propensity of double diffusive processes, which may contribute to the ensuing evolution of the front. The nutrient distribution of the front is consistent with the cross-shelf jet derived from the hydrographic data, with surface and bottom intensified concentrations and minimum mid-depth concentrations, suggesting that the primary transport of the surface nutrients is in the horizontal cross-shelf direction. The potential dynamics of the frontal intrusion is discussed in light of wind forcing and frontal instability. The intrusion is found to be very important to cross-shelf and cross-front exchanges in the East China Sea. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In the first part, the concept of the ABL is defined and main theoretical aspects of air stratification are explored. The main part of the background research summarizes current knowledge of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions,</b> especially how the landscape pattern influences their development and parameters under different synoptic situations, and methods used for their detection, measurement and evaluation.

The focus of actions is placed on inversions analysis based upon time series of Praha-Libuš rawinsonde station. Homogeneity of used data is tested and all inversions within the 2000 - meters-thick-layer close to the ground are derived. Diurnal, annual and interannual frequency variations are described.

40|$|Increase of {{temperature}} with height in the troposphere is called <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion.</b> Parameters such as strength and depth are characteristics of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion.</b> Inversion strength {{is defined as}} the temperature difference between the surface and the top of the inversion and the depth of inversion {{is defined as the}} height of the inversion from the surface. The common approach in determination of these parameters is the use of Radiosonde where these measurements are too sparse. The main objective of this study is detection and modeling the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> using MODIS thermal infrared data. There are more than 180 days per year in which the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> conditions are present in Kermanshah city. Kermanshah weather station was selected as the study area. 90 inversion days was selected from 2007 to 2008 where the sky was clear and the Radiosonde data were available. Brightness temperature for all thermal infrared bands of MODIS was calculated for these days. Brightness temperature difference between any of the thermal infrared bands of MODIS and band 31 was found to be sensitive to strength and depth of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion.</b> Then correlation coefficients between these pairs and the inversion depth and strength both calculated from Radiosonde were evaluated. The results showed poor linear correlation. This was found to be due to the change of the atmospheric water vapor content and the relatively weak <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> strength and depth occurring in Kermanshah. The polynomial mathematical models and Artificial intelligence algorithms were deployed for detection and modeling the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion.</b> A model with the lowest terms and highest possible accuracy was obtained. The Model was tested using 20 independent test data. Results indicate that the inversion strength can be estimated with RMSE of 0. 84 ° C and R 2 of 0. 90.

Five micrometeorological towers were located along an east-west cross section {{through the center of}} the crater.

When the regional scale flows exceeded approximately 5 m/s, the basin atmosphere became fully coupled with the atmosphere above and little or no <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> formed inside the crater.

The analysis is focused on both historical series and future projections under climate change.

A new method to detect layers of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> is also presented. The developed method computes the occurrence of a <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> layer for a given day at 12 UTC without a detailed knowledge of temperature vertical profile. This method was validated using sounding data and applied to the model projections, under two different emissions scenarios (RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5). Under RCP 4. 5 intermediate emissions scenario, the occurrence of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> is projected to increase by 12  days/year (around +  10 %) {{in the last decade}} of 21 st century compared to 1986 – 2005 average.

40|$|ABSTRACT] In the Nobi Plain, {{temperature}} profiles {{were measured}} in 41 observation wells in 1993 and 1994. There are many <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> in the vertical temperature profiles of recharge area.

Simulated results show that subsurface <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> are formed in recharge area at depth between 50 m- 130 m below sea level, because subsurface temperature has been cooled with the advective heat transfer by the downward groundwater flow from the surface.

Wyniki zostały przedstawione w odniesieniu do dwóch charakterystyk warstw inwersyjnych – częstości i natężenia. Związek występowania inwersji termicznych z sytuacją synoptyczną określono za pomocą częstości i prawdopodobieństwa warunkowego wystąpienia dni z inwersją temperatury powietrza w poszczególnych typach cyrkulacji atmosfery. Przeprowadzona analiza wskazuje na występpowanie istotnego statystycznie dodatniego trendu zmian liczby dni z inwersją temperatury powietrza między poziomami 1000 hPa i 925 hPa oraz dodatnich trendów średniego rocznego natężenia zjawiska w warstwach 1000  –  925 hPa, 1000  –  850 hPa i 925  –  850 hPa.
