5|$|The <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> {{belongs to}} the order Cetartiodactyla, the order {{containing}} all cetaceans and even-toed ungulates. It {{is a member of}} the unranked clade Cetacea, with all the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, and further classified into Odontoceti, containing all the toothed whales and dolphins. It is the sole extant species of its genus, Physeter, in the family Physeteridae. Two species of the related extant genus Kogia, the pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> Kogia breviceps and the dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> K. simus, are placed either in this family or in the family Kogiidae. In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea (see the separate entry on the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> family).|$|E
5|$|Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick {{is based}} on a true story about a <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> that {{attacked}} and sank the whaleship Essex. Melville associated the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> with the Bible's Leviathan. The fearsome reputation perpetuated by Melville was based on bull whales' ability to fiercely defend themselves from attacks by early whalers, occasionally resulting in the destruction of the whaling ships.|$|E
5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} not the easiest of whales to watch, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long {{distances}} underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale, watching is increasingly popular. <b>Sperm</b> <b>whale</b> watchers often use hydrophones {{to listen to the}} clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> watching include the town of Kaikoura on New Zealand's South Island, Andenes and Tromsø in Arctic Norway; as well as the Azores, where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore, and Dominica where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale</b> Project, has been in operation since 2005.|$|E
40|$|Stomach {{contents}} {{were analyzed}} of six pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> (Kogia breviceps) and five dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> (Kogia sima) which were taken as by-catch or were stranded specimens in coast al Taiwan from 1998 through 2000. Twenty-t wo species in 12 families of oceanic cephalopods were identified. In pygmy sp erm whales, Enoploteuthis chunii, Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis, and Taonius pavo {{were the primary}} prey in the diet, while E. chunii, Histioteuthis miranda, and T. pavo {{were the most important}} prey items ingested by dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> Although the primary p rey items these two species ingested were very similar, each item comprised a different proportion for each whale species. A similarity test demonstrated a significant difference in prey composition, and SIMPER analysis showed that E. chunii was ranked first and contributed 37. 1 % to the average dissimilarity between pygmy and dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> Pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> fed on much larger T. pavo compared to those ingested by dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> while dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> ingested more H. miranda than did pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> These results support the view that pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> live seaward of the continental shelf and that dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> live more in coastal waters.

500|$|... <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> eyes afford good {{vision and}} {{sensitivity}} to light. They conjectured that <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> use vision to hunt squid, either by detecting silhouettes from below or by detecting bioluminescence. If <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> detect silhouettes, Fristrup and Harbison suggested that they hunt upside down, allowing them to use the forward parts of the ventral visual fields for binocular vision.|$|R
500|$|The {{total number}} of <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> {{in the world is}} unknown, but is thought to be in the {{hundreds}} of thousands. [...] The conservation outlook is brighter than for many other whales. [...] Commercial whaling has ceased, and the species is protected almost worldwide, though records indicate that in the eleven-year period starting from 2000, Japan has caught 51 <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> Fishermen do not target the creatures <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> eat, but long-line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska have complained about <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> stealing fish from their lines.|$|R
5|$|The name <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> is a {{truncation}} of spermaceti whale. Spermaceti, originally mistakenly {{identified as}} the whales' semen, is the semi-liquid, waxy substance found within the whale's head (see below).|$|E
5|$|The <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> {{characteristically}} has a large, squarish head {{one-third the}} length of its body; the blowhole is slightly to the left hand side; the skin is usually wrinkled; and it has no teeth on the upper jaw.|$|E
5|$|Atop the whale's skull is {{positioned}} a large complex of organs {{filled with a}} liquid mixture of fats and waxes called spermaceti. The purpose of this complex is to generate powerful and focused clicking sounds, which the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> uses for echolocation and communication.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> {{generate}} transient sounds (clicks) when foraging. These clicks {{have been}} described as echolocation sounds, a result of having measured the source level and the directionality of these signals and having extrapolated results from biosonar tests made on some small odontocetes. The authors propose a passive acoustic technique requiring only one hydrophone to investigate the acoustic behavior of free-ranging <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> They estimate whale pitch angles from the multipath distribution of click energy. They emphasize the close bond between the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale’s</b> physical and acoustic activity, leading to the hypothesis that <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> might, like some small odontocetes, control click level and rhythm. An echolocation model estimating the range of the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale’s</b> targets from the interclick interval is computed and tested during different stages of the whale’s dive. Such a hypothesis on the echolocation process would indicate that <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> echolocate their prey layer when initiating their dives and follow a methodic technique when foraging...|$|R
50|$|Solander Islands were {{historically}} well-known {{area for}} migrating whales especially southern right and <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> and <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> {{in this area}} {{was said to be}} exceptionally large in size and quantities of blubbers.|$|R
40|$|On November 18, 1994, four <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> were {{discovered}} {{dead on the}} Belgian coast, and on January 12, 1995, three live <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> stranded on the Dutch coast. Necropsies were conducted following a standardized procedure and samples were collected. Two Belgian <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> had a severe weight deficit and the Dutch <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> had reductions in blubber thickness. Agonal lesions such as visceral passive congestion and lung edema were due to the stranding. Significant lesions included acute ulcerations of the skin and acute to subacute ulcerative stomatitis. Severe diffuse subacute to chronic ulcerative external otitis was noted in four animals. Progressive weakness and/or potential alterations of echolocation might have predisposed these <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> to visit shallow waters - strong social cohesion and complex topography along the Dutch and Belgian coasts being the final factors leading to the stranding...|$|R
5|$|Remaining <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> {{populations are}} large {{enough that the}} species' {{conservation}} status is rated as vulnerable rather than endangered. However, the recovery from centuries of commercial whaling is a slow process, particularly in the South Pacific, where the toll on breeding-age males was severe.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> was {{designated}} as the Connecticut state animal by the CT General Assembly in 1975. It was selected because of its specific contribution to the state's history and because of its present-day plight as an endangered species.|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), {{are thought to have}} split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale),</b> Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whale),</b> and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).|$|E
500|$|These {{analyses}} also {{confirm that}} there was a rapid evolutionary radiation (diversification) of the Physeteroidea in the Miocene period. The Kogiidae (dwarf and pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whales)</b> diverged from the Physeteridae (true <b>sperm</b> <b>whales)</b> at least [...]|$|R
50|$|To {{achieve this}} aim of {{conducting}} a long-term analysis, Ocean Alliance monitored the top apex predator of the region, the <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> A resident, non-migratory population of <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> {{resides in the}} Northern Gulf of Mexico {{in close proximity to}} the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. As apex predators, <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> act as bio indicators of the health of the marine ecosystem in a toxicological context, demonstrating the effects of three key processes: bioaccumulation, biomagnification and the generation effect. Sadly these processes also make <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> and other apex predators, at greater risk from toxic pollution. Significantly, the data which was collected could be placed into the global data-set acquired during The Voyage of the Odyssey program.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards {{the left side of}} the skull.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> is a {{prominent}} user of echolocation and communication, with vocalization {{as loud as}} 230 decibels (re 1 µPa at 1 m) underwater. It has the largest brain of any animal on Earth, {{more than five times}} heavier than a human's. Sperm whales can live for more than 60 years.|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} in all mammalia, both in absolute and relative terms. The olfactory system is reduced, suggesting that the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> has a poor sense of taste and smell. By contrast, the auditory system is enlarged. The pyramidal tract is poorly developed, reflecting the reduction of its limbs.|$|E
5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> consist {{the largest and}} {{smallest}} odontocetes, and spend {{a large portion of}} their life hunting squid. P. macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require any degree of light at all, in fact, blind <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> have been caught in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|R
50|$|The Caribbean Sea {{offshore}} of {{the island}} of Dominica is home to many cetaceans. Most notably a group of <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> live in this area year-round. Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include spinner dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins and bottlenose dolphins. Less commonly seen animals include killer whales, false killer <b>whales,</b> pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> Risso's dolphins, common dolphins, Atlantic spotted dolphins, humpback whales and Bryde's whales. This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in whale-watching.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> {{may also}} herd prey.|$|R
5|$|Odontocetes, {{such as the}} <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of the}} tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. Mysticetes have large whalebone, as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas Odontocetes contain only one.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} the largest known of any modern or extinct animal, {{weighing}} on average about , {{more than five times}} heavier than a human's, and has a volume of about 8,000cm3. Although larger brains generally correlate with higher intelligence, {{it is not the only}} factor. Elephants and dolphins also have larger brains than humans. The <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> has a lower encephalization quotient than many other whale and dolphin species, lower than that of non-human anthropoid apes, and much lower than humans'.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the air forced through the phonic lips is the right nasal passage. While the left nasal passage opens to the blow hole, the right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips. It is thought that the {{nostrils}} of the land-based ancestor of the <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> migrated through evolution to their current functions, the left nostril becoming the blowhole and the right nostril becoming the phonic lips.|$|E
50|$|Krill {{populations have}} {{declined}} dramatically since whaling began. <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> transport iron {{from the deep}} ocean to the surface during prey consumption and defecation. <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> {{have been shown to}} increase the levels of primary production and carbon export to the deep ocean by depositing iron-rich faeces into surface waters of the Southern Ocean. The faeces causes phytoplankton to grow and take up carbon. The phytoplankton nourish krill. Reducing the abundance of <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> in the Southern Ocean, whaling resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> have {{scars on}} their backs, {{believed}} {{to be caused by}} the hooks of colossal squid. Colossal squid are a major prey item for <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> in the Antarctic; 14% of the squid beaks found in the stomachs of these <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> are those of the colossal squid, which indicates that colossal squid make up 77% of the biomass consumed by these whales. Many other animals also feed on colossal squid, including beaked whales (such as the southern bottlenose whale), pilot whales, southern elephant seals, Patagonian toothfish, sleeper sharks (Somniosus antarcticus), and albatrosses (e.g., the wandering and sooty albatrosses). However, beaks from mature adults have only been recovered from large predators (i.e. <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> and sleeper sharks), while the other predators only eat juveniles or young adults.|$|R
40|$|Predators make {{foraging}} {{decisions based}} upon sensory information about resource availability, but {{little is known}} about how large, air-breathing predators collect and use such information to maximize energy returns when foraging in the deep sea. Here, we used archival tags to study how echolocating <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> (Physeter macrocephalus) use their long-range sensory capabilities to guide foraging in a deep-water habitat consisting of multiple, depth-segregated prey layers. <b>Sperm</b> <b>whales</b> employ a directed search behaviour by modulating their overall sonar sampling with the intention to exploit a particular prey layer. They forage opportunistically during some descents while actively adjusting their acoustic gaze to sequentially track different prey layers. While foraging within patches, <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> adjust their clicking rate both to search new water volumes as they turn and to match the prey distribution. This strategy increases information flow and suggests that <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> can perform auditory stream segregation of multiple targets when echolocating. Such flexibility in sampling tactics in concert with long-range sensing capabilities apparently allow <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> to efficiently locate and access prey resources in vast, heterogeneous, deep water habitats...|$|R
