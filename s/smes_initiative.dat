40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of private {{foundations}} and organizations have launched ambitious initiatives to support promising entrepreneurs in developing countries, on both a for-profit and not-for-profit basis. Many of these programs have focused exclusively on building business capacity. While these tailored programs {{play an important role}} in supporting small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development, their overall effectiveness remains hamstrung in part by continuing constraints on entrepreneurs’ access to expansion and operating capital. Simultaneously, the U. S. government, other bilateral donors, and international financial institutions (IFIs) have launched a series of initiatives that provide both financial and technical assistance to SMEs in developing countries. Surprisingly, collaboration or formalized partnerships between private foundations and donor agencies has been somewhat limited—particularly on a strategic or globalized basis. This paper is targeted for these private foundations, especially those focused on women entrepreneurship. First, it provides a brief literature review of the rationale for and against <b>SME</b> <b>initiatives.</b> Second, it presents an overview of existing targeted USG and IFI programs. Lastly, it offers several new, incremental options for private foundations to establish focused partnerships with donor agencies in support of their ongoing organizational goals.

40|$|Many <b>SMEs</b> {{networking}} <b>initiatives</b> {{failed because}} {{of the absence of}} trust among companies and between companies and government, leadership and management approaches as well as absence of entrepreneurial skills in managing business networks. Even though local governments or regional agencies have a capacity to mobilize actors from the public and private sectors, generic public initiatives are proved not to be enough. The private sector should also be supported in gathering around joint interests and solving their mutual problems, thus improving business and competitiveness. Research, management and policy instruments to support SMEs will need to have some other directions. Can standardization be one of the directions? The main objective {{of this paper is to}} present some aspects of need for standardization in <b>SMEs</b> networking <b>initiatives.</b> The solution to actual or potential matching problems (intended and expected to be used repeatedly or continuously, during a certain period, by a substantial number of parties for whom they are meant) can be formalized as standard. The standard development process can serve as basis for building connections and trust among cluster members.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{implementation}} of the 2010 - 2015 ASEAN Strategic Action Plan for SME Development and the 2004 - 2009 ASEAN Policy Blueprint for SME Development. The initial interviews and survey results yielded low average effectiveness scores for the ASEAN Strategic Action Plan for SME Development. The scores ranged from without- to no- or little concrete impacts on {{the implementation of}} various programs on access to financing, facilitation, technology development, promotion, human resource development, and other regional <b>SME</b> <b>initiatives.</b> Results for the ASEAN Policy Blueprint for SME Development also indicated low average effectiveness scores on the implementation of programs on human resource development and capacity building, enhancing SME marketing capabilities, access to financing, access to technology, and creating conducive policy environment. In the last decade, manufacturing SMEs have not substantially generated sufficient value added and employment to increase the country's overall manufacturing growth. This weak performance of SMEs has been largely attributed to barriers particularly access to finance, technology, and skills as well as information gaps and difficulties with product quality and marketing. Within this light, the government could facilitate SMEs' gainful participation in the ASEAN by designing a coherent set of policies and programs; addressing financing issues; improving the technological capabilities and strengthening supply chains (to enable SMEs to move up the technology scale); and creating an enabling environment for SMEs to survive and realize their potentials to grow...|$|R
40|$|The study {{sought to}} assess or {{investigate}} the financing strategies employed by SME real estate firms operating under the liquidity constraints in Zimbabwe and the effect on their growth and success. The phenomenal growth and contribution to the economy of SME real estate firms is widely observed in all developing and emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and even Zimbabwe. These firms have contributed towards the creation of employment, value addition, foreign currency and competition among others. The study used both quantitative and qualitative methodologies with combined survey and interview methods. Data was collected from a sample of 110 small and medium sized firms in Harare out of a population of 227 firms trading in Zimbabwe. The study arrived at the following conclusions: SME real estate firms lacked financing strategies; they rely heavily on private equity and leasing finance; they have little access to bank loans; venture finance and public equity. They also lack skills, training, technology and markets. However the SMEs have great growth potential and {{have the capacity to}} increase their contribution to GDP. The study therefore recommended the following: greater use of financing strategies in their operations; increased access to other sources of finance; skills; training and markets; increase capacity building initiatives to enhance entrepreneurial leadership skills; promote business development services; enhance operation effectiveness; strengthening business associations and increase information sharing or dissemination on available <b>SME</b> <b>initiatives...</b>|$|R

40|$|Vietnam’s {{venture capital}} (VC) {{industry}} took {{shape in the}} late 1990 s {{during a period of}} exceptional economic growth in the country and the development of its high-technology sector. High growth rates and technological advances have typically coincided with both strong VC market activity and state support of equity financing. This, however, has not been the case in Vietnam. In this article a policy diffusion framework is used to investigate the international and domestic origins of Vietnam’s nascent VC policies, and how they became part of the agenda of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) as credit-based, rather than equity-based, solutions. The article argues that Vietnam’s heterodox approach to VC policy results from both external forces from donors and from domestic factors. In particular, Vietnamese policymakers have a preference for credit-based SME financing solutions and Vietnam’s official development assistance providers diffuse expertise on loans, not equity investments, to the Socialist Republic. The only donors recommending VC and equity-based financing in Vietnam have gone “around the state” rather than through it by working directly with the private sector. As a result, Vietnam’s <b>SME</b> financing <b>initiatives</b> have significantly diverged from international VC policy patterns...|$|R

40|$|Companies {{are facing}} {{increasing}} demand concerning the environmental perfor-mance of their products. The focus of product development {{should not be}} on product characteristics alone, but rather on improving the entire product life-cycle. Holistic management of environmental impacts, i. e. life-cycle thinking, is needed. Life-cycle thinking requires that the main contractors {{are aware of the}} environmental aspects of their products within the whole value chain. This is currently placing growing pres-sure on their supplier <b>SMEs.</b> Environmental <b>initiatives</b> in <b>SMEs</b> are, however, often inhibited by lack of resources, capacity and capabilities. Life-cycle thinking forces network co-operation. Here ideas about how network dynamics could be helpful in finding new solutions to the problems of environmental management in the value chain context are introduced. For the main contractor, partnership means better control over the supplier chain. For the suppliers, a reliable, long-term relationship offers better opportunities to allocate more efficiently scarce manufacturing and development resources. The case of environmental management system development process in a Finnish metal industry network illustrates the topic.

Although the majority of SMEs actively used the Web in their daily business operations and most were willing to share knowledge face-to-face, this did not translate into willingness to share online. The most significant factors affecting the willingness to share knowledge online were the how many of networks SMEs were involved in, the number of years an SME had been in business, the geographical scope of their operations, and intensity of their use of the web. These findings challenge the commonly-held view that SMEs will automatically share online if the infrastructure is provided. <br /...|$|R

Recently quality leaders are faced with challenges such as profitable growth, excellence in execution, customer loyalty, innovation/creativity, speed to market and corporate reputation rather than traditional task of product quality improvement. To achieve an organizational excellence level, internal, external factors and business excellence implementation obstacles must be considered. Each initiative has {{a positive impact on}} constructs of quality implementation. Due to this reason, breaking down the initiatives for each construct is necessary. The focus of study is to investigate on initiatives in the electrical and electronic industries in Malaysia which are faced with competition from other ASEAN countries.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} attention in the development literature {{on the issue of}} the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) “missing middle” - a distinctive distribution of small and medium enterprises in developing countries as well as certain characteristics unique to this distribution. In this distribution the number of SMEs is found to be “low” relative to other enterprise sizes. A number of reasons are cited for the existence of this missing middle. They include: restricted access to Financing & Financial Infrastructure; Government Regulations & Taxes; Access to Electricity (particularly Energy); Economic & Political Uncertainty; and Lack of Workforce Skills & Informal Competition. The objective of this paper is to analyse whether there is a SME “missing middle” in Bangladesh and if so, are financial constraints a crucial factor for this. The paper also analysed the impact of various non – financial constraints on SMEs in Bangladesh. The paper is based on existing literature and available quantitative data and surveys from various international and local institutions and researchers. The paper finds that there is indeed a SME “missing middle” in Bangladesh in terms of their number and their contribution to GDP and employment relative to similar contributions by the SMEs in the emerging and the developed economies. The paper concludes that the major causes for the SME “missing middle” in Bangladesh are a continuing lack of access to financing (even though there have been signs of improvement in this area) and infrastructural problems particularly access to power. The analysis also shows that SMEs in Bangladesh have diversified significantly overtime, going beyond what would be expected in a proto-industrialization process, and venturing into industrial sectors unrelated to the agricultural sector. The paper concludes that even though various pro- <b>SME</b> growth <b>initiatives</b> are underway, there is still room for improvement particularly in the provision of financing and in the adaptation of new and innovative ways of doing business...|$|R
40|$|Management {{support is}} widely {{reported}} to be a contributor to influencing corporate entrepreneurship within organisations. Managerial support and attitude are described as having a direct positive link on the levels of corporate entrepreneurial activity exhibited in organisations. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the role of managerial support within Small and Medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the seafreight transport industry. A questionnaire, adapted from the Corporate Entrepreneurial Climate Instrument (CECI), developed by Morris, Kuratko & Covin (2008), was distributed to organisations of differing sizes in the seafreight transport sector. The questionnaire measured key antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship. Data was analysed by means of a one-way between-groups ANOVA. Results indicate that managerial support for corporate entrepreneurship in the sampled SMEs is relatively low. Results further indicate that as an SME increases in size, its level of management support for corporate entrepreneurship improves. Respondents under the age of 30 perceived a higher level of support than their older counterparts. This paper provides recommendations regarding <b>initiatives</b> <b>SMEs</b> can undertake to improve managerial support levels. The findings and recommendations of the paper are of particular interest to middle-level and senior managers within SME?s in the seafreight industry who have a direct influence over managerial support levels in their respective organisations.

40|$|This thesis draws {{together}} and reconciles three seemingly dichotomous "worlds"; small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), e-business and government policy making. A {{significant number of}} EU and UK government projects and policy initiatives have been introduced {{in recent years to}} motivate e-business adoption and implementation by SMEs, yet the relatively low take-up rate strongly indicates that these policies and initiatives are failing. Designed as a preliminary study, this research ascertains the practical impact of such policy <b>initiatives</b> on <b>SMEs,</b> based on the experiences of seven UK case studies, with a view to instruct constructive and feasible changes in policy making. The implication is that future policy initiatives may become more appropriate, coherent and accessible to SMEs, resulting in greater opportunities for them, a greater level of innovation adoption by them, and an economy that is - as a direct result - more dynamic. In this "problem situation," both the SMEs and the policy makers who aim to serve them are joint owners of the problem situation. There is a very real need to think about ways to bring these "actors" in disparate "worlds" together into a more collaborative arrangement, and to consider how government policies that are currently failing SMEs might have more relevance - it would seem that most SMEs are unaware of many of the services and initiatives provided by their government. Ascertaining what SMEs want and need, designing policies and services in light of this, and finding better ways of letting them know these services are available, would seem to be the key. Through a narrative research approach informed by Action Case Research (ACR) and Dialogical Action Research (Dialogical AR), in combination with Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) conceptual modelling, this doctoral research develops our understanding of <b>SME</b> policy <b>initiatives</b> in the UK and the EU. The thesis addresses the absence of well-structured multiple case study designs in the literature, and tests existing knowledge about SMEs and policy generation in an original way. The development of appropriate and complementary (ACR and Dialogical AR) analysis tools constitutes a methodological extension of the SSM conceptual modelling process for ISD, which focuses on social, political and cultural factors and the social construction of problems and solutions. The thesis is an exploration of complex and ill-structured problem situations with multiple owners that can be viewed from a variety of stances - this has rarely been featured in the literature. This research is also an extension of SSM theory development, in that SSM has not been widely used in the SME environment, and there are very few examples of iteration having taken place in the literature. The research is an interpretive approach to the study of a domain about which we know very little. As such, it provides a contribution to literature, theory and practice. A (1981) study by Galliers et al. is drawn upon. Although that study was originally applied in a very different context, it nonetheless parallels this doctoral research, in that both examine a complex and difficult real world system with a utilitarian approach, and in that both are soft systems studies that draw together anachronous worlds and suggest a way of pursuing a dialogue that is meaningful to all involved parties. The research concludes with a proposal to incentivise SME owner/managers to attend workshop(s), in order that an in-depth and meaningful dialogue between policy makers and SMEs can develop, and in order to draw out attitudes and issues previously unexpressed. Policy makers would thus be able to build on the findings in order to generate and advertise more appurtenant policies for SMEs, thereby bringing these "worlds" together...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} towards {{environmental issues}} (transportation emissions, global warming, depletion of natural resources) in today’s global economy {{has resulted in}} the need for businesses to be more environmentally friendly and act in an environmentally responsible manner. Like most developed nations, the UK has placed significant importance on the need for more sustainable business operations. However the smooth adoption and implementation of these green practices by businesses is slow due to challenges such as lack of awareness, cost, resourcing, legislation, and incorporation into existing business processes. Green practices are often assumed by SMEs to involve significant expense, and in some cases even unaffordable. Particularly during the recent time of recession, focus has been on keeping SMEs afloat rather than making substantial investment in what are perceived to be “nice to have” green <b>initiatives.</b> <b>SMEs</b> sometimes also cite lack of knowledge of how to implement green initiatives and lack of support for such activity. The focus of this research is Scottish food and drink sector, which plays a vital role contributing nearly £ 10 bn yearly to the economy. However, this positive contribution of the sector to the economy sits in tension with the fact it also generates a substantial amount of waste (estimated to generate 2 million tonnes of waste annually), and thus has costly negative impacts on the environment. This paper forms part of a larger doctoral study on green supply chain <b>initiatives</b> in Scottish <b>SMEs.</b> Specifically, the research has been set up to explore the various factors motivating and inhibiting the adoption of green initiatives by food and drink businesses. In this paper, the focus is on {{a review of the literature}} that was undertaken to establish some initial motivators and inhibitors among SMEs across a range of sectors. These were then explored further in a pilot study among six small firms in the food and drink sector Scotland. This qualitative pilot study was undertaken using semi-structured interviews with the owner-managers. Arising from the findings of the pilot study, a scale of “green-ness” was devised to chart the extent to which the firms have innovated by incorporating green practices into their business processes. A more extensive study is now being designed to test and refine the scale with a view to creating a model to assist small businesses in their planning and strategizing in relation to introducing green practices. The paper reports on the early stages of this research, including the pilot study and the creation of the “green-ness” scale...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) has been {{significantly}} drawing global attention {{for the past}} decade. The solving of social, political and economic problems now fully requires the involvement of {{both the public and}} private sectors, particularly in the context of developing countries. In Zimbabwe, CSR has mainly been the responsibility of large firms, NGOs and the government. Little has been done to encourage <b>SMEs</b> to take <b>initiative</b> and responsibility on CSR matters, although these SMEs constitute about ninety percent of all economic activities in Zimbabwe. For CSR to be implemented, there is need for access to information. Public libraries are one of the major focal points in the provision of information. These public libraries have vast potential to support CSR initiatives and are capable of partnering with various organisations from different sectors as well. However, when it comes to visibility on CSR, public libraries in Zimbabwe and in other developing countries are almost non-existent. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role that public libraries play in promoting CSR to SMEs in Zimbabwe as a means of contributing in shaping policies which ensure that public libraries are more relevant in society through their support of, as well as their involvement in sustainable developmental issues. In order to attain this, the study adopted the interpretive paradigm and the qualitative approach. In addition, the case study design was used, allowing the researcher to obtain detailed information about the Harare City Library in relation to the promotion of CSR to SMEs. The target population for this study included librarians at public libraries in Zimbabwe and the owners or managers of formally registered SMEs in the country. The study revealed that a great number of SMEs have limited knowledge about CSR and do not engage in it. SMEs consider CSR to be mainly philanthropic in nature, as their knowledge does not extend to include other important aspects of the concept. In addition, public libraries are not the major source of CSR information provision to SMEs, although a fair number of SMEs believe that they should be at the forefront. The study recommends that public libraries should reach out to SMEs to promote CSR to them, in addition to marketing the library’s own information resources and services. Public libraries need also to establish strategic alliances with relevant stakeholders as a means of encouraging SMEs to engage in CSR initiatives. Information ScienceM. Inf.

40|$|The {{attraction}} of inward investment from the UK and from overseas {{was the main}} focus of regional development policy in Wales for much of the 1970 s and 1980 s. Whilst Wales has been particularly successful in attracting foreign enterprise, the contribution of new investors to improving longer term regional economic prospects has been questioned at several levels. With concerns over inward investor stability, embeddedness, and contribution to local value added, increasing weight has been given to the encouragement, and development of innovative indigenous SMEs in the Welsh economy. General and sectoral <b>initiatives</b> to encourage <b>SME</b> development and innovation in Wales have also taken place against a background of historically low levels of new firm formation in the region, together with the presence of factors expected to hinder SME growth including low levels of capital availability. Ultimately, it is hoped that a strongly performing indigenously controlled and innovative SME sector will go some way to improving regional growth prospects, and hence play a role in reducing the GDP per capita gap between Wales and the UK. During the 1990 s a series of research and consultancy studies in Wales have been undertaken seeking to audit SME activities, define needs and identify market failures in provision of information and services. These have formed the basis of revised policy and then for new resource directions emanating at the European, regional and local levels. Encouraging innovative activity has {{been at the forefront of}} the network of initiatives currently underway in Wales. New initiatives have often been instituted without a clear appreciation of the nature of innovation, and how innovative activities link to innovative outputs and then feed through to improved business performance. This paper examines the link between innovative activity, outcomes and the performance of SMEs in Wales. A range of European, UK and locally developed initiatives in Wales seek to encourage innovative activity in indigenous SMEs. However, it is the contention of this paper that these initiatives have often been instituted without a clear appreciation of how, if, and which innovative activities feed through to improved business performance. The paper offers a general method of assessing the innovative potential (the configuration of management practices, capabilities, internal and external linkages facilitating the generation of appropriation of ideas) of manufacturing SMEs. This then leads on to an examination of how far innovative potential is connected to operational and general business performance. The paper describes how the model was developed and used to assess the innovative potential of a sample of manufacturing SMEs in Industrial South Wales, and how far the innovative potential can be linked to improved operational and business performance. The introduction to the paper reviews current literature on innovation in SMEs, and demonstrates how far recent studies have succeeded in measuring, and then linking innovative inputs of SMEs to innovative outputs and firm performance. The second section builds upon the review to develop a working model of an innovative SME. Innovation is considered not only in terms of new product or process development but more generally as practice. The model reveals the innovative firm as one that identifies, interprets, and applies knowledge effectively, and as appropriate throughout the organisation. The model described represents a synthesis of previous research. Key factors in the model include strategy and the techniques and practices deployed to facilitate the development and appropriation of ideas for innovation. Broadly this focuses on SME commitment to innovation, and management practices supporting this commitment. The third section describes how the model was operationalised into an auditing tool, and then used to assess the innovative potential of a sample of manufacturing SMEs in Industrial South Wales. The fourth section summarises the results from the initial research programme, and in particular, considers whether the unique operating structures usually associated with SMEs hinder or facilitate the adoption of new structures for organisational learning. Moreover the section examines whether the existence of certain configurations of practices coincide with improved business performance and operational efficiencies. The conclusions consider these results in the context of the directions being adopted by current regional <b>SME</b> policy <b>initiatives</b> in Industrial South Wales. ...|$|R
