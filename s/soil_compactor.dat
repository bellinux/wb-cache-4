40|$|This study {{explores the}} ride {{dynamics}} of typical North-American vibratory soil compactors via analytical and experimental methods. In-plane ride dynamic {{models of the}} vehicle are formulated to evaluate ride vibration responses of the vehicle in the transit mode on undeformable terrain surfaces with the roller vibrator off. An in-plane dynamic model is also formulated to study the compaction mode dynamics at lower speeds on elasto-plastic soil subject to roller induced vibration. Field measurements were conducted to characterize the ride vibration environments during the two modes of operations. The ride dynamic models of the <b>soil</b> <b>compactor</b> are thus analyzed to study its whole-body vibration environment while operating on undeformable random terrain surfaces. The modeling of the equipment in compaction mode of operation, however, gives insight over {{the efficiency of the}} compactor as a tool aimed to perform compaction of soil layers by plastic deformation (compression). The ride vibration environment of the vehicle and its compaction capability is subsequently assessed using the ISO- 2631 - 1 (1997) guidelines and commonly accepted compaction criteria, respectively. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing the model responses with the measured data. Comprehensive parametric analyses were subsequently performed to study the influences of variations in various design and operating parameters on the ride quality and the compaction efficiency of the mobile equipment. The results of the study are utilized to propose desirable design and operating parameters of the vibratory <b>soil</b> <b>compactor</b> for enhancement of its ride vibration environment and compaction performance...|$|E
40|$|This article proposes and {{implements}} a {{class of}} chaotic motors for electric compaction. The key {{is to develop a}} design approach for the permanent magnets (PMs) of doubly salient PM (DSPM) motors {{in such a way that}} chaotic motion can be naturally produced. The bifurcation diagram is employed to derive the threshold of chaoization in terms of PM flux, while the corresponding phase-plane trajectories are used to characterize the chaotic motion. A practical three-phase 128 -pole DSPM motor is used for exemplification. The proposed chaotic motor is critically assessed for application to a vibratory <b>soil</b> <b>compactor,</b> which is proven to offer better compaction performance than its counterparts. Both computer simulation and experimental results are given to illustrate the proposed chaotic motor. Â© 2006 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>soil</b> <b>compactor</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} construction machineries which play an significant role during our economic development. And the complicated nonlinear characteristic of equipment-material system is an interesting field in recent theoretical and applied investigations. According to experimental datum, a nonlinear model derived from piecewise linear was used to describe the hysteretic behavior of soil material during compaction. Through choosing proper model parameters, the nonlinear dynamic characteristics are commendably controlled which could represent different compacting stages. Furthermore, the series phase diagram and Poincare section were obtained by simulation. The hysteretic characteristics might be incarnating from periodic vibration to chaotic vibration. Further research proved that reducing the angular frequency of rotation may bring the chaotic vibration coming back to periodic vibration, which provided a good assistance for further study on hysteretic character of soil compaction and man-machine engineering on vibratory compacting system...|$|E

50|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>compactors</b> {{are used}} to perform test methods which cover {{laboratory}} compaction methods {{used to determine the}} relationship between molding water content and dry unit weight of soils. Soil placed as engineering fill is compacted to a dense state to obtain satisfactory engineering properties such as, shear strength, compressibility, or permeability. In addition, foundation soils are often compacted to improve their engineering properties. Laboratory compaction tests provide the basis for determining the percent compaction and molding water content needed to achieve the required engineering properties, and for controlling construction to assure that the required compaction and water contents are achieved. Test methods such as EN 13286-2, EN 13286-47, ASTM D698, ASTM D1557, AASHTO T99, AASHTO T180, AASHTO T193, BS 1377:4 provide soil compaction testing procedures.|$|R
40|$|Major drivers behind {{increased}} {{efforts in}} product development are the increased competition due to globalisation and the urgent transformation of society towards sustainability. Furthermore, the average product lifetime has been compressed significantly {{over the last}} decade. Due to these trends, there is increasing demand for an efficient product development process. Cutting time-to-market, reducing costs and increasing quality are widely accepted as key factors to successful product development. Consideration of sustainability aspects in product development is also becoming increasingly important. Methods and tools that are useful also for small and medium sized enterprises are of particular importance for the Swedish industry. This thesis suggests a definition of lean prototyping and points to its potential for supporting efficient product development. This is done through two case studies: a <b>soil</b> <b>compactor</b> machine treated as a multi-body system and a water jet cutting machine treated as a mechatronic system. Lean prototyping {{is defined as a}} coordinated approach to experimentation with the purpose of achieving cost-efficient and accurate enough prediction of product characteristics to support optimisation and well-informed design decisions during product development, especially in the early stages. This often involves an iterative search for and use of a suitable combination of virtual and limited physical prototypes as well as the reuse of knowledge from previous projects. The case studies are performed in cooperation with one small and one medium sized company, indicating the usefulness of the approach for different product types as well as for different company sizes. More specifically, the validated multi-body model of the <b>soil</b> <b>compactor</b> machine describes the dynamics of the machine satisfactorily and the optimisation study shows a significant potential for improved compaction capacity. This potential would not likely been found through traditional physical prototyping. The related comparative study of contact transition conditions is a contribution to consistent impact modelling in multi-body dynamics in general. The real-time virtual machine concept for simulation of the water jet cutting machine, including detailed mechanical component models, is unique. The fully automated concept implementation makes it a promising base for multidisciplinary design optimisation of the water jet cutting machine, and probably of mechatronic products in general...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: This Dissertation {{addresses}} the design, development {{and construction of}} an automated <b>soil</b> <b>compactor</b> for the preparation of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and Proctor samples. The necessity for this machine is primarily due to an ever increasing number of workers compensation claims within the soil testing and certification industry. The technicians that are currently preparing substrate samples {{by means of a}} manual compaction hammer are subjected to extended periods of use of this apparatus, causing Repetitive Strain Injury and Occupational Overuse Syndrome in the shoulders, neck and elbows. Therefore, a mechanization of the manual compaction methods was required. In addition to addressing the physical strain issues, the machine was also designed to fully comply with current Australian Standards. Multiple automatic machines are available on the market; however none achieve full compliance to the methods set out in AS 1289. The design was therefore developed into a machine that mimics the manual compaction method exactly while eliminating the inherent human error of the manual method. The prototype Compaction Machine has successfully passed product testing as a viable, accurate and efficient tool for use within the Civil Testing Industry while fully complying with the relevant Australian Standards. The machineâs capabilities allow the unit to be used in researching more efficient compaction techniques; a very useful, promising future is ahead...|$|E

The purpose is to develop an efficient and verified method for simulation of rammer compactor machines {{that can be used}} in the product development process. The experience gained through this work is also intended to be useful for studying other types of dynamic compactor machines. Rammer compactor machines perform impact soil compaction, which is very efficient compared to static compaction. They are often used in places where a high degree of compaction is needed and the space for operation is limited. The complexity of this machine type makes design optimisation through traditional prototype testing impractical. This has pointed to the need for a theoretical model and simulation procedure for prediction of the dynamic behaviour of the machine. To be useful for optimisation as design parameters are changed during product development the theoretical model and simulation procedure must be verified. By concurrently working with theoretical modelling, simulations, experimental verifications, and optimisation an efficient analysis support for product development is achieved. This co-ordination works both ways in an iterative manner. Experimental investigations are used to verify theoretical models and simulations. Theoretical models and simulations are used to design good experiments. This Complete Approach concept makes better decisions possible earlier in the development process, resulting in decreased time-to-market and improved quality. In this thesis, the Complete Approach concept is applied on a rammer <b>soil</b> <b>compactor</b> machine. An introductory iteration is described.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to conduct a laboratory test program on how much induced vibrations on concrete during the period between initial set and final set affect the attainable strength of concrete.

The levels of vibration correspond to typical frequencies of vibratory <b>soil</b> <b>compactors</b> and the peak particle velocity produced by the compactors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{elucidate}} how Swedish industry has adapted their products for product/service systems (PSS). Three case study companies that manufacture forklift trucks, <b>soil</b> <b>compactors</b> and household appliances are studied. Interviews with company staff are conducted as well as product analyses in laboratorial environment. The theory is based mainly on previous PSS, design and remanufacturing research. A key factor when developing products for PSS is to design the product from a life-cycle perspective, considering all the product's life-cycle phases, namely manufacturing, use, maintenance and end-of-life treatment. Many of the design improvements deal with the accessibility of parts and components during maintenance and remanufacturing operations, and several of them could reduce the need and cost for maintenance, repair and remanufacturing. Uncovering any additional product requirements needed for a successful PSS not addressed in this paper. For example, it could be interesting to explore which product data could be collected during use in order to improve the products' different life stages. The findings in this paper illustrate and describe many industrial implications for engineering designers to consider when developing PSS. The novelty of this paper is aimed for designers to study how they can adapt their future products used in PSS in a more beneficial way than in traditional product design. The paper shows ideas and general guidelines to follow which have been scarcely published...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{prototype}} machine integrated compaction monitoring technologies {{were evaluated}} for self-propelled non-vibratory <b>soil</b> <b>compactors.</b> Monitoring technologies included roller walkout, rolling radius, machine energy, wheel slip, and machine vibration. In concept, the machine measurement value should {{be capable of}} predicting compaction properties in real time for 100 % of the machine coverage area while displaying the results on a computer monitor inside the cab with global positioning system (GPS) based mapping. To move toward a production-level compaction monitoring technology, a detailed evaluation of these technologies including field experimentation and statistical {{analysis of the data}} was required. The statistical analysis of measurements included repeatability analysis, simple linear correlations analysis, and multiple variable model relationship analysis. The relationships between machine measurement values and soil compaction properties was verified using various in-situ point measurements to determine density, moisture content, strength, and stiffness properties of the soil. Several test strips with variable moisture contents, lift thicknesses, and sloping conditions were constructed as part of the evaluation. Relatively strong relationships were observed between machine measurement values and in-situ point measurements (coefficients of determination, R 2, generally above 0. 7), especially when measurements of roller walkout and machine energy were utilized. Regression relationships were improved by adding moisture content as an independent variable, in some cases producing R 2 values that exceed 0. 80. A repeatability study on machine measurement values produced errors in the range of 20 to 40 percent. Findings from this study help to narrow down several roller integrated compaction monitoring technologies based on repeatability and correlation analysis to soil compaction properties...|$|R
50|$|Indicate only uses GPS {{positioning}} {{information as}} a guide to the operator. Depending on the system used, the machine position can be displayed over the specific design site that was created for the earthmoving project. This system relies on the operator to steer and move the machine's implements in order to match the site's design. Indicate only systems are typically cheaper and less complicated since they don't require hardware to tap into the machine's implement control systems. Indicate only systems typically utilize a single GPS receiver mounted on the machine itself and can use an angle sensor to calculate the machine's slope. Accuracy of these systems depends on if the site has a base station that can relay site specific corrections. If the site does not have a base station, indicate only systems can just use satellite information, however the accuracy is usually in the one to two meter range. Utilizing a base station allows for site specific corrections to be transmitted to the machine, increasing the accuracy through Real Time Kinematics (RTK). Site specific corrections can increase the accuracy of an indicate only system to be around two to three centimeters. Machines that typically use indicate only consist of <b>Soil</b> <b>Compactors</b> (SC), Track-Type Tractors (TTT), and Motor Graders (MG). The use of a base station really depends on the accuracy requirements of the project. Some projects such as clearing overburden at a mine site with a TTT, may not need two to three centimeter accuracy while as grading a road base with a MG does.|$|R
40|$|Peaking {{deflection}} {{caused by}} compacting the sidefill, {{referred to as}} the maximum change of the pipe diameter divided by the undeformed diameter, is an important parameter in the design and safety check of buried pipelines. However, quantitative equations on the deflection useful for engineering practice are very limited. In this paper, a two-dimensional finite element analysis is used to investigate the peaking deflection of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. In the analyses, the pipeÂ¿soil interaction is rationally modeled. A field trial is conducted and the finite-element modeling is evaluated by using the data measured in the field test. Parametric studies are also conducted to investigate the effects of pipe diameter, pipe stiffness, soil modulus, trench width, and compactor type on the peaking deflection of buried HDPE pipes. A new estimating tool is developed that considers the major influencing factors: pipe diameter, pipe stiffness, <b>soil</b> modulus, and <b>compactor</b> type (vibratory plate or rammer) to predict the peaking deflection of HDPE pipes, and the proposed method is finally verified by data reported in published studies. The comparison of the calculated and measured peaking deflections demonstrates a reasonably good prediction of the peaking deflection...|$|R
