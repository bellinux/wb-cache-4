5|$|In 2010 THSRC {{put through}} a new {{syndicate}} loan, which alleviated the company’s imminent financial burden. THSRC signed a NT$382 billion refinancing contract with a consortium of 8 domestic banks led by Bank of Taiwan in January, 2010; and utilized the new loan {{to pay off the}} previous <b>syndicated</b> <b>loan</b> which with higher interest. As of 30 June 2011, the long-term debts totaling NT$385 billion include NT$26 billion corporate bonds and NT$359 billion bank loans. In comparison with the terms and conditions of previous loans, the newly signed refinancing debts carried lower interest rates and longer tenors up to 22 years. The Company’s financial burden is therefore largely reduced.|$|E

The program was created in 1957 and [...] has channeled approximately $38 billion from over 550 financial institutions toward development projects in over 100 different emerging markets. The IFC syndicated a total of $4.7 billion in loans in 2011, twice that of its $2 billion worth of syndications in 2010. Due to banks retrenching from lending across borders in emerging markets, in 2009 the IFC started to syndicate parallel loans to the international financial institutions and other participants.|$|E

Using a sample of <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> issued in 2008 in North America and Europe, and records of <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> since 2003, we show that firms that had developed a relationship with an investment bank obtained a lower spread, but did not benefit from greater loan facilities or longer maturities. <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans,</b> banking relationship, credit rationing...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{recent development}} in U. S. capital markets is the tremendous {{growth in the}} secondary market trading of <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans.</b> This paper uses a unique trading data set for <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> over the period 1997 to 2003 to empirically investigate two major issues. First, we present a statistical overview of the recent growth in the secondary market trading of <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans.</b> Second, we examine the determinants of which <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> {{are most likely to}} be traded in the secondary market using binomial logistic regression models. We find that <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> that are larger, have longer maturities, are underwritten by larger syndicates, and are used for debt repayment, takeovers, and leveraged buyouts are more likely to be traded. Lender reputation plays an important role as well, with loans originated by very active lenders more likely to be traded. We also find that <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> made to borrowers with only senior debt ratings are more likely to be traded in the secondary market than loans made to borrowers with both a debt rating and equity that trades in a stock exchange. This result most likely reflects the growing demand of institutional investors for the higher yields of levered and highly levered <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> made to riskier opaque borrowers with less available market information...|$|R

The last financial crisis clearly shows the impacts of credit rationing and tightening credit conditions, even in the <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> market. We investigate whether banking relationships help firms to benefit from better terms for <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> in a chaotic financial environment. Using a sample of <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> arranged from 2003 to 2008 in North America and Europe, we find that firms with a previously developed relationship with a lead bank obtained a lower spread and a longer maturity during the financial crisis but did not benefit from larger loan facilities...|$|R

We investigate the financial factors behind the issuance of <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> for an extensive sample of euro area non-financial corporations.

We find that large firms, with greater financial leverage, more (verifiable) profits and higher liquidation values tend to prefer <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans.</b> In contrast, firms with larger levels of short-term debt and those perceived by markets as having more growth opportunities favour financing through corporate bonds.

The {{analysis of the}} valuation of debt arrangements by stock markets provides information {{about the use of}} debt by Russian companies. We apply the event study methodology to check whether debt announcements lead to abnormal returns using a sample of Russian listed companies that issued <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> or bonds between June 2004 and December 2008. We find a negative reaction of stock markets to debt arrangements that can be explained by moral hazard behavior of shareholders at the expense of debtholders. Further, we observe no significant difference between announcements of <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> and bonds. Thus, our findings support the view that Russian companies could have incentives to limit their reliance on external debt.

40|$|<b>Syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> and {{the number}} of lending {{relationships}} have raised growing attention. All other terms being equal (e. g. seniority), <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> provide larger payments (in basis points) to lenders funding larger amounts. The paper explores empirically the motivation for such a price discrimination on sovereign <b>syndicated</b> <b>loans</b> in the period 1990 - 1997. First evidence suggests larger premia are associated with renegotiation prospects. This is consistent with the hypothesis that price discrimination is aimed at reducing the number of lenders and thus the expected renegotiation costs. However, larger payment discrimination is also associated with more targeted market segments and with larger loans, thus minimising borrowing costs and/or attempting to widen the circle of lending relationships in order to successfully raise the requested amount.
