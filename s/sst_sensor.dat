40|$|Climate studies need {{long-term}} {{data sets}} of homogeneous quality, {{in order to}} discern trends from other physical signals present in the data and to minimise the contamination of these trends by errors in the source data. Sea surface temperature (SST), deﬁned as one of essential climatology variables, has been increasingly used in both oceanographical and meteorological operational context {{where there is a}} constant need for more accurate measurements. Satellite-derived SST provides an indispensable dataset, with both spatially and temporally high resolutions. However, these data have errors of 0. 5 K on a global scale and present inter-sensor and inter-regional differences due to their technical characteristics, algorithm limitations and the changing physical properties of the measured environments. These inter-sensor differences should be taken into account in any research involving more than one sensor (SST analysis, long term climate research...). The error correction for each <b>SST</b> <b>sensor</b> is usually calculated as a difference between the SST data derived from referent sensor (e. g. ENVISAT/AATSR) and from the other sensors (SEVIRI, AVHRR, MODIS). However, these empirical difference (bias) ﬁelds show gaps due to the satellite characteristics (e. g. narrow swath in case of AATSR) and to the presence of clouds or other atmospheric contaminations. We present a methodology based on DINEOF (Data INterpolation Empirical Orthogonal Functions) to reconstruct and analyse SST biases with the aim of studying temporal and spatial variability of the SST bias ﬁelds both at a large scale (European seas) and at a regional scale (Mediterranean Sea) and to perform the necessary corrections to the original SST ﬁelds. Two different approaches were taken: by analysing SST biases based on reconstructed SST differences and based on differences of reconstructed SST ﬁelds. Corrected SST ﬁelds based on both approaches were validated against independent in situ buoy SST data or with ENVISAT/AATSR SST data for areas without in situ data (e. g. eastern Mediterranean) ...|$|E

Brown (RHB) was {{deployed in the}} east Pacific Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) for approximately 3 weeks near 10 deg. N, 95 deg. W. One of the principal objectives of the EPIC-ITCZ program was to observe the modulation of convection by synoptic-scale easterly waves and the air-sea coupling process in this poorly sampled region of the east Pacific. Data from the experiment {{will be used as}} validation to improve forecast models. The RHB carried a variety of platforms during EPIC to sample atmospheric and oceanic phenomena, including a scanning C-band Doppler radar, radiation flux instrumentation, air-sea flux system, Doppler lidar, 35 GHz cloud radar, UHF wind profiler, sea surface temperature (<b>SST)</b> <b>sensors,</b> as well as standard surface meteorological instrumentation and a suite of rain gauges. This presentation will focus on the analysis of C-band radar data that was collected on 10 September, 2001 as the ship passed through an easterly wave which later developed into hurricane Ivo. The ship captured approximately 12 hours of convection associated with the tropical disturbance. During this period, the domain sampled by the radar (approximately 71, 000 sq km) contained a significant number of echo features. Specifically, the fraction of the domain containing radar echo above 10 dBZ reached 80 % for over 2 hours and remained near 60 % for a continuous six hour period. Animation of radar images showed distinct rotation in echo features associated with the easterly wave passage. Despite an approximate 4 C drop in surface air temperature and sustained winds approaching 20 m/ s, the SST remained nearly constant throughout the observation period (approx. 29. 5 C). Peak values of latent and sensible heat flux exceeded 400 and 100 W /sq m, respectively. The radar documented the change in precipitation vertical structure as the ship passed through regions of significant convection with echo tops approaching 14 km and 30 dBZ echo tops extending to near 9 km embedded in regions that were predominantly stratiform in nature. Single Doppler retrievals (Extended Velocity Azimuth Display) were conducted continuously at 10 -minute resolution for approximately 4 hours {{in the latter part of}} the observation period, and documented the transition from convection (low-level convergence, upper level divergence) to stratiform (mid-level convergence sandwiched between upper and lower level divergence) kinematic structure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple technique for creating regional, high-resolution, daytime and nighttime composites of sea surface temperature (SST) {{for use in}} operational numerical weather prediction (NWP). The composites are based on observations from NASA s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Aqua and Terra. The data used typically are available nearly in real time, are applicable anywhere on the globe, and are capable of roughly representing the diurnal cycle in SST. The composites resolution {{is much higher than}} that of many other standard SST products used for operational NWP, including the low- and high-resolution Real-Time Global (RTG) analyses. The difference in resolution is key because several studies have shown that highly resolved SSTs are important for driving the air sea interactions that shape patterns of static stability, vertical and horizontal wind shear, and divergence in the planetary boundary layer. The MODIS-based composites are compared to in situ observations from buoys and other platforms operated by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) off the coasts of New England, the mid-Atlantic, and Florida. Mean differences, mean absolute differences, and root-mean-square differences between the composites and the NDBC observations are all within tenths of a degree of those calculated between RTG analyses and the NDBC observations. This is true whether or not one accounts for the mean offset between the skin temperatures of the MODIS dataset and the bulk temperatures of the NDBC observations and RTG analyses. Near the coast, the MODIS-based composites tend to agree more with NDBC observations than do the RTG analyses. The opposite is true away from the coast. All of these differences in point-wise comparisons among the SST datasets are small compared to the 61. 08 C accuracy of the NDBC <b>SST</b> <b>sensors.</b> Because skin-temperature variations from land to water so strongly affect the development and life cycle of the sea breeze, this phenomenon was chosen for demonstrating the use of the MODIS-based composite in an NWP model. A simulated sea breeze in the vicinity of New York City and Long Island shows a small, net, but far from universal improvement when MODIS-based composites are used in place of RTG analyses. The timing of the sea breeze s arrival is more accurate at some stations, and the near-surface temperature, wind, and humidity within the breeze are more realistic...|$|R

Simulation studies of the velocity profiles resulting from the perturbation produced by a 1 deg/w/ 1 deg, 1 mgal anomaly as sensed by two GRM spacecraft orbiting altitudes of 160 km and 200 km respectively are described. It {{was found that the}} amplitude of the gravity signal drops off by a factor of 1. 5 when going from an altitude of 160 km to 200 km. By extrapolation the signal amplitude is further decreased by a factor of 3 when the orbital altitude is increased to 250 km. Thus the amplitude of the measurement drops off as the altitude is increased {{to the point where it}} is insignificant at the 1 mgal level for altitudes above 200 km. Spectral analysis results show that for a GRM mission altitude of 160 km and a system precision of 1 micrometer/sec, gravity field information can be sensed up to 230 cycles per orbital revolution - beyond that frequency the gravity signal is characterized by white noise. It follows that at the GRM mission altitude of 160 km and a satellite to satellite Doppler system precision of 1 micrometer per second, 1 / 1 deg gravity and geoid anomalies can be determined to an accuracy of 3. 4 mgals and 8. 6 cm respectively...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{experimental}} daily surface heat flux data set based on satellite observations to study subseasonal variability (periods shorter than 90 days) {{in the tropical}} Indian Ocean. We use incoming shortwave and longwave radiation from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, and sea surface temperature (<b>SST)</b> from microwave <b>sensors,</b> to estimate net radiative flux. Latent and sensible heat fluxes are estimated from scatterometer winds and near-surface air temperature and specific humidity from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) observations calibrated to buoy data. Seasonal biases in net heat flux are generally within 10 W m(- 2) of estimates from moorings, and the phases and amplitudes of subseasonal variability of heat fluxes are realistic. We find that the contribution of subseasonal changes in air-sea humidity gradients to latent heat flux equals or exceeds the contribution of subseasonal changes in wind speed in all seasons. SST responds coherently to subseasonal oscillations of net heat flux associated with active and suppressed phases of atmospheric convection in the summer hemisphere. Thus, subseasonal SST changes are mainly forced by heat flux in the northeast Indian Ocean in northern summer, and in the 15 degrees S- 5 degrees N latitude belt in southern summer. In the winter hemisphere, subseasonal SST changes are not a one-dimensional response to heat flux, implying that they are mainly due to oceanic advection, entrainment, or vertical mixing. The coherent evolution of subseasonal SST variability and surface heat flux suggests active coupling between SST and large-scale, organized tropical convection in the summer season...|$|R
40|$|To assess climatic {{changes in}} sea surface {{temperature}} (SST), {{changes in the}} measurement method with time {{and the effect of}} these changes on the mean SST must be quantified. Observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) have been analyzed for the period from 1970 to 1997 using both SST measurement metadata contained within the dataset and a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) catalog of observing ships. The WMO metadata were particularly important in identifying engine-intake SSTs during the 1970 s, but increased method identification over the entire period. There are strong regional variations in the preferred SST measurement method, with engine-intake SST most common in the Pacific and bucket SST preferred by countries bordering the Atlantic. The number of engine-intake SSTs increases over time and becomes more numerous than buckets by the early 1980 s. There are significant differences between SST observations made by different methods. The rounding of reports is more common for engine-intake SST than for either bucket or hull <b>sensor</b> <b>SST,</b> which degrades its quality. Significant time-varying biases exist between SST derived from buckets and from engine intakes. The SST difference has a strong seasonal signal with bucket SST being relatively cold in winter, probably resulting from heat loss from the buckets, and warm in summer, probably resulting from solar warming or the sampling of a shallow warm layer.

40|$|International audienceThe frontal {{activity}} in coastal regions remains a research field where {{a large number}} of open questions needs to be addressed to quantify the potential impact of these processes on dependent systems (e. g. biogeochemical activity). Spatial and seasonal distributions of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fronts (∼ 1 - 100 km) in the vicinity of main French rivers, Gironde and Loire, are explored over the continental shelf North of 45 °N in the Bay of Biscay. A highresolution (1 km spatial and daily temporal resolutions) dataset of 11 years (2003 to 2013) remotely sensed <b>SST</b> by MODIS <b>sensor</b> onboard Aqua and Terra satellites has been investigated and compared with coastal numerical model experiments. The detection and characterization fronts with fluctuating amplitudes is achieved through the Singularity Analysis (i. e. the process of calculating the degree of regularity or irregularity of a function at each point in a domain). Seasonality of {{frontal activity}} in the Bay of Biscay is then described based on the long-term satellite SST archive and coastal operational model simulations. The identifiedhot spots of higher frontal occurrences correspond on one hand to previously observed features (e. g. tidal fronts) but also reveal new features. These are investigated to identify fine-scale dynamical drivers. In winter, density fronts are prominent in a coastal strip where freshwater influence is important. In spring, this strip diminishes as plumes detach from the coast, while tidal fronts become apparent in other regions. In summer, tidal fronts in Ushant region and internal wave activity along the shelf break dominate. In autumn, coastal density fronts due to freshwater inputs reappear as these inputs increase, and reduced stratification causes a weakening of the Ushant and shelf break fronts. Additional information and an effort to dynamically interpret these fronts, based on a systematic investigation of the whole seasonal cycle and including modeling insights from coastal operational oceanography, complement the description of frontal activity in the Bay of Biscay...|$|R
40|$|Ocean surface {{processes}} {{occur at}} different time and spatial scales. Algal blooms {{in particular are}} transient, naturally occurring phenomena that {{are central to the}} structure and functioning of the marine food web. The monitoring of algal bloom events in coastal waters has become increasingly important because of the growing environmental pressure on coastal ecosystems. Ocean colour remote sensing is the only technique capable of monitoring the cyclicity and spread of algal blooms over large scales of space and time. The high temporal frequency at which satellite images are acquired allow for the integration of climatology and time series of satellite-derived surface water properties for detecting annual and seasonal trends, as well as discrete algal bloom events. The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate the dynamics of algal blooms in the tropical coastal, lagoonal and reef waters of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, using satellite data from the European Space Agency Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) ocean colour and National Aeronautical and Space Administration Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Sea Surface Temperature (<b>SST)</b> <b>sensors.</b> To achieve this research aim, it was necessary to first characterise the inherent optical properties (IOPs) and concentrations of chlorophyll (Chl), coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and total suspended solids (TSS) in the GBR surface waters. A total of 129 in situ samples from various campaigns carried out in the GBR between 2002 and 2005 was used to optically characterise six regions. Most of the stations sampled during these field campaigns were in coastal waters. The results of this first objective illustrated the optical complexity of the GBR waters and emphasized the need to regionalize the GBR system based on water quality parameters. Spatially, the surface waters of the Fitzroy, a shallow, macrotidal estuary located in the southern GBR, exhibited the strongest variability in all the inherent optical properties and biogeochemical concentrations sampled. CDOM slopes were found to increase from the reef to the coastal waters of the GBR, and the CDOM properties of the Fitzroy were of autochthonous and terrestrial origins. The relationship between the phytoplankton absorption at 440 nm and Chl was found to differ from reference models. Picophytoplankton (< 2 Âµm) was the dominant fraction of the phytoplankton community in most regions, with a relative contribution of 65 % in the reef waters. Temporally, optical properties and concentrations were higher in most regions during wet season months (December to April). However, additional field measurements are required to supplement this limited (N= 8) wet season dataset and to help better characterise the effects of the wet season on the GBR waters. A second objective was to determine the most suitable ocean colour sensor for detecting and monitoring algal blooms in the GBR waters. Despite a less frequent (two- to three-day) revisit cycle than MODIS, MERIS was found to be better suited for this task. MERIS has more (15) and better positioned spectral bands than MODIS that allow for the retrieval of water quality parameters as well as the detection of algal surface expressions. This second objective also demonstrated that the MERIS Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin (FUB) Algal 2 was the most robust and accurate algorithm for the retrieval of Chl (the main proxy for phytoplankton biomass) in the GBR waters. The FUB Chl algorithm was empirically fine-tuned to improve its performance at retrieving Chl in the GBR waters using in situ Chl and phytoplankton absorption (440 nm) data. However, FUB underestimated TSS and CDOM in the GBR waters. The MERIS Fluorescence Line Height (FLH), the Spectral Shape (SS) and the Maximum Chl Index (MCI) were also tested for the retrieval of fluorescence and algal surface expressions. The MERIS FLH was used to provide additional information on algal status from the FUB Chl, and the MCI was selected as the best performing algorithm for the retrieval of surface algal expressions. The MCI was subsequently used for the mapping and monitoring of Trichodesmium sp. blooms, a phytoplankton taxa that regularly occurs in the GBR. The third objective focused on the four-year statistical analysis of five MERIS ocean colour products (Chl, CDOM, TSS, FLH, MCI) and MODIS SST to extract spatial and temporal (annual and seasonal) patterns of phytoplankton bloom variability in the GBR between 2006 and 2010. Monthly climatology maps, latitude-time plots (HovmÃ¶ller plots) and time-series helped describe the dynamics of algal blooms in the coastal, midshelf and oligotrophic lagoonal waters of the GBR. Although the period of time explored was limited to four years, these results provided complementary information to the previous findings: the GBR is a complex system in both optical properties and bloom dynamics. Monthly climatology maps and HovmÃ¶ller plots of Chl demonstrated that a seasonal, cross-shelf increase in phytoplankton growth occurred during the wet season months. They also revealed that the southern GBR (19 ï‚°- 26 ï‚°S) was characterized by a higher phytoplankton biomass in comparison to the northern GBR (10 ï‚°- 19 ï‚°S). This spatial difference is due to the southern GBR hosting larger river catchments, therefore influencing the quantity of nutrients delivered to the GBR nearshore waters during freshwater runoffs. The waters of the northern GBR however showed pulses of Chl of short durations likely associated with intense, but short-lived, small tropical river flows. Time-series of Chl for the coastal, midshelf and lagoonal waters, extracted for both the southern and northern GBR, exhibited significantly different patterns. These six time-series confirmed that phytoplankton blooms were spatially heterogeneous and that their timing and magnitude varied from year to year. The frequency of these Chl cycles was found to decrease from the coastal to the oligotrophic lagoonal waters, the latter being characterised mostly by a strong seasonal cycle during the wet season. The year 2009 was higher in Chl, in particular during the wet season months. This was likely the result of an enhanced nutrient supply from the ecological disturbance caused by tropical cyclone Hamish in March 2009. The north-to-south track of cyclone Hamish was unusual because it followed the whole GBR matrix, whereas tropical cyclones occurring on the east coast of Australia are usually confined to the northern GBR (north of Cairns). Finally, algal surface expressions of what was believed to be Trichodesmium sp. blooms were found to occur mainly between August and December in the southern GBR, and predominantly in the oligotrophic lagoonal waters. The frequency and intensity of these blooms of cyanobacteria were found to increase over the four years of this study. It is possible that stronger water column mixing in the northern GBR hampers the development of regular Trichodesmium sp. blooms, while predation or competition limit their occurrence in the coastal and midshelf waters. Phytoplankton dynamics in tropical marine ecosystems have been largely under-studied and this research partly addressed this knowledge gap. The findings of this work are of direct benefit to Australiaâ€™s capacity for environmental detection, monitoring and prediction of algal bloom events in the GBR, providing trends in phytoplankton biomass across the entire shelf during a period of four years. Despite the limited study period and some possible artefacts in the data, the results of this PhD research provided an assessment of algal bloom dynamics in the GBR waters by the combination of six satellite products. Future research would include the merging of MERIS and MODIS ocean colour products to complement the limited temporal sampling frequency of MERIS. Additional satellite datasets on wind speed and direction, as well as sea surface height would benefit to this study because it would allow the analysis of their effects on algal bloom occurrences in the GBR. For instance, it has been commonly reported in the literature that wind speed and the occurrence and distribution of Trichodesmium sp. bloom events are related...|$|R

While these processes are widely studied in offshore regions, their intensity and spatio-temporal frequencies over the continental shelves remain little known. In this context, this study proposes to explore the spatial and seasonal distributions, and development mechanisms of frontal structures (∼ 1 - 100 km) in river plume boundaries from the main French rivers (Gironde and Loire) over the continental shelf north of 45 °N in the Bay of Biscay. A dataset of 11 years’ (2003 to 2013) nighttime remotely sensed Sea Surface Temperature (<b>SST)</b> by MODIS <b>sensor</b> onboard Aqua and Terra satellites has been constructed. This dataset has ∼ 1 km spatial and daily temporal resolutions. Front detection is achieved through the Singularity Analysis (i. e. the process of calculating the degree of regularity or irregularity of a function at each point in a domain) such that negative values of Singularity Exponents (SE) indicate that the signal is irregular/discontinuous and encounter abrupt shifts (strong frontal activity) while positive values indicate regular/continuous signals (weak frontal activity). The spatial distributions of front occurrence frequency, defined as the percentage of number of times the pixel is a front pixel out of the times that pixel is cloud-free, are investigated seasonally. Seasonality of frontal activity in the Bay of Biscay is shown for the first time from the long-term satellite SST archive. The localized hot spots of higher frontal occurrences allow distinguishing the potential drivers in action. It has been revealed that the occurrence of frontal activity over the shelf varies spatially, and has a significant seasonal behavior. Results showed that in winter, density fronts are prominent in an alongshore band in vicinity of the fresh water occupied coast; in spring, winter structures were diminished to estuaries and tidal fronts started to appear; in summer, tidal fronts in Ushant region and internal wave activity along shelf break dominated; in autumn, alongshore density fronts re-appeared as the fresh water increased, and weakened stratification caused a dispersion of Ushant and shelf break fronts.

The SST needs to be investigated for various scientific phenomenon such as salinity, potential fishing zone, sea level rise, upwelling, eddies, cyclone predictions. On the other hands, high spatial resolution SST maps can illustrate eddies and sea surface currents. Also, near real time producing of SST map is suitable for weather forecasting and fishery applications. Therefore satellite remote sensing with wide coverage of data acquisition capability can use as real time tools for producing <b>SST</b> dataset. Satellite <b>sensor</b> such as AVHRR, MODIS and SeaWIFS are capable of extracting brightness values at different thermal spectral bands. These brightness temperatures are the sole input for the SST retrieval algorithms. Recently, Landsat- 8 successfully launched and accessible with two instruments on-board: (1) the Operational Land Imager (OLI) with nine spectral bands in the visual, near infrared, and the shortwave infrared spectral regions; and (2) the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) with two spectral bands in the long wavelength infrared. The two TIRS bands were selected to enable the atmospheric correction of the thermal data using a split window algorithm (SWA). The TIRS instrument {{is one of the}} major payloads aboard this satellite which can observe the sea surface by using the split-window thermal infrared channels (CH 10 : 10. 6 μm to 11. 2 μm; CH 11 : 11. 5 μm to 12. 5 μm) at a resolution of 30 m. The TIRS sensors have three main advantages comparing with other previous sensors. First, the TIRS has two thermal bands in the atmospheric window that provide a new SST retrieval opportunity using the widely used split-window (SW) algorithm rather than the single channel method. Second, the spectral filters of TIRS two bands present narrower bandwidth than that of the thermal band on board on previous Landsat sensors. Third, TIRS is one of the best space born and high spatial resolution with 30  m. in this regards, Landsat- 8 can use the Split-Window (SW) algorithm for retrieving SST dataset. Although several SWs have been developed to use with other sensors, some adaptations are required in order to implement them for the TIRS spectral bands. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a SW, adapted for use with Landsat- 8 TIRS data, along with its accuracy assessment. In this research, that has been done for modelling SST using thermal Landsat 8 -imagery of the Persian Gulf. Therefore, by incorporating contemporary in situ data and SST map estimated from other sensors like MODIS, we examine our proposed method with coefficient of determination (R 2) and root mean square error (RMSE) on check point to model SST retrieval for Landsat- 8 imagery.
