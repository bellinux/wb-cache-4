40|$|In this diploma work a {{model of}} an {{integrated}} pulp and paper mill has been evaluated and analysed. The pulp mill is a reference model mill, defined in the research program “The Ecocyclic Pulp Mill”, and it consists of the best technology built and run in the Nordic pulp and paper industry. The paper mill however, is modelled in this study. The heat demand of the mill has been analysed using Pinch Technology. The paper mill in the reference model mill is a conventional paper mill, and consists of wire and press section with a white water system, and a <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> followed by a soft calender. Since the dryer is the most energy demanding section of the paper mill, mainly different {{ways to improve the}} drying section have been studied. Three different ways to change the dryer section have been studied, higher dry solids content before the <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> and a combination of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> with either an impulse dryer or a superheated steam dryer. Apart from the mill’s energy demand, changes in fuel costs and emissions of carbon dioxide with the different dryer models have been studied. When part of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> is replaced with an impulse dryer or a superheated steam dryer the live steam demand decreases, while the electricity or natural gas demand increases. A reduction in steam consumption, i. e. reduction in steam production, also leads to a decrease of the electricity production in the mill. To compensate this the mill has to buy externally produced electricity. The bark, which has been made available through the reduced production of steam, can be used to decrease the deficit of bark in the mill. In the base case the reference model mill has a heat demand of 9, 46 GJ/t paper, while the <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> has a heat demand of 3, 77 GJ/t paper. If the dry solids content increases with five percentage units, the heat demand in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> decreases with 15 %. When part of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> is replaced with an impulse dryer drying the paper to a dryness of 65 % the steam demand decreases in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> section with 42 %. At the same time the electricity or natural gas demand increases with 290 or 326 kWh/t paper respectively. When using a combination of a superheated steam <b>dryer</b> and <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer,</b> where 50 % of the drying is carried out in each of the dryer, the live steam demand decreases with roughly 50 %, while the natural gas demand increases with 622 kWh/t paper. The reduced steam demand and the raised electricity and natural gas demand leads to decreased emissions of carbon dioxide in the mill, if it can be assumed that the bark that is made available is used to replace oil elsewhere. The emissions decreases with 111 and 148 kg/t paper for the combination of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> and an impulse dryer heated with electricity or natural gas respectively, and with 197 kg/t paper when using the combination of a superheated steam <b>dryer</b> and a <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer.</b> The fuel cost increases when using a combination of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> and an impulse dryer or a superheated steam dryer, compared to only using a <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer.</b> The cost increases with 48 SEK/t paper for the impulse dryer when heated by electricity, and 26 SEK/t paper when heated by natural gas. For the superheated steam dryer the fuel cost increases with 51 SEK/t paper. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> is therefore a better alternative regarding fuel cost...|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{a numerical}} {{approach to the}} search of a maximum heat transfer rate density (the overall heat transfer dissipated per unit of volume) from a two-dimensional laminar multiscale array of cylinders in cross-flow under an applied fixed pressure drop and subject to the constraint of fixed volume. It was furthermore assumed that the flow field was steady state and incompressible. The configuration had {{two degrees of freedom}} in the stationary state, that is, the spacing between the cylinders and the diameter of the smaller cylinders. The angular velocity of the cylinders was in the range 0 ≤ ϖ, ≤ 0. 1. Two cylinders of different diameters were used, in the first case, the cylinders were aligned along a plane which lay on their centrelines. In the second case, the cylinder leading edge was aligned along the plane that received the incoming fluid at the same time. The diameter of the smaller cylinder was fixed at the optimal diameter obtained when the cylinders were stationary. Tests were conducted for co-rotating and counterrotating cylinders. The results were also compared with results obtained in the open literature and the trend was found to be the same. Results showed that the heat transfer from a rotating array of cylinders was enhanced in certain cases and this was observed for both directions of rotation from an array which was aligned on the centreline. For rotating cylinders with the same leading edge, there is heat transfer suppression and hence the effect of rotation on the maximum heat transfer rate density is insignificant. This research is important in further understanding of heat transfer from rotating cylinders, which can be applied to applications ranging from contact <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryers</b> in the chemical processes industry and rotating cylinder electrodes to devices used for roller hearth furnaces.

40|$|Pulp from {{recycled}} paper products contains various waxes, glues, adhesives, filler, and inorganics that are collectively {{referred to as}} contaminants. Contaminants that are not drained out during the forming process are trapped in the sheet and carried down the paper machine. These contaminant particles and contaminants in solution can become deposited on the <b>dryer</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The contaminants which deposit on the <b>dryer</b> <b>cylinders</b> lead to reduced quality and production of paper on the machine. The process by which contaminants are deposited on a <b>dryer</b> <b>cylinder</b> has not been explored at a fundamental level. Rather, quick industrial fixes have been tested to try and eliminate the contaminant deposition and only reductions in deposition have been achieved. The literature reviewed does not relate the flow of particle suspensions through porous media to the heat transfer and fluid dynamics processes associated with drying paper. The experiments in the literature showed the general trends of particle and dye distributions across the thicknesses of different porous media during forming or filtration processes. Filler and fines distribution {{were not able to}} be changed by flows induced by pressing a sheet. The mechanisms for how particles move through porous media found in the literature were a basis for what kind of phenomena would be expected in the particle flow experiments. A means of completely eliminating sticky deposits could be found by examining the parameters which contribute to the deposition process. The hypothesis proposed in this thesis is that contaminant particles and liquid containing contaminants are transported to the dryer can surface by liquid flows induced by the drying process. By performing particle flow experiments during drying, bounds for the particle size, initial drying surface temperature, drying time, and initial solids content will be determined for which the hypothesis is true. The particle and dye transport studies performed showed an array of processes at work simultaneously. The results from the particle and dye transport studies show that a particle diameter of ~ 1. 0 and # 956;m or less, handsheet solids content of less than 30 %, open sheet structure and a high surface drying temperature (200 C) were needed to create a significant change in filler and dye distribution across the thickness of a handsheet.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} at Mondi kraft {{pulp and paper}} mill located in Sweden, Kramfors Dynäs due to the low return rate of condensate. Currently, the return rate is only at 65 - 75 %. This is problematic as the demineralization process is operating on full capacity and thus requires a reduced make-up water need. The production of demineralized water is an expensive process due to large requirements of chemicals and pump-energy, but also due {{to the cost of}} raw water and maintenance. Therefore the purpose of the work was to investigate the possibility to increase the condensate return rate and thus reduce the need of make-up water. The investigation was performed during normal production rates to simplify the interpretations. The steam and condensate system was mapped and extracted flows were identified, measured and marked on map. The extracted flows were investigated in more detail and characterized as either consumed in a process or lost to sewer or atmosphere. In the work, both minor and major improvements were investigated. Minor improvements are accomplished with small intervention measures and could be done with small or no investments costs. Major improvements require large investments costs and further investigations. Six different processes were found to constitute the total production of make-up water. These are the free blowing of excess steam, soot blowing steam, paper machine 6, de-aerating process in the feed water tanks, digester process and steam- & condensate leaks along the pipe network. Improvements with the category of minor were found to reduce steam and condensate consumption by 22 - 23 ton/h. This implies a reduction by 30 - 32 % of the added make-up water, including an annual financial benefit of 3, 3 - 3, 9 MSEK. Additionally 0, 41 - 0, 82 MSEK could be gained annually by improving the insulation on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> heads. The make-up water would be further reduced if insulation jackets and inspection programs were implemented on equipments along the steam lines. Two major improvements are recommended. The first major improvement involves elimination of the free blowing of excess steam. This could be accomplished by drying the bark before combustion. The added make-up water would be reduced by 25 % and with the possibility to sell the dried bark during low steam production. The second major improvement involves the digester process, where the consumptions of medium pressure steam could be reduced by replacing steam with liquor-steam from the strong liquor accumulator. Medium pressure steam could instead be converted into electricity by the turbine...|$|R
50|$|A Yankee dryer is a {{pressure}} vessel {{used in the}} production of tissue paper. On the Yankee dryer, the paper goes from approximately 42-45% dryness to just over 89% dryness. In industry, MG <b>cylinders</b> or Yankee <b>dryers</b> are primarily used to remove excess moisture from pulp that is about to be converted into paper. The Yankee cylinder can be equipped with a doctor blade and sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Creping is done by the Yankee's doctor blade that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface thereby crêping the paper. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the doctor blade, speed difference between the yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.|$|R

40|$|Cocoa pod husk is the bigest {{component}} of cocoa pod, about 70 % of total ht of mature pod, and to potentially used as organic compost source. Poten tial solid waste of cocoa pod husk from a cocoa processing centre is about 15 — 22 m 3 /ha/year. A cocoa plantation needs about 20 — 30 ton/ha/year of organic matters. One of important steps in compos processing technology of cocoa pod solid waste is drying process. Organic compost with 20 % moisture content is more easy in handling, application, storage and distribution. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed and tested a horizontal <b>cylinder</b> type rotary <b>dryer</b> for drying process of organic compos from solid waste cocoa pod with kerosene burner as energy sources. The {{objective of this}} research is to study performance of a horizontal <b>cylinder</b> type rotary <b>dryer</b> using kerosene burner as energy source for drying process of organic compost from solid waste cocoa pod. The material used was solid waste cocoa pod with 70 — 75 % moisture content (wet basis), 70 % size particle larger than 4. 76 mm, and 30 % size particle less than 4. 76 mm, 690 — 695 kg/m 3 bulk density. Drying process temperatures treatment were 60 OC, 80 OC, and 100 OC, and cylinder rotary speed treatments were 7 rpm, 10 rpm, dan 16 rpm.

40|$|In {{production}} of tissue paper, the adhesion of a liquid adhesive creping aid, compound polymer, as creping aids on the Yankee dryer surface was investigated. A compound polymer was prepared based on mixing ratio of poly (amideamine) -epichlorohydrin resin (PAE) as an adhesive agent, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a modifier agent, and cationic fatty acid (CFA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as release agents. In order {{to simulate the}} Yankee <b>dryer</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the adherence of paper to the substrate that was coated by the compound polymer solution was measured using a peel strength test. Results indicated that increasing the percent of total solid content of compound polymer would increase peel strength of paper. Peel strength of paper increases if EG as a release agent is used.

40|$|The rimming flow of {{condensate}} in horizontal rotating <b>dryer</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{has been}} studied computationally by solving the full Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a volume of fluid method for tracking the free surface. It was shown that significant variations in both condensate velocity and thickness exist at moderate dryer speeds, whereas at higher speeds the variations are of less significance. Regardless of dryer speed or condensate film thickness, the film {{can be divided into}} two distinct regions: a viscous sub-layer adjacent to the cylinder wall and an inviscid, oscillating layer close to the free surface. The thickness of the viscous layer decreases as the dryer speed increases, whereas, for a certain speed, it is independent of the total film thickness. The computational results are compared with measurements of both the film thickness and the pressure normal to the cylinder wall. In both cases the agreement is excellent. Some implications for heat transfer through the condensate film are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The creping {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the Yankee <b>cylinder</b> <b>dryer</b> are key factors in a tissue paper mill, and they therefore need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. To this end it would be valuable {{to be able to make}} on-line measurements of Yankee coating thickness as well as the crepe structure of the tissue paper. The adhesion of paper to the cylinder affects the creping process and more information about the parameters that affect the adhesion is therefore of interest. To perform trials on a full scale or in a pilot plant is very costly and laboratory creping equipment is therefore sought after in order to be able to measure the adhesion force. The coating layer for use on the cylinder was analysed. It contained a large amount of carbohydrates and could not be considered transparent. The thickness of the coating layer was measured on a laboratory cylinder with a method based on fluorescence. An optical brightener was added to the coating chemicals and the coating layer was subjected to UV-radiation. The intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener was measured and gave an indication of the thickness of the coating layer. The equipment has to be further investigated before it is possible to implement the new sensor on-line. New creping equipment and an adhesion method were developed for use on a laboratory scale. The equipment can operate with different creping angles and the force needed to crepe the paper can be measured. The highest creping force was obtained for papers of high grammage, low dryness at adhesion, high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. A more direct method is to analyse the structure of the produced paper. Measurements were made on a tissue paper with an optical fibre sensor while the paper was travelling at low speed. The collected signal was mathematically analysed and the characteristic wavelength was calculated for different paper samples. These values were close to the wavelengths measured with an off line method by a commercial crepe analyser. Baksidestext The creping process is the heart of tissue paper manufacture. To control the process better, on-line measurements of paper structure and coating thickness are sought after. The creping is highly dependent on the adhesion of the paper to the Yankee dryer. To be able to measure the adhesion, laboratory creping equipment was also required. Different pulp parameters affect the adhesion and some of them have been investigated in this work. The coating on the Yankee cylinder consisted mainly of fiber fragments and could not be considered as transparent, which had to be considered when choosing a method to measure coating thickness. A method based on the light emitted from an optical brightener in the coating when subjected to UV-irradiation was used, but has to be further improved before it can be used on-line. A new laboratory creping method was developed to determine the adhesion between paper and metal, and the force needed to scrape off the paper with a doctor blade was measured. The highest creping force was obtained for papers made of pulp with a high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. An optical method using reflected light to measure crepe wavelength on-line was developed. The paper travelled under a sensor and the light collected was mathematically analyzed to determine the most common wavelength...|$|R

The innovative tea dryer was designed and fabricated targeting the group of farmers who cultivate bio tea /organic tea in few acres amidst of lot of constraints. Main challenge {{for the production of}} tea at small scale is consistent drying. Since drying is a key factor affecting the quality of the ultimate product of tea, the simulation results of the mathematical model explain the drying performance and how the physical model or the prototype could be scaled. The tea sector has always been a vital component of Sri Lanka’s economy. Sri Lanka as the third biggest tea producing country globally, has a production share of 9 % in the international sphere, and one of the world's leading exporters with a share of around 19 % of the global demand. The total extent of land under tea cultivation has been assessed at approximately 187, 309 hectares. Much of the growth boost in low grown tea production is attributed to the rise of the tea smallholders who are concentrated in the low-country. It is estimated that the smallholders occupy about 65 to 70 % of the tea extent in the country and their contribution to overall production has also now risen to around 65 to 70 %. Since the organic tea has an increasing demand and a good overseas market the tea cultivators of small holders are encouraged to produce organic tea. In the traditional or 'orthodox' procedure, the process used to make loose tea, the leaves must go through a process of Withering, Rolling, Oxidation /fermentation and Drying. Among these processes, withering and fermentation are taken place as a result of environmental conditions except rolling and drying. Rolling could be done manually on a serrated timber plank as the quantity is small. Dholes followed by the above three processes are fed into the innovative dryer for the making of tea. This dryer was completed as two stages with two cylinders having concentric perforated cylinders inside. Two hot air generators are being used to supply the hot air where saw dust is burnt for the supply of thermal energy for the first stage drying and the electricity is used in second stage drying, The cylinders are rotating at the same speed of about 12 rpm, and screw feeder is used for the feeding of material into rotating inner cylinder at a constant rate without the material being clogged at the entrance. Analyzing the direction of material and hot air flow inside the <b>cylinder</b> the <b>dryer</b> {{is said to be the}} type of cross-flow co-current. The two drums and the material feeder are powered by a single motor of ½ hp with a gearing ratio of 1 : 30. As the heat transfer is direct from the heat transfer medium to product the dryer is also called direct or adiabatic dryer. The adiabatic dryer is more closely related to the humidification process than is the indirect one. As per the raw material and other drying parameters, the dryer type for the innovative dryer has been selected as cross flow, co current rotary type considering physical properties of the drying materials. Testing of this innovative dryer under real conditions and its results are further illustrated in the report. Based on the physical and thermodynamic parameters of the design and experimental data, a mathematical model has been developed studying various drying models and simulation methods using experimental figures in the report in details.

40|$|The creping {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the Yankee cylinder are the key factors in the production process. They need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. A natural coating always develops {{on the surface of the}} Yankee cylinder due to evaporation from dissolved and dispersed substances and to fiber fragments that remain on the surface after creping. Nevertheless, coating chemicals are sprayed onto the Yankee surface in order to modify the adhesion between the paper and the <b>dryer</b> <b>cylinder.</b> To be able to control the process, on-line measurements of coating thickness as well as of the crepe structure of the tissue paper produced would be very valuable. In the work described in this thesis, the coating layer was analyzed chemically and morphologically to provide information about the coating layer before starting any on-line measurements. The chemicals added and the constituents of the pulps are known to the paper producers, but what is left on the cylinder and whether there are different layers of coating still remain to be investigated. The chemical analysis indicated that the adhesive content was higher in an inner layer of the coating than in the outer layer. The relative amount of polyamide-amine resin calculated on the basis of the nominal nitrogen content in the resin was low indicating that the coating consisted of a significant amount of carbohydrates or other substances. The coating layer could not be considered transparent. It was observed that the coating was thick and appeared patch-wise and that it contained fiber fragments. Measurements on a laboratory scale, to further be applied on-line on the tissue machine, have been investigated and evaluated in this study. The thickness of the coating layer on a laboratory dryer has been measured. The method was based on fluorescence with an optical brightener added to the coating chemicals sprayed on the Yankee dryer. With a UV-LED (Ultra Violet - Light Emitting Diode) the coating layer was exposed to UV-light and the intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener in the layer was measured. The intensity in the trials with different thickness of the coating and no coating was scattered and no trend could be seen between the different trial points. Attempts were made to measure the wavelength of the tissue paper produced with an optical fiber perpendicular to and at an angle to the paper surface.
