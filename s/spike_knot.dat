40|$|Nine Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trials, {{situated}} {{north of}} latitude 6 I 0 N, were studied. The frequency of trees with straight stems {{and one or}} more spike knots was evaluated at a tree age of 27 - 29 years. A model was developed describing geographical variation and was based on 19 provenance trials {{from different parts of}} Sweden. North of latitude 6 I 0 N, an average of 30 per cent of the stems were straight enough to produce a first-class bottom log of sawtimber. In addition, 47 per cent of the trees had no spike knots up to 5 m height. Significant variation between provenances was found in stem straightness and <b>spike</b> <b>knot</b> frequency in most trials. Provenances transferred southwards were straighter and had fewer spike knots than the corresponding local provenance. The frequencies and numbers of straight stems and trees without spike knots were higher at 1. 25 m spacing than at 2. 0 m spacing. The general models for geographical variation indicate that the highest number of straight stems without spike knots may be found between latitudes 58 " and 65 "N and at altitudes below 250 m...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{provenance}} trials {{located between}} latitude 55 o 37 ' and 60 o 32 ' were studied. Over all locations. {{at the age}} of 30 years. 40 % of the trees had at least one <b>spike</b> <b>knot</b> up to 5 metres height. Furthermore about 60 % of the trees were not straight enough to produce a first class bottom log of saw timber. Significant differences existed between provenances for both traits. Environmental differences also had a major effect on Scots pine quality. The southern. tallest. provenances were less straight than northern ones. On the contrary. within each provenance the tall trees were also straighter and had less spike knots than short trees. Spacing effects showed that the number of trees suitable for first class saw timber were approximately 50 per cent higher in the 1. 25 m spacing than in the 2. 0 m spacing. The joint effect of provenance transfer and spacing on stem straightness. indicated that with the same minimum requirements. a change in spacing from 2. 0 m to 1. 25 m. corresponded to the effect of a southward provenance transfer of 2 o of latitude...|$|E
40|$|Six 30 -year-old, fast-grown Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) {{stands in}} Sweden, {{comprising}} {{a total of}} 700 stems, were examined. Four had been planted on agricultural land and two on very fertile forest land. The characteristics studied were branch properties, defects and basic density {{as well as the}} graded quality of timber, assessed by Swedish export grading, and the modulus of elasticity, assessed by machine strength grading (EJ. Our aim was to determine how the wood properties of Norway spruce grown on agricultural land differ from those of spruce grown on fertile forest land. The only differences found between the two sites concerned defects, especially spike knots. These were more common in the agricultural stands, where the frequency of logs with at least one <b>spike</b> <b>knot</b> was 33. 7 %, whereas the corresponding figure in the forest stands was 6. 9 %. The graded quality was low for boards from all stands according to both export and strength gradings. Only 7. 1 % of the boards were considered to be of highest export grade, u/s. Eighty-two per cent were approved for structural use, i. e., strength grade T 18 or better. Basic density and annual ring width were the only characters that explained significant amounts of variation in EM. A model for predicting the EM of boards from a stand is presented. Wood properties could be improved silviculturally by thinning regimes and technically by cross-cutting and using the butt part of the tree for purposes other than sawing...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis was {{to find out how}} the wood quality differed among Silver birch provenances. The study was conducted in family, provenance and tree species experiments in SW Sweden. External features like stem straightness, <b>spike</b> <b>knots,</b> double leader, diameter, tree height, leaning and other defects were measured and analyzed. Significant differences were found between birch families and provenances for a number of measured parameters. In the family experiment, significant differences between families were found for the parameters straight trees and diameter while {{no significant differences were found}} for others measured parameters like <b>spike</b> <b>knots,</b> forking, leaning and tree height. The local provenance “Tönnersjöheden” had the best overall quality and growth in the provenance experiment while Kulbäcksliden provenance (North Sweden) had a low overall quality. In the tree species experiment, significant differences between provenances were only found for the frequency of straight and leaning trees. Asarum was suggested a good quality provenance with an overall high quality performance and a low percentage of leaning trees while Visingsö was judged a bad quality provenance with a high percentage of crooked stems and a many leaning trees...|$|R
40|$|Independent of genotype, {{increased}} spacing {{results in}} increased branch diameter of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), but on different levels for different genotypes. Frequency of defects like <b>spike</b> <b>knots</b> and crooked stems are under stronger genetic than silvicultural control. Simultaneous improvement of {{rate of growth}} and timber properties is feasible. Deteriorating of both factors can happen rapidly at a negative selection. This needs consideration when selecting seed trees for natural regeneration. A defect like stem cracking of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) only manifests itself under drought stress when certain genetic and environmental prerequisites are present, like high fertility and wide spacing. This emphasize the fact that new silvicultural methods may reveal genetic weaknesses...|$|R
30|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} for detecting localized defects such as edge knots using a bending deflection curve. The coordinates of a bottom edge (edgeline) of an unloaded piece of lumber are extracted from a digital image, and a bending deflection curve is obtained from the displacement of the edgeline of the lumber using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Depending on the knots within the beam, the bending deflection curve is shifted from the curve of a defect-free beam. The measured bending deflection curve is regressed to a theoretical curve by elementary beam theory. A finite element method (FEM) model of the beams including defects as simplified knot structure has been performed. Comparison between the bending experiment and FEM analysis shows that cross-sectional reductions cause characteristic variations in the bending deflection curves depending on the position of encased knots, and local grain distortions cause variations in the curves depending on the direction of <b>spike</b> <b>knots.</b> Using the residual variance between the measured deflection curve and a polynomial regression curve, {{it is possible to}} detect knots at which failures initiate.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} {{underlying}} this thesis was to quantify the genetic variability of important traits used for ranking candidate trees in northern Swedish Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) breeding populations, with special focus on growth and survival and the genetic association between these traits. The thesis reports studies based on simulated data, field data from 28 progeny trials, and early test data from four artificial freezing experiments. The field and freezing experiments comprised half-sib progenies of Swedish and Finnish Scots pine plus-trees. The field trials (9 – 21 years old) were established {{in a wide range}} of environmental conditions. The traits analyzed were survival, tree height, <b>spike</b> <b>knot</b> frequency, branch diameter, branch angle, stem straightness, and susceptibility to infections of the fungi Phacidium infestans, Gremmeniella abietina, Melampsora pinitorqua and Lophodermella sulcigena. In the freezing experiments cold hardiness of 1 -year-old seedlings was assessed after freezing in a climate chamber. In the simulation study the accuracy of single- and multiple-trait REML procedures was examined by studying estimates of within-individual genetic correlations between a categorical trait and a continuous trait with selectively deleted records. The average bias generated by multiple-trait REML was generally low, whereas single-trait REML systematically provided too moderate estimates. The variation among the correlations was generally high, showing that single-site estimates might be seriously misleading. The average within-site genetic correlation between tree height and field survival was generally positive, whereas corresponding between-site estimates were positive when the tree heights were assessed in harsh environments, but negative if the tree heights were assessed in mild environments (0. 05 and – 0. 25, respectively). The genetic correlation between cold hardiness and field survival was on average positive (0. 30), while the average correlation between cold hardiness and tree height was negative (– 0. 23). For the quality characters and susceptibility to infections of the pathogens, genetic associations with cold hardiness could not be verified. The most notable result was the contrasting correlation patterns across environments between tree height and field survival in the material sampled. The results show that tree heights from young trials located in harsh areas may reflect tree health and survival ability to a greater extent than growth capacity...|$|E
40|$|SCA has today almost 300 000 {{hectares}} of their forest land planted with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia). Due to initial extensive planting in the 1970 ies {{the area of}} lodgepole pine forests in the thinning age has grown rapidly {{from the end of}} the 1990 ies. During the years 1996 - 2005 first commercial thinning of lodgepole pine at SCA took place. The goal of the hereby presented study was to investigate the growth and stability in those firstly-thinned lodgepole pine stands a few years after thinning. Furthermore, the objective was to investigate the relationship between stand stability and different stand parameters. Additionally, lodgepole pine stem quality was estimated. The study is mainly based on the data collected during an inventory project carried out at SCA in 2008. Altogether 91 lodgepole pine stands in northern Sweden were measured after the first thinning. Since the same stands were inventoried in 2004 and 2005, chosen results such as thinning grade, strip-road width and the distance between strip roads were used as additional data in correlation matrix. It was found that: • The average volume of dead trees in the inventoried 91 lodgepole pine stands was 3, 8 m 3 sk/ha being equal to 2, 3 % of the standing volume at the time of the inventory. • In terms of the number of trees, dead trees formed on average 3, 9 % of the total number of inventoried lodgepole pine trees. • No correlation between the volume of dead trees and soil type, soil moisture, stands dominant slope or stands dominant height above sea level was found. The share of the number of dead trees gave similar results. However, a positive and significant correlation between the share of the number of dead trees and soil moisture was found indicating higher risk for damages on wet soils than on dry soils. • Risk for mortality after thinning increases in stands thinned at larger dominant height, stands with high thinning grade and wide strip-roads. • No clear relation between types of dead trees and their distance to the closest trip-road centre was found. • 49 % of measured stems were estimated to have sawn-timber quality. The most frequent defect types were long crook and <b>spike</b> <b>knot...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to describe how yield and quality of Pinus contorta vary with locality and provenance in Sweden. The differences between Pinus contorta and Pinus sylvestris are also described. The material comprises four trials in a provenance series assessed at an age of 24 years. Assessments were made of height, diameter, different branch traits, stem straightness, number of <b>spike</b> <b>knots,</b> basic density and fibre properties. A comparison was made of Pinus sylvestris with similar dimensions. Based on sectional measurements of felled trees, volume production was estimated for lodgepole pine. There were large differences in volume production, stem form and quality among the four trials. To achieve a high volume production, site and soil evaluation and treatment are important. There were large and significant differences among provenances for most traits evaluated. The best provenances were of a more southern origin at the southern trials, Remningstorp and Bogesund, when compared to the northern trial, Lövsåsen. In comparison with P. sylvestris at the same dimensions a correct P. contorta source has thinner branches and a lower number of branches while fibre length is increased. Lodgepole pine could in some areas of southern and central Sweden produce more than Scots pine and possibly with an improvement in wood quality...|$|R
40|$|Timber {{quality in}} Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in Sweden has {{deteriorated}} during the 20 th century. A possible {{cause of this}} is the increasing proportion of timber that originates in planted stands. Two naturally regenerated and two planted pine stands, of the same genetic origin, were compared. The planted stands were established as spacing experiments (1. 25 x 1. 25 - 2. 5 x 2. 5 m) at Tönnersjöheden Experimental Forest (lat. 56 " 42 'N, long. l 3 " 06 'E, alt. 60 m). Volume growth and timber quality, i. e. taper, crookedness, number of branches, branch thickness, branch angle, crown size, occurrence of <b>spike</b> <b>knots</b> and damage were compared. The quality of dominant and co-dominant trees was higher in the naturally regenerated stands than in the planted stands. Of the planted trees, only 25 % were straight, compared with 86 % of naturally regenerated trees. In the planted stands, the mean diameter of the thickest branch below 2 m was 23 mm, compared to 15 mm in the naturally regenerated stands. Timber quality and planting density were also positively correlated, quality being very poor at the widest spacings. Volume growth at initial spacings of 1. 75 x 1. 75 m and denser was estimated to be 5 - 10 % higher than that in the naturally regenerated stands...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of producing good quality beech timber seems to increase {{even if there}} are periods with low demands for it. Due to relatively substantial amount of fertile abandoned agriculture soils in Southern Sweden possibilities to increase the area occupied by beech seems to be high. Former studies indicate the positive influence of shelter on a survival of seedlings and quality formation e. g. crookedness, forking. The aim {{of the study was to}} answer the question: if the shelterwood benefit to better quality of beech and which admixture species creates the most favourable conditions for beech regeneration? Furthermore, the goal was to study a possible hampering of the beech growth, due to the shelter. The thesis comprises two parts. In the first literature was reviewed, in the second field results were analyzed. Different beech traits were compared in mixed and open grown stands. The following beech traits were measured and judged on sample trees: diameter in breast height, diameter of the thickest branch, tree class, stem crookedness, quality of the stem, shape of the tree and occurrence of the <b>spike</b> <b>knots.</b> The statistical analyze was made by means of ANOVA planned comparisons. Every measured row was regarded as an independent observation. Contrast was made between three groups; NS (no shelter) - pure beech and mixture with alder (control plot), LS (low shelter) – mixtures with hornbeam, aspen and spruce, HS (high shelter) – mixtures with larch, birch, and hybrid aspen. The results showed that mixing beech with fast growing species has a positive influence on beech quality formation, especially shape of the tree and commercial quality. There was no significant decrease of diameter and volume growth of beech, due to the shelter. Finally the admixtures with fast growing species were regarded as the most favourable for artificial regeneration of beech...|$|R
40|$|As {{reported}} in four appended papers (I-IV), effects of genotype (half-sib family) and initial spacing (I) or initial spacing (II) and various thinning methods (III & IV) on stands and properties of sawn-products were investigated in Scots pine (I & IV), lodgepole pine (II) and Norway spruce (III) stands in southern Sweden. Most of the analysed growth parameters {{were found to}} be affected by interaction between genotype and initial spacing, but the treatments had no significant interactive effects on most quality parameters (I). Very wide initial spacing (4 x 4 m, 625 trees/ha⁻¹) was found to negatively affect most growth and quality properties of lodgepole pine. Differences in effects of the density currently used in forestry (2500 trees/ha⁻¹) and a tested density (1100 trees/ha⁻¹, 3 x 3 m), were quite small, but increasing the spacing decreased frequencies of potential high quality trees. The results indicate that Scots pine and lodgepole pine have similar volume production rates and external quality traits (II). External properties of trees in the stands, particularly stem straightness and frequencies of quality defects (e. g. <b>spike</b> <b>knots),</b> were affected by the selection strategies applied in the thinning treatments. Thus, selection in thinnings should focus on these traits as they affect both the quality and grades of logs (III). The applied thinning treatments did not significantly influence board properties, such as basic density, Modulus of Elasticity and Knot Area Ratio. However, differences in these variables between outer and inner boards indicate that quality improvement might be connected to improvement in the growth of individual trees (IV). In summary, use of improved planting material and wider than currently applied 2 x 2 m spacing in combination with selection of high quality trees might lead to production of higher quality timber. However, the scope for selection decreases with time and since the Scots pine boards from thinned stands and unthinned stands did not significantly differ the target traits and both objectives and market conditions must be carefully considered. ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{different}} silvicultural treatments {{were studied}} in two experiments. In the first, mechanical scarification, slash removal, vegetation control, clear-cut age and seedling types were investigated {{with respect to}} frost injury to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings. Frost damage was also related to near-ground minimum temperature. In the other experiment, the effects of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) shelterwood density gradients, ranging from dense, uncut forest to complete clear-cuttings, were analysed. Near-ground temperature and radiation were monitored close to planted Norway spruce cuttings with a mobile data acquisition system. Growth, frost damage and chlorophyll fluorescence were monitored and analysed in relation to microclimate. Budburst date was estimated and the nocturnal near-ground temperature during the period when the seedlings were most susceptible to frost was analysed in both experiments. The shelterwood moderated near-ground radiation fluxes and diurnal temperature varia-tions, while the daily mean temperature was unaffected. Near-ground minimum tempera-tures were lower, and vertical temperature inversions were more pronounced in clear-cuttings than in shelterwoods, during clear and calm nights. The effects were most pro-nounced during a dry period. Budburst was delayed in the shelterwood. Later budburst was shown {{to reduce the risk}} of exposure to frosts during the most frost-susceptible period, when cuttings of two clones, differing in budburst date, were compared. Mechanical scarification reduced frost damage to seedlings in the first growing season, but neither herbicide treatment, nor mowing affected the frequency of frost injury. The frequency of frost injury was higher amongst containerised seedlings than amongst bare-rooted seedlings, especially in the first growing season. Neither clear-cut age nor slash removal affected the frequency of frost damage. Frost injury to the cuttings was reduced by the shelterwoods, since 80 % were damaged by frost in clear-cuts and low-density shelterwoods, 27 % in moderately dense shelterwoods, and only 5 % in dense shelter-woods. Of the climatic variables tested, the accumulated net and global radiation the day after a severe frost event were the most strongly correlated with the degree of frost injury among cuttings, and the variation in their Fv/Fm ratios, in the graduated shelterwoods. Frost injuries were rarely lethal, but reduced growth and increased the proportion of seed-lings with multiple leaders and <b>spike</b> <b>knots,</b> especially amongst seedlings that were re-peatedly injured over several years. Height growth was lower in the clear-cut area than in moderately dense shelterwoods during years with severe frost dam...|$|R
