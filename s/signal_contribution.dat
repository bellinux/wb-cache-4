For a simple two-layer system, such as powder in a plastic bottle, the powder spectrum can be measured without knowing the bottle material or its relative <b>signal</b> <b>contribution.</b> To do this without using an offset measurement would be severely restricted by photon shot noise generated by Raman and fluorescence signals originating from the surface layer.|$|E
40|$|Quantification of short-echo time proton {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy results in > 18 metabolite concentrations (neurochemical profile). Their quantification accuracy depends on {{the assessment of the}} contribution of macromolecule (MM) resonances, previously experimentally achieved by exploiting the several fold difference in T(1). To minimize effects of heterogeneities in metabolites T(1), the aim {{of the study was to}} assess MM <b>signal</b> <b>contributions</b> by combining inversion recovery (IR) and diffusion-weighted proton spectroscopy at high-magnetic field (14. 1 T) and short echo time (= 8 msec) in the rat brain. IR combined with diffusion weighting experiments (with δ/Δ = 1. 5 / 200 msec and b-value = 11. 8 msec/μm(2)) showed that the metabolite nulled spectrum (inversion time = 740 msec) was affected by residuals attributed to creatine, inositol, taurine, choline, N-acetylaspartate as well as glutamine and glutamate. While the metabolite residuals were significantly attenuated by 50 %, the MM signals were almost not affected (< 8 %). The combination of metabolite-nulled IR spectra with diffusion weighting allows a specific characterization of MM resonances with minimal metabolite <b>signal</b> <b>contributions</b> and is expected to lead to a more precise quantification of the neurochemical profile...|$|R

The outstanding accomplishments of this division in its first experience of combat, against a ruthless and battle-hardened enemy, were due primarily to his aggressive leadership. His continued emphasis on rigorous, intensive training, his indoctrination of his men with the proper mental conditioning for battle, and his comprehensive grasp of military tactics proved decisive factors in the grim fighting against the enemy-held strong points of Colle San Martino, Hill 121, Formia, Terracina and Mount Ceraso.

40|$|To {{develop a}} {{chemical}} shift encoding (CSE) approach for fluorine- 19 MRI of perfluorocarbons {{in the presence}} of multiple known fluorinated chemical species. A multi-echo CSE technique is applied for spectral separation of the perfluorocarbon perfluoro- 15 -crown- 5 -ether (PFCE) and isoflurane (ISO) based on their chemical shifts at 4. 7 [*]T. Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis is used to identify echo combinations with optimal signal-to-noise performance. <b>Signal</b> <b>contributions</b> are fit with a multispectral fluorine signal model using a non-linear least squares estimation reconstruction directly from k-space data. This CSE approach is tested in fluorine- 19 phantoms and in a mouse with a 2 D and 3 D spoiled gradient-echo acquisition using multiple echo times determined from Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis. Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis for PFCE and ISO separation shows signal-to-noise performance is maximized with a 0. 33 ms echo separation. A linear behavior (R(2) [*]=[*] 0. 987) between PFCE signal and known relative PFCE volume is observed in CSE reconstructed images using a mixed PFCE/ISO phantom. Effective spatial and spectral separation of PFCE and ISO is shown in phantoms and in vivo. Feasibility of a gradient-echo CSE acquisition and image reconstruction approach with optimized noise performance is demonstrated through fluorine- 19 MRI of PFCE with effective removal of ISO <b>signal</b> <b>contributions.</b> Magn Reson Med, 2017. © 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine...|$|R
