50|$|A <b>strap</b> <b>hinge</b> with a {{zero offset}} and an angle pintle matched to the {{thickness}} of the shutter will serve in every case. The shutter is removed {{from the face of the}} casing by {{the thickness of}} the shutter plus the diameter of the pintle pin. That leaves the shutter with a little breathing room and clears the corner of the casing - it's a nice angle between the shutter and house. The question of security - lifting the shutter and hinges from their pintles is resolved by installing the top pintle in the inverted position.|$|E
5000|$|Changes in {{construction}} are {{noted in the}} same period. Instead of building the structure around the heavy wooden frame of the window, you would see structures built with openings into which pre-fabricated windows were installed. The earliest examples I've seen date from around 1810 and utilized a very nice variation on the <b>strap</b> <b>hinge.</b> Instead of mounting the pintle {{to the surface of}} the structure a new form was designed. This pintle was a flat plate of about two inches high and notched to one half of its height and formed to a female barrel. Holes were punched in the side of the pintle and it was screwed directly to the side of the window before the window was installed on the structure. The strap hinges were modified to match the new pintles… the hinge was of the same width as the pintle and notched to one half of its height. A pin to mate with the female pintle was welded in the hinge. Examples of this type proved to be very durable and were in very regular and widespread use through the 1870s. If you look in any older town you can still see tons of examples of the female [...] "cup" [...] pintles still installed on the windows. (Often when the shutters were removed - usually in the 20th century - cast type pintles were hit with a hammer and broken off flush with the edge of the window. The shutters often found their way into the basements of the home to provide coal bins for newly installed central heat - or, as on our old farm, were nailed up in the barn to partition off pig sties or calf pens).|$|E
5000|$|Virtually {{all of the}} {{shutters}} in colonial times were hung with strap hinges - following the examples in Britain and on the continent. Strap hinges were strong and secure. The frames of windows were hewn from a single heavy piece of wood and offered plenty of [...] "meat" [...] into which a heavy pintle could be driven. The rails of the shutter were often six or eight inches high and provided {{plenty of room to}} position the <b>strap</b> <b>hinge</b> across the width of the shutter. The hinges were fastened to {{the shutters}} with rivets or nails driven through and clinched {{on the inside of the}} closed shutter. The nails and rivets were not only strong and secure, but they were also the cheapest fastener option. A relatively unskilled smith could produce them with only a hammer and small anvil and an open fire. Screws had to be forged, and then the threads hand-cut and the head had to be slotted - usually with a sharp chisel blow. Locks of the period followed the form of the strap hinges. The rolled barrel was replaced by a pin of about ½" [...] in diameter and twice the length of the thickness of the shutter mounted perpendicular to the face of the lock. The lock would be nailed or riveted on the lock rail of one shutter with the pin positioned about two inches beyond the edge of the shutter. The opposite shutter would be drilled through with a hole to accept the pin protruding from the lock. From the inside close the shutter with the hole, and then close the shutter with the lock. The lock pin passes through the hole and you drop a simple nail-like key into the hole in the lock pin and the shutter is virtually impregnable from the exterior. Closed eighteenth century shutters are very handsome with their five matching strap elements. It's quite impressive to see an early city block with the windows shuttered and the doors locked - there's just no way to get in.|$|E

40|$|DE 102007030036 A 1 UPAB: 20090116 NOVELTY - The tool has {{multiple}} drives and multiple grip fingers (2) on which force for performing gripping movement is directly exercisable or via a mechanism e. g. connecting rod, for power transmission from the drives. Each drive includes a hollow inflatable body (4) that is inflated under pressure during discharging of fluid e. g. gas, {{such that the}} force is directly exercised or via the power transmission mechanism. The grip fingers are connected with an elastic <b>strap</b> <b>hinge</b> (3), which causes resetting of the grip fingers into a starting position when the grip fingers tighten the inflatable body. USE - Gripping tool for handling and/or mounting of an object {{in a field of}} industrial manufacturing. ADVANTAGE - The tool is simple in structure and light in weight, works purely mechanically and avoids the requirement of electrical drives. The hollow inflatable body is inexpensive such that the tool is realized with a simple and economical manner...|$|E
25|$|The inset {{wicket door}} {{also has a}} pair of <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> that are {{miniature}} images of the larger door with similar construction from horizontal boards. There is a single deadbolt {{on the inside of}} the door.|$|R

50|$|Old Wilkes County Jail is a {{historic}} jail located at the Wilkes Heritage Museum in Wilkesboro, Wilkes County, North Carolina. It was built in 1858, and is a two-story, rectangular brick building with a low hipped roof. The jail retains much of its original hardware including <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> and several early locks.|$|R
50|$|The door is {{six feet}} wide and eight feet high and is of two thicknesses. There is a large, {{horizontal}} board at the top, then two small boards, and at the bottom four more horizontal boards. The outer door is {{held in place by}} large <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> that are obviously hand made.|$|R
50|$|The European {{structures}} are typically stucco coated, with a drive type pintle built diagonally into the masonry prior to stucco finish. A lag screw pintle {{can be substituted}} for the drive pintle. Brick structures can employ a similar embedded pintle, or a surface mounted pintle. Storm type <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> are typically in Europe, American examples are often tapered.|$|R
50|$|Surface {{mounting}} {{seems the}} simpler approach. We've used a modified jamb pintle on a custom installation where a full board shutter allowed <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> {{to be installed}} high enough on the shutter to cover the pintle in the open position. My favorite surface approach {{is to use a}} notched hinge with a matching pintle. A 405 lift-off will work.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Strap</b> <b>hinges</b> {{continued}} to dominate {{in the market}} place, however, for hanging shutters. But here, too, changes were afoot. Drive pintles started {{to be replaced by}} similar pintles cut off and mounted on a piece of thin plate material and again fastened with the new screws. This is the precursor of the [...] "plate pintle" [...] that's still very much around.|$|R
50|$|The north door, {{fitted with}} <b>strap</b> <b>hinges,</b> has a four-centred arch and wave moulding. On the east side, {{there is a}} four-centred arched doorway with hood-mould. It {{contains}} a recess (probably a niche which housed an image in the past). A former doorway has been converted into the south window of the nave. There is a wooden gate {{at the entrance to}} the porch.|$|R
5000|$|The south (front) facade has 12 ft double Dutch {{doors of}} {{vertical}} battens with cast iron <b>strap</b> <b>hinges,</b> four per section, in the center. In {{the middle of}} the upper section of both is a six-light square window, covered over for security purposes. There is evidence of a [...] having been located above the entrance in the past, and a dovecote having been in the gable apex.|$|R
50|$|Despite being {{dismantled}} and reassembled {{three times}} {{since it was}} first constructed in the 12th century, the Caen stone doorway shows surprisingly little damage or alteration. It features a double row of chevrons, one decorated with {{what appear to be}} grapes, inside an outer order of four-leaved emblems. The whole arch rests upon scallop capitals on the original shafts and the door itself is fitted with decorative <b>strap</b> <b>hinges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each {{section of}} the house is {{essentially}} an open room. The center section was partitioned into smaller spaces, and the east section is slightly below the floor level of the other two. The east and center sections have fireplaces, the latter with a wooden Georgian mantel. Exposed ceiling beams support the garrets above. The western and center sections are connected by a battened door with wrought iron <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> and pancake nailing plates.|$|R
50|$|Wide {{entry doors}} {{consisting}} of two pairs of hinged ledged doors with <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> open out from the main volume to the street which is accessed via a wide driveway. The front opening is sheltered by a timber-framed footpath awning which is supported on timber posts and clad in corrugated metal sheeting. Decorative elements in the main elevation include a circular vent and a simple finial on the gable end. The main building is clad in chamferboards and the lean-to annex to the south is clad in weatherboards.|$|R
5000|$|The front {{facade of}} the house has a central bay with a {{recessed}} entrance. [...] The entrance has a heavy wooden door with iron <b>strap</b> <b>hinges,</b> surrounded by glass lights. Above the entrance {{is a pair of}} French doors opening onto a small balcony with a wrought iron railing. To the left of the entrance bay is a projecting bay holding a two-story porch with a shallow hip roof. To the right is a three-bay wide section with a central three-sided bay window flanked by a single tall window on each side.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main house}} is a -story, 11-bay {{clapboard}} structure of varied [...] and form, reflecting considerable work and expansion {{in the first century}} of its existence. There are three entrances in the main facade, two with 19th-century panelled doors and the other with a vertical plank door and <b>strap</b> <b>hinges.</b> The main entrance has a shed-roofed porch. Large chimneys rise from the roof and two one-story wings project {{from the rear of the}} house. A small porch has also been built at the east end of the house, screened from sight by surrounding vegetation.|$|R
5000|$|The cabinet is 8 feet (2.44 m) high, 42 inches (1.07 m) wide, and 20 inches (0.51 m) deep. It {{is made of}} walnut and maple, with poplar {{and white}} pine {{secondary}} woods. It features a shingled [...] "roof," [...] ebonized compressed columns, and carved and incised decoration throughout. Its two sets of doors are separated by a highly-carved drawer front. Its eight inset panels - four on {{the doors of the}} front, and a pair on each of the sides - are of veneered maple, cameo-carved to reveal the darker walnut beneath. Its <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> and hardware are of brass.|$|R
5000|$|The calaboose is a 10 by 12 ft structure. [...] The vaulted {{concrete}} roof is 8 ft high. The {{walls of}} locally quarried sandstone are 2 ft thick. Narrow window slits with grated openings {{are located on}} {{the east and west}} elevations of the building. The main entrance into the structure is a heavy cast iron door with <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> and a grated opening located on the south elevation. The interior is a single room that is sheathed in plaster without ornamentation. The furnishings include a stove, folding cot, bureau, table, and chair that appear to be from the early twentieth century.|$|R
25|$|The {{timber frame}} {{features}} close studding with a middle rail. It {{rests on a}} stone plinth, the infill is rendered brick and the roof is of slate. At the west end is a shingled square tower with a shingled broach spire ending in a weather cock. This is surrounded by lean-to roofed aisles on the north, west and south sides. The tower has a western arched door with a 20th-century door which incorporates 17th-century iron <b>strap</b> <b>hinges.</b> The body of the church consists of a three-bay nave with north and south aisles, a two-bay chancel and north and south chapels {{at the ends of}} the aisles, and a south porch.|$|R
25|$|This {{opening on}} the end of the north wing {{consists}} of a full width, battened door bearing four vertical, recessed panels similar to the south door. The frame and brickwork surrounding it are probably reworked. This is especially evident in the brick framing on the top that is now a simple course of Flemish bond. The wooden door frame consists of three sets of flat boards, becoming progressively narrower toward the doorway. There is a bevel between the outermost frame member and a semi-round molding between the two inner boards. Both the north and south doors are secured by <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> on the inside.|$|R
50|$|During the Shaver ownership, the {{original}} hewn logs {{were covered with}} poplar siding. The hewn and pegged rafters remain visible, however. The interior walls were also modified during the Shaver era. The walls of the east upstairs room received poplar plank panelling while the lower floor walls utilized laths and plaster. It is believed that the fireplace mantels also date from this period. The original plank doors with wrought iron <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> remain unmodified. After the purchase by John Spahr, the only major change to the house was {{the addition of a}} dining room connecting the previously separated kitchen to the remainder of the structure.|$|R
50|$|Several related {{structures}} are found {{west of the}} house. Of particular interest is the smoke-house, which probably dates {{from the same period}} as the house. This weather-boarded structure features a gable roof with deep overhang on the front end and a batten door with the same type of <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> as those found in the house. On the side closest to the house is a stone well. Northwest of the well is a frame corn crib which appears to be of later date than the house. In an open field across the road is a frame tenant building of the late 19th-earlly 20th century era.|$|R
50|$|The first lean-to {{addition}} was {{the first}} room restored during Isham's 1930's restoration. The entirely restored room presents an excellent picture of a 17th-century residential interior in Rhode Island. This room contains two of the original square-shaped, single casement, leaded glass windows. These windows were carefully restored and re-hung where originally located to provide {{some of the best}} evidence available of 17th-century windows. The room retains the huge fireplace surrounded by many of the original hand-planed, feather-edged, vertical pine boards, along with batten doors with wooden latches and <b>strap</b> <b>hinges.</b> The ceiling is exposed oak beam and both the floor and ceiling above are wideboard.|$|R
50|$|The {{timber frame}} {{features}} close studding with a middle rail. It {{rests on a}} stone plinth, the infill is rendered brick and the roof is of slate.

50|$|The two-story brick home {{is in the}} Flemish bond {{pattern and}} has endured more than 200 years. The main section of the house has three bays with the main {{entrance}} on the far right. The large Dutch door and original wrought-iron <b>strap</b> <b>hinges</b> and iron lock box allow the door to swing open with little effort. The door is surmounted by a large fanlight inside a projecting pediment. The double sash, 9 panel windows are framed by sandstone blocks above and below and wooden dog-head shutters. A brick chimney projects through the sloped roof. The wing has slightly smaller windows with a basement entryway.|$|R
50|$|This {{opening on}} the end of the north wing {{consists}} of a full width, battened door bearing four vertical, recessed panels similar to the south door.
