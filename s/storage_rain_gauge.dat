40|$|Precipit ation {{distribution}} {{is a crucial}} componen t of a region’s hydrology. In mountaino us regions this distributio n is highly variable because {{of the influence of}} extreme topography on weather systems. The difficulties in operating <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> in such an environment have left New Zealand with a poor understanding of precipitation distributions at a catchment scale for much of the Southern Alps. Compounding this is that few regions in the world match New Zealand’s Southern Alps as a barrier to global circulation (Ibbitt et al., 2005). This means distributions found in other regions of the world may be inappropriate when applied to New Zealand. In 2002, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommended a catchment approach to analysis of precipitation as a specific area of research requiring attent ion (IPCC 2002). As a step towards alleviating this situation, a network of ten logging <b>storage</b> <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> was installed in the upper Lake Pukaki catchment in early 2006. As part of the preliminary data analysis, comparison of the measured precipitation distribution for a small number of storm events against clima te model output and interpolate...|$|R

Possibilities of using <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> calibrated satellite observations to represent vacant <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> stations are also explored in this study. Significant variations are observed even among stations located within about 15  km of each other. Error increases with increase in <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> spacing. It may also be concluded that 4 – 6 <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> give reasonable accuracy in daily rainfall estimation in a 50  km[*]×[*] 50  km area. There are scopes to use <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> calibrated satellite observations to represent the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> station in area with poor <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> density. The technique described here {{may be used to}} estimate the rainfall over the area having insufficient number of <b>rain</b> <b>gauges.</b> Homogeneous distribution of <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> having sufficient number of equally spaced gauges form a perfect network to monitor the rainfall accurately over a region.|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{southern}} part of Indian region, ISRO AWS <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> density over India is poor. The density over some places is such that only 1 <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> station (and sometimes no <b>rain</b> <b>gauge)</b> falls in 50  km[*]×[*] 50  km region. It is observed from the present study that rainfall values may change significantly within 15  km area. So, {{it is very difficult to}} quantify the rainfall on the basis of <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> observations over a region having poor <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> density. In this section, possibility of using <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> calibrated satellite observations to fill the gaps of missing <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> stations is analyzed. Past study (Mishra et al. 2010) shows that satellite estimates of rainfall matches well with that from <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> observations over well populated <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> area. These satellite rainfall estimates are based on a matchup between ground truth rainfall and rain signature from satellite.|$|R
40|$|The Ocean Acoustics Division (OAD) of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), in {{cooperation}} with NOAA/NESDIS and NASA, has deployed six <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> for calibration and intercomparison purposes.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{benefits}} of integrating coarse resolution satellite-derived precipitation estimates with quasi-point <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data for generating a fine spatial resolution precipitation map product. To integrate the two precipitation data sources, a geostatistical downscaling and integration approach is presented that can account for the differences in spatial resolution between data from different supports and adjusts inherent errors in the coarse resolution precipitation estimates. First, coarse resolution precipitation estimates are downscaled at a fine spatial resolution via area-to-point kriging to allow direct comparison with <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data. Second, the downscaled precipitation estimates are integrated with the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data by multivariate kriging. In particular, errors in the coarse resolution precipitation estimates are adjusted against <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data during this second stage. In this study, simple kriging with local means (SKLM) and kriging with an external drift (KED) are used as multivariate kriging algorithms. For comparative purposes, conditional merging (CM), a frequently-applied method for integrating <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data and radar precipitation, is also employed. From a case study with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3 B 43 monthly precipitation products acquired in South Korea from May–October in 2013, {{we found that the}} incorporation of TRMM data with <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data did not improve prediction performance when the number of <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data was relatively large. However, the benefit of integrating TRMM and <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data was most striking, regardless of multivariate kriging algorithms, when a small number of <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data was used.

30|$|Rainfall is an {{extremely}} variable parameter in both space and time. <b>Rain</b> <b>gauge</b> density is very crucial in order to quantify the rainfall amount over a region. The level of rainfall accuracy is highly dependent on density and distribution of <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> stations over a region. Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have installed a number of Automatic Weather Station (AWS) <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> over Indian region to study rainfall. In this paper, the effect of <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> density over daily accumulated rainfall is analyzed using ISRO AWS gauge observations. A region of 50  km[*]×[*] 50  km box over southern part of Indian region (Bangalore) with good density of <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> is identified for this purpose. <b>Rain</b> <b>gauge</b> numbers are varied from 1 – 8 in 50  km box to study the variation in the daily accumulated rainfall. Rainfall rates from the neighbouring stations are also compared in this study. Change in the rainfall {{as a function of}} gauge spacing is studied. Use of gauge calibrated satellite observations to fill the gauge station value is also studied. It is found that correlation coefficients (CC) decrease from 82 % to 21 % as gauge spacing increases from 5  km to 40  km while root mean square error (RMSE) increases from 8.29  mm to 51.27  mm with increase in gauge spacing from 5  km to 40  km. Considering 8 <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> as a standard representative of rainfall over the region, absolute error increases from 15 % to 64 % as gauge numbers are decreased from 7 to 1. Small errors are reported while considering 4 to 7 <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> to represent 50  km area. However, reduction to 3 or less <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> resulted in significant error. It is also observed that use of gauge calibrated satellite observations significantly improved the rainfall estimation over the region with very few <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> observations.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} between <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data and radar {{data from the}} Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere/Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA/COARE) was studied. The <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data from an echo that passed over the Xiangyanghong # 5 on December 24, 1992 was compared to what the MIT radar saw at this location from the R/V Vickers, 103. 4 km to the east. The precipitation measured by the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> peaked at 108 mm/hr 92 seconds into the period before tapering off 11 1 / 2 minutes later. This sharp gradient was evident in a PPI plot of the radar reflectivities and the percentage area-rainfall for the radar data statistics. The percentage area curve was converted to rain rates using a GATE Z-R and compared to a percentage time curve of rain rates according to the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge.</b> A four minute running average applied to the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> rates improved the comparison of peak rates between the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> and radar. Differences in peaks between rain rates observed by the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> and reflectivities observed by the radar {{could be due to}} variations in rainfall rates within a single radar data bin. For example, two measurements of reflectivity such as 37 and 47 dBZ within the same bin would result in a 44 dBZ average.

40|$|AbstractA {{methodology}} {{for the design}} of a <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network is developed in this study. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, {{this is the first time}} a combination of geostatistical tools and factor analysis, along with a clustering technique, has been used to prioritize <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> stations in terms of information content over the study area. The whole study area is divided into homogeneous subregions and a conventional variance-based approach is implemented in each subregion to rank <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> stations. For this purpose, factor analysis coupled with ordinary block kriging is used to identify the number of homogeneous subregions, and then, ordinary point kriging is used to assign <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> stations to each subregion. The developed scheme is quite time-efficient as it is not sensitive to initial guesses on cluster centers, there is no need to specify the number of clusters in advance and, above all, it is highly relevant to the overall objective stipulated in <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network design. The proposed methodology is implemented on real data set in the south west of Iran. The results show that the proposed approach compares well with existing paradigms in <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network design and only six <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> stations are required to provide the necessary information. In particular, the measure of network accuracy lies somewhere in between the so called time consuming and more simplified approaches used in <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network design...|$|R
40|$|The use of Gauge-Adjusted Radar (GAR) for {{rainfall}} measurement is {{a recent}} innovation in Urban Hydrology in the United States for measuring rainfall between <b>rain</b> <b>gauges.</b> Gauge Adjusted Radar {{is the result of}} calibrating a radar image with ground truth <b>rain</b> <b>gauges.</b> This technology is particularly useful for Rainfall Dependent Infiltration Inflow (RDII) programs in which the relationship between rainfall and RDII is critical to defining sewer basin performance and directing rehabilitation programs.

40|$|The use {{of dense}} {{networks}} of <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> {{to verify the}} skill of quantitative numerical precipitation forecasts requires bridging the scale gap between the finite resolution of the forecast fields and the point measurements provided by each gauge.

To this end data from the Netherlands operational national <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network (330 gauges nationwide) is combined with an experimental network (30 gauges within 225 km 2). Based on 74 selected rainfall events (March¿October 2004) the spatial variability of daily rainfall is investigated at three spatial extents: small (225 km 2), medium (10 000 km 2), and large (82 875 km 2). From this analysis it is shown that semivariograms show no clear dependence on season. Predictions of point rainfall are performed for all three extents using three different geostatistical methods: (i) ordinary kriging (OK; <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data only), (ii) kriging with external drift (KED), and (iii) ordinary collocated cokriging (OCCK), with the latter two using both <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data and range-corrected daily radar composites¿a standard operational radar product from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). The focus here is on automatic prediction. For the small extent, <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data alone perform better than radar, while for larger extents with lower gauge densities, radar performs overall better than <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data alone (OK). Methods using both radar and <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data (KED and OCCK) prove to be more accurate than using either <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data alone (OK) or radar, in particular, for larger extents. The added value of radar is positively related to the correlation between radar and <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> data. Using a pooled semivariogram is {{almost as good as}} using event-based semivariograms, which is convenient if the prediction is to be automated.

The type-A <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> is a No. 34 -T (RA- 1) gauge manufactured by Ota Keiki Seisakusho Co., Ltd., and data are recorded to the Onset Computer Corporation’s HOBO event data logger (H 07 - 002 - 04). It measures at a 0.5  mm resolution with a receiving orifice diameter of 200  mm. All the type-A <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> had been abandoned for observation as of June 2009, and therefore, we rehabilitated these <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> to restart observation where possible. On restarting the observation, we checked the performance of tipping buckets and data loggers by pouring known amounts of water; we also carefully cleaned the buckets, nets, and data loggers and changed the desiccants and batteries to new ones. The type-B <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> consists of an RG 3 -M gauge and a HOBO pendant event data logger (UA- 003 - 64) produced by the Onset Computer Corporation. Its measuring resolution is 0.2  mm, and the receiving orifice diameter is 154  mm. All the type-B <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> were installed by the authors in September 2009, especially concentrating on the poorly gauged area in the northeastern side of the lake. At two stations (S 4 and M 3), the type-B <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> were installed next to the type-A gauges to check the instrumental difference on the observed rainfall amount. The type-C gauge is an A-TK- 2 <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> manufactured by Takeda Keiki Kogyo Co., Ltd., constituting one component of the AWS that was also installed by the authors. It has a gauge resolution of 1.0  mm with a receiving orifice diameter of 200  mm. Rainfall data were recorded, along with other meteorological variables, to a Campbell Scientific, Inc. data logger (CR 1000). After the rehabilitation and installation of <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> in September 2009, we serviced stations {{two to three times}} per year to obtain continuous, highly reliable, and quality-controlled data for our detailed investigation of the rainfall in Cambodia.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> were {{installed}} privately {{by some of}} the earliest settlers, the first instrumental climate records in Australia were not compiled until 1840 at Port Macquarie. <b>Rain</b> <b>gauges</b> were gradually installed at other major centres across the continent, with the present gauges in Melbourne and Sydney dating from 1858 and 1859 respectively.|$|R
40|$|Existence of {{appropriate}} <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network in a basin is very vital for any water resources planning. In many basins, the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> stations are located without clear scientific understanding. In this study, an attempt {{is made to}} re-design <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network for Tamarabarani basin in Peninsular India {{with the help of}} available rainfall information from the existing stations. First, rainfall in assumed potential locations within the basin is estimated by ordinary kriging and Genetic Programming (GP) based kriging, besides general regression models. This information is used to locate finally the required number of stations and their locations. The results show that GP based models are quite superior to standard variogram models used in kriging. It is also seen that the accuracy of rainfall estimation does affect the determination of optimal location of <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> stations...|$|R
