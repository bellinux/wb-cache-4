25|$|Chrissie Wellington has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> two passions in life: {{sport and}} development. In her victory {{speech at the}} 2007 Hawaii Ironman, she {{referred}} to her experience teaching at Beaver Country Day School near Boston, where she first noticed the difference that sport can make to children's lives. She also noted, from her experience in Nepal, how sport can bring conflict-affected communities together. In an interview, her coach Brett Sutton said: She has kicked around for years through South East Asia, working for underprivileged people. That's why she was in Nepal. Already this year she has done clinics in Thailand and the Philippines and now sponsors a young Filipino athlete to attend our group for the coach to work some magic. I think her win could be the catalyst for the sport in South East Asia.|$|E
25|$|When Subaru faces Fūma in battle, {{he allows}} the Dragon of Earth to blind {{him in his}} right eye—a lesser wish Subaru had held for some time. In single combat against Seishirō at Rainbow Bridge, Subaru reveals his true desire: he wishes to be killed by him, as thus he would exist in Seishirō's heart. However, due to a spell cast by Hokuto at her death, the killing strike is reversed, and Subaru kills Seishirō instead. Hokuto has told Seishiro this spell cast when Seishiro killed her as she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> the last {{confidence}} for him because 'Subaru loves him'. This implied that Sheshiro is willing to kill himself by Subaru as he thought this is Subaru's real hope. As a result of Seishirō's death, Subaru loses his will to fight alongside his ability to create a barrier which causes {{him to leave the}} Dragons of Heaven. Fūma brings him Seishiro's eye which is necessary to grant the assassin's wish: erasing Fūma's mark in Subaru by replacing Subaru's wounded eye. Subaru accepts the eye, inheriting his powers and the Sakurazukamori title in the process and becoming one of the Dragons of Earth. Despite joining Fūma, Subaru is still interested in Kamui's true wish.|$|E

500|$|The album also {{features}} more introspective songs, and The Sunday Times wrote that it [...] "has a surprising sadness to it." [...] The seventh track, [...] "Te Busqué", which features Latin singer Juanes, is about Furtado's experiences with depression, which she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> had periodically {{since she was}} around seventeen years old.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{has also}} been {{influenced}} by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> [...] "unwavering devotion" [...] for Spears. In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Fall Out Boy, and Jimmy Eat World. She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch, Alanis Morissette, Ashlee Simpson, Fefe Dobson and Justin Timberlake; and the 1960s acts The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys. Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and [...] "Like a Prayer-era Madonna".|$|E
500|$|Hindustan Times writer Robin Bansal was {{impressed}} with the song, and called it [...] "eclectic, peppy, and electrifying from the start... The song explodes after a point in its massiveness and stays in the head. The impeccable notes and pitch makes one wonder if it's really Priyanka." [...] He added that the song had a high tempo and pitch, making it more like a track by The Black Eyed Peas. Chopra refuted the claims that her voice was digitally modulated, and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a high range in her voice, and that she always had an accent while speaking English. Perdy Mohindru from The Times of India described the lyrics as simple and beautiful, and complemented Chopra's accent and voice.|$|E

500|$|Ayane was {{controversially}} {{portrayed by}} Natassia Malthe, a half-Norwegian half-Filipina actress {{who was also}} much older than Ayane is portrayed in the games. Malthe's Ayane uses a Japanese long sword and also wields two longs swords in the various promotional images {{in and out of}} character. Malthe <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> undergone [...] "weeks of martial arts training in China" [...] for the film. Tomonobu Itagaki later said he [...] "wanted to have Japanese actresses portray Kasumi and Ayane" [...] but the film's director Corey Yuen [...] "believed strongly in his casting choices." [...] Itagaki said he would have chosen Aya Ueto to play Ayane. The film's producer Mark A. Altman said that he [...] "was such a fan" [...] of Malthe being [...] "threatening and enigmatic as Ayane" [...] that he cast her in Dead and Deader.|$|E
500|$|Cher has {{employed}} various musical styles, including folk rock, pop rock, power ballads, disco, {{new wave}} music, rock music, punk rock, arena rock, and hip hop; she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{done this to}} [...] "remain relevant and do work that strikes a chord". Her music has mainly dealt with themes of heartbreak, independence, and self-empowerment for women; by doing so, she became [...] "a brokenhearted symbol of a strong but decidedly single woman", according to Out magazine's Judy Wieder. Goldmine magazine's Phill Marder credited Cher's [...] "nearly flawless" [...] song selection as what made her a notorious rock singer; while several of her early songs were penned by or sung with Sonny Bono, most of her solo successes, which outnumbered Sonny and Cher's successes, were composed by independent songwriters, selected by Cher. Not.com.mercial (2000), the singer's first album mostly written by herself, presents a [...] "1970s singer-songwriter feel" [...] that proves [...] "Cher adept {{in the role of}} storyteller", according to AllMusic's Jose F. Promis.|$|E
500|$|When Leslie <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> never {{received}} an MRI, Chris takes {{her to the}} hospital to receive one. Chris makes uncomfortable comments, remarking that Leslie has an excellent uterus ("could easily have triplets right off the bat") and asking whether she is having her period, presumably in anticipation of sex later. Leslie rejects his advances when the date ends, prompting him to make an angry goodbye, even though Leslie still needs to give him a ride home. Meanwhile, Mark (Paul Schneider) grows suspicious that Ann harbors romantic feelings for Justin. He eventually confronts Ann and accuses her of trying to [...] "save" [...] Justin for a possible relationship in the future. Mark asks Ann's ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt), who also recalls Ann's infatuation with Justin. Andy scolds Ann for hurting Mark's feelings, then tries to trick her into thinking she was still dating him, which does not work. Realizing her behavior was inappropriate, Ann sets Leslie up on a date with Justin.|$|E

500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} with a C. He criticized Gilmore's {{performance}} in [...] "That Still Small Voice" [...] and earlier episodes, writing that [...] "Gilmore struggles {{to make a}} connection with his character, so it always looks like he’s reading lines," [...] which might {{have a negative effect}} on the Henry's character development. Sava felt that Espenson, based on her previous work, was good at balancing large casts and wrote [...] "this episode juggles the expansive character roster of this series better than its predecessors." [...] Conversely, IGN's Amy Ratcliffe <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> [...] "never liked Henry as much as I did in this episode," [...] especially his explanation to Archie on why he is Jiminy Cricket. Ratcliffe added that Jiminy had the [...] "most touching backstory" [...] of the season up to that point, opining that [...] "the transformation of Dr. Hopper was moving, and this episode maybe felt the most like a fairytale of the stories we've seen so far." [...] She graded [...] "That Still Small Voice" [...] with 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode.|$|E
500|$|The Queen {{inspired}} main antagonist {{characters in}} the otherwise unrelated titles, such as the stepmother queen in the Russian animated film The Wild Swans (1962), the Witch Queen in the Spanish film Tom Thumb and Little Red Riding Hood (1962), the goddess Venus in the anime version of Unico, Queen Admira in the American film The Hugga Bunch (1985), and {{the queen of the}} witches in the video game Curse of Enchantia (1992). Lady Macbeth in Orson Welles' 1948 Macbeth resembles the Queen in her costume, make-up, and even the manner of her death; Lady Macbeth was also visually based on the Queen in a 1982 comic book adaptation. The evil Queen Bavmorda from 1988's film Willow bears a resemblance too, so much that Cinefantastique editor Frederick S. Clarke described her as [...] "simply Snow Whites Wicked Queen, right down to her hooded costume." [...] Robin Wood has drawn a connection between the looks of the Witch and of the Emperor in the Star Wars franchise (which eventually also became a Disney property). According to the designer Steve Brown, the Queen's old Witch form served as an inspiration for the main character Witch Queen in his 1985 video game Cauldron. Brigitte Nielsen <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> also based her role as the Black Witch (who also kidnaps a prince character out of jealously for a princess) in the 1992 Italian film Fantaghirò 2 on Disney's [...] "Grimilde" [...] (an Italian name for the Queen in the comics).|$|E
500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E
