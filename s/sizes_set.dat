500|$|Dimetrodon ( [...] ; meaning [...] "two {{measures}} of teeth") is an extinct genus of synapsids that lived during the Cisuralian (Early) Permian, around 295–272million years ago (Ma). It {{is a member}} of the family Sphenacodontidae. The most prominent feature of Dimetrodon is the large neural spine sail on its back formed by elongated spines extending from the vertebrae. It walked on four legs and had a tall, curved skull with large teeth of different <b>sizes</b> <b>set</b> along the jaws. Most fossils have been found in the southwestern United States, the majority coming from a geological deposit called the Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma. More recently, fossils have been found in Germany. Over a dozen species have been named since the genus was first described in 1878.|$|E

50|$|This {{resolution}} to the missing heritability problem {{was supported by the}} introduction of Genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) in 2010, which demonstrated that trait similarity could be predicted by the genetic similarity of unrelated strangers on common SNPs treated additively, and for many traits the SNP heritability was indeed a substantial fraction of the overall heritability. The GCTA results were further buttressed by findings that a small percent of trait variance could be predicted in GWASes without any genome-wide statistically-significant hits by a linear model including all SNPs regardless of p-value; if there were no SNP contribution, this would be unlikely, but it would be what one expected from SNPs whose effects were very imprecisely estimated by a too-small sample. Combined with the upper bound on maximum effect <b>sizes</b> <b>set</b> by the GWASes up to then, this strongly implied that the highly polygenic theory was correct. Examples of complex traits where increasingly large-scale GWASes have yielded the initial hits and then increasing numbers of hits as sample sizes increased from n<20k to n>100k or n>300k include height, intelligence, and schizophrenia.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} encode, store, and {{retrieve}} visually presented objects {{is referred to}} as visual working memory (VWM). Although crucial for many cognitive processes, previous research reveals that VWM strictly capacity limited. This capacity limitation is behaviorally observable in the <b>set</b> <b>size</b> effect: the ability to successfully report items in VWM asymptotes at a small number of items. Research into the neural correlates of <b>set</b> <b>size</b> effects and VWM capacity limits in general largely focus on the maintenance period of VWM. However, we previously reported that neural resources allocated to individual items during VWM encoding correspond to successful VWM performance. Here we expand on those findings by investigating neural correlates of <b>set</b> <b>size</b> during VWM encoding. We hypothesized that neural signatures of encoding-related VWM capacity limitations should be differentiable as a function of <b>set</b> <b>size.</b> We tested our hypothesis using High Density Electroencephalography (HD-EEG) to analyze frequency components evoked by flickering target items in VWM displays of <b>set</b> <b>size</b> 2 or 4. We found that <b>set</b> <b>size</b> modulated the amplitude of the 1 st and 2 nd harmonic frequencies evoked during successful VWM encoding across frontal and occipital-parietal electrodes. Frontal sites exhibited the most robust effects for the 2 nd harmonic (<b>set</b> <b>size</b> 2 > <b>set</b> <b>size</b> 4). Additionally, we found a set-size effect on the induced power of delta-band (1 - 4 Hz) activity (<b>set</b> <b>size</b> 2 > <b>set</b> <b>size</b> 4). These results are consistent with a capacity limited VWM resource at encoding that is distributed across to-be-remembered items in a VWM display. This resource may work in conjunction with a task-specific selection process that determines which items are to be encoded and which are to be ignored. These neural <b>set</b> <b>size</b> effects support the view that VWM capacity limitations begin with encoding related processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The Weibull and the Chaudhry-Ahmad {{probability}} density functions {{were used to}} model resin production distributions for maritime pine stands. Maximum likelihood was used for parameter estimation. Data were collected during one season in two sets of plots. Set 1 consisted of two 50 -tree and one 100 -tree plots. Bootstrap re-sampling showed that the Weibull parameters had smaller estimation errors for small sample <b>sizes.</b> <b>Set</b> 2 consisted of thirty-seven 10 -tree plots. No {{significant differences in the}} fit of the den-sity functions were detected. Parameters of both models were found to be well correlated with the mean plot production {{as well as with the}} within plot coefficient of variation. The results did not reveal any major differences between the Weibull and the Chaudhry-Ahmad probability functions. The most appropriate model should be chosen at later stages when parameters of both functions are regressed against easily measured stand attributes...|$|E
40|$|Solar coronal arches heated by {{turbulent}} ion-cyclotron waves {{may suffer}} significant cross-field transport by these waves. Nonlinear processes fix the wave-propagation speed {{at about a}} tenth of the ion thermal velocity, which seems sufficient to spread heat from a central core into a large cool surrounding cocoon. Waves heat cocoon ions both through classical ion-electron collisions and by turbulent stochastic ion motions. Plausible cocoon <b>sizes</b> <b>set</b> by wave damping are in roughly kilometers, although the wave-emitting core may be only 100 m wide. Detailed study of nonlinear stabilization and energy-deposition rates predicts that nearby regions can heat to values intermediate between the roughly electron volt foot-point temperatures and the about 100 eV core, which is heated by anomalous Ohmic losses. A volume of 100 times the core volume may be affected. This qualitative result may solve a persistent problem with current-driven coronal heating; that it affects only small volumes and provides no way to produce the extended warm structures perceptible to existing instruments...|$|E

From this search 513 studies were assessed for eligibility of which 79 met the inclusion criteria. Where the data summary on the UKCRN Database was incomplete, data were also gathered from: the International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) register; the clinicaltrials. gov website and the website of the funders.

However, consistent with the previously reported accuracy analysis, there was an interaction between Hand Position and <b>Set</b> <b>Size,</b> F(1, 49) = 5.41, P < 0.05. In the small <b>set</b> <b>size</b> conditions, hand position made no difference, t(49) = − 0.35, P = 0.73.
