50|$|The Board did {{undertake}} a one-month trial in 1923 using a Garford bus and local driver, {{but it made}} a loss and was not renewed. It was another two years before they tried again, and on 19 January 1925 a contracted feeder service connecting with the Brighton trams commenced operation using a local driver, Ern Smith. He used his own vehicle, a converted International truck, {{for which he was}} compensated <b>on</b> a <b>mileage</b> <b>basis.</b>|$|R
25|$|When the {{contract}} {{came up for}} renewal in October 1928, it was re-let to the same operator. W. C. Sanders took over the service in October 1930 when {{the contract}} next came up for renewal. This {{was not the only}} business Sanders had with the Board and he quickly discovered that he was unable to meet all of his obligations. The Board cancelled all of the contracts it had with him, save for his operation of the Avonside service. Under the Board's control once again, the through services were discontinued and the feeder operation was reinstated from May 1931 using two drivers previously in the employ of Sanders. After a dispute with the union, the drivers became contracted operators of the service in April 1932, being compensated <b>on</b> a <b>mileage</b> <b>basis.</b> The contact was renewed in June 1933.|$|R
50|$|When {{passengers}} travelled {{between two}} stations {{on the same}} railway, using trains provided by the same company, that company was entitled to {{the whole of the}} fare. Similarly, when goods were consigned between two stations on the same railway, using wagons provided by the same company, that company was entitled to the whole of the fee. However, when coaches or wagons owned by a different company were used, that company would be entitled to a proportion of the fare or fee. If the commencement and terminus of the journey were on different railways, a more complicated situation arose: if the two companies involved did not provide through ticketing, the passenger or goods needed to be re-booked at a junction station; if through booking was provided, the receipts collected by the first company needed to be divided between them, usually <b>on</b> a <b>mileage</b> <b>basis.</b> The Railway Clearing House was founded as a means by which these receipts could be apportioned fairly.|$|R
