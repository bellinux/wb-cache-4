50|$|<b>Spondyloepiphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> congenita (abbreviated to SED {{more often}} than SDC) is a rare {{disorder}} of bone growth that results in dwarfism, characteristic skeletal abnormalities, and occasionally problems with vision and hearing. The name of the condition indicates that it affects {{the bones of the}} spine (spondylo-) and the ends of bones (epiphyses), and that it is present from birth (congenital). The signs and symptoms of <b>spondyloepiphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> congenita are similar to, but milder than, the related skeletal disorders achondrogenesis type 2 and hypochondrogenesis. <b>Spondyloepiphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> congenita is a subtype of collagenopathy, types II and XI.|$|E
40|$|The <b>spondyloepiphyseal</b> <b>dysplasias</b> (SEDs) and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasias (SEMDs) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of skeletal dysplasias (dwarfing disorders) characterized by abnormal epiphyses, {{with and without}} varying degrees of metaphyseal irregularities, flattened vertebral bodies, and myopia. To better define the underlying cause of these disorders, we have analyzed the collagens from costal cartilage from several of these patients, using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of intact chains and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptides and amino acid analysis. In {{almost all of the}} patients in this study group, the type II collagen exhibited a slower electrophoretic mobility when compared with that in normal controls. The mobility of many, but not all, of the CNBr peptides was also retarded. Peptides near the amino terminus were almost always altered, while the mobility of peptides close to the carboxyl terminus were normal in all but the severely affected cases. Analysis of the CNBr peptides on an HPLC sieving column confirmed that the electrophoretically abnormal peptides were of a higher molecular weight than were control peptides. Amino acid analysis indicated that the abnormal collagens have a higher ratio of hydroxylysine to lysine than does control collagen, suggesting that overmodification may be involved in the altered mobility. Our results are consistent with a defect in the collagen helix that results in overmodification of the molecule from that point toward the amino terminus. We propose that some forms of SED and SEMD are associated with abnormalities in type II collagen that results in delayed helix formation and consequent overmodification of the collagen. Cases of SED fit onto a continuous spectrum of clinical severity that correlates positively with both the extent of alteration and the proximity of the defect to the carboxyl terminus...|$|R
40|$|Skeletogenesis occurs {{through both}} intramembranous ossification, and endochondral ossification, {{the latter of}} which {{features}} a cartilage intermediate. The cartilage intermediate is comprised of heterotypic molecules formed from collagens type II, IX, and XI. Recently, a number of cell culture and transgenic model studies have posited a function for the alpha 1 chain of collagen XI beyond contributing to cartilage formation. Further, collagen α 1 (XI) mutations in humans generate a series of <b>spondyloepiphyseal</b> <b>dysplasias,</b> including Stickler syndrome and Marshall syndrome. These disorders present clinical skeletal symptoms, including abnormal epiphyseal development, irregularity of {{the margins of the}} vertebral bodies, thick calvaria, short stature, and intracranial calcifications, supporting a more extensive role in skeletal formation for collagen α 1 (XI). These skeletal symptoms are similar to those seen in the homozygous chondrodysplasia (cho) mouse model, a functional knockout for collagen α 1 (XI). This study investigates the role of the alpha 1 chain of collagen XI at the organismal level by quantifying the skeletal abnormalities in the bones of the homozygous cho mouse using microcomputed x-ray tomography (micro-CT) analysis. Geometric analysis was conducted to quantify the decreases in length and increases in width of long bones compared with littermate controls. Rib length and ribcage shape, as well as spinal column and vertebral dimensions were also quantified for the homozygous cho mouse, heterozygous, and wildtype mice. The absence of a deltoid tuberosity and the abnormal formation of vertebral bodies were also described {{for the first time in}} the homozygous cho mouse. Microarchitectural analysis was conducted on endochondrally formed bones of the skeleton and both endochondrally and intramembranously formed bones of the skull. Regarding the microarchitecture of the endochondrally formed bones, the homozygous cho mouse differs from wildtype mice with respect to trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, and trabecular percent bone volume. Relative to wildtype, homozygous cho mouse trabeculae are generally increased in thickness and number, while decreased in separation. Early homozygous cho mouse metaphyseal growth is also characterized by a disorganization in structure, and also variation in trabecular percent bone volume with a trend toward increased mineralization of the primary spongiosa. Craniofacial analysis was completed on both intramembranously and endochondrally formed bones. Most intramembranously formed bones of the homozygous cho mouse exhibited decreases in all microarchitectural indices except for the mesoderm-derived intramembranous parietal bone, which exhibited decreased trabecular separation but increased trabecular thickness, number, and trabecular percent bone volume. Endochondral craniofacial bones exhibited an increase in trabecular thickness and an increase in trabecular separation. These findings are different than the results seen in endochondrally formed long bones, ribs, and verebrae of the homozygous cho mouse and warrant further investigation. In this study, micro-CT proved to be a robust quantitative method to study bone and an ideal means to evaluate early skeletal abnormalities during development. Furthermore, the application of micro-CT technology to existing and newly developed collagen α 1 (XI) mouse models will allow for better understanding of collagen XI’s function during skeletogenesis at the full skeletal, individual bone, and microarchitectural levels. This study supports a structural and signaling role for Collagen α 1 (XI) in bone formation and provides the foundation for future research...|$|R

50|$|People with <b>spondyloepiphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> are short-statured from birth, with a {{very short}} trunk and neck and {{shortened}} limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. This type of dwarfism {{is characterized by a}} normal spinal column length relative to the femur bone. Adult height ranges from 0.9 meters (35 inches) to just over 1.4 meters (55 inches). Curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis and lordosis) progresses during childhood and can cause problems with breathing. Changes in the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck may also increase the risk of spinal cord damage. Other skeletal signs include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly), a hip joint deformity in which the upper leg bones turn inward (coxa vara), and an inward- and downward-turning foot (called clubfoot). Decreased joint mobility and arthritis often develop early in life. Medical texts often state a mild and variable change to facial features, including cheekbones close to the nose appearing flattened, although this appears to be unfounded. Some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth, which is called a cleft palate. Severe nearsightedness (high myopia) is sometimes present, as are other eye problems that can affect vision such as detached retinas. About one-quarter of people with this condition have mild to moderate hearing loss.|$|E
