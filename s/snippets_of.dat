5|$|According to Béla Miklós Szőke's theory, the {{detailed}} description of the Magyars by western contemporary sources and the immediate Hungarian intervention in local wars give the presumption that the Hungarians had already lived on the eastern territories of the Carpathian Basin since the middle of the 9th century. Regarding the right location of early Hungarian settlements, the Arabic geographer al-Jayhani (only <b>snippets</b> <b>of</b> his work survived in other Muslim authors' papers) in the 870s placed the Hungarians between Don and Danube rivers. Szőke identifies al-Jayhani's Danube with the middle Danube region, as opposed to the previously assumed lower Danube region, because following al-Jayhani's description the Christian Moravians were the western neighbors of the Magyars.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of Him is a first-person narrative-based {{video game}} set around {{the death of}} a {{bisexual}} man named Will. The player controls four characters, each of whom was connected to Will during his lifetime. The characters consist of: Will, who dies in a car crash early in the game; Sarah, Will's ex-girlfriend; Harry, Will's boyfriend {{at the time of his}} death; and Mary, Will's grandmother. The gameplay has the player character walk around the world, with the player triggering <b>snippets</b> <b>of</b> narration by clicking on highlighted objects. When interacting with non-player characters, clicking on them will sometimes result in them disappearing and reappearing in a different location to give the impression of them walking.|$|E
5|$|The ReactOS and the Wine {{projects}} {{share the}} goal to run binary Windows software natively and can share therefore many dependencies and development. ReactOS uses {{portions of the}} Wine project {{so that it can}} benefit from Wine's progress in implementing the Win32 API. While Wine's NTDLL, USER32, KERNEL32, GDI32, and ADVAPI32 components cannot be used directly by ReactOS due to architectural differences, code <b>snippets</b> <b>of</b> them and other parts can be shared between both projects. The kernel is developed by ReactOS separately as Wine relies here on existing Unix-like kernels.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} split {{screening}} came to Nalluri after visiting a pub {{one night after}} filming wrapped up. In the audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses split screen, as he was not yet aware of the show. The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane's past activities were <b>snippets</b> <b>of</b> real-life news from the United States, which were edited together. The music was composed by Jennie Muskett, who spent just {{two to three hours}} putting several pieces of background music together. One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan. Some publicity shots of Keeley Hawes in the series were shots of her with long brunette hair, though in fact she has short blonde hair.|$|E
5|$|This brief account can {{be filled}} out, if Polyaenus's {{account of the}} battle is to be believed. Polyaenus {{collected}} many <b>snippets</b> <b>of</b> information on warfare in his Strategems; some are known from other sources to be reliable, while others are demonstrably false. In the absence of other evidence, {{it is unclear whether}} his passage regarding Chaeronea is to be accepted or rejected. Polyaenus suggests that Philip engaged the Greek left, but then withdrew his troops; the Athenians on the Greek left followed and, when Philip held the high ground, he stopped retreating and attacked the Athenians, eventually routing them. In another 'stratagem', Polyaenus suggests that Philip deliberately prolonged the battle, {{to take advantage of the}} rawness of the Athenian troops (his own veterans being more used to fatigue) and delayed his main attack until the Athenians were exhausted. This latter anecdote also appears in the earlier Stratagems of Frontinus.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} {{video was}} shot for the song's remix. It too {{was directed by}} Carey, and was shot in black and white. The shot of Carey in a beret that would become the cover for this single is {{a scene from the}} video. The video features cameo appearances by Da Brat and Xscape. It begins with Carey and the duo spending time recording the song in Carey's in-home studio. In the video, Carey is wearing a large white, straw hat and features long golden hair. As the trio finishes the song, scenes of Carey by her pool are shown, with cameos made by her dog, Jack. Brat and Xscape are seen poolside with Carey, playing cards and drinking beer, as the trio further bond and laugh. Towards the end of the video, scenes of the trio in the studio are shows, and intermingled with <b>snippets</b> <b>of</b> Carey walking inside her mansion, shared with then husband Tommy Mottola. The video ends with Carey and Brat bonding by the studio and pool.|$|E
