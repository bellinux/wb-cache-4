25|$|Capelin are a {{forage fish}} of the smelt family {{found in the}} Atlantic and Arctic oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of {{plankton}} {{at the edge of}} the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat krill and other crustaceans. The capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between Iceland, Greenland, and Jan Mayen. The migration is affected by ocean currents. Around Iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place in September to November. The <b>spawning</b> <b>migration</b> starts north of Iceland in December or January.|$|E

500|$|American {{paddlefish}} {{begin their}} upstream <b>spawning</b> <b>migration</b> sometime during early spring; some begin in late fall. They spawn on silt-free gravel bars {{that would otherwise}} be exposed to air or covered by very shallow water {{were it not for the}} rises in the river from snow melt and annual spring rains that cause flooding. [...] Although availability of preferred spawning habitat is essential, there are three precise environmental events that must occur before American paddlefish will spawn. [...] The water temperature must be from the lengthened photoperiod which occurs in spring triggers biological and behavioral processes that are dependent on increasing day length; and there must be a proper rise and flow in the river before a successful spawn can occur. [...] Historically, American paddlefish did not spawn every year because the precise environmental events only occurred once every 4 or 5 years.|$|E
2500|$|The six Pacific salmons of Oncorhynchus are {{anadromous}} (migratory) and semelparous (die after <b>spawning).</b> <b>Migration</b> can {{be affected}} by parasites. Infected individuals can become weak and probably have shortened lifespans. Infection with parasites creates an effect known as culling whereby fish that are infected {{are less likely to}} complete the migration. Anadromous forms of Oncorhynchus mykiss known as steelhead are iteroparous. [...] The Coastal cutthroat trout form of Oncorhynchus clarki is considered semi-anadromous as it spends short periods of time in marine environments.|$|E
2500|$|The Northeast Atlantic is the world's largest {{population}} of cod. By {{far the largest}} part of this population is the North-East Arctic Cod, as it is labelled by the ICES, or the Arcto-Norwegian cod stock, {{also referred to as}} skrei, a Norwegian name meaning something like [...] "the wanderer", distinguishing it from coastal cod. The North-East Arctic Cod is found in the Barents Sea area. This stock spawns in March and April along the Norwegian coast, about 40% around the Lofoten archipelago. Newly hatched larvae drift northwards with the coastal current while feeding on larval copepods. By summer the young cod reach the Barents Sea where they stay {{for the rest of their}} life, until their <b>spawning</b> <b>migration.</b> As the cod grow, they feed on krill and other small crustaceans and fish. Adult cod primarily feed on fish such as capelin and herring. The northeast Arctic cod also shows cannibalistic behaviour. In 2012 the biomass of the Northeast Atlantic cod stock was estimated to be at an all-time high since scientists started observing stock status some 100 years ago.|$|E
50|$|The estuary perch is {{a common}} and popular {{recreational}} angling fish in all Australian states.

50|$|In many {{rivers of}} Central Europe, the sea trout have been extirpated because {{hydropower}} plants prevent <b>spawning</b> <b>migration.</b> In addition, many spawning grounds have disappeared {{due to the}} backflooding of rivers. In more recent times, sea trout have succeeded in re-establishing themselves in some lakes and rivers through the introduction of fish ladders and bypass channels around hydropower plants. In this way <b>spawning</b> <b>migration</b> has been enabled again, albeit in a limited way.|$|E

50|$|Movement {{patterns}} (home ranges, ontogenetic {{shifts and}} <b>spawning</b> <b>migrations)</b> vary among and within species, and {{are influenced by}} factors such as size, sex, behaviour, density, habitat characteristics, season, tide and time of day. For example, damselfishes, butterflyfishes and angelfishes travel <0.1-0.5 km, while some sharks and tuna migrate over thousands of kilometres. Larval dispersal distances tend to be <5-15 km, and self-recruitment to new habitat is common.|$|R
50|$|Lake chubs {{normally}} undergo <b>spawning</b> <b>migrations</b> {{in early}} summer. Temperature {{plays a role}} in triggering migration onset, as migrations are delayed on colder years. Migrating chubs leave their lakes and rivers to ascend tributary streams, in which they mate (by day or night) and release their eggs over gravel or rocks. There is no parental care. During migration the fish move mostly during dusk and at night.|$|R
50|$|There are long-discussed {{plans to}} install a fish ladder at the Rahway City Water Works to aid these fish during their <b>spawning</b> <b>migrations.</b> Fish ladders are {{inundated}} structures with small underwater steps that allow fish to navigate around a dam and continue their migration. Other approaches include removing obstructions that are inoperative or no longer serve their purpose, or improving water quality and reducing debris that obstructs passage.|$|R
50|$|Icelandic capelin move inshore {{in large}} schools to spawn and migrate {{in spring and}} summer to feed in the plankton-rich oceanic area between Iceland, Greenland, and Jan Mayen. Capelin {{distribution}} and migration is linked with ocean currents and water masses. Around Iceland, maturing capelin usually undertake extensive northward feeding migrations in spring and summer and the return migration takes place in September to November. The <b>spawning</b> <b>migration</b> starts from north of Iceland in December to January.

5000|$|Adult alewives {{are caught}} during their spring <b>spawning</b> <b>migration</b> {{upstream}} by being scooped out of shallow, constricted areas using large dip nets. They are the preferred bait {{for the spring}} lobster fishery in Maine, [...] and are eaten by humans, usually smoked.|$|E
50|$|Because of its complex life cycle, {{the species}} face {{a broad range}} of threats, some of which are {{specific}} to certain growth stage. Being catadromous, the eels's reproductivity success depends heavily on free downstream passage for <b>spawning</b> <b>migration.</b> It also depends on the availability of diverse habitats for growth and maturation.|$|E
2500|$|The omul feeds {{primarily}} on zooplankton, smaller fish, and occasionally some benthic organisms. It feeds {{primarily in the}} rich pelagic zone of Lake Baikal up to 345–450 m. [...] It is a relatively long-lived, iteroparous species that attains reproductive maturity at five to 15 years of age. [...] The omul only enters the rivers that feed Lake Baikal to spawn, initiating short <b>spawning</b> <b>migrations,</b> usually in mid-October, broadcasting 8000-30000 eggs {{before returning to the}} lake.|$|R
50|$|Although {{short on}} water by late summer, Alice Rich {{considered}} Cascade Creek {{to have the}} best Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) habitat in the Corte Madera Creek watershed. However, Cascade Falls presents an impassable barrier to steelhead <b>spawning</b> <b>migrations.</b> Rich also noted that Cascade Creek's steep gradient and low flow conditions were not suitable rearing habitat for juvenile trout, the latter typically spending a year in freshwater before outmigrating to San Francisco Bay.|$|R

5000|$|This is a food fish of {{seasonal}} commercial importance {{in some parts}} of its range. Its spawning events, known locally as kapata, can involve large aggregations of adult fish. During the <b>spawning</b> <b>migration,</b> many fish gather in the shallows of the floodplains, where they are easy to catch. The eggs are also collected for caviar. Overfishing occurs in some areas, and the resource is managed by some governments.|$|E
50|$|The delta smelt is semelparous, living {{one year}} and dying after its first {{spawning}}. Delta smelt spawning occurs in spring in river channels and tidally influenced backwater sloughs upstream of the mixing zone where saltwater meets freshwater. The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers then transport the delta smelt larvae downstream to the mixing zone, normally located in the Suisun Bay. Young delta smelt then feed and grow in the mixing zone before starting their upstream <b>spawning</b> <b>migration</b> in late fall or early winter.|$|E

50|$|The fish {{approach}} the water surface {{at high speed}} (about 10 m/s in large fish; 20-30 body lengths/s) with their lateral fins furled against the body. They get accelerated by beating their tails rapidly, and break through the water surface at a shallow angle to the horizontal. Four fish in ray-finned fish family(Beloniformes) and salmon have this jumping behavior. The ray-finned fish includes needlefish, flyingfish, halfbeak, and sauries. Salmon jump out waterfalls during upstream <b>spawning</b> <b>migrations.</b>|$|R
40|$|On my {{very first}} day as a {{doctorate}} student, my supervisor Øyvind Fiksen introduced me {{to one of my}} new colleagues, Christian Jørgensen, who enthusiastically told me about his fascination with the Northeast Arctic cod’s <b>spawning</b> <b>migrations.</b> I was immediately intrigued by his eager approach, but most of all by the simplicity of the research question that would form the basis of this thesis. Why on earth would some cod choose to swim {{all the way from the}} Barents Sea to Møre, or even to Bergen, to spawn their eggs, when there were perfectly good spawning grounds in Lofoten or Troms, much closer to the Barents Sea? General evolutionary theory would predict that the individuals who undertook <b>spawning</b> <b>migrations</b> several times longer than their conspecifics must be getting something in return. Otherwise, it would be an evolutionary cul-de-sac. Impatiently I started sifting through all the literature I could find, from online articles via obscure reports from the Directorate of Fisheries, to joint Norwegian-Russian conference proceedings from the early 80 s, forgotten in someone’s bottom drawer.

Each year Chinook, coho, and chum salmon return to their {{terminal}} streams in Alaska, the Yukon Territories, and British Columbia. The Chinook have the longest journey, with an estimated 35-50% bound for Canada. As salmon do not eat during their <b>spawning</b> <b>migration,</b> Yukon River salmon must have great reserves of fat and energy to fuel their thousands-mile long journey. As a result, Yukon River salmon are noted for their especially rich and oily meat.|$|E
50|$|The eel {{lives in}} fresh water and {{estuaries}} and only leaves these habitats {{to enter the}} Atlantic Ocean to start its <b>spawning</b> <b>migration</b> to the Sargasso Sea. Spawning takes place far offshore where the eggs hatch. The female can lay up to 4 million buoyant eggs a year, and dies after egg-laying.After the eggs hatch and the early-stage larvae develop into leptocephali, the young eels move toward North America where they metamorphose into glass eels and enter freshwater systems where they grow as yellow eels until they begin to mature.|$|E
50|$|For all {{populations and}} {{subspecies}} of sturgeon, there are <b>spawning</b> <b>migrations</b> into freshwater {{in early spring}} and movement into salt water in the fall.

40|$|Southern {{bluefin tuna}} (SBT) appear to {{comprise}} a single stock that {{is assumed to}} be both mixed across its distribution and having reproductive adults that are obligate, annual spawners. The putative annual migration cycle of mature SBT consists of dispersed foraging at temperate latitudes with migration to a single spawning ground in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean. <b>Spawning</b> <b>migrations</b> have been assumed to target two peaks in spawning activity; one in September-October and a second in February-March. SBT of sizes comparable to that of individuals observed on the spawning ground were satellite tagged in the Tasman Sea region (2003 - 2008) and demonstrated both <b>migrations</b> to the <b>spawning</b> grounds and residency in the Tasman Sea region throughout the whole year. All individuals undertaking apparent <b>spawning</b> <b>migrations</b> timed their movements to coincide with the second recognised spawning peak or even later. These observations suggest that SBT may demonstrate substantial flexibility in the scheduling of reproductive events and may even not spawn annually as currently assumed. Further, the population on the spawning grounds may be temporally structured in association with foraging regions. These findings provide new perspectives on bluefin population and spatial dynamics and warrant further investigation and consideration of reproductive schedules in this species...|$|R
