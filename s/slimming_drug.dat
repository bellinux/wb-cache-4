50|$|The Scotland gig occurs, but is {{not seen}} onscreen. The band finds a {{long-term}} drummer in Pete Best, whose mother owns the teenagers' hangout spot the Casbah Coffee Club. They begin {{to prepare for the}} trip Hamburg which lasts several months and they encounter disapproval from Cynthia and John's Aunt Mimi. When they reach Hamburg, they discover they are playing in the Indra Club on the Reeperbahn, Hamburg's notorious sex district. They play long, grueling hours (up to 8 hours a night, seven days a week), and have to stay active by taking Preludin, a <b>slimming</b> <b>drug.</b> They are living {{in the back of the}} Bambi Kino, a run down old cinema. While in the Indra, they play loudly and wildly, eating, spitting and drinking onstage, inviting women to dance on stage with them, etc. Things get so loud the club is eventually shut down.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 34 -year-old woman {{presenting}} with an erythema multiforme (EM) -like eruption. Lesions developed after a 12 -day treatment with a <b>slimming</b> <b>drug</b> preparation (food integrator with thermogenic activity) and a herbal remedy (pilosella tincture). Serological investigations excluded viral or bacterial infections. Patch testing with galenic preparations of both drugs demonstrated sensitization to the <b>slimming</b> <b>drug</b> preparation. According to literature reports and immune-chemical properties, those components that are likely to have triggered the skin eruption are clorazepate dipotassium and theobromine. Their interaction with other two constituents such as pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and dehydrocholic acid may have caused the adverse reaction by means of a summation effect. There are no reports specifically about EM caused by a <b>slimming</b> <b>drug</b> preparation and no studies have identified thermogenic pills as cause of EM/EM-like eruption. Weight-loss compounds in slimming preparations should be kept in mind as a possible cause of drug-induced EM-like eruption...|$|E
40|$|Rational and {{emotional}} appeals in advertising of prescription medicines: {{study of a}} <b>slimming</b> <b>drug</b> in Brazil The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) advertising of medicines encourages people to ask physicians about medicines and treatments that require medical prescription. Advertising models recommend matching the appeals (rational and/or emotional) to the consumer's attitude toward the product (cognitive and/or affective). Such recommendation generates controversies in the DTC advertising context. Emotional appeals might always appear to be inadequate {{in this type of}} advertising. Adequate or not, medicine advertising exists and within {{the scope of this article}} our discussion will focus on the forms of persuasion of drug advertisements and consumer attitudes towards them. Because there is no empiric evidence about Brazilian consumer's perspective, a descriptive research was undertaken with a sample of women. The objective was to evaluate: i) components of attitude towards medicines; ii) attitude and behavioral intentions towards DTC ads (rational {{and emotional}}). The study measured five constructs: i) cognitive component of attitude towards slimming drugs; ii) affective component of attitude towards slimming drugs; iii) general attitude towards slimming drugs; iv) consumer attitude towards <b>slimming</b> <b>drug</b> ads (one with predominantly rational appeal and another with predominantly emotional appeal); and v) behavioral intention as a consequence of exposure to ads. A prescription weight-loss medicine was chosen. Results revealed an attitude predominantly cognitive toward the product and an attitude and a behavioral intention more favorable toward the rational ad. Negative cognition about the product was identified, restricting the persuasive power of emotional appeals...|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{only a small}} {{proportion}} of dietary fat that is consumed by man reaches the large intestine. Lipids in colonic digesta are derived from this undigested residue of dietary fat and partly from endogenous secretions and shedding of colonocytes. Intestinal bacterial lipases and phospholipases release fatty acids and various glycerides that may then be metabolized further to form products that have implications for intestinal health. Some clinical conditions result in increased fluxes of lipids to the large intestine, and, increasingly, <b>slimming</b> <b>drugs</b> that inhibit pancreatic lipases or adsorbants that enable fat to bypass the small intestine also result in large quantities of dietary lipids reaching the colon. The consequences of increased fat metabolism in the colon are as yet largely unknown...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} and understand the purchase of unlicensed <b>slimming</b> <b>drugs</b> via the Web. This paper draws on social theory, specifically theories used within criminology to inform the analysis of Web purchasing of slimming medicines. Virtual ethnographic techniques, including non-participant observation of three Web forums were used, along with interviews with key stakeholders involved in medicines regulation in the UK. This paper presents the findings from a thematic analysis of text obtained from the forums. These indicate that particular aspects of The Web allow a new route to purchasing unlicensed medicine and appear to circumvent some of the threats and sanctions associated with illegal drug purchases. Accessibility is provided to those who previously would not have engaged in such activities. It is suggested that this may constitute a new method of conducting deviant behavior...|$|R
40|$|The estrogenic {{effects of}} oleoyl-estrone (OE) administration, either though {{continuous}} i. v. infusion with osmotic minipumps or administered by daily oral gavage, were studied. Binding of OE to human recombinant purified alpha receptors was negligible, {{and that of}} estrone (E- 1) was {{only a fraction of}} 17 beta -estradiol (E- 2) binding. Intravenous - but not oral - OE administration resulted in marked increases of both E- 1 and E- 2 in rat plasma, but oral OE did not induce significant changes in either plasma hormone in Wistar or Zucker rats. The weight of uteri and ovaries increased with time of administration in Zucker rats treated with i. v. OE, but inguinal mammary gland proliferation between subcutaneous adipose tissue was even more marked. Oral administration of OE, however, did not increase either uterine weight or mammary gland proliferation, even at doses (10 mu mol. kg. d) higher than those given i. v. (3. 5 mu mol/kg. d). The results indicate that i. v. administration of OE resulted in limited estrogenic effects mainly due to the high accumulation of E- 1 giving rise to significant increases in E- 2. On the other hand, oral administration of OE, even at higher daily doses, did not increase the circulating levels of either estrogen and, therefore, there were no significant effects on mammary gland proliferation or uterine weight. The oral administration of OE as a <b>slimming</b> <b>drug,</b> then, do not result in estrogenic side effects over a wide range of daily doses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|Exploitation {{of women}} now comes in new faces; through the mass media. Media {{currently}} has a dual role, like {{two sides of}} a coin, on one side the media serves as a mediator for the improvement and progress of the nation, {{on the other side}} contributes to the suppression of media for the benefit of market capitalism toward consumer culture women once again being the subject of image construction. Expansion of the market and the mass media {{can not be separated from}} the flow of consumerism, because the mass media (particularly advertising on television) is an extension of the market to boost sales of industrial products in the form of imagery that originates from the "mode of production". Through the process of meaning people are affected by the image created by the market and advertisement that increase their consumptive behavior. Here begins the role of advertising in blurring the identity as the supporting tool of consumerism, therefore those who identify themselves as modern men are no longer themselves but apparently no more than "Robot Man" impersonator without original identity, the principle of life pawned in the name of modernity. Women are vying to look beautiful, to buy up all whitening products, hair straightener tools, body <b>slimming</b> <b>drugs,</b> making them "Paranoid" who are restless because being haunted by old age. Actually they are aware of the exploitation, but enjoy it on the pretext of style and fashion. Key words: women, exploitation, mass medi...|$|R

40|$|A {{signal is}} a {{suspicion}} {{of a relationship}} between a reaction and a drug, and an indication that no regulatory action has yet been taken. It is an initial lead that, when reported, triggers a warning. A practitioner suspects and reports an adverse drug reaction (ADR), and health authorities determine whether a warning and health policy statement should be issued. The {{process by which the}} Philippine government {{with the help of the}} Adverse Drug Reactions Monitoring Programme (ADRMP) evaluates problem drugs or problem drug use is discussed. Steps in pharmacovigilance for translating ADR signals into health policies will be proposed. Examples of cases reported to the ADRMP-defective devices, unregistered herbal medicines and antimicrobial <b>drugs,</b> <b>slimming</b> formulations, body building pills, mood altering health foods, dosage labeling confusion, suspected therapeu-tic inefficacy, dangerous drug product advertisements, and deregulation of prescription drugs into over-the-counter products-and the lessons learned are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Some of <b>slimming</b> <b>drugs</b> {{had been}} {{withdrawn}} from markets so, {{the present study}} was conducted to follow the effect of three different anorexic drugs; on the haematological and physical parameters of adults albino rats. The used drugs differ in their nature, where the first one i. e., apple-lite is a fully natural substance, the 2 nd one i. e., mirapront-N. is a chemical substance and the 3 rd one i. e., tenuate is a synthetic foamy filler substance. Fourty adult male albino rats (130 20 g) were randomly divided into four groups, ten on each treated group and ten for the first group which conserved as control group. The 2 nd group was treated daily with apple-lite (3. 5 mg/ 100 g. b. wt), the 3 rd group was treated daily with mirapro-N (0. 14 mg/ 100 g. b. wt) and the 4 th group was treated daily with tenuate (0. 1 mg/ 100 g. b. wt). Haematological parameters (RBCs, WBCs count, haemoglobin content (Hb), hematocrit value (Hct%), mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell heamoglobin (MCH) and mean cell heamoglobin concentration (MCHC) were detected after 30 days of treatment and also after 15 days of the last treatment as a recovery period. Also, body weight, percent of organs weight/body weight, skin-fold thickness and some vital measurements i. e. heart beats, respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded after the same periods of treatment and recovery. Haematological studies revealed that RBCs count, total WBCs count, Hb and Hct values were significantly decreased in the three groups treated daily with anorexic drugs for 30 days. These changes aere also recorded after the recovery period except in apple-lite treated group which showed insignificant change in RBCs and Hb after the recovery period. The calculated mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) recorded significant increase in apple-lite after treated and recovery periods, while non significant changes in MCHC were observed after mirapro-N and tenuate groups after treatment 30 daysfor 30 days but significant increase of MCHC was recorded after the recovery period of tenuate treated group. Skin-fold thickness of the three regions tested (gluteal, back and belly) revealed significant decrease in all the treated groups except the belly region in apple-lite treated group which showed insignificant decrease after treatment for 30 days. Significant decrease of skin-fold thickness of different regions still present after the recovery period of 15 days in the three treated groups except the back region of mirapro-N and the belly region of apple-lite- treated rats which showed insignificant decrease. Percent of organs weight/body weight were affected according the type of tested drug, while apple-lite- caused non significant changes, mirapro-N caused significant increase in hepatosomatic ratio and cardiosomatic ratio, and significant decrease in gonadosomatic ratio. On the other hand, tenuate resulted in a significant increase in percentage weight of kidneys and hepatosomatic ratio and significant decrease of gonadosomatic ratio after treatment for 30 days. After the recovery period, apple-lite revealed significant decrease in brain/b. wt. ratio, while mirapro-N still affected kidneys, gonadosomatic ratio and brain and tenuate still affected gonadosomatic ratio and brain; they recorded significant decrease. The physical measurement of vital signs, i. e. heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature recorded insignificant change after treatment with apple-lite, mirapro-N and tenuate for 30 days, but significant increase of rectal temperature was recorded in the tenuate group of the treated rats. After recovery period insignificant changes in heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature of the treated rats were observed in the three treated groups...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{substantial}} discussion of the proper scope of patentable subject matter in recent years, drugs have been overlooked. This Article begins to address that gap with a comparative perspective. In particular, this Article considers what is permissible under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), {{as well as how}} India and Canada have utilized TRIPS flexibilities in different ways to properly reward developers of valuable new drugs, while also considering the social harm of higher prices beyond an initial patent term on drugs. This Article brings valuable insight into this area at a critical time. Many have noted that the industry is in a crisis because, despite exponentially increasing expenditures, the number of new drugs produced has been stagnant. Moreover, a predominant number of the <b>slim</b> pipeline features <b>drugs</b> that are not highly innovative.
