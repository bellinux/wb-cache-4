Park A robust <b>shape-matching</b> measure with a boundary detection preprocessor is proposed to track a moving object in complex image sequences. A correlation-tracking algorithm seeks to align the incom-ing target image with the reference {{image of the}} target. But it has a critical problem if we use the conventional block-matching criteria. This is the so-called ‘false peak problem’, which is generally caused by highly correlated background pixels with similar intensities to the pixels of moving targets. The robustness of the proposed method for practical application is demonstrated by simulating two kinds of real-target image sequences.

In particular, {{it was shown}} that nanotopography influences diverse cell behaviors such as cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, apoptosis, macrophage activation, and gene expression [1, 2], which in turn leads to proliferation, differentiation, and migration on various nanostructures including nanofibers [3], nanopillars [4], and nanogrooves [5, 6]. As a result, cell behaviors are critically determined by the interaction between nanoscale cellular surface components such as microvilli, filopodia, extracellular matrix (ECM), and the underlying nanostructure topography [7]. However, little is known of how the use of size and <b>shape-matched</b> diverse nanometer-scale topographies interact to not only the forthcoming cells but also the nanoscale cellular surface components of cells bound on the nanotopographic substrates in cell adhesion steps even at the very early stage of incubation (< 20 min).|$|R

We have used small-angle neutron scattering and thermo-gravimetric analysis to determine the optimum temperature for calcination of these granules. It was found that calcination in the temperature range of 200 °C to 400 °C removes the cells without significant alteration of the nano-structured silica network.

40|$|Pictures {{represent}} {{real world}} objects {{and are thus}} symbolic. What factors do children use to decipher the picture-referent relationship? Some theorists argue that children interpret pictures according to how perceptually similar they are to their referents, termed the realist route. Others contend that children follow the intentional route, taking into consideration what the artist intended the picture to represent. These hypotheses were investigated in two studies, in which the level of conflict between appearance and intentional cues was varied. Children aged 4 - 6 were presented with four trials, each involving 3 - object arrays (e. g. a pink duck, a blue duck and a teddy). The experimenter photographed or drew one of the objects (e. g. blue duck). Due to a ‘printer error’ or using the ‘wrong’ colour crayon, the final picture depicted the referent in greyscale (black and white condition) or the colour of its <b>shape-matched</b> object, e. g. a pink duck (colour change condition). Children were asked three questions regarding {{the identity of the}} pictures.

Our approach enjoys the efficiency and robustness of <b>shape-matching</b> deformation models, and the same algorithmic simplicity and linear cost as FLSM, but it eliminates its dense sampling requirements. Our method can handle adaptive spatial discretizations, allowing the simulation of more degrees of freedom in arbitrary regions of interest at little additional cost. The method is also versatile, as it can simulate elastic and plastic deformation, it can handle cuts interactively, and it reuses the underlying data structures for efficient handling of (self-) collisions.

In this paper, we present the results of a study where users were given two dissimilar two-dimensional shapes and asked to map a given point in the first shape to the point in the second shape they consider most similar. We find that user mappings in this study correlate strongly with simple geometric relationships between points and shapes. To predict the probability distribution of user mappings between any pair of simple two-dimensional shapes, two distinct statistical models are defined using these relationships. We perform a thorough validation of the accuracy of these predictions and compare our models qualitatively and quantitatively to well-known <b>shape-matching</b> methods.

Here we examine whether young children follow a realist route (e. g., focusing on how closely pictures resemble their referents) or intentional route (e. g., focusing on what a picture is intended to represent by its artist) when identifying a picture’s referent. In 3 experiments, we contrasted an artist’s intention with her picture’s appearance to investigate children’s use of appearance and intentional cues. In Experiment 1, children aged 3 – 4 and 5 – 6 years (N = 151) were presented with 4 trials of 3 -object arrays (e. g., a pink duck, a blue duck, and a teddy). The experimenter photographed or drew 1 of the objects (e. g., blue duck), however, the subsequent picture depicted the referent in grayscale (black and white condition) or the color of its <b>shape-matched</b> object, for example, a pink duck (color change condition).

40|$|The {{selection}} of an appropriate wavelet {{is an essential}} issue that should be addressed in the wavelet-based filtering of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Since entropy can measure the features of uncertainty associated with the ECG signal, a novel comprehensive entropy criterion Ecom based on multiple criteria related to entropy and energy is proposed in this paper to search for an optimal base wavelet for a specific ECG signal. Taking account of the decomposition capability of wavelets and the similarity in information between the decomposed coefficients and the analyzed signal, the proposed Ecom criterion integrates eight criteria, i. e., energy, entropy, energy-to-entropy ratio, joint entropy, conditional entropy, mutual information, relative entropy, as well as comparison information entropy for optimal wavelet selection. The experimental validation is conducted {{on the basis of}} ECG signals of sixteen subjects selected from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The Ecom is compared with each of these eight criteria through four filtering performance indexes, i. e., output signal to noise ratio (SNRo), root mean square error (RMSE), percent root mean-square difference (PRD) and correlation coefficients. The filtering results of ninety-six ECG signals contaminated by noise have verified that Ecom has outperformed the other eight criteria in the {{selection of}} best base wavelets for ECG signal filtering. The wavelet identified by the Ecom has achieved the best filtering performance than the other comparative criteria. A hypothesis test also validates that SNRo, RMSE, PRD and correlation coefficients of Ecom are significantly {{different from those of the}} <b>shape-matched</b> approach (α =  0. 05, two-sided t- test) ...|$|R
40|$|Young {{typically}} developing (TD) {{children have}} been observed to utilize word learning strategies such as the noun bias and shape bias; these improve their efficiency in acquiring and categorizing novel terms. Children using the shape bias extend object labels to new objects of the same shape; thus, the shape bias prompts the categorization of object words based on the global characteristic of shape over local, discrete details. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently attend to minor details of objects rather than their global structure. Therefore, children with ASD may not use shape bias to acquire new words. Previous research with children with ASD has provided evidence that they parallel TD children in showing a noun bias, but not a shape bias (Tek et al., 2008). However, this sample was small and individual and item differences were not investigated in depth. In an extension of Tek et al., (2008) with twice the sample size and a wider developmental timespan, we tested 32 children with ASD and 35 TD children in a longitudinal study across 20 months using the Intermodal Preferential Looking (IPL) paradigm. Children saw five triads of novel objects (target, <b>shape-match,</b> color-match) in both NoName and Name trials; those who looked longer at the shape match during the Name trials than the NoName trials demonstrated a shape bias. The TD group showed a significant shape bias at all visits, beginning at 20 months of age while the language-matched ASD group did not show a significant shape bias at any visit. Within the ASD group, though, some children did show a shape bias; these children had larger vocabularies concurrently and longitudinally. Degree of shape bias elicitation varied by item, but did not seem related to perceptual complexity. We conclude that shape {{does not appear to}} be an organizing factor for word learning by children with ASD...|$|R

Our approach improves upon state-of-the-art interactive <b>shape-matching</b> meshless simulation methods by not only capturing important nuances of an object's kinematics but also of its dynamic texture variation. We are able to achieve this in an automated pipeline from data capture to simulation. Our system allows for the capture of idiosyncratic characteristics of an object's dynamics which for many simulations (e. g. facial animation) is essential. We allow for the plausible simulation of mechanically complex objects without knowledge of their inner workings.

These applications {{have been based}} upon assumptions regarding film structure and electronic properties. This thesis provides an increased understanding of factors that control structure in binary molecular films and begins to establish structure-electronic property relations. In this thesis, three technologically relevant "donor-acceptor" systems are studied with variable temperature STM/STS: pentacene (Pn) :C 60, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) : C 60 and ZnPc: perfluorinated zinc phthalocyanine (F 16 ZnPc). These three model systems provide a systematic exploration {{of the impact of}} molecular shape and molecular band offset on morphology-electronic relations in thin film heterostructures. For Pn:C 60, I show how domain size and architecture are controlled by composition and film processing conditions. Sequential deposition of pentacene, followed by C 60, yields films that range from nanophase-separated, to co-crystalline phases, to a templated structure. These distinct structures are selectively produced from distinct pentacene phases which are controlled via pentacene coverage. For the ZnPc:C 60 system, the shape of ZnPc and the lattice mismatch between ZnPc and C 60 are quite different from the Pn:C 60 films. Nonetheless, ZnPc:C 60 films also yield chemical morphologies that can be similarly controlled from phase separated, to co-crystalline phases, to templated structures. In both of these binary films, I exploit relative differences in the component cohesive energies to control phase selection. In bilayer films of both systems, a common structural element of stress-induced defects is also observed. In ZnPc:F 16 ZnPc, I explore two components with similar shapes and cohesive energies while retaining molecular band offsets comparable to Pn:C 60. In this <b>shape-matched</b> system, a checkerboard ZnPc:F 16 ZnPc arrangement stabilized by hydrogen bonds readily forms. This supramolecular structure introduces a new hybridization state close to the Fermi Level, yielding electronic properties distinct from the component phases.

We tested this hypothesis by tracking {{the time course of}} attentional processing biases with the N 2 pc component in tasks where observers searched for two targets defined by a colour/shape conjunction. In Experiment 1, two displays presented in rapid succession (100 ms or 10 ms SOA) each contained a target and a colour-matching or <b>shape-matching</b> distractor on opposite sides. Target objects in both displays elicited N 2 pc components of similar size that overlapped in time when the SOA was 10 ms, suggesting that attention was allocated in parallel to both targets. Analogous results were found in Experiment 2, where targets and partially matching distractors were both accompanied by an object without target-matching features. Colour- and <b>shape-matching</b> distractors also elicited N 2 pc components, and the target N 2 pc was initially identical to the sum of the two distractor N 2 pcs, suggesting that the initial phase of attentional object selection was guided independently by feature templates for target colour and shape. Beyond 230 ms after display onset, the target N 2 pc became superadditive, indicating that attentional selection processes now started {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of feature conjunctions.
