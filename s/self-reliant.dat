5|$|One {{approach}} to sustainable living, exemplified by small-scale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages, seeks to create <b>self-reliant</b> communities based on principles of simple living, which maximize self-sufficiency particularly in food production. These principles, {{on a broader}} scale, underpin {{the concept of a}} bioregional economy. These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of open source appropriate technology.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 White Paper {{was seen}} by many as an attempt to {{strengthen}} Australia's relationship with the United States, which had been damaged by New Zealand's stance against nuclear weapons in its ports. In line with this policy, the RAN was structured to become more <b>self-reliant</b> and its activities during the late 1980s were focused on operating within Australia's local region.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less <b>self-reliant.</b> Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi first {{proposed}} a flag to the Indian National Congress in 1921. The flag {{was designed by}} Pingali Venkayya. In the centre was a traditional spinning wheel, symbolising Gandhi's goal of making Indians <b>self-reliant</b> by fabricating their own clothing. The design was then modified to include a white stripe in the centre for other religious communities, and provide a background for the spinning wheel. Subsequently, to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme, saffron, white and green were chosen for the three bands, representing courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{returns to}} {{apologize}} but is turned {{away by a}} fearful Burns. With no one around, Burns learns to do things himself and soon becomes completely <b>self-reliant.</b> After thanking Homer for making him learn that he can fend for himself, Burns fires Smithers when he returns from his vacation. Smithers and Homer engage in a fight within Burns' office which ends when Burns accidentally falls out the window. Burns is seriously injured and becomes reliant on Smithers once again. In gratitude, Smithers sends Homer a fruit basket.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} twelve newborn babies in Banja Luka {{hospital}} {{due to a}} shortage of incubator bottled oxygen were cited as an immediate cause for the action, but the veracity of the incident has since been questioned. Borisav Jović, a contemporary high-ranking Serbian official {{and member of the}} Yugoslav Presidency, has claimed that the report was just wartime propaganda, stating that Banja Luka had two bottled oxygen production plants in its immediate vicinity and was virtually <b>self-reliant</b> in that respect.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson started {{school at}} Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield. Soon afterwards, {{when he was}} six, he was also {{despatched}} to Sheffield, where he attended a primary school in Manor Top. After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior. Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be <b>self-reliant</b> as {{he was unable to}} make close friends. Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper , who was born in 1963. He tried to isolate himself from her {{as much as he could}} when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Victoria became {{seriously ill}} of typhoid fever {{on the last}} of the royal tours. Exploiting her {{weakened}} state, the Duchess and Conroy unsuccessfully tried to force her into signing a document; this document would have appointed Conroy her personal secretary upon her accession. Victoria emerged from the incident more determined than ever to become <b>self-reliant.</b> Her increased intransigence alarmed the Duchess. At her behest, family adviser Baron Stockmar investigated, recommending to the Duchess that she dismiss Conroy and make peace with her daughter. But Conroy easily convinced the Duchess to ignore Stockmar's advice. Even after Victoria's eighteenth birthday on 24 May 1837, Conroy continued to pressure her to appoint him as her private secretary or acknowledge her need for a regent until she turned twenty-one.|$|E
5|$|Noda is a <b>self-reliant</b> {{young man}} who executes the {{strategies}} formed by the SSS and fights with a halberd. He does not listen to anyone other than Yuri, for whom he has adoration, and is antagonistic to almost everyone else. He has a one-sided rivalry with Otonashi. He is a complete idiot whose weakness is education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He {{is not afraid to}} harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way. Though he prefers to fight with his halberd, he sometimes uses guns out of necessity, the type of weaponry that he hates.|$|E
5|$|The unit, {{initially}} {{known as}} the No.1 Long Range Patrol Unit (LRP), was founded on 3 July 1940. Bagnold wanted men who were energetic, innovative, <b>self-reliant,</b> physically and mentally tough, and able to live and fight in seclusion in the Libyan desert. Bagnold felt that New Zealand farmers would possess these attributes and was given permission to approach the 2nd New Zealand Division for volunteers; over half the division volunteered. Two officers and 85 other ranks including 18 administrative and technical personnel were eventually selected, coming mostly from the Divisional Cavalry Regiment and the 27th Machine-Gun Battalion. Once the men had been recruited, they started training in desert survival techniques and desert driving and navigation, with additional training in radio communications and demolitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{country has}} {{developed}} into a centre of Islamic banking, and is {{the country with the}} highest numbers of female workers in that industry. Knowledge-based services are also expanding. To create a <b>self-reliant</b> defensive ability and support national development, Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. The privatisation has created defence industry, which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council. The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the defence industry. Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical devices, and IT and communication products. Malaysia began developing its own space programme in 2002, and in 2006, Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian to the International Space Station as part of a multibillion-dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The government has invested in building satellites in through the RazakSAT programme.|$|E

25|$|The defeat {{prompted}} India to {{make major}} changes in its military. The Department of Defence Production was established to create an indigenous defence production base, which would be <b>self-reliant</b> and self-sufficient. Since 1962, 16 new ordnance factories have been built under the program.|$|E
25|$|He is the {{president}} of the UK charity Tree Aid, which enables communities in Africa's drylands to fight poverty and become <b>self-reliant,</b> while improving the environment. He has many interests, including climate change, population issues, conservation of biodiversity and the early history of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|The Overseas Development Institute {{has found}} that aid {{programmes}} need to move from short-term models of assistance (such as food or cash handouts) to more sustainable long-term programmes that help refugees become more <b>self-reliant.</b> This can involve tackling difficult legal and economic environments, by improving social services, job opportunities and laws.|$|E
25|$|Ulric is {{considered}} a harsh, remote, and unforgiving god, who expects his chosen people to be <b>self-reliant.</b> He is {{not considered to be}} married and is not noted to have sired offspring. His brother is Taal, and is noted as possibly being part of an older triad with Taal and Rhya. He is the uncle of Manann, the sea god of the Old World.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1976, the Service {{was known}} as the NSW Ambulance Transport Service Board, and it was not funded by the NSW State Government, but was <b>self-reliant,</b> with Ambulance Officers having to conduct regular {{fundraising}} activities usually weekly and sign people up to Ambulance subscriptions. Many people who would otherwise attend their local doctor in recent times, would attend an Ambulance station for treatment for minor injuries as it did not cost them anything.|$|E
25|$|Born {{in a rural}} part of Lowell, Massachusetts, Chadwick {{received}} some early musical training from organ lessons given by his older brother, Fitz Henry. He developed an independent, <b>self-reliant</b> character early in his life. Dropping {{out of high school}} in 1871, Chadwick assisted briefly in his father's insurance business. The experience enabled him to travel to Boston and other cities, where he attended concerts and cultural events that might have initiated his lifelong interest in the arts.|$|E
25|$|During the pre-World War II period, {{newspaper}} reporter {{was one of}} the few roles in American cinema that positively portrayed women as intelligent, competent, <b>self-reliant,</b> and career-oriented -- virtually equal to men. Of these role models, Torchy Blane, a smart, beautiful, wisecracking female reporter was perhaps the best-known. The typical plot of movies featuring the character have the resilient, fast-talking Torchy solving a crime (the central element of the film's plot) before her less-than-perceptive lover, loud-mouthed police detective Steve McBride, can.|$|E
25|$|Long term {{plans for}} the {{boulevard}} is extending it in both ways {{of the city to}} southern part of Olingan and northern part of Barra creating a new river park esplanade. Also included for foreshore development are areas of Minaog and Sicayab that goes beyond the Dipolog Airport. All of the said plans are drafted in the city's blueprint program named SWIGAPORE 2030 that aims in making Dipolog a <b>self-reliant,</b> super city by 2030 in terms of infrastructure, housing. social and health services.|$|E
25|$|The {{passage of}} the Local Government Code in 1991 {{provided}} local governments autonomy which has allowed them develop into <b>self-reliant</b> communities. On February 14, 1998, President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act No. 8526, which converted the municipality of Valenzuela into a highly urbanized chartered city. The law also ordered {{the division of the}} newly created city into two legislative districts. When the law was ratified on December 30, 1998, Valenzuela became the 12th city to be admitted in Metro Manila and the 83rd in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{critics have}} pointed out that Colbert had a mixture of unique {{physical}} assets (her round apple-face, big eyes, curly hair, slender body), an elegant voice, aristocratic manner, relaxed acting, a tongue-in-cheek vivacity, intelligent style, comedic timing and ladylike alluring charm, that distinguishes her from other screwball comediennes of the 1930s. In her comedy films, she invariably played shrewd and <b>self-reliant</b> women, but unlike many of her contemporaries, Colbert rarely engaged in physical comedy. Her characters {{were more likely to be}} observers and commentators.|$|E
25|$|When men {{experience}} vulnerable {{feelings and}} other feelings {{that are associated}} with women, men can become frightened. According to Kierski (2007), the fear of the feminine then acts in two ways: a) Like an internal monitor to ensure that men stay within the boundaries of what is regarded as masculine, i.e. being action orientated, <b>self-reliant,</b> guarded, and seemingly independent; b) if a man fails to experience this and feels out of control, vulnerable or dependent, the fear of the feminine can act like a defence, leading to splitting off, repressing, or projecting those feelings.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, Mexico has {{improved}} its training techniques, military command and information structures {{and has taken}} steps to becoming more <b>self-reliant</b> in supplying its military by designing as well as manufacturing its own arms, missiles, aircraft, vehicles, heavy weaponry, electronics, defense systems, armor, heavy military industrial equipment and heavy naval vessels. Since the 1990s, when the military escalated {{its role in the}} war on drugs, increasing importance has been placed on acquiring airborne surveillance platforms, aircraft, helicopters, digital war-fighting technologies, urban warfare equipment and rapid troop transport.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, Nearing and Helen Knothe lived {{together}} in Winhall in rural Vermont, {{where they had}} purchased a rather large forest tract for $2200 and a moderate-sized farm for $2500. Nearing and Knothe lived a largely ascetic and <b>self-reliant</b> life, growing much of their own food and putting up nine stone buildings {{over the course of}} two decades. Cash was earned from producing maple syrup and maple sugar from the trees on their land and from Scott Nearing's occasional paid lectures. They married in 1947.|$|E
25|$|North Korea officially {{describes}} {{itself as}} a <b>self-reliant,</b> socialist state and formally holds elections. Various media outlets have called it Stalinist, particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around Kim Il-sung and his family. International organizations have assessed that human rights violations in North Korea have no parallel in the contemporary world. The Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), led {{by a member of}} the ruling family, holds power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members.|$|E
25|$|The United States Supreme Court case of Winters v. United States {{held that}} the decree enjoining the {{companies}} from utilizing river waters intended for an American Indian reservation was affirmed. It was also held that when American Indian reservations were created by the United States government, they were created {{with the intention of}} allowing the American Indian settlements to become <b>self-reliant</b> and self-sufficient. As American Indian reservations require water to become self-sufficient in areas such as agriculture, it was found that water rights were reserved for tribes as an implication of the treaties that created the reservations.|$|E
25|$|In August 2001, Republic Act 9155, {{otherwise}} {{called the}} Governance of Basic Education Act, was passed. This act {{changed the name}} of DECS to the current Department of Education (DepEd) and redefined the role of field offices (regional offices, division offices, district offices and schools). The act provided the overall framework for school empowerment by strengthening the leadership roles of headmasters and fostering transparency and local accountability for school administrations. The goal of basic education was to provide the school age population and young adults with skills, knowledge, and values to become caring, <b>self-reliant,</b> productive, and patriotic citizens.|$|E
25|$|India House, {{which now}} housed the Abhinav Bharat Society and its {{relatively}} peaceful front the Free India Society, rapidly {{developed into a}} radical meeting ground {{quite different from the}} IHRS. Unlike the latter, it became wholly <b>self-reliant</b> with regard to finances and organisation, and it developed independent nationalist ideologies that moved away from European philosophies. Under Savarkar's influence, it drew inspiration from past Indian revolutionary movements, religious scriptures (including the Bhagavad Gita), and Savarkar's own studies in Indian history, including The Indian War of Independence. Savarkar translated Giuseppe Mazzini's autobiography into Marathi and extolled the virtues of secret societies.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Purge {{focuses on}} two main females, {{both of whom}} reviewers have commented on as complex and are {{integral}} to understanding the themes of the book. The novel begins with Aliide Truu, an elderly woman who has survived many of {{the horrors of the}} Soviet occupation of Estonia. The Aliide who the reader first meets has alienated herself from the local people, though strongly <b>self-reliant.</b> Though cloaked in a rough exterior, she represents a woman who has weathered considerable hardship. She has hardly anything in the way of motherly instinct, especially in regards to the other main character, Zara.|$|E
25|$|Moraldo Rubini (Franco Interlenghi), Sandra's {{brother and}} the {{youngest}} of the five vitelloni, uncomfortably observes Fausto's womanizing as he ponders his own existence, dreaming of ways to escape to the big city. Riccardo (Riccardo Fellini), the baritone, nourishes unrealistic ambitions to sing and act. Alberto (Alberto Sordi), the daydreamer, is supported by his mother and <b>self-reliant</b> sister, Olga (Claude Farell). Vulnerable and effeminate, he's unhappy that Olga is secretly dating a married man. Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste), the aspiring dramatist, writes a play that he discusses with Sergio Natali (Achille Majeroni), an eccentric stage actor he hopes will perform in it.|$|E
25|$|Childhood on the American {{frontier}} is contested territory. One {{group of}} scholars, {{following the lead}} of novelists Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder, argue the rural environment was beneficial to the child's upbringing. Historians Katherine Harris and Elliott West write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more <b>self-reliant,</b> mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten and Lillian Schlissel offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age. Riney-Kehrberg takes a middle position.|$|E
25|$|The Land Development program (Vietnamese: Khu dinh điền): In early 1957, Diệm {{started a}} new program called the Land Development to {{relocate}} poor inhabitants, demobilized soldiers, and minority ethnic groups in central and southern Vietnam into abandoned or unused land in Mekong Delta and Central Highland, and cultivating technological and scientific achievements to transform South Vietnam and ensure security and prevent communist infiltration. Diệm believed that the program would help improve civilians' lives, teach them the values of being <b>self-reliant</b> and hard working. At the end of 1963, the program had built {{more than two hundred}} settlements for {{a quarter of a million}} people. Nevertheless, the lacks of conditions in these areas along with the corruption and mercilessness of local officials failed the program.|$|E
