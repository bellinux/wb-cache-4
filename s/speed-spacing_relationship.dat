This simulation-based {{study examines}} an on-ramp bottleneck using Newell's lower order car following model with a driver relaxation factor added for the vehicles that enter or are immediately behind an entering vehicle (termed “affected vehicles”). The affected vehicles will tolerate a truncated headway for a little while after an entrance but slowly relax back to their preferred <b>speed-spacing</b> <b>relationship.</b> All other vehicles remain on their preferred <b>speed-spacing</b> <b>relationship</b> throughout. Simulating conventional detector measurements, we show that flow is supersaturated in any sample containing an affected vehicle with a truncated headway, i. e., the flow is higher than the underlying FR would predict. This systematic bias is not readily apparent in the detector measurements and during the initial queue formation the supersaturated states can exceed the bottleneck capacity. As the affected drivers relax, the high flows become unsustainable so a queue initially forms downstream of the on-ramp (consistent with earlier empirical results) only later receding upstream past the on-ramp. This initial phase of activation often lasts several minutes. Without any evidence of queuing upstream of the ramp, the conventional point bottleneck model would erroneously indicate that the bottleneck is inactive. Thus, an empirical study or traffic responsive ramp meter could easily mistake the supersaturated flows to be capacity flow, when in fact these supersaturated flows simply represent system loading during the earliest portion of bottleneck activation. Instead of flow dropping “from capacity”, we see flow drop “to capacity” from supersaturation. We also discuss how the supersaturated states distort empirically observed FR. We speculate that these subtle mechanisms are very common and have confounded the results of many past empirical studies...|$|E

The shape of the fundamental diagram is characterised by type of facility, gender, age, space requirements for the pedestrians and so on. In the early stage of pedestrian research, linear relationship between speed - density was assumed but with different linear relationships for different type of pedestrians. The linear speed-density relationship was used to develop a <b>speed-space</b> <b>relationship</b> and finally converted into speed-flow and flow-density relationship [1].|$|R
