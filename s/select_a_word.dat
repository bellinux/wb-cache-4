2500|$|To {{develop the}} {{characters}} for Animorphs, Applegate {{would go through}} teenage magazines such as YM and Seventeen (both of which are referenced in the books when describing Rachel), cutting out pictures and piecing them together {{to get an idea}} of what sort of children the Animorphs would look like. Applegate stated in an interview online that many of the names for her alien creatures, races, and locations are actually scrambled names of local street signs or companies that she happens to notice. For instance, the word nothlit was derived from the hotel name Hilton. According to the Anibase, Applegate did not make up the titles for the Animorphs books: it was up to the Scholastic editors to create the titles for the books based on the outlines provided by the author, having to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> that not only fit the book's storyline, but sounded good with the characteristic [...] "The" [...] preface. One of the author's favorite books, The Lord of the Rings, lent several words and images to Animorphs: the elvish word for Orc, [...] "yrch", became Yeerk; the flaming red Eye of Sauron inspired the Crayak, and Ax's middle name, [...] "Esgarrouth", is based on a town in the books called Esgaroth. The human name of Ax's brother, Elfangor, is Alan Fangor and his last name is in reference to the Fangor region or Fangorn Forest. Also there was a minor reference to Gondor, in the form of a fictional company named [...] "Gondor Industries" [...] in the 14th book. (It may also be significant that Visser Three's host is named Alloran, a rough homonym of Gandalf's Valinorean name [...] "Olórin", and that one of the minor alien races is called [...] "the Five", which is also a term used in The Lord of the Rings for the Istari.) ...|$|E

[...] Mr. Searle uttered the vague ejaculation with which self-conscious Britons so often betray the concussion of any especial courtesy of speech. But he followed this by a sudden odd glare and the sharp declaration: [...] "I'm an honest man!" [...] I was quite prepared to assent; but he went on with a fury of frankness, {{as if it were}} the first time in his life he had opened himself to any one, as if the process were highly disagreeable and he were hurrying through it as a task. [...] "An honest man, mind you! I know nothing about Mr. Clement Searle! I never expected to see him. He has been to me a--a--!" [...] And here he paused to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> which should vividly enough express what, for good or for ill, his kinsman represented. [...] "He has been to me an Amazement! I've no doubt he's a most amiable man. You'll not deny, however, that he's a very extraordinary sort of person. I'm sorry he's ill. I'm sorry he's poor. He's my fiftieth cousin. Well and good.

50|$|If {{the second}} click is made after the time expires it is {{considered}} to be a new, single click. Most modern operating systems and mice drivers allow a user to change the speed of a double click, along with an easy way to test the setting. Some software recognizes three or more clicks, such as progressively <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> sentence, or paragraph in <b>a</b> <b>word</b> processor text page as more clicks are given in a sequence.|$|R

50|$|Gypsy, like Bravo, used a three-button mouse. With {{the first}} button alone, the novice user could do {{everything}} described above (and more) except double-clicking to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> The {{second and third}} buttons were intended for experts who were used to Bravo's method of copying or wanted to accelerate word selection using double click.|$|E
50|$|Here, {{there are}} five couples of words, and for each one, the finalist has to <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> When he errs, the host halves the prize money.

30|$|Some of the DualPad keys {{directly}} lead to {{the generation}} of virtual keystrokes or mouse eventsc. For example, pressing the “Confirmation key” on the DualPad in most modes generates an input event corresponding to the RETURN key on a standard keyboard.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} DIANA, a new {{computational model}} of human speech processing. It {{is the first}} model that simulates the complete processing chain from the on-line processing of an acoustic signal to the execution of a response, including reaction times. Moreover it assumes minimal modularity. DIANA consists of three components. The activation component computes a probabilistic match between the input acoustic signal and representations in DIANA’s lexicon, resulting in <b>a</b> list of <b>word</b> hypotheses changing over time as the input unfolds. The decision component operates on this list and <b>selects</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> as soon as sufficient evidence is available. Finally, the execution component accounts for the time to execute a behavioral action. We show that DIANA well simulates the average participant in <b>a</b> <b>word</b> recognition experiment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{automatic}} speech summarization method having two stages: important sentence extraction and sentence compaction. Relatively important sentences are extracted {{based on the}} amount of information and the confidence measures of constituent words, and the set of extracted sentences is compressed by our sentence compaction method. The sentence compaction is performed by <b>selecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> set that maximizes a summarization score consisting of the amount of information and the confidence measure of each word, the linguistic likelihood of word strings, and the word concatenation probability. The selected words are concatenated to create a summary. Effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed by summarizing a spontaneous presentation...|$|R

These lists can hardly be used by visually impaired users in a short time. In this paper, we present three studies to find an interaction which minimizes {{the time required to}} <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> from a list without knowing its elements a priori. First, we explored the various possible item layouts, to conclude that a linear spatial arrangement is preferable. Then we studied the audio feedback, and we have determined that providing on-demand audio feedback is enough. Finally, we proposed four validation interactions to retain a validation based on the principle of a press-release gesture...|$|E

Collect from the same dictionary all possible synonyms of the base-word that specify it in the definition, or specific examples of the same class as the base-word. From these accumulated synonyms, extract those having the same letter-length as the base-word. Arrange examples of your selection one above another, vertically, in such a manner that a 2 ̆ 2 square 2 ̆ 2 is formed, with the base-word reading downwards at some letter-position within that square (see example at the right).

30|$|Answer-key {{identification}} {{is the task}} where we <b>select</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> {{or a group of}} words (n-gram) which has the potential to become the correct answer of the OCQ. An OCQ has one correct answer-key without alternatives. Therefore we need to identify the answer-key from the selected sentence for question formation. Every informative sentence consists of Unigram and/or Bigram and/or Ngram answer-keys. We have seen that the Ngram key gives more information about the sentence as well as the topic from where we have taken the sentence than the Unigram key. Therefore first we have tried to identify the Ngram answer-key from the sentence; if there is no Ngram key available then we have considered the Unigram answer-key to generate the question. For an open cloze question, it is difficult to guess the answer. Therefore we have considered the number of words in Ngram upto three for our experimental work.|$|E
