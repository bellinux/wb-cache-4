5|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a sustainable development of ethanol production, in September 2009 the government issued by decree a countrywide agroecological land use zoning to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas. According to the new criteria, 92.5% of the Brazilian territory is not suitable for sugarcane plantation. The government considers that the suitable areas are {{more than enough to}} meet the future demand for ethanol and <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domestic and international markets foreseen for the next decades.|$|E
5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{endosperm}} of {{a developing}} seed have many potential roles, including {{the supply of}} carbon to the developing embryo and controlling gene expression in it. Our understanding of their metabolism is, however, fragmentary and is confined to a very few species (especially Vicia spp.). To develop a quantitative understanding of <b>the</b> regulation of <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> seeds of oilseed rape (Brassica napus), we measured relevant enzyme activities, the sizes of <b>the</b> pools of <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liquid endosperm, and the flux of sugars from the endosperm into the embryo. The concentrations of hexose <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liquid endosperm decreased, and sucrose (Suc) increased through development. The overall osmotic potential also fell. The timing of the changes was not precise enough {{to determine whether they}} signaled the onset of rapid accumulation of storage products. Changes in endosperm invertase activity were complex and quantitatively do not explain <b>the</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>sugars.</b> <b>The</b> embryo can metabolize hexose <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> addition to Suc, and possibly at higher rates. Therefore, in addition to invertase, the growing embryo itself has a potential to influence <b>the</b> balance of <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endosperm. The activity of Suc synthase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> embryo was greater than that of invertase during development. This observation and a higher activity of fructokinase than glucokinase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> embryo are both consistent with the embryo using Suc as a carbon source...|$|R
50|$|Bacteria that ferment any of <b>the</b> three <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium {{will produce}} {{byproducts}}. These byproducts are usually acids, which {{will change the}} color of the red pH-sensitive dye (phenol red) to a yellow color. Position of the color change distinguishes the acid production associated with glucose fermentation from the acidic byproducts of lactose or sucrose fermentation. Many bacteria that can ferment <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anaerobic butt of the tube are enterobacteria.|$|R

25|$|Even though Brazilian sugar was reputed {{as being}} of high quality, the {{industry}} faced a crisis during the 17th and 18th centuries when the Dutch and the French started producing <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Antilles, located {{much closer to}} Europe, causing sugar prices to fall.|$|E
25|$|Trockenbeerenauslese wines ("dry berries selection") {{are made}} from grapes of an even higher {{potential}} alcohol level, generally reachable only {{with the help of}} Botrytis. The grapes used for Trockenbeerenauslese have reached an even more raisin-like state than those used for Beerenauslese. Due to the high concentration of <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> raisin-like grape, these wines can only be made in a sweet style and make extremely sweet, concentrated and usually quite expensive wines.|$|E

25|$|As the Deep South was {{developed}} for cotton and <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first half of the}} nineteenth century, demand for slaves increased. This resulted in a massive forced migration (through the slave trade) of more than one million African Americans from the Upper South to the Deep South. Many traders brought slaves to New Orleans for domestic sale, and by 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the country, was the third-largest city, {{and was one of the}} wealthiest cities.|$|E
40|$|We used a {{complete}} set of Allium fistulosum - shallot (A. cepa Aggregatum group) monosomic addition lines (FF+ 1 A - FF+ 8 A) to identify shallot chromosomes affecting <b>the</b> production of <b>sugars.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> alien addition lines grown over two years in an experimental field at Yamaguchi University (34 °N, 131 °E), shallot chromosomes 2 A and 8 A altered <b>sugar</b> contents <b>in</b> leaf-bunching onion (A. fistulosum). Except for FF+ 2 A, every monosomic addition accumulated non-reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> winter leaf blades. FF+ 8 A caused an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amounts of non-reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter. FF+ 2 A hardly produced non-reducing sugar throughout the two-year study. These results indicated that genes related to non-reducing sugar metabolism are located on the 2 A and 8 A chromosomes. The results of regression analyses using 2002 data on A. fistulosum and the monosomic addition set revealed a correlation (r = 0. 63 ± 0. 07; mean ± SE., n = 9) between reducing sugar and monosaccharide (Glc+Fru) contents but no correlation between non-reducing sugar and sucrose contents. This result indicates the existence of other polysaccharides (e. g., scorodose) as non-reducing <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leaf blade...|$|R

25|$|Until {{the early}} seventeenth century, the Portuguese and the Dutch held a virtual {{monopoly}} on sugar exports to Europe. However, between 1580 and 1640 Portugal {{was incorporated into}} Spain, a country at war with Holland. The Dutch occupied Brazil's sugar area in the Northeast from 1630 to 1654, establishing direct control of the world's sugar supply. When the Dutch were driven out in 1654, they had acquired the technical and organizational know-how for sugar production. Their involvement in the expansion of <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean contributed to {{the downfall of the}} Portuguese monopoly.|$|E
25|$|Different {{techniques}} are employed {{to adjust the}} level of <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grape must. In the normal chaptalization process, cane sugar {{is the most common}} type of sugar added, although some winemakers prefer beet sugar or corn syrup. In many wine regions, brown sugar is an illegal additive, and in regions that disallow chaptalization altogether, grape concentrate may be added. After sugar is added to the must, naturally occurring enzymes break down the sucrose molecules in sugar into glucose and fructose, which are then fermented by the yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Between 3% and 10% of {{the mass}} of crop residue {{feedstocks}} can be recovered as furfural, {{depending on the type of}} feedstock. Furfural and water evaporate together from the reaction mixture, and separate upon condensation. The global production capacity is about 800,000 tons as of 2012. China is the biggest supplier of furfural, and accounts for the greater part of global capacity.

25|$|The Chenin blanc wines of Vouvray are {{characterized}} by the grape's natural high acidity. The perception of that acidity and style of wine will be determined based on the balance of <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wine. Dry or sec styles will have more noticeable acidity than the sweeter demi-sec and moelleux. The acidity is also a key component to the wine's aging ability. Depending on the style, Vouvrays can exhibit notes of honey, nuts, ginger, fig, apples and white flowers. Vouvrays are often paired with rich, hearty dishes and flavorful sauces.|$|E
25|$|Yeast consumes the <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{grapes and}} {{converts}} it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce {{different styles of}} wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, {{as well as other}} aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes include rice wine and fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate and elderberry.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Portuguese did {{not find}} mineral riches in their American colony, but they never lost the hope of someday finding such riches there.

25|$|Like France, rosés {{are made}} {{throughout}} Italy with {{the style and}} grape varieties used changing depending on the region and local climate. The long history of Italian rosés, particularly in the warm {{southern part of the}} country, stem from difficulties {{in the early days of}} winemaking to make dark, fully colored dry red wines without temperature controlled fermentation vessels. As the must macerated with the skins, the intense heat of the process would often kill the yeast resulting in a stuck fermentation and residual <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining wine. Eventually Italian winemakers realized that if they pressed the wines early in the process, remaining the skins, they could complete the fermentation albeit with a lightly colored wine.|$|E
