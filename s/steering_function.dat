40|$|We {{introduce}} a motion planning infrastructure, {{a new set}} of distance functions and a <b>steering</b> <b>function.</b> Motion planners are used in robotics in order to plan realistic motions by allowing for variable velocities, as opposed to path planners which either neglect or consider velocities as constant. The main goal of this thesis is to design a planning infrastructure with minimal input, which can solve the motion planning problem for various robots. This all within a reasonable time frame and without preprocessing. Here the state space is the combination of all possible positions and velocities. To find this solution the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) [1] motion planner has been adapted for use in the state space and was tested using a UR 5 robot arm model. By itself it was shown to be unable to connect two states, even after adding 100000 states to its tree. Thus to verify the commonly used euclidean distance metric {{a new set of}} simple diIn conclusion the probabilistically complete motion planner RRT has been adapted for the state space, which in combination with the <b>steering</b> <b>function</b> can find a non optimal connection between two states on the gostance functions has been created, which have been verified by calculating their correlation with actual motions and considering their behavior in RRT. Both strong and weak correlations were observed for these distance functions, yet no connections were established between states. Finally a <b>steering</b> <b>function</b> has been created, PID-connect, which connects both the start and the goal state to a zero velocity state using a PID-controller. PID-connect is able to compute a motion between two states reliably in a short time (0. 02 ± 0. 01 s, n = 1000). In conclusion a probabilistically complete variant o RRT has been adapted for use in the state space, which in combination with the <b>steering</b> <b>function</b> can find a non optimal motion between two states on the go.
