5|$|Despite being {{a popular}} protest flag, {{the leaders of}} the Umbrella Movement {{requested}} that participants of the movement not use the flag, as they intended to protest without intentionally provoking Chinese authorities or the Hong Kong Police Force. The flag has also been used outside of Hong Kong; in the United Kingdom, the blue ensign {{has been used as a}} symbol of protest to pressure the government of the United Kingdom to ensure the <b>Sino-British</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> is fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{used to be}} a British colony {{with the}} {{perpetual}} cession of Hong Kong Island from the Qing Empire after the First Opium War (1839–1842). The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and acquired a 99-year lease of the New Territories from 1898. Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during the Second World War until British control resumed in 1945. The <b>Sino-British</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> signed between the United Kingdom and China in 1984 paved way for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, when it became a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China {{with a high degree of}} autonomy.|$|E
5|$|The British Nationality Act 1981 {{reclassified}} Hong Kong into a British Dependent Territory {{amid the}} reorganisation of global territories of the British Empire. All residents of Hong Kong became British Dependent Territory Citizens (BDTC). Diplomatic negotiations began with China and eventually concluded with the 1984 <b>Sino-British</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration.</b> Both countries agreed to transfer Hong Kong's sovereignty to China on 1 July 1997, when Hong Kong would remain autonomous {{as a special}} administrative region {{and be able to}} retain its free-market economy, British common law through the Hong Kong Basic Law, independent representation in international organisations (e.g. WTO and WHO), treaty arrangements and policy-making except foreign diplomacy and military defence.|$|E

5|$|In September 1982 {{she visited}} China {{to discuss with}} Deng Xiaoping the {{sovereignty}} of Hong Kong after 1997. China was the first communist state Thatcher had visited {{and she was the}} first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, she sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. Deng insisted that the PRC's sovereignty on Hong Kong was non-negotiable, but stated his willingness to settle the sovereignty issue with the British government through formal negotiations, and both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. After the two-year negotiations, Thatcher conceded to the PRC government and signed the <b>Sino-British</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Following the Hong Kong {{handover}} ceremony, {{when the}} Union Jack and the Hong Kong blue ensign were lowered to symbolise {{the end of}} British rule in Hong Kong, the blue ensign lost its official status {{and was replaced by}} the current flag of Hong Kong. In the 2010s, the former flag of Hong Kong was used by protesters to represent the cultural differences between Hong Kong and China; the flag was also used to protest Chinese interference in Hong Kong, as well as perceived Chinese breaches of Hong Kong's universal suffrage (granted by the <b>Sino-British</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration).</b> The first high-profile use of the old flag in protests came in 2011 during pro-democracy protests. Protesters often stated that they did not use the blue ensign to endorse Hong Kong independence or the return of Hong Kong to British control, but rather because they felt that Hong Kong had greater freedom under British rule. The protesters also said that they used the flag to express the contrasting values of China and Hong Kong. Advocates of the Hong Kong Independence Movement and the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement use a derivative of the blue ensign, without the Union Jack and with the Chinese characters for Hong Kong (香港) in the centre of the arms. The right to display the old flag is protected under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and the Hong Kong Basic Law as an expression of free speech. Despite this, when the old flag began appearing in protests, pro-Beijing newspapers called for it to be banned. The pro-Beijing camp views the flag as a symbol of colonialism and a reminder of China's losses during the era of New Imperialism.|$|E

The research {{is based on}} the data of 551 <b>Sino‐British</b> <b>joint</b> ventures formed over the period of 1983 to 1996. It aims to provide an overview of <b>Sino‐British</b> <b>joint</b> ventures' investment in China and to explain the investment conditions.

It reveals the investment trend, the uneven spatial distribution, the sectoral characteristics and the ownership structure of joint ventures. Suggests that government economic strategy and policies towards FDI are imperative in shaping the investment patterns. Locational advantages, economic growth, industrial structures and reform process are major economic factors influencing the investment decisions. Decentralisation of decision making and local governments' facilitation efforts also play a complementary role in attracting foreign investment...|$|R

Signed in March, 1987 the Declaration established the process and conditions of the transfer of the territory from Portuguese rule to the People's Republic of China. The <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> served also as the main source of fundamental rights that were implemented in the Macau Special Administrtaive Region Basic Law.

In 1991 he became Director-General of Trade and in charge of all facets of trade negotiation and administration affecting Hong Kong.

25|$|Regardless of the {{competing}} claims for sovereignty, China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping recognised that Hong Kong, with its free market economy, {{could not be}} assimilated into the People's Republic overnight and that any attempt {{to do so would}} not be in the interests of either. He advocated a more pragmatic approach known as the one country, two systems policy, in which Hong Kong (as well as Macau, and potentially also Taiwan) would be able to retain their economic systems within the PRC. On 19 December 1984, the <b>Sino-British</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> on the Question of Hong Kong (The Joint Declaration) was signed between the PRC and UK governments. Under this agreement, Hong Kong would cease to be a British Dependent Territory on 1 July 1997 and would thenceforth be a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC.
