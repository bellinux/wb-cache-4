These services include the ability to exchange official information between military organizations and to support interoperability with allied nations, non-DoD activities and the IC operating in both the strategic/fixed-base and the tactical/deployed environments. Organizational Messaging supports the assured secure delivery of organizational messages within strict <b>service</b> <b>parameters.</b> This includes delivery times of three minutes or less for high precedence (flash and above) messages across the DISA-provided infrastructure.

50|$|Connection-oriented {{transmission}} {{requires a}} setup phase in each involved node before any packet {{is transferred to}} establish the parameters of communication. The packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints {{so that they are}} delivered in order and with error checking. Address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set-up phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. The signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. Acceptable values for <b>service</b> <b>parameters</b> may be negotiated. Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table. The packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets.|$|E

The advantages of suspension bridge compared with other bridges are: aesthethic performance and longer span where continuous short support along rivers or gorges is not possible. In designing a safe but fairly economical bridge, suitable structure dimensional must be considered. The suspension bridge has several dominan structural elements, such as main cable, hanger rod, main girder, and pylon. This {{research has been done}} by manual calculation and program analysis. The suspension footbridge model has 120 -meters span. Several structure element dimension variation is applied such as diameter of hanger rod, main cable, main girder profile inertia and pylon profile area. <b>Service</b> limit <b>parameters</b> such as: deflection, main girder maximum moment, backstay tensile load, main cable tensile load and pylon compression load have been considered.

50|$|Surendra Babu Mandava and Arogyaswami Paulraj founded Beceem Communications in 2004 {{to produce}} MIMO-OFDM {{chipsets}} for WiMAX. The company {{was acquired by}} Broadcom in 2010. WiMAX was developed {{as an alternative to}} cellular standards, is based on the 802.16e standard, and uses MIMO-OFDM to deliver speeds up to 138 Mbit/s. The more advanced 802.16m standard enables download speeds up to 1 Gbit/s. A nationwide WiMAX network was built in the United States by Clearwire, a subsidiary of Sprint-Nextel, covering 130 million points of presence (PoP) by mid-2012. Sprint subsequently announced plans to deploy LTE (the cellular 4G standard) covering 31 cities by mid-2013 and to shut down its WiMAX network by the end of 2015. The first 4G cellular standard was proposed by NTT DoCoMo in 2004. Long term evolution (LTE) is based on MIMO-OFDM and continues to be developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

The company was acquired by Broadcom in 2010.The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) created a task group in late 2003 to develop a wireless LAN standard delivering at least 100 Mbit/s of user data throughput. There were two major competing proposals: TGn Sync was backed by companies including Intel and Philips, and WWiSE was supported by companies including Airgo Networks, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments. Both groups agreed that the 802.11n standard {{would be based on}} MIMO-OFDM with 20 MHz and 40 MHz channel options. TGn Sync, WWiSE, and a third proposal (MITMOT, backed by Motorola and Mitsubishi) were merged to create what was called the Joint Proposal.
