5|$|The Bahá'í {{calendar}} {{is based}} upon the calendar established by the Báb. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five intercalary days, to make a full <b>solar</b> <b>year.</b> The Bahá'í New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called Naw Rúz, and occurs on the vernal equinox, near 21 March, {{at the end of the}} month of fasting. Bahá'í communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a Feast for worship, consultation and socializing.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} in the Maya {{calendar}} was one day, or k'in, and 20 k'in grouped to form a winal. The next unit, instead of being multiplied by 20, as called for by the vigesimal system, was multiplied by 18 {{in order to provide}} a rough approximation of the <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> (hence producing 360 days). This 360-day year was called a tun. Each succeeding level of multiplication followed the vigesimal system.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days {{before returning to the}} night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the <b>solar</b> <b>year.</b> This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior to the summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E
25|$|Al-Battani, in his Zij Al-Sabi', after {{mentioning}} Hipparchus calculating precession, and Ptolemy's {{value of}} 1 degree per 100 <b>solar</b> <b>years,</b> {{says that he}} measured precession and {{found it to be}} on degree per 66 <b>solar</b> <b>years.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because a {{tropical}} year is 365.24219879 days, and a synodic month is 29.53058868 days, {{the difference between}} nineteen <b>solar</b> <b>years</b> and 235 lunar months is only about two hours. Thus by adding seven intercalary months in nineteen <b>years,</b> the <b>solar</b> <b>years</b> and the lunar years basically synchronize.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Solar</b> Hijri <b>year</b> begins about 21 March of each Gregorian {{year and}} ends about 20 March {{of the next}} year. To convert the <b>Solar</b> Hijri <b>year</b> into the {{equivalent}} Gregorian year add 621 or 622 <b>years</b> to the <b>Solar</b> Hijri <b>year</b> {{depending on whether the}} <b>Solar</b> Hijri <b>year</b> has or has not begun.|$|R
5|$|The Maya calendrical system, {{in common}} with other Mesoamerican calendars, had its origins in the Preclassic period. However, it was the Maya that {{developed}} the calendar to its maximum sophistication, recording lunar and solar cycles, eclipses and movements of planets with great accuracy. In some cases, the Maya calculations were more accurate than equivalent calculations in the Old World; for example, the Maya <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> was calculated to greater accuracy than the Julian year. The Maya calendar was intrinsically tied to Maya ritual, and it was central to Maya religious practices. The calendar combined a non-repeating Long Count with three interlocking cycles, each measuring a progressively larger period. These were the 260-day tzolk'in, the 365-day haab', and the 52-year Calendar Round, resulting from {{the combination of the}} tzolk'in with the haab. There were also additional calendric cycles, such as an 819-day cycle associated with the four quadrants of Maya cosmology, governed by four different aspects of the god K'awiil.|$|E
25|$|The 28-year {{cycle is}} based on a <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> of 365.25 days, which is only nearly precise. The Hebrew {{calendar}} itself uses a <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> of 365.2468 days, but utilizes the less precise approximation of 365.25 for Birkat Hachama so that the blessing might occur with some frequency.|$|E
25|$|The Burmese {{calendar}} uses lunar months but {{tries to}} keep pace with the <b>solar</b> <b>year.</b> The present Thandeikta system's <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> is about 23 minutes 51.43 seconds ahead of the actual mean tropical year of 365.241289 days. The older Makaranta system was actually slightly more accurate, with 23 minutes 50.87 seconds ahead of the actual year.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s and 40s Tolkien used {{a figure}} which fluctuated {{slightly}} around ten {{before settling on}} 9.582 <b>solar</b> <b>years</b> in each Valian year. However, in the 1950s Tolkien decided to use a much greater value of 144 <b>solar</b> <b>years</b> per Valian year, and included this figure in The Lord of the Rings appendices as {{the length of the}} elven year (the yen).|$|R
25|$|While the {{new system}} has {{seemingly}} narrowed {{the gap between the}} calendar's solar and lunar years, it has not made the calendar more accurate when compared against the actual tropical year. Indeed, it is slightly worse than the old system. (The Thandeikta <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> is about 23 minutes 51.4304 seconds ahead of the mean <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> whereas Makaranta is about 23 minutes 50.8704 seconds ahead.) As a result, the calendar has kept on drifting away from the actual <b>solar</b> <b>year.</b> The calendarists have periodically resorted to modifying its intercalation schedule, based on apparent reckoning, to keep pace, at the expense of making publishing future calendars more than a few years out all but impossible.|$|E
25|$|Note: Because {{the dates}} for Birkat Hachama assume a 365.25-day <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> and the Julian {{calendar}} also assumes a 365.25-day <b>solar</b> <b>year,</b> Birkat Hachama will always fall on March 26 in the Julian calendar. While Birkat Hachama usually {{occurs in the}} Jewish lunar month of Nissan, {{this is not always}} the case; it will occur on 29 Adar II (April 10) in the year 2233.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the main}} purpose of Burmese {{calendar}} is {{to keep pace with the}} <b>solar</b> <b>year,</b> the new year is always marked by the <b>solar</b> <b>year,</b> which falls at the time when the Sun enters Aries. The date, which at the present falls on the 16 or 17 April, has slowly drifted over the centuries. In the 20th century, the New Year's Day fell on 15 or 16 April but in the 17th century, it fell on 9 or 10 April.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Rome's legendary 10-month calendar notionally {{lasted for}} 304 days but was usually thought {{to make up}} the rest of the <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> during an unorganized winter period. The unattested but almost certain lunar year and the pre-Julian civil year were 354 or 355 days long, with the difference from the <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> more or less corrected by an irregular intercalary month. The Julian year was 365 days long, with a leap day doubled in length every fourth year, almost equivalent to the present Gregorian system.|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew lunar year {{is about}} eleven days {{shorter than the}} <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> and uses the 19-year Metonic cycle to bring it into line with the <b>solar</b> <b>year,</b> with the {{addition}} of an intercalary month every two or three years, for a total of seven times per 19 years. Even with this intercalation, the average Hebrew calendar year is longer by about 6 minutes and 40 seconds than the current mean tropical year, so that every 216 years the Hebrew calendar will fall a day behind the current mean tropical year; and about every 231 years it will fall a day behind the mean Gregorian calendar year.|$|E
25|$|The front dial has two {{concentric}} circular scales {{that represent}} {{the path of the}} ecliptic through the heavens. The outer ring is marked off with the days of the 365-day Egyptian civil calendar. On the inner ring, a second dial marks the Greek signs of the Zodiac, with division into degrees. The mechanism predates the Julian calendar reform, but the Sothic and Callippic cycles had already pointed to a 365¼-day <b>solar</b> <b>year,</b> as seen in Ptolemy III's abortive calendrical reform of 238. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed leap day (Epag. 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter day in the <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> by turning the scale backward one day every four years.|$|E

25|$|Although the Maya {{calendar}} was {{not tied}} to the Sun, John Teeple has proposed that the Maya calculated the <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> to somewhat greater accuracy than the Gregorian calendar.

25|$|Until {{about the}} 12th century, all Zoroastrians {{followed}} the same 365-day religious calendar, which had remained largely unmodified since the calendar reforms of Ardashir I (r. 226-241 AD).

25|$|The Maya of Central America used a mixed base 18 {{and base}} 20 system, {{possibly}} {{inherited from the}} Olmec, including advanced features such as positional notation and a zero.

25|$|The Maya {{calendar}} is {{a system}} of calendars used in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and in many modern communities in the Guatemalan highlands, By its linear nature, the Long Count was capable of being extended to refer to any date far into the past or future. This calendar involved {{the use of a}} positional notation system, in which each position signified an increasing multiple of the number of days. The Maya numeral system was essentially vigesimal (i.e., base-20) and each unit of a given position represented 20 times the unit of the position which preceded it. An important exception was made for the second-order place value, which instead represented 18 × 20, or 360 days, more closely approximating the <b>solar</b> <b>year</b> than would 20 × 20 = 400 days. It should be noted however that the cycles of the Long Count are independent of the <b>solar</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
