25|$|An {{algorithm}} {{is said to}} take logarithmic time if T(n) = O(log n). Due {{to the use of}} the binary numeral system by computers, the logarithm is frequently base 2 (that is, log2 n, sometimes written lg n). However, by the change of base for logarithms, loga n and logb n differ only by a constant multiplier, which in big-O notation is discarded; thus O(log n) is the <b>standard</b> <b>notation</b> for logarithmic time algorithms regardless of the base of the logarithm.|$|E

Winds have a <b>standard</b> <b>notation</b> when plotted on weather maps. More than a century ago, winds were plotted as arrows, with feathers on just one side depicting five knots of wind, while feathers on both sides depicted [...] of wind. The notation changed to that of half of an arrow, with half of a wind barb indicating five knots, a full barb ten knots, and a pennant flag fifty knots.|$|E
