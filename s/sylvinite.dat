This was applied simultaneously with a four-electrode r sistivity measuring system for samples with very high resistivity.

40|$|From {{the late}} Cretaceous {{to the early}} Tertiary period, the Tethys {{seawater}} repeatedly invaded the Shaqa sub-basin and entered the Kuqa sub-basin through the Awati straight. At the same time, {{as a result of}} tectonic and paleoenvironmental conditions, many sequences of thick strata of evaporites, especially in its two largest sub-basins of Kuqa in the north and Shaqa in the southwest have been deposited. Therefore, the western Tarim Basin has been considered to be a favorable location to prospect for ancient potash deposits. In order to clearly distinguish between a marine or a continental origin, and also to study the evaporite facies (i. e., late vs. early stage), we analyzed the late stages of evaporites of gypsum and salt minerals and measured chlorine isotope values in halite, sulfur isotopes in gypsum and oxygen isotopes in crystalline water of gypsum. The results showed that the sulfur isotope composition of gypsum can be used to distinguish between a marine and continental origin and chlorine isotopes of salt and oxygen isotopes of crystalline water in gypsum can be used to judge the sedimentary stage. Based on these results, we conclude that the late Cretaceous halite deposited in the Kashi Depression of the southwestern Tarim Basin have a marine origin and represent a later stage of marine evaporite sequence compared to other evaporites in the regions. Hence, the Kashi Depression should be considered as a promising area for finding new <b>sylvinite</b> deposits...|$|E

40|$|The {{present day}} martian surface is cold, dry, exposed to UV {{radiation}} and bombarded with heavy ions [1]. Any remaining {{water in the}} near subsurface {{is likely to have}} a high salt concentration because of the likely evaporative processes occurring in those environments. Halophiles are UV resistant [3] and have an ability to entomb themselves within salt crystals during periods of desiccation [4], halophiles have therefore been proposed as analogues for potential martian life. Boulby Salt and Potash Mine in Yorkshire has excavations up to 1. 4 km underground and is the second deepest mine in Europe. Despite this depth and the darkness, Norton et al., [5] isolated halophiles from the halite deposits. In this project, we will attempt to isolate and characterize halophiles from halite and other salt-rich sediments from Boulby Mine such as potash, <b>sylvinite,</b> anhydrite and polyhalite, in order to gain an understanding of potential life in the subsurface of Mars. Although the Boulby Mine is used as a martian analogue environment [6], it does possess certain key differences from modern Mars, in particular its aerobic environment and warm temperature. Our long-term goals, once we have characterized the micro-organisms present, are to expose them to Mars conditions (past and present) to determine their ability to grow in such environments. Elements of the martian environment being considered include variations in temperature, lack of oxygen and variations in brine composition., We will then focus on defining molecular biomarkers and geochemical bio-signatures that may be used as evidence of past or present life on Mars.

40|$|Salt {{anomalies}} are {{a common}} problem to potash mining in Saskatchewan. The geology of the PCS Cory potash mine in the Patience Lake Member of the Prairie Evaporite Formation was studied to attempt to find indicators of proximity to anomalies. Initially, {{a basic understanding of}} normal potash ore was needed to provide a foundation of data for the study. The ore zone was divided into six units, based on potash rock­types and clay seams. The units may be correlated throughout the mine with varying degrees of success and are mappable. The potash deposition appears to have been cyclic, expressed in the repetitive distribution of hematite and other insoluble minerals. Four potash cycles, each about 1 m thick, make up the lower Patience Lake Member. In the upper Patience Lake Member there are 3 complete potash cycles, and 3 or 4 incomplete potash cycles. The cyclic distribution of disseminated insolubles was possibly due to a combination of source proximity and the strength of winds. The potash salts and associated iron oxides probably formed just beneath the sediment surface. Possible disconformities, created by the dissolution of overlying potash-bearing beds, may be indicated by an abundance of residual hematite in clay seams. Desiccation polygons, desiccation cracks, microkarst pits, and chevron halite crystals indicate that the Patience Lake Member was deposited in a shallow-brine, salt-pan environment. The insoluble minerals found in the PCS Cory samples are, in approximate order of decreasing abundance: dolomite, clays [illite, chlorite (including swelling-chlorite/chlorite), and septechlorite), quartz, anhydrite, hematite, and goethite. Detrital minerals include dolomite, illite (or mica precursors), chlorite, quartz, and fossil fragments. The septechlorite and swelling-chlorite/chlorite are probably authigenic. X-ray peaks and heating data indicate that the chlorites are rich in magnesium. Except in collapse features, the secondary redistribution of insolubles, other than iron oxides, is insignificant. Up to five post-burial facies, including carbonate-mud collapse breccias and bedded <b>sylvinite,</b> may result from post­burial leaching. The effects of the leaching that produced the anomalies, range from weak to strong, from selectively preserving delicate laminae and chevron textures, to deforming and destroying salt beds. Good preservation of iron oxides in halite may indicate that the leaching was weak or of short duration. In leach anomalies, salinities increase downward possibly because fluids exited downward. NaC 1 -saturated fluids tend to follow the chemical gradient provided by potash beds. Common indicators may exist equally for two different types of anomalies. Large blebs (eg. > 200 cm 2) of sylvite-poor potash cross-cutting units of an incomplete potash cycle {{near the top of the}} ore zone, were found about 5 m from a salt anomaly. Anhydrite was more common in an anomaly than in ore. Once into an anomaly, indicators of a major collapse feature may include: stretched clay seams, folded beds, small collapse features (1 - 20 m), split clay seams with injected salt, and drops in topography > 10 m of the marker seams. Any number, or none, of these indicators may be found close to a major collapse feature. The local abundance of anhydrite in ore may indicate the proximity of a salt anomaly...|$|E
40|$|Recent discoveries have reopened {{the idea}} that, in the past, Mars had {{a period of}} wetness where {{conditions}} {{were similar to those}} on Earth [1]. If this was the case then it is feasible that these environments may have harboured life. The martian surface today is dry, cold and heavily bombarded by UV radiation, making it an environment unsuitable for any known terrestrial life [2]; the martian subsurface might be considerably more hospitable. Subsurface microbial communities would not have access to sunlight for photosynthesis to drive their food chains, so primary production would have to be driven by chemolithoautotrophic organisms. Every successful Mars landing site has been found to have abundant surface salt [3], and halite has been detected in Martian meteorites [4]. While subsurface halite deposits have not yet been detected on Mars, areas on the surface consisting of unidentified chlorine deposits have been detected with evaporation as one of the main theories to explain their creation [5]. On Earth, chloride evaporites are home to halophiles, and they have been suggested as an analogue for potential Martian life. Halophiles are micro-organisms which display a high salt tolerance. Despite being found in evaporite deposits, they are normally studied in surface brines. Brines form when the rate of evaporation of water is greater than the rate that water enters an area [6], so eventually most brines evaporate and form salt crystals. Halophiles in a brine are able to alter the size and formation rate of fluid inclusions within these salt crystals so as to entomb themselves inside until the crystals can re-dissolve [7]. It is uncertain how long halophiles can spend entombed within crystals, but there are some who speculate that it could be up to millions of years, if not longer [8]. If life had arisen on Mars during an earlier, more hospitable, wet period, as it did on Earth, then when the planet cooled, organisms analogous to terrestrial halophiles might have had the greatest potential for survival [9]. As the atmosphere left the planet, any large pools of water would have gradually evaporated, with the remaining fluid becoming increasingly brine-like. The only organisms that could survive these high salt conditions would have to be halophilic. The possibility exists that, even if there are no free-living martian halophiles remaining now, as the brines crystallized, halophiles could have been entombed inside mineral grains. It is feasible that their biomarkers and/or DNA could be extracted by instruments onboard future Mars landers [10]. It is also interesting to consider that, even though known terrestrial halophiles could not survive the high UV on the Martian surface today, they are still some of Earth’s most UV tolerant terrestrial organisms. This is because, on Earth, briny environments tend to be created by evaporation of water brought on by intense sunlight; therefore organisms living in them get a high dose of UV [11]. It seems reasonable to suggest that a martian halophilic organism would, prior to the loss of Mars’ atmosphere, initially have evolved in environments similar to the ones in which they evolved on Earth and so might share similar adaptations. There is some evidence to suggest that there is still periodic liquid water on Mars in the form of brines [3]. Any surface-dwelling organism remaining on the planet would need to have UV and salt tolerance and be able to enter periods of dormancy during the long dry spells. Since terrestrial halophiles have all three of these attributes, they are probably good candidates for use as analogues of martian life. Boulby Salt and Potash mine in Yorkshire is 1. 4 km underground and the second deepest mine in Europe. Despite this depth and the darkness, Norton et al., isolated halophiles from the halite deposits [12]. In this project we will be attempting to isolate and characterize halophiles from halite, as well as from other salt-rich sediments such as potash, <b>sylvinite,</b> anhydrite and polyhalite, in order to gain an understanding of potential life in the subsurface of Mars. Although the Boulby mine is used as a martian analogue environment [13], it does possess certain key differences from modern Mars, in particular its aerobic environment. Our long-term goals, once we have characterized the micro-organisms present, is to expose them to Mars conditions (past and present) to determine their survival potential. We will also investigate differences between their growth in the mine and in the simulated martian brine environments. To detect the presence of potential extinct or extant life on Mars, we will also focus on attempting to define biomarkers that may be left by halophile growth and degradation in these Mars-like conditions. ...|$|E
