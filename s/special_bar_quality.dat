40|$|OG Technologies, Inc. (OGT) has led this SQA (Surface Quality Assured Steel Bar) {{program to}} solve the major surface quality {{problems}} plaguing the US special quality steel bars and rods industry and their customers, based on crosscutting sensors and controls technologies. Surface defects in steel formed in a hot rolling process {{are one of the}} most common quality issues faced by the American steel industry, accounting for roughly 50 % of the rejects or 2. 5 % of the total shipment. Unlike other problems such as the mechanical properties of the steel product, most surface defects are sporadic and cannot be addressed based on sampling techniques. This issue hurts the rolling industry and their customers in their process efficiency and operational costs. The goal of this program is to develop and demonstrate an SQA prototype, with synergy of HotEye® and other innovations, that enables effective rolling process control and efficient quality control. HotEye®, OGT’s invention, delivers high definition images of workpieces at or exceeding 1, 450 C while the workpieces travel at 100 m/s. The elimination of surface defect rejects will be achieved through the integration of imaging-based quality assessment, advanced signal processing, predictive process controls and the integration with other quality control tools. The SQA program team, composed of entities capable of and experienced in (1) research, (2) technology manufacturing, (3) technology sales and marketing, and (4) technology end users, is very strong. There were 5 core participants: OGT, Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT), University of Wisconsin (UW), Charter Steel (Charter) and ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor (Inland). OGT served as the project coordinator. OGT participated in both research and commercialization. GIT and UW provided significant technical inputs to this SQA project. The steel mills provided access to their rolling lines for data collection, design of experiments, host of technology test and verification, and first-hand knowledge of the most advanced rolling line operation in the US. This project lasted 5 years with 5 major tasks. The team successfully worked through the tasks with deliverables in detection, data analysis and process control. Technologies developed in this project were commercialized as soon as they were ready. For instance, the advanced surface defect detection algorithms were integrated into OGT’s HotEye® RSB systems late 2005, resulting in a more matured product serving the steel industry. In addition to the commercialization results, the SQA team delivered 7 papers and 1 patent. OGT was also recognized by two prestigious awards, including the R&D 100 Award in 2006. To date, this SQA project has started to make an impact in the <b>special</b> <b>bar</b> <b>quality</b> industry. The resulted product, HotEye® RSB systems have been accepted by quality steel mills worldwide. Over 16 installations were completed, including 1 in Argentina, 2 in Canada, 2 in China, 2 in Germany, 2 in Japan, and 7 in the U. S. Documented savings in reduced internal rejects, improved customer satisfaction and simplified processes were reported from various mills. In one case, the mill reported over 50 % reduction in its scrap, reflecting a significant saving in energy and reduction in emission. There exist additional applications in the steel industry where the developed technologies can be used. OGT is working toward bringing the developed technologies to more applications. Examples are: in-line inspection and process control for continuous casting, steel rails, and seamless tube manufacturing...|$|E

50|$|Small mills use {{a single}} {{chainsaw}} {{and can be}} handled by a single operator. Larger mills use two chainsaw power heads, one {{on either side of}} the attachment and these require two operators. This larger style of mill requires a <b>special</b> <b>bar</b> which allows the two chainsaw heads to be attached at either end. The width of the plank that can be cut is determined by the length of the bar, up to 34 in so for logs having a large diameter, the longer bar is necessary. Also a special chain is designed to make rip cuts rather than the usual chainsaw chain which is for cross-cutting.|$|R

The point value of the trick is based on time maintained, degrees rotated, number of tricks performed in sequence, and the number of times the tricks have been used (the more often a trick is used, the less it's worth). Successful tricks also add to the player's special meter, which, once full, allows for the execution of [...] "signature moves" [...] which are worth a great deal more than normal tricks.

40|$|AbstractBolker and Crapo [4] {{studied the}} {{possibilities}} of applying diagonal braces to rigidify a <b>special</b> <b>bar</b> and joint framework, the so called one-story building. Apparently, one of their ultimate goals was to solve the more general problem of the cubic grids. Some partial results towards this end were published in Bolker [2], who characterized the circuits of the describing matroid. However, his result is not completely satisfactory from the algorithmic point of view, since one still cannot decide whether a given set of diagonal braces makes the cubic grid rigid. In the present note we give {{a necessary condition for}} this, using matroid partition algorithm. This result also enables one to efficiently find a minimal set of braces meeting this condition; even an optimal one with respect to a weight function (say, when the costs of the possible diagonal braces are different). Finally we give an example which shows that the condition is not sufficient...|$|R
