5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but {{the magnitude of the}} effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torpedo was known and set, but the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E

5|$|Dual motor {{electric}} – At higher vehicle speeds {{the secondary}} motor engages over the planetary gear {{such that it}} reduces the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary motor.

5|$|An {{advantage}} held by Eurostar is {{the convenience}} and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> service: with shorter check-in times than at most airports and hence quicker boarding and less queueing and high punctuality, it takes {{less time to}} travel between central London and central Paris by high-speed rail than it does by air. Eurostar now has a dominant share of the combined rail–air market on its routes to Paris and Brussels. In 2004, it had a 66% share of the London–Paris market, and a 59% share of the London–Brussels market. In 2007, it achieved record market shares of 71% for London–Paris and 65% for London–Brussels routes.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> return trip.

5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} {{would be far}} beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.|$|E
