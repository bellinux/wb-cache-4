25|$|The city {{purchased}} {{its first}} <b>self-propelled</b> <b>truck</b> in 1924 for $8,000, {{which is on}} display at the Main Station. In 1928, the department received its first chief, Walter Tews, and first paid firefighter. The Ray-Maling Cannery burned in May 1929, that required assistance from neighboring fire departments, which was followed by fire at the Commercial Building at Second and Main in January 1933 that did $75,000 in damage.|$|E
50|$|Junkrat, {{real name}} Jamison Fawkes, is an Australian scavenger, {{mercenary}} and anarchist. He carries a Frag Launcher that fires grenades and employs Steel Traps and remote-detonated Concussion Mines; {{when he is}} killed, several primed grenades are released from his body in a final attempt {{to get back at}} the attacker (Total Mayhem). Junkrat's ultimate ability is RIP-Tire, a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>truck</b> wheel loaded with explosives that he's able to manually steer and detonate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{department}} then {{bought a}} two-cylinder chemical engine in 1908, {{adding to the}} hook and ladder and two hose carts the department already had. The city also installed a steel water reservoir that year to improve water pressure. [...] A nozzle belonging {{to one of the}} first pieces of equipment owned by the department was later uncovered during an excavation in 1911. The nozzle had been part of a pump engine originally used by the Sacramento Fire Department and later used by the Portland Fire Bureau and the City of Albany. One of the early fires was in January 1912 when the Commercial Hotel at Second and Washington burned, with two fatalities. The city built a new city hall in 1914 on Second Avenue, and the department moved into the building. The city purchased its first <b>self-propelled</b> <b>truck</b> in 1924 for $8,000, which is on display at the Main Station.

5000|$|Wagons {{and other}} means had been used for centuries to haul away solid waste. Among the first <b>self-propelled</b> garbage <b>trucks</b> were those ordered by Chiswick District Council from the [...] Thornycroft Steam Wagon and Carriage Company in 1897 {{described}} as a steam motor tip-car, a new design of body specific for [...] "the collection of dust and house refuse".|$|R
50|$|Recreational {{vehicles}} (RV) are {{utility vehicles}} or vans {{that are often}} equipped with living facilities. While some are <b>self-propelled</b> (integrated <b>truck</b> chassis), many are designed as trailers to be attached to a trailer hitch. These trailer hitches are common {{on the back of}} many cars and trucks, and RV trailers are commonly used for camping outings or road trips. In the United Kingdom, RV trailers are known as caravans.|$|R
50|$|The ZIL-135 is a large, eight-wheeled {{military}} {{transport and}} <b>self-propelled</b> artillery <b>truck</b> {{produced in the}} Cold War by the Soviet Union starting in 1959. Its purpose was to carry and launch an artillery missile, specifically a FROG-7, from surface-to-surface. The ZIL-135 was widely exported to other communist countries, most notably North Korea, where {{it is a common}} sight in films and military marches. It also served as the TEL for the BM-27 Uragan artillery rocket system.|$|R
50|$|The dirt is {{collected}} by either a dustbag or a cyclone for later disposal. Vacuum cleaners, {{which are used}} in homes {{as well as in}} industry, exist in a variety of sizes and modelsâ€”small battery-powered hand-held devices, wheeled canister models for home use, domestic central vacuum cleaners, huge stationary industrial appliances that can handle several hundred litres of dust before being emptied, and <b>self-propelled</b> vacuum <b>trucks</b> for recovery of large spills or removal of contaminated soil. Specialized shop vacuums can be used to suck up both dust and liquids.|$|R
50|$|Charles B. Brooks, an African American {{man from}} Newark, New Jersey, invented the U.S.' first <b>self-propelled</b> street sweeper <b>truck.</b> Brooks' patent was {{approved}} on March 17, 1896; his application for the patent had been filed on April 20, 1895. His street sweeper had a truck-like frame mounted on axles supported by wheels. There are drive-wheels for the sweeping, elevator mechanisms, and an endless chain that travels around a sprocket-wheel and travels {{up to an}} additional sprocket-wheel. The patent drawings go on to explain the complete composition of the invention. The truck had brushes attached to the front fender which would revolve. These revolving brushes could interchange with a flat scraper for use on snow and ice.|$|R
5000|$|... "The 9th Lancers {{took part}} in many decisive battles, none more so perhaps than the long {{withdrawal}} from Knightsbridge, south of Gazala, to El Alamein. Many think that Egypt was saved when the Eighth Army defeated Rommel's last big attack in the Western Desert {{at the end of}} August 1942. Actually, Egypt was saved earlier during those first few critical days of July when Rommel drove his tanks and <b>self-propelled</b> guns and <b>trucks</b> forward along the Ruweisat Ridge in close formations, to be stopped by the 25-pounders and the remnants of the 2nd Armoured Brigade with their [...] "thin-skinned" [...] Crusader tanks. In this critical action the 9th Lancers took the principal part. Throughout that long withdrawal from Knightsbridge, when the fluctuating Battle of Gazala had finally swung against the Eighth Army, past Sollum and Matruh to the Ruweisat Ridge, only seventy miles from Alexandria, the 2nd Armoured Brigade with the 9th Lancers always there but often reduced to only a handful of tanks, fought on skilfully and with gallant endurance and determination. Egypt was then saved indeed and {{with the arrival of the}} 9th Australian Division from Syria about the 6th of July, the tide of the whole war was turned." [...]|$|R
