Other geometric properties used in design include area for tension and shear, radius of gyration for compression, and moment of inertia and polar moment of inertia for stiffness. Any relationship between these properties is highly dependent on the shape in question. Equations for the section moduli of common shapes are given below. There are two types of section moduli, the elastic <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> (S) and the plastic <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> (Z).

The sample trees were 12 aged poplar trees growing along the roadside in Sapporo. Binarized bitmap images {{of photographs of}} the crosscut surface of the sample tree stems were used to calculate numerical solutions for section moduli. The error for image resolution was simulated to less than 1 % under the condition in which the image was divided into more than 400 pixels.

As a matter of course, the <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> is a random variable. With reference to corrosion effects, the actual Rules adopt the so-called net scantling approach, for the strength checks of platings, ordinary stiffeners and primary supporting members: given corrosion additions should {{be added to the}} net scantlings to obtain relevant gross thicknesses. On the other hand, for the assessment of the hull girder <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> the gross scantling approach is adopted or the sectional properties have to be calculated by deducting half the corrosion additions from the gross thicknesses of the members contributing to the longitudinal strength. In this paper, the significance of this design procedure is examined in light of the statistical properties of <b>section</b> <b>modulus,</b> evaluated according to a purposely developed procedure and the corrosion wastage model, and corresponding statistical data, proposed by Paik et al, 2003, for oil tanker structures.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the longitudinal strength of ships with damages due to grounding or collision accidents. Analytical equations are derived for the residual hull girder strength and verified with direct calculations of sample commercial ships for a broad spectrum of accidents. Hull girder ultimate strengths of these sample vessels under sagging and hogging conditions are also calculated, based on which correlation equations are proposed. To evaluate a grounded ship, using the <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> to the deck would be optimistic, while using the <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> to the bottom would be conservative. On the contrary, to evaluate a collided ship, using the <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> to the deck would be conservative, while using the <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> to the bottom would be optimistic. The derived analytical formulae are then applied to a fleet of 67 commercial ships, including 21 double hull tankers, 18 bulk carriers, 22 single hull tankers and six container carriers. The mean values, standard deviations and coefficients of variation for the coefficients in these new analytical formulae are obtained. The ship length exhibits little influence on these coefficients because they are close to the mean values although ship length spans from 150 to 400 m. The ship type shows some influence on the residual strength. Uniform equations are proposed for commercial ships which do not depend on a ship’s principal dimensions. These formulae provide very handy tools for predicting the residual strength in seconds, without performing step-by-step detailed calculations, an obvious advantage in cases of emergency or salvage operation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

30|$|To {{evaluate}} windthrow resistance {{with respect}} to stem breakage, a nondestructive method for determining the shape of trunk cross sections was developed. In this method, the coordinates of multiple gauge points set on the perimeter of a trunk are calculated by measuring the distances between them.

Measurement tests were conducted using profile gauges with lengths of 300 and 900 mm on model specimens with four shape patterns and four different diameters. The accuracy of the estimation was verified by comparing the <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> calculated for the generated image and for the photograph. The average ratio of <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> (generated/photo) for all specimens was 0.994, which indicates that the proposed method is highly accurate.

40|$|The role of bone tissue's {{geometric}} distribution in hip fracture risk requires full evaluation in large population-based datasets. We tested whether <b>section</b> <b>modulus,</b> a geometric index of bending strength, predicted hip fracture better than BMD. Among 7474 {{women from the}} Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) with hip DXA scans at baseline, there were 635 incident hip fractures recorded over 13 yr. Hip structural analysis software was used to derive variables from the DXA scans at the narrow neck (NN), intertrochanter (IT), and shaft (S) regions. Associations of derived structural variables with hip fracture were assessed using Cox proportional hazard modeling. Hip fracture prediction was assessed using the C-index concordance statistic. Incident hip fracture cases had larger neck-shaft angles, larger subperiosteal and estimated endosteal diameters, greater distances from lateral cortical margin to center of mass (lateral distance), and higher estimated buckling ratios (p < 0. 0001 for each). Areal BMD, cross-sectional area, cross-sectional moment of inertia, <b>section</b> <b>modulus,</b> estimated cortical thickness, and centroid position were all lower in hip fracture cases (p < 0. 044). In hip fracture prediction using NN region parameters, estimated cortical thickness, areal BMD, and estimated buckling ratio were equivalent (C-index = 0. 72; 95 % CI, 0. 70, 0. 74), but <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> performed less well (C-index = 0. 61; 95 % CI, 0. 58, 0. 63; p < 0. 0001 for difference). In multivariable models combining hip structural analysis variables and age, effects of bone dimensions (i. e., lateral distance, subperiosteal diameter, and estimated endosteal width) were interchangeable, whereas age and neck-shaft angle were independent predictors. Several parsimonious multivariable models that were prognostically equivalent for the NN region were obtained combining a measure of width, a measure of mass, age, and neck-shaft angle (BMD is a ratio of mass to width in the NN region; C-index = 0. 77; 95 % CI, 0. 75, 0. 79). Trochanteric fractures were best predicted by analysis of the IT region. Because <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> failed to predict hip fracture risk as well as areal BMD, the thinner cortices and wider bones among those who fractured may imply that simple failure in bending is not the usual event in fracture.

This study tested the hypothesis that <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> (SM, a measure of bending resistance) when measured ex vivo, would discriminate cases of hip fracture from controls better than areal bone mineral density (aBMD). The biopsies were from (n = 22, female) subjects that had suffered an intracapsular hip fracture. The control material (n = 24, female) was from post-mortem subjects. Serial peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) 1 -mm thick cross-sectional images of femoral neck previously embedded in methacrylate were obtained with the Densiscan 1000 pQCT densitometer and matched for lateral location. The image voxels were converted to units of bone mass, which were then used to derive the <b>section</b> <b>modulus.</b> The data were used to derive means from which receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves could be generated. The area under the curves (AUC) showed that discrimination between the fracture cases and controls was better for SM than aBMD [SM: AUC = 0. 83 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 71, 0. 96), aBMD: AUC = 0. 70 (0. 54, 0. 85); P = 0. 034]. To simulate the forces experienced during a sideways fall, the model's neutral axis was rotated by 210 degrees. The results for <b>section</b> <b>modulus</b> were predictable from those at 0 degrees (r(2) = 0. 97). We conclude that biomechanical analysis {{of the distribution of}} bone within the femoral neck may offer a marked improvement in the ability to discriminate patients with an increased risk of intracapsular fracture. Progress towards implementing this form of analysis in clinical densitometry should improve its diagnostic value, but may depend in part on better image resolution and more accurate corrections for the variability between subjects in regional soft tissue composition...|$|R
