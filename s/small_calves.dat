5|$|Prey is {{obtained}} by hunting {{either on the}} ground or in the trees. During the non-breeding season the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing them down to the ground where the other is easily able to capture them. The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and <b>small</b> <b>calves,</b> and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.|$|E

When {{in close proximity to}} humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys. Old or wounded tigers, unable to catch wild prey, can become man-eaters; this pattern has recurred frequently across India. An exception is in the Sundarbans, where healthy tigers prey upon fishermen and villagers in search of forest produce, humans thereby forming a minor part of the tiger's diet. Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for dietary fibre such as fruit of the slow match tree.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female herds, consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor herds, consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large herds often get divided into smaller groups. While <b>small</b> <b>calves</b> stay with their mothers, the older ones form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression {{on the part of the}} males. These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E

40|$|To {{find out}} if timing of endectocidic {{antiparasitic}} treatment is critical for its efficacy in overwintering reindeer, 72 hinds of the Kaamanen Experimental Reindeer Herd were randomly allocated to four groups. Three groups received ivermecrin mixture orally once at a dose of 200 pg/kg, either in September, December, or February, and one group was left untreated. Antiparasitic efficacy was evaluated by counting Hypoderma tarandi and Cephenemyia trompe larvae in April, and by faecal examinanon for trichostrongylid nematode eggs in March and April. Production efficacy consequences were assessed by comparing animal weight development from November to April, and calf birth weights. No difference {{could be seen in}} the antiparasitic efficacy of the treatments; all were 100 % efficient against H. tarandi larvae (warbles) and C. trompe larvae (throat bors), and reduced the trichostrongylid egg output by 62 to 74 %.

50|$|The {{first man}} known to own Bodacious was Bill McCann. He would always laugh when he {{recalled}} how {{he sold the}} most famous bull in bull riding history for pennies on the pound.

40|$|Population ecology is {{concerned}} with measuring changes in population size and composition, and identifying the causes of these fluctuations. Important driving variables include animal body size and growth rate, {{and their relationship to}} reproduction and mortality. Among wild and domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), reproductive performance, calving time, calf birth weight and neonatal mortality are strongly correlated to maternal weight. Heavy females enjoy higher pregnancy rates, calve earlier, and give birth to heavier calves which have a higher neonatal survival rate than light females. Most studies indicate that both weaning weight of a calf and mature body weight correlate to its birth weight. Calf body weight and composition influence the rate of attainment of sexual maturity. Females which breed as calves suffer reduced growth and give birth to <b>smaller</b> <b>calves,</b> which suffer higher neonatal mortality and lower rates of postnatal growth. A yet unresolved question is whether reindeer body weight, and hence reproductive performance and neonatal mortality, are more strongly influenced by winter than by summer grazing conditions. This paper reviews population ecology studies on wild and domestic reindeer and promotes the view that body size in Rangifer is determined primarily by grazing conditions during the summer...|$|R

Methods: Blood was collected from 55 free-ranging and 63 captive healthy manatees. Most analytes were measured using a CELL-DYN 3500 R; auto-mated reticulocytes were measured with an ADVIA 120.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 The {{prevalence}} of non-lethal entanglements of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in fishing gear in northern southeastern Alaska (SEAK) was quantified using a scar-based method. The percentage of whales assessed {{to have been}} entangled ranged from 52 % (minimal estimate) to 71 % (conditional estimate) to 78 % (maximal estimate). The conditional estimate is recommended because it is based solely on unambiguous scars. Eight percent of the whales in Glacier Bay/Icy Strait acquired new entanglement scars between years, although the sample size was <b>small.</b> <b>Calves</b> {{were less likely to}} have entanglement scars than older whales and males may be at higher risk than females. The temporal and spatial distribution of commercial fisheries is complex and difficult to correlate with these results. The percentage of whales with entanglement scarring is comparable to the Gulf of Maine where entanglement is a substantial management concern. Consequently, SEAK humpback whale-fisheries interactions may warrant a similar level of scrutiny...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} important mineral deficiency in Brazil. In the state of Pará, this deficiency occurs in many regions, mainly in Marajó Island, where it causes important economic losses. This paper reports the epidemiology, clinical signs and pathology of phosphorus deficiency in Buffaloes in Pará. This information was obtained by visits to the farms, clinical examination and necropsies of some affected buffaloes. The disease occurs due to the low levels of P in the pastures and an incorrect or absent mineral supplementation. Also, in the Marajo Island, the high NaCl concentration in the water limits consumption of mineral supplements by the buffaloes. The main clinical signs are osteophagia, bone fractures, rising difficulties, rigid gait or stance over the carpal joints, kiphosis, abnormal stance, mainly with one foreleg dislocated cranially, joint swelling, softening of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, poor growth, weight loss, birth of <b>small</b> <b>calves,</b> and low reproductive taxes. Hemoglobinuria after parturition is also observed. Serum phosphorus varied between 2. 52 and 5. 43 mg/dl.

All the traits investigated showed negative phenotypic covariances with strongyle egg count throughout the first year: high worm counts were associated with low values of WBC, red blood cell count, total serum protein and absolute eosinophil count. Furthermore, calf body weight at 1 week old {{was a significant predictor of}} strongyle EPG at 16 – 51 weeks, with <b>smaller</b> <b>calves</b> having a higher strongyle egg count later in life.
