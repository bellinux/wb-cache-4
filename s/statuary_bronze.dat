The bell-metal used is a high-tin alloy of copper and tin only, with approximately a 4:1 ratio of copper to tin (78% copper, 22% tin).

50|$|The {{majority}} of 302 telephone sets were produced in black; however, painted color sets were available by 1939 for subscribers {{willing to pay}} a surcharge for the option. The housing was originally cast from a zinc alloy until production sets were increasingly made from a thermoplastic material, Tenite, in 1941. The thermoplastic housings were available also in five colors: ivory, Pekin red, green, blue, and rose until telephone production was suspended due to the military material requirements for WW-II by orders of the War Production Board. Post-war telephone production resumed with black plastic housings in 1945 and by 1949 color sets were reintroduced. Requests for custom colors were also fulfilled, including the traditional dark gold, <b>statuary</b> <b>bronze,</b> old brass, and oxidized silver hues.|$|E

In 1914 Dr James Battye in his Cyclopedia of Western Australia described the dwelling as follows:From the substantial foundation to the shingle roof {{every part of the}} structure is of jarrah, and after nearly twenty years - the house having been built in 1894 – every plank and beam and joist remain in as sound condition as when first they were cut to the contractor's design. Over twenty rooms are roofed beneath these jarrah shingles, and the interior is fitted up with all that art and comfort can suggest, while surrounding the house is a park of ten acres, tastefully laid out with lawns and flower-beds, and further beautified by the introduction of decorative <b>statuary</b> in <b>bronze,</b> collected by Mr McNeil on various trips to England and the Continent.|$|R

50|$|Many bronze statues {{or parts}} of statues in antiquity were cast using the lost wax process. Theodorus of Samos is {{commonly}} associated with bronze casting.

He also made a few portraits, including of Pope Leo XIII. His work was exhibited throughout Europe, commonly winning awards.

Beads subject to this process have small [...] "dig marks" [...] where a portion of the bead has been scraped or ground away {{to be included in the}} medicine.

2500|$|Even {{a casual}} {{examination}} of this arch, {{with a few}} of the many preserved Roman triumphal arches [...] in mind, reveals the significant design variation between the two structures. [...] The number of arched passageways of the lower level of Roman triumphal arches was variable as was the presence of a secondary passageway along the long axis of the structure; as a dipylon arch with a single passageway, the lower level of the Arch of Hadrian falls within the gamut of the architectural genre. [...] Roman triumphal arches, however, typically have a massive, solid attic (upper level), often filled with a dedicatory inscription and sculptural decoration. [...] In addition, Roman arches typically supported major stone or <b>bronze</b> <b>statuary,</b> often including a quadriga (four-horse chariot) or similar at top center. [...] As Willers notes, the design of the Arch of Hadrian has a very refined upper level that does not allow the mounting of major decoration on top of the attic.|$|R
