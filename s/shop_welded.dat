40|$|This study {{investigates the}} failure {{pressure}} on the API 12 F <b>shop</b> <b>welded</b> steel tanks and performs a fatigue evaluation to estimate the permissible number of pressure cycles for these equipment. Four different analyses were carried out on more than 350 finite element models to determine various failure pressure modes of these storage tanks. An elastic analysis considering potential buckling modes was developed to determine the yielding pressure of the tanks. The redistribution of stresses due to inelastic deformations and plastic collapse were evaluated through an elastic-plastic stress analysis considering the plastic hardening of the material. A wind load analysis was performed to evaluate the stress levels at all regions of the tank and estimate the uplift deformations. Moreover, the increase of the design pressure was investigated regarding the stress levels and bottom uplift. Additionally, an elastic stress analysis following the ASME Boiler 2 ̆ 6 Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII, Division 2, Design-by-Analysis rules was implemented to determine the fatigue life of the storage tanks. This research provides engineering calculations to evaluate the current design of the API 12 F tanks and the design internal pressures guaranteeing a safe performance of the equipment. ...|$|E

50|$|Emerson High School {{was one of}} Buffalo's {{multiple}} vocational schools, {{focusing on}} upholstery, tailoring, cabinetmaking, machine <b>shop,</b> <b>welding,</b> drafting, painting, baking and culinary arts. The school was formed in the early 1911 as Peckham Boys Vocational High School. In 1926, the Sycamore Street building was constructed. The school would later be renamed for former Buffalo Superintendent Henry P. Emerson. In 1975, the school became co-ed. The school closed in 2002, but re-opened on Chippewa Street as Emerson School of Hospitality. The building was renovated and now houses School 97, Harvey Austin School.|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the status of}} the welding industry in Biliran Province. Findings of the study highlighted in detail the characteristics of the <b>welding</b> <b>shops,</b> their owners, problems encountered, future plans, and their service status through the years. Facilities of the <b>welding</b> <b>shops</b> were moderately available (OWM= 3. 3); and supplies and materials were available (OWM= 3. 4). Shop personnel were sufficient (OWM= 3. 5); and location of shops was generally much accessible. Working capital of majority of the <b>welding</b> <b>shops</b> ranged from 15 thousand pesos to 50 thousand; labor wage rates from 40 pesos to 300, {{depending on the type of}} work; license requirements were strictly observed by all but without accreditation or linkage. Majority of the <b>welding</b> <b>shop</b> owners aged between 46 and 55; all of them male and married. Majority of them were vocational graduates; several finished a college degree while a few completed high school only. While a few had a certificate of competency from NMYC or TESDA, the majority were simply welders by experience. None had any additional specialized training. Most critical to all the <b>welding</b> <b>shops</b> was the problem of brown out; lack of materials in hardware stores and distance from the source of materials were a felt problem to majority of the <b>shops.</b> The <b>welding</b> <b>shop</b> owners were more of less unified in their future plans: to become a contractor in a big project in the government; to expand the existing shop; to procure a service vehicle; to accept welding jobs outside the province; and to engage in automotive repair. The service status of the shops rose from a provider of mere welding jobs to a builder of vehicle bodies and residential steel gates and window grills...|$|R

40|$|A {{maintenance}} strategy to repair or modify the dissimilar weld on the branch connection of the steam generator hot leg in CANDU 6 was developed. The repair {{method is to}} add a carbon steel pipe spool as a transition fitting to transfer the dissimilar <b>weld</b> to <b>shop</b> <b>welding,</b> and the modification method {{is to use the}} backup tap fabricated during plant installation, so that the weld quality would be superior comparing with field welding, and the quantity of argon gas getting into the primary heat transport system would be reduced simultaneously. A gasbag is used to isolate the branch connection for welding performance when the primary heat transport system is drained to low level state during the prolonged shutdown. If the gasbag could not work, a nonstandard pipe fitting with O-ring should be used to isolate the branch connection. KEY WORDS: {{maintenance strategy}}, hot leg, gasbag, dissimilar weld 1...|$|R
5000|$|The Fisheries Program at WHS {{started as}} the [...] "fish farm club" [...] {{and became the}} {{aquaculture}} class in the early 1960s. The program was conceived and {{began in the late}} 1950s. It started with rearing salmonids in buckets and releasing them into the on-campus Skipanon River, and grew to eventually being one of the pioneers of netpen rearing in the Pacific Northwest, with the first netpens built in the 1960s. Warrenton was founded under water and after its diking and incorporation as a city, it still was mostly wetland. The fish rearing operation had only a 2"x6" [...] wide wooden catwalk as the only means of reaching the operation, until the early 1970s when the Oregon National Guard cleared and built a road to the pump shed. The first on-campus fish hatchery was built in 1974 by the aquaculture, <b>shop,</b> <b>welding,</b> and PE classes alongside community volunteers directing the engineering.|$|R

40|$|The {{folded plate}} girder, a newly {{proposed}} bridge girder, is investigated through this thesis. The folded plate girder is cold bent {{out of a}} single sheet of steel. The cold bending eliminates the costly and inconsistent <b>shop</b> <b>welds</b> found in traditional girders. The folded plate girder is meant for application in short span bridges. The girder was subjected to an equivalent 75 year lifetime loading to investigate the fatigue performance. The rebar detail used in the closure region between adjacent slabs has been investigated in the past by the NCHRP 12 - 68 project. This thesis will proposes a hooked rebar detail as a cost effective alternative to the previously recommended headed rebar detail. The proposed hooked rebar detail looks to improve upon the headed bar detail by increasing the clear cover, and reducing the cost of fabrication and shipment of the rebar. Six specimens containing closure regions are subjected to {{both positive and negative}} moment loading in order to investigate their behavior and failure modes under ultimate load...|$|R

40|$|Concrete filled square hollow {{sections}} (CFSHS), comprising a square hollow section infilled with concrete {{have been used}} as a column in many structural applications in the USA, Europe, Japan and China. The CFSHS are not commonly used in Australia despite having many structural and constructional advantages. This is because it is perceived to be difficult/expensive to develop moment connections between open beams to the CFSHS. Welded connections are common in other countries but not common in Australia where <b>shop</b> <b>welding</b> and field bolting are the norm. The use of double-T blind bolted connections is proposed here as a structurally viable moment connection that satisfies the requirement for shop welding/field bolting and is easy to install. A detailed 3 D finite element model has been developed of a sub-assemblage that consists of a concrete filled steel tube as the column, universal beams on opposite side of the column which are composite with a concrete slab and that are connected to the column with moment resisting blind-bolted connections. This model has been used to simulate the behaviour of a full scale sub-assemblage test in which gravity loads were applied followed by cyclic loading representing the effect of an earthquake. A satisfactory agreement was obtained between the FE model and experimental results...|$|R
