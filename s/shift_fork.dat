50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate <b>shift</b> <b>fork</b> shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|E
50|$|By late 1977, he {{had caught}} the {{attention}} of Frank Williams, who was looking to rebuild his Formula One racing team. Williams Grand Prix had struggled for success in its first years and Jones was entrusted to give them their first taste of it. As well as Williams, he also signed with Haas-Hall for 1978, and competed in a Lola 333CS in the Can-Am series, winning the title. Jones took nine poles in ten races but missed the Laguna Seca race due to a Formula One scheduling conflict. Stand-in Brian Redman finished twelfth in that race after the kill wire was crimped under a valve cover, resulting in intermittent ignition. Of the nine races in which he competed, Jones won five (Atlanta, Mosport, Road America, Mid-Ohio, and Riverside.) He finished second to Elliot Forbes-Robinson at Charlotte after hitting a chicane and losing a spark plug wire, retired through accident at St Jovite and lost a radiator at Watkins Glen. He finished third at Trois-Rivières after losing a <b>shift</b> <b>fork</b> and being stuck with only second and fifth gears on the tight road circuit. At that race, water-injected brakes were first used in Can-Am, developed by the Haas team and copied with varying degrees of success by others. Jones ran one Can-Am race in 1979 (Mid-Ohio), where he and Keke Rosberg finished 1-2, with Jones winning his last Can-Am start. For Williams, his best result that season was a second-place finish at Watkins Glen. Jones helped put the team on the Formula One map in 1979 using the Williams FW07, after winning four races in the span of five events {{near the end of the}} season. Jones finished third in the championship that year, and it was the springboard to an excellent 1980 campaign. Jones's best years in Formula One had just begun, in the middle of the ground-effect era.|$|E

5000|$|The Tremec TR-6060 {{six-speed}} {{manual transmission}} features six forward speeds and one reverse speed. It {{is derived from}} the Tremec T-56 6-speed manual transmission. As usual, the forward helical cut gears are synchronized however, the reverse gear operates through a fully synchronized constant-mesh system. The TR-6060 contains removable wear pads on the <b>shift</b> <b>forks,</b> and uses aluminum alloys for the main case, extension housing, and clutch housing. It is manufactured by TREMEC (formerly Transmission Technologies Corporation) and is rated for [...] of torque.|$|R
50|$|Hewland Mk.III of 1962 {{became the}} first product for the public, which {{utilised}} the magnesium alloy case of the Beetle transaxle to house 5 pairs of bespoke straight-cut constant mesh spur gears with dog rings operated by custom-made brass <b>shift</b> <b>forks.</b> Gear selector shaft was located in the nose housing, unmodified as in the Beetle set up, facing rear-ward {{at the tail end}} of the box in the front-side-back position on a midship engine racing cars. The elimination of synchromesh parts provided the space for an additional pair of gears for the 5th speed.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} deformation behavior of carburized steel parts after quenching and tempering, the residual stress field that was distributed under hardening layer of a transmission gear was nondestructively measured by neutron diffraction. The material was chromium-molybdenum steel, SCM 420. The carburized case depth was first determined by microscope, and then was measured by micro Vickers hardness tester. The neutron diffractions from Fe- 110 and 211 planes were used for stress measurement. In this study, residual stresses were calculated from lattice spacing changes. Unstressed lattice spacing was experimentally determined using reference coupon specimens that were cut from the same carburized gear. As the results, the interior of transmission gear deformed elastically to accommodate the generation of compressive residual stresses in surface hardening layer. This interior elastic deformation was found to result in the complicated residual stresses under hardening layer. Large tensile residual stress parallel to the axial direction of gear was generated in the <b>shift</b> <b>fork</b> groove. Furthermore, tensile residual stresses parallel to the hoop and axial directions were also generated in two gear wheels...|$|E
40|$|After many abusive, over-torqued powershifts, {{the venerable}} T 5 is left a little worse for wear. Couple this with no {{built-in}} <b>shift</b> <b>fork</b> limits and sheer age, {{and the frequency}} of failure is quite high in any spirited driven vehicle. Or, in some cases, the high-mileage often seen on Mustangs results in worn out friction linings on the blocker rings. (My first (and only, so far!) failure was a delaminated fourth gear blocker. I could upshift, but had to pause a while to downshift, until it went out altogether, at 125, 000 miles!) Update: July 2, 1999 : Blew input shaft at lunch! Thing sounded like a grenade going off; left with fourth gear only! Now I feel like a real man, LOL! The solution: Why, a thorough rebuild, of course! While going through the rebuild, do you and your trans a favor by spending some of the money saved on upgrades: the two most notable are a steel input shaft bearing retainer and a decent aftermarket shifter (or at least do something about the factory rubber isolators, like remove them!). Besides learning how to do a rebuild to get yourself out of trouble, it’s a great bartering skill when your “friends” blow theirs up! The sources: I have purchased parts from D&D Performance, Hanlon Motorsports, and National Drivetrain. I have received outstanding service from all, and always receive my parts in a timely manner. However, I will not do business with NDT again over a petty issue (actually, not petty; based on principals that they claim but did not uphold; they do have good deals on inputs and clusters from time to time, but their kits, uh, suck, IMHO…). Personally, I prefer to deal with Hanlon; Linda, Bob’s wife, always makes me laugh when I speak with her, and they had the courtesy to call me several months after I placed an order to let me know the Tremec rebuild manuals were in, and overnight a part that they let slip through. You cannot go wrong with D&D or Hanlon...|$|E

At present, the {{domestic}} most use the traditional machining methods of production, such as general milling, drill, ground, etc. But the traditional processing method is low material utilization ratio, time-consuming power consumption, and low production efficiency. {{as the same}} time the product quality is difficult to meet the requirement of high strength.

40|$|The use of PM {{materials}} is rapidly expanding concentrating {{more and more}} on highly loaded structural parts such as synchronizer hubs, gears, sprockets or <b>shifting</b> <b>forks.</b> Several papers, presented during the last years on PM-conferences have confirmed the highly stressed volume concept as an excellent method to assess the local durability in sharp notched areas considering the local properties of the material and stress gradients. Based on the method of highly stressed volume (HSV) this paper presents an approach to estimate the local durability by simply determinable static material properties including sinter-hardened condition. For this purpose, results of fatigue strength tests under axial, bending and torsion alternating loading (R = - 1) with up to six different specimen geometries, three different sinter alloys and two different densities will be analysed in order to estimate the endurable fatigue strength in correlation with the highly stressed volume...|$|R
5000|$|First, {{it gives}} more {{traction}} because the downward {{force on the}} front tire is increased by load transfer. Second, as the brakes are applied and the weight <b>shifts</b> forward, the <b>forks</b> are compressed. The compression of the forks changes the motorcycles steering geometry, decreasing stability {{in a way that}} makes the motorcycle more apt to lean and more quickly change direction. Third, decreasing speed decreases the motorcycle's cornering radius. Conversely, accelerating while turning increases the motorcycles cornering radius. [...] Fourth, trailing off the brakes while entering blind or tight corners allows the rider to slow if something unexpected blocks the rider's path. Because the motorcycle is already on the brakes and the front tire is getting additional traction from already slowing, the rider can slow even more with very little risk, depending on surface conditions. However, applying the brakes after the motorcycle is already leaned over can be exceedingly risky depending on surface conditions and lean angle.|$|R
40|$|Does {{mortality}} select size or {{growth potential}} in young sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) ? A simulation based on otolith fish size relationships 1 M. G. Meekan, D. A. J. Ryan, J. J. Dodson, and S. P. Good Abstract: There is conflicting {{evidence on the}} role of size-selective mortality in the demography of populations of young sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). A previous field study suggested that increases in mean fork length and otolith size at emergence observed in a cohort of salmon between fry and smolt stages were due to size-selective mortality, such that fry with small fork lengths underwent higher mortality than larger individuals. However, a subsequent study used a simulation to show that such increases could not have been achieved by size-selective mortality without levels of survivorship of the cohort far lower than those that had been observed in the field. To account for field observations, the simulation study proposed that individuals with high metabolic rates had better survivorship, a process that was termed selection for growth potential. Here, we use a simulation approach to show that size-selective mortality may result in <b>shifts</b> in mean <b>fork</b> length and otolith size at emergence comparable with those observed in the field at total mortalities within the range of estimates of natural values. The contrasting outcomes of earlier simulation work and the present study are probably due to the assumption by the former that otolith and fish size in young salmon were weakly correlated and the use of an inappropriate model of size-selective mortality. We conclude that size-selective mortality can explain the results of previous field studies and that little empirical evidence exists to support the hypothesis of selection for growth potential in cohorts of young salmon.
