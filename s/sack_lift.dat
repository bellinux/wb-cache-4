5|$|The {{grinding}} equipment {{is powered by}} a pair of overshot wheels, which transfer power to the crown wheel via a series of belts. This then drives the grinding stones and <b>sack</b> <b>lift.</b> There is a doorway on the first floor to allow material to be hoisted up the building.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, you-all" [...] he cried. [...] "I'm {{going to}} do two things: first, weigh my sack; and second, bet it that after you-all have lifted clean from the floor all the sacks of flour you-all are able, I'll put on two more <b>sacks</b> and <b>lift</b> the whole caboodle clean." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{continued}} his search. In one {{angle of the}} tree {{was a piece of}} <b>sacking.</b> Barrett <b>lifted</b> it. He caught a glimpse of something bright, but before he could confirm the vague suspicion that flashed upon him, his match burnt down and lay smouldering on the floor. His hand trembled with excitement as he started to light another. It broke off in his hand. At last he succeeded. The light flashed up, and there beside the piece of sacking which had covered them were two cups. He recognized them instantly.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a worker}} {{emptying}} oranges from a special picking sack, ca. 1925. A man in overalls, a lightly-colored {{shirt and a}} wide hat leans over a crate of oranges in the soil as he empties a bag which hangs from his neck. Dark rows of orange groves surround the thin lane of clear soil which he stands in. The groves continue into the distance. Photoprint reads "Orange Picking: In emptying a picking sack used in gathering citrus fruit, a flap at the bottom is unbuttoned and the <b>sack</b> carefully <b>lifted</b> from around the fruit to avoid dumping and bruising"...|$|R
50|$|The {{audience}} next sees Rusk {{at night}} carrying a large <b>sack</b> and <b>lifting</b> {{it into the}} back of a lorry among sacks of unsold potatoes bound for Lincolnshire. Rusk soon finds that his distinctive jeweled tie pin (with the initial R) is missing, and realises that Babs must have torn it off as he was murdering her. He climbs {{into the back of}} the lorry, but it starts off on its journey north. The killer desperately scrabbles through the sack of potatoes to find the dead woman's hand. Rigor mortis has set in, and he has to break her fingers in order to prise the pin from her grasp.|$|R
5|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{traditional}} sports {{not solely}} the preserve of the samurai class, being popular among peasants and sake brewers. Both professions valued the manual labor of young people, and similar practices called kyokumochi also existed, which involved <b>lifting</b> <b>sacks</b> of rice or barrels of sake. The sporting aspect of stone-lifting developed in Edo around the seventeenth century, likely evolving from the sack-lifting contests of the stevedores and labourers. Historically, the lifting of strength-stones was exclusively practiced by men.|$|R
50|$|Zoline hired Emile Allais, a French Olympic skier to help {{configure}} {{runs and}} lifts and consult {{on the design}} and layout of the mountain. He {{enlisted the help of}} Bill “Senior” Mahoney and Ed Bowers to cut trails, clear slopes, and obtain land-use rights, mining claims, and water rights for the ski company. Zoline hired ecologists and environmental planners and encouraged local preservationists to protect the Victorian-era town. The Ski Area started in 1970-71 with snowcat skiing for $10 a day including a <b>sack</b> lunch. Five <b>lifts</b> were constructed, and the Telluride Ski School was founded in conjunction with the mountain’s opening. Zoline’s vision finally became a reality when the Telluride Ski resort officially opened on December 22, 1972.|$|R
60|$|In the morning, {{as soon as}} he got up, he drew on his mittens, {{pulled the}} flaps of his cap down over his ears, and crossed through the cottonwoods to the Yukon. He took his rifle with him. As before, he did not descend the bank. He watched the empty trail for an hour, beating his hands and {{stamping}} his feet to keep up the circulation, then returned to the tent for breakfast. There was little tea left in the canister--half a dozen drawings at most; but so meagre a pinch did he put in the teapot that he bade fair to extend the lifetime of the tea indefinitely. His entire food supply consisted of half-a-sack of flour and a part-full can of baking powder. He made biscuits, and ate them slowly, chewing each mouthful with infinite relish. When he had had three he called a halt. He debated a while, reached for another biscuit, then hesitated. He turned to the part <b>sack</b> of flour, <b>lifted</b> it, and judged its weight.|$|R
60|$|It is {{the great}} city's one hour of purity, of dignity. The very rag- picker, groping with her filthy hands among the ashes, instead of an object of contempt, moves from door to door an accusing Figure, her thin soiled garments, her bent body, her scarred face, hideous with the wounds of poverty, an eloquent {{indictment}} of smug Injustice, sleeping behind its deaf shutters. Yet even into her dim brain has sunk the peace that fills for this brief hour the city. This, too, shall have its end, my sister! Men and women were not born {{to live on the}} husks that fill the pails outside the rich man's door. Courage a little while longer, you and yours. Your rheumy eyes once were bright, your thin locks once soft and wavy, your poor bent back once straight; and maybe, as they tell you in their gilded churches, this bulging <b>sack</b> shall be <b>lifted</b> from your weary shoulders, your misshapen limbs be straight again. You pass not altogether unheeded through these empty streets. Not all the eyes of the universe are sleeping.|$|R
60|$|The spring {{took him}} {{close to the}} horse of the latter, and before the amazed soldier could again strike, Rupert had vaulted on to the horse, behind him. Then using his immense {{strength}}--a strength brought to perfection by his exercise at Loches, and his work in <b>lifting</b> <b>sacks</b> as a miller's man--he seized with both hands the French soldier by the belt, lifted him from the seat, and threw him backwards over his head, the man {{flying through the air}} some yards before he fell on the ground with a heavy crash. Driving his heels into the horse, he rode him straight at the French general, as the latter--who had dashed forward as Rupert unseated the trooper--came at him. Rupert received a severe cut on the left shoulder, but the impetus of the heavier horse and rider rolled the French officer and his horse on to the ground. Rupert shifted his seat into the saddle, leapt the fallen horse, and stooping down seized the officer by his waist belt, lifted him from the ground {{as if he had been}} a child, threw him across the horse in front of him, and galloped forward towards the allied lines, amid a perfect roar of cheering, just as a British cavalry regiment rode out from between the infantry to check a body of French dragoons who were galloping up at full speed from their side.|$|R
