50|$|The grains are {{infused with}} yet hotter water to rinse more sugars from the mash {{in a process}} known as <b>sparging.</b> There are two types of <b>sparging.</b> Fly <b>sparging</b> and batch <b>sparging.</b> Fly <b>sparging</b> {{involves}} rinsing the grain bed by adding small amounts of hot water to the top while draining equal amounts from the bottom. Batch <b>sparging</b> involves adding all or most of your <b>sparge</b> water at one time to the grain bed and slowly draining it from the bottom. The <b>sparging</b> process will also stop any further enzymatic activity if much hotter water is used; conversely the mash may be heated to around 80 C to end such activity prior to placing it in the lauter-tun, and to prevent cooler grain from lowering the <b>sparge</b> water temperature to a lower than desirable figure.|$|R

40|$|Mixing {{performance}} of a gas <b>sparging</b> system in a model anaerobic digester was investigated using XGKT (xanthan gum) solution, a transparent liquid, to simulate the flow behaviour of digested sludge. The effect of specific power input on mixing performance was studied with 0. 15 % and 0. 4 wt% XGKT solutions using upward and downward gas <b>sparging</b> arrangements.

40|$|Existing ITP {{filtrate}} hold tanks {{may provide}} sufficient capacity and residence time to strip dissolved benzene from the incoming filtrate using nitrogen <b>sparging</b> {{in the bottom}} of the old tanks. This is based on equilibrium supported by late Wash test data using aged washed slurry. Theoretical considerations indicate that benzene stripping will be more difficult from the ITP unwashed high salt filtrates due to reduced mass transfer. Therefore experimental <b>sparging</b> data is needed to quantify the theoretical effects. Foaming limits which dictate allowable <b>sparging</b> rate will also have to be established. <b>Sparging</b> in the hold tanks will require installation of sintered metal spargers, and possibly stirrers and foam monitoring/disengagement equipment. The most critical <b>sparging</b> needs are at the start of the precipitation/concentration cycle, when the filtrate flux rate is the highest,and at the end of wash cycle where Henry`s equilibrium constant falls off,requiring more gas to <b>sparge</b> the dissolved benzene. With adequate recycle (for proper distribution) or <b>sparging</b> in the old tanks, the 30 inch column could be used for the complete ITP process. A courser packing would reduce back pressure while enabling benzene stripping. The Late Wash Tests indicate adequate benzene stripping even at reduced gas flow. This will require experimental verification under ITP conditions.

40|$|Abstract Efforts to {{increase}} H 2 yields from fermentative H 2 production include heat treat-ment of the inoculum, dissolved gas removal, and varying the organic loading rate. Although heat treatment kills methanogens and selects for spore-forming bacteria, {{the available evidence}} indicates H 2 yields are not maximized compared to bromoethanesulfonate, iodopropane, or per-chloric acid pre-treatments and spore-forming acetogens are not killed. Operational controls (low pH, short solids retention time) can replace heat treatment. Gas <b>sparging</b> increases H 2 yields compared to un-sparged reactors, but no rela-tionship exists between the <b>sparging</b> rate and H 2 yield. Lower <b>sparging</b> rates may improve the H 2 yield with less energy input and product dilution. The reasons why <b>sparging</b> improves H 2 yields are unknown, but recent measurements of dis-solved H 2 concentrations during <b>sparging</b> suggest the assumption of decreased inhibition of the H 2 –producing enzymes is unlikely. Significant disagreement exists over the effect of organic loading rate (OLR); some studies show relatively higher OLRs improve H 2 yield while others show the opposite.

The 1 -liter microbubble dispersion generator supplied bubbles for 20 -liter and 50 -liter working volume fermentations in a 72 -liter pilot scale fermenter. The microbubbles were stabilized by the surfactants naturally present in the culturing broth medium. The growth patterns of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cultured at agitation speeds of 150 rpm and 500 rpm, were compared for oxygen supplied by ordinary air <b>sparging</b> and by MBD <b>sparging.</b> Both air <b>sparged</b> and MBD systems were supplied air at equivalent volumetric flow rates.
