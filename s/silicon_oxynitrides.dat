The validity of the model is corroborated by the good agreement between the simulated and experimental results. Under typical inversion biases (2 V), hole tunneling current is lower through oxyni-tride and oxynitride/oxide with about 33 at. % N than through pure oxide and nitride gate dielectrics. This is attributed to the compet-itive effects {{of the increase in}} the dielectric constant, and hence di-electric thickness, and decrease in the hole barrier height at the dielectric/Si interface with increasing with N concentration for a given electrical oxide thickness (EOT). For a N/O stack film with the same N concentration in the oxynitride, the hole tunneling cur-rent decreases monotonically with oxynitride thickness under the typical inversion biases. For minimum gate leakage current and maintaining an acceptable dielectric/Si interfacial quality, an N/O stack structure consisting of an oxynitride layer with 33 at. % N and a 3 A oxide layer is proposed.

A detailed quantitative compositional analysis using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy resulted in identification of the germanosilicate dielectrics as the most promising candidates for use in integrated optics. The first reported systematic study of propagation losses for different-index planar waveguides by using prism coupling method was correlated with the compositional analysis. This study had an important outcome for planar waveguides fabricated with germanosilicate core layers resulting in the lowest propagation loss values reported so far for as deposited CVD-grown films at λ= 1. 55 µm, eliminating the need for costly and cumbersome annealing process. An improvement of the prism coupling technique led to a new approach for elasto-optic characterization of thin polymer films. This completely new method allows one to determine the optical anisotropy and out-of-plane mechanical properties and to correlate both in order to obtain the elasto-optical properties of thin polymer films, for the first time. Of interest as potential electro-optic material, we have concentrated on thermally poled germanosilicate films deposited on fused-silica substrates by PECVD. As a result of an optimization study, we demonstrated a record peak nonlinear coefficient of ∼ 1. 6 pm/V, approximately twice as strong as the highest reliable value reported in a thermally poled fused silica glass. Finally, we have demonstrated several applications of this technology in the field of integrated optics. Since optical waveguides constitute the building blocks of many integrated optical devices, we had first concentrated on design and optimization of waveguides employing germanosilicates as the core layers. The final step of our work concentrated on design and implementation of microring resonator devices based on germanosilicate layers. Ay, FeridunPh. D...|$|E
