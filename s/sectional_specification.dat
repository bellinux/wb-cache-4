The increase in the range confidence intervals due to the IV setup can be reduced {{by a factor of}} 3 by using a proxy to risk attitude. In order state the "precision" of the cross sectional VSL estimates I estimate the VSL using Chilean panel data and use them as benchmark for different cross <b>sectional</b> <b>specifications.</b> The use of the proxy eliminates need for using hard-to-find instruments for the job risk level and narrows the confidence intervals for the workers in the Chilean labor market for the year 2009...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the novel {{use of a}} macroecological plant and forest structure model {{in conjunction with a}} Radiative Transfer (RT) model to better understand interactions between microwaves and forest canopies. Trends predicted by the RT model, resulting from interactions with mixed age, mono and multi species forests, are analysed in comparison to those predicted using a simplistic structure based scattering model. This model relates backscatter to scatterer cross <b>sectional</b> or volume <b>specifications,</b> dependent on the size. The Spatially Explicit Reiterative Algorithm (SERA) model is used to provide a widely varied tree size distribution while maintaining allometric consistency to produce a natural-like forest representation. The RT model is parameterised using structural information from SERA and microwave backscatter simulations are used to analyse the impact of changes to the forest stand. Results show that the slope of the saturation curve observed in the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter-biomass relationship is sensitive to thinning and therefore forest basal area. Due to similarities displayed between the results of the RT and simplistic model, it is determined that forest SAR backscatter behaviour at long microwave wavelengths may be described generally using equations related to total stem volume and basal area. The nature of these equations is such that they describe saturating behaviour of forests in the absence of attenuation in comparable fashion to the trends exhibited using the RT model. Both modelled backscatter trends predict a   relationship to forest basal area from an early age when forest volume is increasing. When this is not the case, it is assumed to be a result of attenuation of the dominant stem-ground interaction due to the presence of excessive numbers of stems. This work shows how forest growth models can be successfully incorporated into existing independent scattering models and reveals, through the RT comparison with simplistic backscatter calculations, that saturation need not solely be a direct result of attenuation...|$|R

40|$|Metallized {{polymer film}} {{capacitors}} are important passive electrical components nowadays, which are currently used in any electronic devices and circuits without hesitation. Amongst other components, {{they are used}} in EMC-filters as X- and Y-capacitors, so-called RFI/EMI suppression capacitors. The latest results of studies show that under critical operating conditions, the reliability of those components is called into question. In one case an Inverter supplier was forced to call back a number of inverters, {{because one of the}} capacitors used has degraded. "This process results in outgassing within the wiring component of the inverter itself, possibly causing the compartment's cover to pop off with enough force to cause injury or property damage". This circumstance suggests, that the requested quality tests, according to the standard IEC 60384 - 14 : 2005 "Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment - Part 14 : <b>Sectional</b> <b>specification</b> - Fixed capacitors for electromagnetic interference suppression and connection to the supply mains" are not sufficient. There are no sufficient tests, specific to capacitors exposed to the conditions corresponding, when they are used in solar inverters for the outdoor area. The norm only includes a general climate test for the RFI/EMI suppression capacitors in all range of applications. At Fraunhofer IWES an accelerated aging test has been conducted for 1, 000 hours, at a defined temperature and relative humidity with different voltage stress conditions (d. c., a. c. and without voltage), after a short time a degradation of some metallized polymer film capacitors was observed. The ageing of RFI/EMI suppression capacitors cause, not only the rise of the electrical disturbances above the permitted limits, but could also affect the leakage currents at the event of a fault in a negative way, so that the isolation ability of the capacitors in case of failure is severely limited and thereby a risk for humans could occur...|$|E
