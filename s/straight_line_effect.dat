50|$|Some {{media have}} {{an index of}} {{refraction}} which varies gradually with position and, thus, light rays curve through the medium rather than travel in <b>straight</b> <b>lines.</b> This <b>effect</b> is what is responsible for mirages seen on hot days where the changing index of refraction of the air causes the light rays to bend creating the appearance of specular reflections in the distance (as if {{on the surface of}} a pool of water). Material that has a varying index of refraction is called a gradient-index (GRIN) material and has many useful properties used in modern optical scanning technologies including photocopiers and scanners. The phenomenon is studied in the field of gradient-index optics.|$|R

50|$|The {{interesting}} {{effect of}} the last ball ejecting with a velocity nearly equal to the first ball {{can be seen in}} sliding a coin on a table into a line of identical coins, as long as the striking coin and its twin targets are in a <b>straight</b> <b>line.</b> The <b>effect</b> can similarly be seen in billiard balls. The effect can also be seen when a sharp and strong pressure wave strikes a dense homogeneous material immersed in a less-dense medium. If the identical atoms, molecules, or larger-scale sub-volumes of the dense homogeneous material are at least partially elastically connected to each other by electrostatic forces, they can act like a sequence of colliding identical elastic balls. The surrounding atoms, molecules, or sub-volumes experiencing the pressure wave act to constrain each other similarly to how the string constrains the cradle's balls to a <b>straight</b> <b>line.</b> For example, lithotripsy shock waves can be sent through the skin and tissue without harm in order to burst kidney stones. The side of the stones opposite to the incoming pressure wave bursts, not the side receiving the initial strike.|$|R
25|$|The other effect {{occurred}} when the dish was pointed towards the ground, causing a strong return that produced a sharp return on the display. Due to the circular scanning pattern, the dish would be pointed to the sides when the beam first struck the ground, continuing to strike the ground while the scanner continued rotating until it is pointed down, and then back up until the beam no longer intersects the ground again. Since the beam strikes the ground at a point closer to the aircraft when it is pointed straight down, the returns during this period are closest to the zero ring. When the reflector rotated further to the sides the beam would strike the ground further away and produce blips further from the zero line. Conveniently, the geometry of the situation causes the returns to form a series of <b>straight</b> <b>lines,</b> producing an <b>effect</b> similar to an artificial horizon.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of ball bearings, the bearing has inner and outer races {{and a set of}} balls. Each race is a ring with a groove where the balls rest. The groove is usually shaped so the ball is a {{slightly}} loose fit in the groove. Thus, in principle, the ball contacts each race at a single point. However, a load on an infinitely small point would cause infinitely high contact pressure. In practice, the ball deforms (flattens) slightly where it contacts each race, much as a tire flattens where it touches the road. The race also dents slightly where each ball presses on it. Thus, the contact between ball and race is of finite size and has finite pressure. Note also that the deformed ball and race do not roll entirely smoothly because different parts of the ball are moving at different speeds as it rolls. Thus, there are opposing forces and sliding motions at each ball/race contact. Overall, these cause bearing drag. [...] "V" [...] groove raceways distribute the load evenly over the balls as they travel on four points of contact, creating a <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> rolling <b>effect</b> and decreasing the amount of friction created by a full contact round groove design.|$|R

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of 3 D scenes constituted by <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> can find many applications both in Computer vision and in Mobile robotics.

40|$|Due to the {{discrete}} distribution computing errors {{and lack of}} adaptability are ubiquitous in the current <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> extraction for TLS data methods. A 3 D <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> segment extraction method is proposed based on spherical projection for single station terrestrial laser point clouds.
