France, {{a founding member of}} the ECCSEL ERIC, is offering access to several outstanding research facilities: one CO 2 capture pilot (EDF’s CO 2 Capture Pilot, Le Havre), one CO 2 transport platform (INERIS’s CO 2 Transport Platform, Mont La Ville), one underground laboratory (Andra’s Underground Research Laboratory, Bure), one site for shallow CO 2 injection experiments (INERIS’ Shallow CO 2 Injection Site, Catenoy), one bio-reactor at high temperatures and pressures (BRGM’s BIOREP reactor, Orléans), one mobile equipment for gas measurements on site (IFPEN’s Mobile ESCORT Station), one laboratory for advanced gas analyses (IFPEN’s GasGeochem Laboratory, Rueil-Malmaison).

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of my thesis defines the key terms {{necessary}} for understanding the concept of mobility of companies in the private international law. The fundamental difference between lex societatis and the nationality of company are terms which are not identical, despite their frequent confusion. It is the lex societatis which is defining for the inner organisation of the company. According to the reasoning of the Court of European Union, in the cross border transfer of the <b>statutory</b> <b>seat</b> should inevitably lead to change of lex societatis. However, in order to decide on which legal order is applicable for defining the lex societatis of a company, {{we have to look}} into the international private rules of a particular country. There are two major theories from which stem the legal orders of all member countries, the real seat theory and incorporation theory. This chapter explores their pros and cons, as well as practical consequences of their application on the possibility of cross-border transfer of a seat of a company. The second chapter of my thesis outlines relevant European Union law which lies behind the concept of cross border mobility of companies. The Treaty provisions on freedom of establishment are reviewed {{in the light of the}} Court case law. The most relevant decisions of the Court are [...] ...|$|E
40|$|States have {{traditionally}} dealt with foreign companies on their territory within their private international law. The arrival of European law and enactment {{of freedom of}} establishment though considerably constrained capabilities of member states, whereas companies gained the right of establishment. The aim of this thesis is characterization and specification {{of the relationship between}} the freedom of establishment, member states and companies incorporated under laws of member states. The main focus of this thesis is analysis of ten most important cases by the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning the freedom of establishment of companies, which significantly transformed mentioned relationship. Subsequently the thesis summarizes the conclusions of analyzed cases by subject of evolution of primary and secondary freedom of establishment, standing of pseudoforeign companies, conformity with incorporation theory and real seat theory and lastly ways of <b>statutory</b> and/or real <b>seat</b> transfer. The main contribution of the thesis is the very detailed case law analysis, including the newest case Vale from July 12 th 2012, and also the case law classification by object...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} increased corporate mobility on corporate lawmaking in the European Union (EU). More specifically, we seek an answer to a simple question: Has the increased mobility which arose from {{the implementation of the}} Societas Europaea (SE) and the path-breaking decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) led to an outbreak of regulatory competition and the emergence of a Delaware-like member state in Europe? Two types of corporate mobility are distinguished: (1) the incorporation mobility of start up firms and (2) the reincorporation mobility of established firms. As to incorporation mobility, the Centros triad of cases makes it possible for start-up firms to incorporate in a foreign jurisdiction. Many entrepreneurs have taken advantage of this new freedom of establishment. However, recent data from Germany and The Netherlands indicate declining numbers of such foreign incorporations over time. Moreover, Centros-based incorporation mobility is a rather trivial phenomenon, economically speaking. The actors in question seek only to minimize costs of incorporation. National lawmakers have been responding, amending their statutes to lower these costs. But, because out of pocket cost minimization at the organization stage operates as only a secondary motivation of 'choice-of-business-form' decisions, there arise no competitive pressures that cause national legislatures to engage in thorough-going reform addressed to corporate governance more generally. As to reincorporation mobility, which concerns the migration of the <b>statutory</b> <b>seat</b> of a firm incorporated in one member state to another member state, the SE has opened the door, but not widely enough to serve as a catalyst for company law arbitrage. Reincorporation mobility is still far from generally available in the EU. As a result, competitive pressures do not yet motivate changes in the fundamental governance provisions of national corporate law regimes...|$|E

Zinātniskā darba ietvaros tiek aplūkota sabiedrību pārrobežu apvienošanas institūta vēsturiskā attīstība, analizēts sabiedrību pārrobežu apvienošanas institūts starptautisko privāto tiesību kontekstā, kā arī noskaidrots atsevišķu tiesību subjektu - kreditoru, dalībnieku un darbinieku interešu aizsardzības pasākumu kopums pārrobežu apvienošanas procesā. Tāpat darbā uzmanība tiek veltīta sabiedrību pārrobežu apvienošanas procesa aplūkošanai, atsevišķi analizējot tādus procesa posmus kā reorganizācijas līguma noslēgšana, reorganizācijas prospekta sagatavošana, lēmuma par reorganizāciju pieņemšana un pārrobežu apvienošanas reģistrācija. On April 26 th, 2008 Latvian Parliament {{adopted the}} {{amendments}} of the Commercial Law, allowing {{limited liability company}} registred in Latvia to merge with another limited liability company established in accordance with regulatory enactments of the European Union Member States. These amendments of Commercial Law were based on directive 2005 / 56 /EC on cross-border mergers adopted by the Council of the European Union on October 26 th, 2005. The goal of this thesis is to explore the transpositon of the directive 2005 / 56 /EC into Commercial Law. In {{the beginning of the}} thesis, the author offers to analyze two events which promoted the cross border merger of limited liability companies - the judgment of the European Union Court of Justice of December 13 th, 2005 (case SEVIC System AG) and the directive 2005 / 56 /EC. The first event allows to study cross border reorganization process in a context of freedom of establishment. The harmonization process of national rules in EU member states is the second event to be viewed. Since the cross border merger process contains cross border element, the determination of the nationality of companies participating in the cross border reorganization is a significant question {{in the context of the}} conflict of laws. Nationality of the companies can be determined by the reference to the <b>statutory</b> <b>seat</b> or real seat theories. Because of the fact that the cross border merger subjects are companies registered in the different European Union member states, the author of this thesis clarifies applicable laws to the merger process. Cross border merger influences creditors’, minority shareholders’ and employees’ interests. As the national legislators are required to ensure appropriate protection of those interests, the thesis analyzes whether Latvian legislator has reached the balance between the interests of the subjects and companies’ rights to implement the cross border merger. Cross border merger process consists of four main steps: Firstly, the management of each of the merging companies shall draw up the common draft terms of cross-border merger known as reorganization agreement. Secondly, the management of the merging companies is required to draft the cross border merger report known as reorganization prospectus explaining all legal and economic aspects of the cross-border merger to shareholders. Thirdly, the shareholders have to approve common draft terms at the meeting of shareholders. The final step is the registration of cross-border merger in commercial register and its entry into effect. The thesis analyses all these steps, discovering problems and offering proposals how to improve the process of reorganization...|$|E
