Among those vendors, Chen Changsheng(Stage name: Xiao Deli) was the most famous, who was considered as the representative of Ligao Tang sellers in Suzhou. After him, Du Baolin created something new based on Chen's creation. He added some stories of criticising politics or satirizing officials. To avoid troubles from the government, he called himself [...] "Xiaorehun", asserting that all he said was nonsense and needless for officials to worry about. Du Baolin's [...] "Xiaorehun" [...] rap became popular in Hangzhou. Later, he came to Shanghai seeking new opportunities, and became a famous comedian in Shanghai in 1920s. "Xiaorehun" [...] then became an alternative word of Ligao Tang. In 1958, Wu Jingshou(Stage name: Xiao Mingli), current Vice director of Changzhou Folk Arts Sodality, and Bao Yunfei(Stage name: Xiao Delin), established a Rap and Candy-selling Cooperation of Street Artists in the East Avenue in Changzhou, which helped spread the [...] "Xiaorehun" [...] culture in Suzhou. Wumai in Yangzhou was also interesting. With every two people worked together, several pair of men and women pushed wheelbarrows and walked along the streets. They sold candies in crowded places and sang Xiaodiao (Yangzhou folk songs) to attract customers. Xiaodiao was clear and easy to understand, a bit like a roundelay, which often won laughters from the audience.|$|E

30|$|Interestingly, {{the fact}} that the seller reacts to the {{formation}} of a buyer group with a KAM approach encourages the actual creation of such a group. This article adds to the literature by describing a rationale for the emergence of a buyer group and the relationship with the implementation of a KAM program as <b>selling</b> <b>method.</b> We find that both decisions are closely linked, not only in the rather obvious sense of the seller creating a KAM program in response to the emergence of a buyer group, but also in the opposite sense of the group emerging and surviving because its prospective participants anticipate being treated separately from customers that remain outside the group. In this context, we point out that, without market segmentation, buyers face the standard free-rider problem of collective action (Olson 1965; Hardin 1971). In fact, a body of literature initiated by Bloch (1996) has considered the stability problem in the process of cartel formation and has analyzed how this can prevent the formation of a coalition (see Bloch 2005, for a sound review of this topic). 3 However, we also show that if customers expect the seller to react to the formation of a buyer group with a KAM strategy as the <b>selling</b> <b>method,</b> then the free-rider problem no longer holds. The seller, nonetheless, faces a commitment problem in this context. Ex-post, once a buyer group emerges, the seller’s profits increase when the consumers grouped receive preferential KAM treatment and the market becomes segmented. However, ex-ante, the seller’s profits would be greater if the utilization of a KAM program could be saved, since the buyer group would not arise in such a case.|$|E

The emphasis of the experimental stations apparently has been directed mainly towards the development of new and better varieties of the different crops; little concern, however, has been shown towards the marketing of these commodities. This thesis then will be an attempt to describe and analyze the processing, packaging, and marketing of a certified seed as it now exists in Nebraska. The objectives of this study are: (1) To describe the current practices of processing and packaging of certified seed in Nebraska and in turn recommend improved methods. (2) To describe the present marketing system for certified grain sorghum seed including the channels of distribution and the importance of the various types of dealers. (3) To identify and analyze some of the factors which affect the price of certified seed, including production, buying and <b>selling</b> <b>methods,</b> and inter-regional competition. This study should answer such questions as costs of processing, packaging, type and size of package, and the processing needed to put out a quality seed. In addition to this, it should attempt to determine; (1) the volume of certified seed handled by seedsmen, (2) the proportion of certified seed to total seed handled, (3) the trade channels used for marketing by the growers, (4) the buying and <b>selling</b> <b>methods</b> used by growers, and (5) the method of determining price differentials at the different market levels, such as from grower to wholesaler, wholesaler to retailer, and retailer to consumer.

This study, conducted prior to export deregulation, sought to identify which factors were important to northern New South Wales (NSW) wheat growers when they were {{making decisions about}} wheat selling and price risk, under production and market uncertainty. Key questions were about how they make these decisions and the implications, particularly for larger-sized farmers, merchants, end-users, bankers, advisors and trainers. The research aim was to test the behaviour of users and non-users of five selling methods and six pricing-hedging strategies against eighteen management and seventeen risk attitude-adoption questions. Responses of growers were polarised in behavioural traits such as adoption flexibility, decision-support, the achievement of realistic target prices, {{and whether or not}} growers hedged-forward priced. There was no loyalty evident to the selling or pricing method except perhaps for speculative storage, which is a characteristic activity in deregulated supply chains.

30|$|The {{remainder}} of the paper is laid out as follows. Section  2 describes the industry model used, namely, one consisting of a monopolist selling a homogeneous good to a continuum of buyers of equal size. Section  3 analyzes industry performance when all customers purchase the good {{on an individual basis}} and the seller submits a supply schedule. Section  4 examines the market outcome when some customers decide to form a coalition (a buyer group) and thus act strategically by submitting an aggregate demand function, whereas the seller continues to submit a supply-function rule as the only <b>selling</b> <b>method</b> with all customers, either inside or outside the group. In this context, we show that the customers not grouped profit more from the existence of the buyer group than the customers within the group, with the result that the group is destabilized. Section  5 analyzes the market outcome when the seller can offer different deals to customers in the group and outside the group; in this case, the seller’s profit increases with market segmentation, independent customers find they are worse off than grouped customers and the coalition then becomes stable. Section  6 concludes the paper.|$|E

40|$|Value-based {{selling and}} its key {{methods have been}} {{characterized}} as an effective way of selling in the existing literature. This {{is assumed to be}} {{due to the fact that}} an explicit indication of value makes customer's purchase decision easier because the investment can be reasoned with rational arguments. Typical value-based selling tools are value calculators and reference cases. However, regardless of the strong theoretical support for the effectiveness of value-based selling, no research thus far has empirically and with actual sales data examined what kind of effects valuebased selling activities have on sales success. These effects are studied by using sales data of a B 2 B company operating in marketing services business. Value-based selling activities studied are the use of value calculators and reference cases, and the data was collected from an electronic sales meeting platform as well as from a CRM system. Hypotheses are tested with quantitative analyses on a sales meeting level. Findings show little support for value-based selling's hyped effectiveness as a sales method. Main findings show that using a value calculator decreases the duration of sales process. However, the results also show that using a value calculator does not affect the probability of a sales deal - the customer's purchase decision was thus independent from seeing a value calculation of the offer. Findings also suggest that the higher the value of a sales offer, the less likely it is that a value calculator is used suggesting that the use of a value calculator does not depend on the customer's preferences or purchase style but on the sold offer. The study suggests that value-based <b>selling</b> <b>methods</b> are not suitable in all kinds of business environment and for all kinds of products or services, or at least companies should not count on their effectiveness. If value-based <b>selling</b> <b>methods</b> are ineffective, more simplified sales pitches or more emotionally-laden sales arguments could be justified to achieve better sales outcome...|$|R
