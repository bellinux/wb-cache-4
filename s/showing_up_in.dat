5|$|The comics {{magazines}} <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Canada at {{the time}} suffered from promotion and distribution problems, however, getting most of their support from the fan press. Phil Seuling's California-based comics distributor Bud Plant was supportive of these underground and alternative comics, though, and helped get them into stores. Eventually, distributors like Bud Plant {{and the emergence of}} specialty comic shops would form a distribution network for small press comics that would thrive independently of the traditional newsstands.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev rarely {{appeared}} in public during 1982. The Soviet government claimed that Brezhnev was not seriously ill, but {{admitted that he}} was surrounded by doctors. He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, but refused to relinquish office. On 7 November 1982, despite his failing health, Brezhnev was present standing on Lenin's Mausoleum during the annual military parade and demonstration of workers commemorating the anniversary of the October Revolution. The event would also mark Brezhnev's final public appearance before dying three days later after suffering a heart attack. He was honoured with a state funeral, which was followed with a five-day period of nationwide mourning. He was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Red Square. National and international statesmen from around the globe attended his funeral. His wife and family attended; his daughter Galina Brezhneva outraged spectators by not <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> sombre garb. Brezhnev on the other hand was dressed for burial in his Marshal's uniform, along with all his medals.|$|E

25|$|Dreams occur mainly {{during the}} rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep and are composed of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations. Although more {{research needs to be}} done on this subject, dreams are said to be linked to the unconscious mind. Thought suppression has an influence on {{the subject matter of the}} unconscious mind and by trying to restrain particular thoughts, there is a high chance of them <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> one's dreams.|$|E
25|$|The {{theme song}} for Saved by the Bell {{was written by}} {{composer}} Scott Gayle against the implicit instructions of Engel. Though Engel {{had not been able}} to keep the show from being named Saved by the Bell, he was determined to prevent the phrase from <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the theme. He gave explicit orders to his team of composers that he would not accept any theme that referenced the title, and the group agreed to leave out the phrase.|$|E
25|$|When the Lindbergh {{kidnapping}} captures national attention, President Herbert Hoover {{asks the}} Bureau to investigate. Hoover employs several novel techniques, including the monitoring of registration numbers on ransom bills and expert {{analysis of the}} kidnapper's handwriting. When the monitored bills begin <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> New York City, the investigators find a filling station attendant who wrote down the license plate number {{of the man who}} gave him the bill. This leads to the arrest, and eventual conviction, of Bruno Richard Hauptmann for the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh child.|$|E

25|$|The bumpnose {{trevally}} {{is usually}} founds {{in small groups}} of two or more, swimming along beaches where they take prey which consists of shrimp, small crabs, and fish. Studies on the North West Shelf of Australia have found the species often aggregates with other carangids, particularly Carangoides humerosus, Ulua aurochs, and Selaroides leptolepis, and together these make up {{a large proportion of}} the resident fish fauna. Reproduction in the species is very poorly known, with young fish often <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> South Africa during summer.|$|E
25|$|His {{appearance}} at the big Antimafia trials {{and the end of}} the 1960s made many of the island’s establishment very nervous. When <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> court, Genco Russo presented petitions from prominent politicians, priests, bankers, doctors, lawyers and businessman who declared to testify on his behalf. His lawyer threatened to publish telegrams from 37 Christian Democratic deputies – one a cabinet minister – thanking Genco Russo for helping them to get elected. Minister and prominent DC politician Bernardo Mattarella denied that he had been sent one. Genco Russo was sentenced to five years confinement by the Court of Caltanissetta, and sent to Lovere, near Bergamo.|$|E
25|$|During {{high school}} Rosalie participated in theater as had her parents while in college. She acted and sang in many productions, garnering praise for her {{performances}} in the local media. It was during this period that Rosalie became pregnant and had an illegal abortion. This experience {{had a profound effect}} on her, <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> later poetry and song. She earned a scholarship to the University of Idaho, but as a result of a rape, she became pregnant and went to a home for unwed mothers in California to await the birth of her child, a daughter. Again, the experience of making the difficult choice of adoption shows in her later writings and music.|$|E

25|$|By {{overland}} travel, American {{missionaries and}} early settlers (initially mostly ex-trappers) started <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Oregon around 1824. Although officially the HBC discouraged settlement because it interfered with their lucrative fur trade, their Chief Factor at Fort Vancouver, John McLoughlin, gave substantial help, including employment, {{until they could}} get established. In the early 1840s thousands of American settlers arrived and soon greatly outnumbered the British settlers in Oregon. McLoughlin, despite working for the HBC, gave help {{in the form of}} loans, medical care, shelter, clothing, food, supplies and seed to U.S. emigrants. These new emigrants often arrived in Oregon tired, worn out, nearly penniless, with insufficient food or supplies, just as winter was coming on. McLoughlin would later be hailed as the Father of Oregon.|$|E
25|$|In {{various forms}} {{the game has}} been played since the early 20th Century in Canada as a {{recreational}} sport, especially in high school gymnasiums, as a playful variant of hockey, where the sticks got their form from the hockey game bandy. Most Canadian males born in the 1950s and before could attest to this. Similarly, during the 1950s and 1960s many public school systems within Michigan incorporated floorball into their primary and secondary school gym classes. Later, Americans claimed to have invented it, and held interstate tournaments in the 1960s. The game was formally organized as an international and more organised sport in the late 1970s in Gothenburg, Sweden. The sport began as something that was played for fun as a pastime in schools. After a decade or so, floorball began <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Nordic countries where the former schoolyard pastime was becoming a developed sport. Formal rules soon were developed, and clubs began to form. After some time, several countries developed national associations, and the IFF was founded in 1986.|$|E
500|$|Mark Valley {{returns as}} John Scott. The actor stated {{that despite the}} character's death in the pilot; [...] "I'm going to be <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the first season. And, {{for a guy who}} died in the pilot, I {{consider}} myself pretty fortunate." [...] Actors who guest star in the episode include Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Joseph Meegar, Max Baker as Jacob Fischer, and Marylouise Burke as Flora Meegar. The first season DVD contains a deleted scene of Olivia and Peter picking up the homing pigeons from a friend of his named Tony. Tony quietly mentions to Peter that his sister could use Peter's help, but when asked, Peter refuses to tell Olivia more of the story.|$|E

500|$|To {{achieve a}} greater variety of stories {{in the first half of}} series 6 [...] "Night Terrors" [...] was moved to the second block of episodes, having been filmed as episode four and <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> promos for the first half of the season. This necessitated minor changes to the episode, {{including}} the removal of a recurring sequence featuring the appearance of Madame Kovarian. The original last scene was dropped, and a new one was written so it would make sense at that point in the series. This scene consisted of nursery rhyme; lead writer Steven Moffat wanted to foreshadow the Doctor's death and asked Gatiss to write a nursery rhyme, which he described as [...] "rather wonderful". Variations of the rhyme are heard in [...] "Closing Time" [...] and the series finale [...] "The Wedding of River Song".|$|E
500|$|Butcher {{was able}} to save some of his teacher's salary, and to borrow enough more to open the first {{photography}} studio in Custer County. [...] The studio was housed in a lath-and-adobe building, measuring , with a dirt floor and with cotton sheeting in lieu of glass to cover the windows and the skylights. [...] As a backdrop for the photos, he used an old cloth wagon cover. [...] The cloth had been gnawed by rats and was full of holes, which Lillie patched. [...] To keep the patches from <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> photographs, Butcher attached two coil springs from an old bed to the ceiling, then hung the backdrop from them. [...] Before taking a picture, he plucked the backdrop so that it oscillated on the springs; the motion, combined with the long exposure time required, blurred the backdrop so that the patches would not be visible in the photograph.|$|E
500|$|Darla spends {{four centuries}} torturing {{innocent}} people, {{often accompanied by}} Angel (until his soul is restored), before <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Sunnydale. Her first appearance is in [...] "Welcome to the Hellmouth", the first episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which aired in 1997. She breaks into Sunnydale High School with a student who goes there. Darla first toys with the youth, then her face morphs into that of a vampire and she bites the boy. Darla later appears in the episode [...] "The Harvest", where she participates in the ascension of the Master, a very old and powerful vampire. Darla's role in the series is more prominent in the episode [...] "Angel", where it is revealed that she is Angel's sire and former lover. Darla bites an unsuspecting Joyce Summers (Buffy's mother), making it look as if Angel did it. Angel eventually kills her. She later appears in numerous flashbacks, illuminating her involvement not only with Angel, but also with Spike.|$|E
