40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} some {{interest}} shown by exporters in acquiring younger lambs than those remaining from the normal springlambing flocks involved in mid-season or <b>store</b> <b>lamb</b> production systems, to supply niche markets in the November to February period. Lambing ewes later in the year, i. e. April to June, offers an opportunity to supply such niche markets with younger lamb. Two farmlet systems were each operated over two years with 59 to 69 ewes on 4. 5 ha of pasture in an all-grass production system. The objectives were: to assess the overall performance of flocks in late-lambing systems, to monitor lamb growth rates and drafting pattern, to monitor carcass quality in terms of weight, conformation and fatscore, and to identify any difficulties that may be associated with late lambing systems.

40|$|The {{raising of}} fat lambs is not {{restricted}} to any particular system of farming, but limitations are imposed by many physical factors, the major ones being soil, climate, topography, and transport facilities. The aim {{of this investigation was}} directed towards obtaining information on; (a) the cost of producing rape, (b) the productive value or gross returns from rape as a fat lamb producer, and (c) the profit or loss on the rape crop when grazed by fattening lambs. The investigations reviewed the importance of rape as a fattening crop and the circumstances under which it is grown. It appears that rape will continue to be grown in the drier areas of the Dominion. It need not be considered essential in the maintenance of soil fertility, but it fits in well with the organisation of labour on cropping farms. The cost of growing the rape crop and the gross returns are influenced by numerous factors, many of which are outside the farmer’s control. The profit from the crop in those cases where <b>store</b> <b>lambs</b> are bought and fattened is governed mainly by the rape yield and the price of <b>store</b> <b>lambs.</b> Under average conditions for farmers to make a profit by buying <b>store</b> <b>lambs</b> and fattening them on rape, there is a tendency for the prices of <b>store</b> <b>lambs</b> to be too high. Finally, investigation has shown that the field to be covered is very complex, conditions varying with the efficiency of the farmer, with soil, weather, crop yield and breed of lamb {{as well as with the}} margin between <b>store</b> and fat <b>lamb</b> prices. Another factor, more difficult to measure, is the benefit obtained from rape in the general crop rotation and farm management...|$|R

Effects of ensiled forage legumes on {{performance}} of <b>store</b> finishing <b>lambs.</b> Animal Feed Science and Technology, 120, 203 - 216. Sponsorship: MLCMale Beulah speckled face lambs (initial live weight (LW) 28. 8 ? 0. 31 kg) were allocated to three dietary treatments {{to evaluate the}} performance of <b>store</b> <b>lambs</b> of a hill breed when offered ensiled lucerne (Medicago sativa), red clover (Trifolium pratense) or ryegrass. Second-cut silage bales (wilted and inoculated) were prepared from 3 -year old lucerne and red clover stands and a 1 -year old ryegrass sward. All the lambs were group-housed and offered ad libitum ryegrass silage during a 3 -week co-variate period. This {{was followed by a}} week of dietary changeover period, after which the lambs were housed individually and offered their treatment diet ad libitum. All the lambs received a flat rate supplement of pelleted molassed sugarbeet (250 g fresh weight/day). Individual intakes were determined daily, and weekly measurements of LW and body condition score (CS) were made. Additional measurements were taken by scanning the lambs for depth of Longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle and subcutaneous fat. Over an experimental period of 7 weeks, the lambs offered red clover silage had a higher voluntary silage dry matter (DM) intake, total DM intake and metabolisable energy (ME) intake (P < 0. 001) than lambs offered either lucerne or ryegrass silage. This resulted in a faster (P < 0. 001) growth rate and increase (P < 0. 001) in CS, with no difference between lucerne and ryegrass silages. The feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was 8. 0 ? 0. 61 kg feed/kg gain for lambs fed red clover silage, compared with 16. 6 ? 2. 82 and 10. 6 ? 1. 94 kg feed/kg gain for lucerne and ryegrass silage, respectively. The CP intake was higher (P < 0. 001) for lambs fed the lucerne and red clover silages than for the ryegrass silage treatment. The concentration of plasma total protein (TP) was higher (P < 0. 05) for lambs offered ryegrass silage versus lucerne and red clover silage. Urea concentrations were highest for lambs fed lucerne silage and lowest for those fed ryegrass silage (P < 0. 05). The glucose concentration was higher (P < 0. 05) for lambs offered red clover silage, whereas non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration was higher (P < 0. 05) for lambs offered lucerne silage.

40|$|The {{foothill}} {{areas of}} Canterbury {{consist of a}} large portion of the province, extending from the Conway River in the north to the Waitaki River in the south, a distance of some 230 miles. This same area varies in width from a few miles behind Methven, and Mayfield to some 80 miles in a part of North Canterbury, with much variation between these limits. Except in parts of North Canterbury, the climate generally is more severe and the rainfall higher than on the Plains. There is, of course, much variation. The soil, in general, is second class, but much variation exists, so that good rich pockets and small flats are not uncommon. Large areas of tussock and also of third-class land-poor, clay, scrub country-are prominent in certain districts. A rough estimate of the area of ‘the foothill, farms in Canterbury is 2, 000, 000 acres. A typical farm or small sheep-run in this area consists of some medium flat land, a fair proportion of rolling downs with steep gullies, and possibly, an unploughable tussock or scrub area. The total ploughable area varies considerably between properties, but on an average might be one-half to three-quarters of the area of the farm, the total area of which might be 1, 200 acres. The average carrying capacity would be one to one and a half sheep per acre, and a few cattle would be carried. The sheep, in the main; are half-breds, but in many of the wetter and colder districts and on the sour, clay soils Romney sheep are preferred. Corriedales constitute a fair proportion of the sheep of North Canterbury. Ewe hoggets are kept each year for flock maintenance. Surplus four and five year old breeding ewes, fat and <b>store</b> <b>lambs,</b> some fat ewes, store wethers, cull ewe lambs, and cull two-tooth ewes, together with wool and some cattle, constitute the main source of farm income. In recent times a few specially favoured properties with some suitable land have grown small areas of wheat and rye-grass seed. The production of these crops, however, is a precarious undertaking on account of the risks of winter flooding and strong winds and wet weather at harvest...|$|R

40|$|Mount Derrimut Field Station, {{approximately}} 320 ha, {{is situated}} 22. 4 kilometers {{to the west}} of the Melbourne General Post' Office. It is operated by the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry of the University of Melbourne, primarily for undergraduate teaching in Agricultural Science but also as a Centre for research. The climate is of a Mediterranean type with an average annual rainfall of 450 min., mainly of winter incidence. Typically the growing season begins about mid August and finishes in late November to early December. Soils are of volcanic origin and are mildly leached, ranging from shallow stoney red loams on the slopes to. moderately deep grey clays on the flats. The pastures are generally of improved types although there are some native species particularly in those paddocks with large areas of rocky outcrops. The 290 ha, of land available for cropping and grazing carry a herd of thirty crossbred beef cows plus about fifty followers of various ages and a flock of 500 Corriedale breeding ewes. Each year about 60 ha, are sown to wheat, barley and oats. Selection in the sheep flock has primarily been directed towards the genetic improvement of wool quality and lambing percentages: less attention has been paid to the improvement of the lamb growth rates. Over the past ten years considerable difficulty has been experienced in growing the lambs to prime condition, suitable for slaughter, by the time the pastures have matured towards the end of the spring growing season. The ewes were mated during early March so that they would lamb in August when the spring flush was occurring. The lambs then had about three months in which to grow to slaughter weight before the pastures matured. In recent years, mating has been changed to mid January, so that lambing would occur during June and. July. It was anticipated that this early mating, although possibly having an adverse effect on lambing percentages, would' allow the lambs a further four weeks of growth before pasture maturity. The strategy of early mating has in part improved the numbers of lambs in prime condition at the end of the season but there is still a variable number of lambs that are not in prime condition at the normal sale time. These lambs must either be carried over into the dry summer and sold in the following autumn, or sold at the normal time as <b>store</b> <b>lambs</b> at a considerably lower price. In 1973 investigations were started in an attempt to develop management strategies that would reduce or eliminate the number of Underweight lambs by the time of pasture maturity. Preliminary studies in which all lambs in the Mt. Derrimut flock were weighed at birth and at subsequent six week intervals, suggested that lambs that were lightweight at pasture maturity were also lightweight at six weeks of age. The correlation coefficient between six. week weight and the subsequent length of time required to reach slaughter weight was found to be - 0. 60. Although the lightweight lambs had lower birth weights than the lambs achieving slaughter weight at the normal. time, most of the advantage in weight of normal lambs was made during the first six weeks of life. Wardrop (1968) also found that in a prime lamb producing flock under southern Australian conditions, the correlation coefficient between liveweight at eight and seventeen weeks of age was 0. 91. It was concluded that: (a) lambs that were lightweight at the normal sale time could be identified with reasonable confidence at about six weeks of age, and that (b) preferential treatment in the form of a concentrate diet offered sometime between six weeks of age and normal slaughter time, may reduce or eliminate the number of lambs carried-over beyond the end of the growing season.

40|$|Burn {{injury is}} {{associated}} with disabling scar formation which impacts on {{many aspects of the}} patient 2 ̆ 7 s life. Previously we have shown that the fetus heals a deep dermal burn in a scarless fashion. Amniotic membrane (AM) is the outermost fetal tisue and has beeen used as a dressing in thermal injuries, though there is little data to support this use. To assess the efficacy of AM in scar minimisation after deep dermal burn wound, we conducted a randomised controlled study in the 1 -month lamb. Lambs were delivered by caesarian section and the amniotic membranes <b>stored</b> after which <b>lambs</b> were returned to their mothers post-operatively. At 1 month, a standardised deep dermal burn was created under general anaesthesia. on both flanks of the lamb. One flank was covered with unmatched AM, the other with paraffin gauze. Animals were sequentially euthanased from Day 3 - 60 after injury and tissue analysed for histopathology and immunohistochemically for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) content. AM resulted in reduced scar tissue as assessed histopathologically and reduced aSMA content. This study provides the first laboratory evidence that AM may reduce scar formation after burn injury.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of parenteral administration of L-arginine (Arg) to well-fed twin-bearing ewes from day (d) 100 of pregnancy to birth on fetal growth, body composition and neonatal behavior. Ewes received an i.v. bolus of either 345 μmol Arg-HCl/kg bodyweight or saline solution (control) 3 times a day. At d 140 of pregnancy, Arg-supplemented and control ewes were euthanized and fetal weight and fetal organ weight recorded, and maternal and fetal plasma concentrations of amino acids, hormones and metabolites analyzed. A subset of ewes was allowed to lamb and birth weight, body dimensions and behavior of the lambs in the first 2 hours(h) following birth recorded and blood samples collected. At d 140 of pregnancy, fetal weight internal organ weights were unaffected by treatment with the exception of brown fat stores which were increased by 16 % in fetuses from Arg-supplemented ewes relative to controls (P < 0.05). At birth, there was an interaction (P = 0.06) between treatment and sex for birth weight of the lamb. The ewe lambs from Arg-supplemented ewes were 12 % (P < 0.05) heavier at birth compared with controls whereas birth weight of male lambs did not differ. These results indicate that maternal Arg supplementation enhanced brown fat stores in the fetus and countered some effect of fetal growth restriction due to litter size in female lambs. Increasing birth weight of female lambs and enhancing brown fat <b>stores</b> of all <b>lambs</b> may have important implications for lamb survival and postnatal growth.|$|R
40|$|Lamb’s lettuce (Valerianella locusta L.) {{delivered}} at the vegetable auctions is not always fresh. The product could be stored for a certain period depending on the season. The stored samples cannot be distinguished visually from fresh material but their shelf life potential is reduced {{compared to that of}} the latter. Batches with limited shelf life potential lead to losses in distribution and lower consumption quality. The aim of this work was to develop a methodology that can determine the time that lamb’s lettuce has been in storage. Lamb’s lettuce samples, grown at an experimental garden were stored at 4 °C with a relative humidity greater than 90 %. Visible/near infrared (VIS/NIR) spectra of the samples were measured at harvesting day and after 7, 14 and 20 days in storage. Samples of lamb’s lettuce were taken during storage for the analysis of different components to find an explanation for the change in spectral data. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, ascorbic acid and chlorophyll content were followed during storage. Other samples were set aside for respiration measurements. VIS/NIR reflectance spectra were linked to the time in storage using partial least squares regression (PLS). The resulting PLS-model was able to determine the <b>stored</b> period of <b>lamb’s</b> lettuce (RMSEC = 1. 88 days; R² = 0. 94). To validate the model a random cross validation of 4 segments containing 48 samples was performed (RMSEV = 2. 09 days; R² = 0. 92). Other results showed that the content of glucose, sucrose and fructose gradually decreased during storage.

40|$|Master of Science in Family and Consumer Sciences The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze the textile and apparel industries' eco-fashion practices in the women's wear category. The objectives of this study were (a) to identify the available eco-f 1 iendly fibers, (b) to evaluate eco-fashion practice in the women's apparel industry in terms of functional, expressive, and aesthetic aspects in better and budget markets, and (c) to assess consumers' understanding of eco-fashion apparel and their attitudes toward eco-fashion apparel products. To identify available organic and eco-friendly fiber fabrics, the researcher attended the Los Angeles Textile Show in October 2009. To evaluate the eco-fashion practice in women's wear two <b>stores</b> were selected. <b>Lamb</b> and Kallal's (1992) conceptual framework was modified to examine functional, expressive, and aesthetic aspects (FEA Consumer Need Model) of eco-fashion apparel. To assess consumers' understanding of eco-fashion apparel and their attitudes toward eco-fashion apparel products, a survey was conducted in a college in Los Angeles, California. The review of the Textile Show revealed that most of the available eco-friendly fabrics were of 100 % organic cotton or an organic fiber blend and were in solid and off white colors. Based on the modified FEA Consumer Need Model, the functional and aesthetic characteristics of eco-fashion apparel were almost similar to the non eco-fashion of better and budget markets. In terms of expressive aspects, the choice of fabrics of the eco-fashion line were different from those used for the non eco-fashion apparel, which can be more desirable to eco-conscious consumers in the better and budget markets. The fabric care recommended for the eco-fashion apparel was almost the same as that for the non eco-fashion apparel items. The evaluation of eco-fashion practice revealed that the fiber content caused a garment to be considered eco-friendly, not other factors. The eco-fashion woman's apparel of the budget market lacks variety in styles and fabric types. Customers of the better market need to read garment labels carefully before making purchasing decisions. If the shell of a garment is 100 % organic cotton, the lining could be in standard polyester or acetate, neither of which is eco friendly. The majority of survey participants purchased apparel in natural fibers. Less than half have purchased apparel products made of eco-friendly fibers. Most participants did not know what stores carry eco-fashion apparel products and were not willing to pay more for eco-fashion items than for non eco-fashion items. The majority admitted that they were not adequately aware of the environmental issues caused by the textile and apparel industries. The findings of this study could be helpful to apparel designers desiring to use eco-friendly fibers and fabrics. They could also assist consumers with their purchasing decisions by providing an evaluation of eco-fashion in women's apparel of better and budget markets...|$|R
