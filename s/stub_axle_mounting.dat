5000|$|The flat-sided {{fuselage}} did {{present a}} large keel {{area to be}} compensated by the fins. On the other hand, it produced a large uncluttered space that could be readily accessed via rear doors that included an integral ramp [...] to the fuselage floor. It had a volume of 780 cu ft (22.1 m3) [...] and the aircraft could carry loads of up to 5000 lbs (2,268 kg). [...] Configured as a passenger aircraft, this space could seat twenty in five rows of four, {{though there is no}} record that seats were installed. It had a tricycleundercarriage with <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> <b>mounted</b> under the fuselage floor carrying short legs that bore a pair of small fixed main wheels, keeping the aircraft close to the ground for loading; the fuselage floor was only 2 ft (610 mm) above the ground. [...] The nosewheel was steerable via the rudder bar as in the Aerovan.|$|R
2500|$|During development, the Mark C had {{utilised}} {{the same}} sliding pillar suspension {{on the rear}} as the Mark B, but by September 1952, this had been changed for Flexitor suspension units produced by George Spencer Moulton & Co. Ltd. The Flexitor units were a type of lever arm shock absorber which used bonded rubber in torsion as the shock absorber. On these units a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> is <b>mounted</b> upon a trailing-arm with the pivot point being a steel rod. This rod is bonded inside a rubber tube which runs through and is also bonded to an external steel housing. The housing is bolted to {{the underside of the}} car. The units provide about [...] of vertical movement to each independent rear axle.|$|R
50|$|A <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{is one of}} the {{two front}} axles that carries a wheel in a rear wheel drive vehicle. The axle is capable of limited angular {{movement}} about the kingpin for steering the vehicle. The <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> consists of wheel bearings which support the wheel hub.|$|R

50|$|In 1909 H.F.S. Morgan {{introduced}} a fundamentally similar system using a sliding <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{on a fixed}} pillar, used first on Morgan Motor Company cyclecars, then on their cars up to the current time. The Morgan design is an inverted sliding pillar, as are most of the later designs; the pillar {{is attached to the}} chassis and the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> is carried by the sliding sleeve over this.|$|R
50|$|Some {{trailers}} {{support a}} normal axle on two sides, others mount the wheel off one {{side with a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> (a one sided axle).|$|R
50|$|Recumbent tadpole {{or reverse}} trike is a {{recumbent}} design with two steered wheels {{at the front}} and one driven wheel at the back, though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels' <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> assemblies (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> assembly (direct). A single tie rod connects {{the left and right}} axle assemblies.|$|R

50|$|The Week-End had conventional, fixed {{landing gear}} with each mainwheel <b>mounted</b> on a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{provided}} with a torsional shock absorber. Each axle was at the convergence of three struts from the lower fuselage. There was a small tailskid.|$|R
50|$|Hamster {{wheels are}} {{exercise}} devices. Most {{of these devices}} consist of a runged or ridged wheel held on a stand by a single or pair of <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Hamster wheels allow rodents to run even when their space is confined.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{is named}} so because it resembles {{the shape of}} a stub, like a {{truncated}} end of an axle, short in shape and blunt.There are four following method those are1. Elliot strub axle2. Reversed elliot3. Lemoine4. Lemoine inverted ...|$|R
5000|$|Wheel {{moves forward}} as it rises, {{can also be}} poor for impact {{harshness}} (this can be negated by designing the beam with the mounts higher than the <b>stub</b> <b>axles,</b> which impacts on the floorpan height, and causes more roll oversteer) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{top link}} is a fixed-length {{half-shaft}} universally jointed at each end. The universal joints act as {{inner and outer}} pivots for the top link, which rotates to transmit drive from its inner pivot at {{the output of the}} differential/brake unit to its outer pivot at the wheel carrier. The wheel carrier {{takes the form of a}} splined <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> (for knock-off wheels) or a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> and hub plate (for 5-lug wheels). In later XJS models with outboard rear brakes, the wheel carrier, brake discs and parking brake drum were a single cast steel unit. In all cases the wheel carrier runs in bearings mounted in a large cast aluminium hub carrier.|$|R
50|$|Dubonnet {{suspension}} was {{a system}} of trailing arm independent front suspension and steering popular mainly in the 1930s and 1940s. Not very durable unless exactingly maintained, it was soon replaced by other versions. It consisted of a rigidly <b>mounted</b> <b>axle</b> beam in which the sprung steering and suspension arms pivoted around kingpins mounted {{on the ends of}} the axle. The wheels themselves were <b>mounted</b> onto <b>stub</b> <b>axles,</b> suspended from the kingpins. The system featured an encased coil spring and shock absorber, which sealed in the oil needed to lubricate and protect the suspension parts. This was also the weakness of the layout, as any leaks would have negative effects on ride and durability.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947 Earle MacPherson {{patented}} the MacPherson strut {{for use on}} the Chevrolet Cadet. [...] This was {{the first}} true strut suspension for cars: the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> was rigidly fixed to the strut, thus always keeping the same angle with it, rather than being attached through a swivelling joint as for Stout's Scarab.|$|R
2500|$|The rear {{suspension}} system was of the sliding pillar type, a block carrying the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> rode {{up and down on}} two guide pillars mounted on a solid casting bolted {{to the side of the}} body.

50|$|The D.480 had a fixed, {{conventional}} undercarriage with a {{track of}} 2.80 m. Each mainwheel was <b>mounted</b> on a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> at the vertex of a V-strut hinged {{on the lower}} fuselage longeron, with a near-vertical sprung leg, with an oleo strut shock absorber, to the wing spar. The tailwheel was on a long, hinged leg close to the rear fuselage with a short, vertical shock absorber.|$|R

50|$|The Peitz had a {{tail skid}} {{undercarriage}} with each wheel on a steel <b>stub</b> <b>axle,</b> hinged on a V-strut {{from the lower}} fuselage and with a short vertical elastic shock absorber leg to the forward wing strut This junction was strengthened by extra struts to the forward fuselage and {{to the top of}} the forward, vertical cabane strut and by another long strut outwards {{to the top of the}} rear wing spar.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} used {{very tall}} uprights with the wheel spindles {{on one side}} and a short <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> extending inwards on the other. Springing was by vertically mounted coil-over-damper units mounted inboard and operated through rocker-style upper arms. The lower arms were conventional wide-based wishbones made of a one-piece wishbone and long radius arm running back towards the bulkhead. Steering was rack-and-pinion mounted high, at the same level as the upper wishbone.|$|R
50|$|Four tank-and-tender {{locomotives}} of the CGR’s Experimental 4th Class were {{supplied by}} Neilson in 1884, built {{to the design}} of J.D. Tilney, Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape Eastern System at the time, {{to be able to use}} low-grade local coal. They had Joy valve gear and unusual six-wheeled tenders, with the leading <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> in a rigid frame and the other two <b>axles</b> <b>mounted</b> in a bogie. One of the locomotives survived until 1912 and was designated SAR Class 04 as an obsolete locomotive.|$|R
25|$|The de Marçay 4 had a {{conventional}} fixed tailskid undercarriage, with mainwheels {{on a single}} <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on a pair of}} V-form struts from the lower fuselage.|$|R
25|$|The main {{undercarriage}} was a robust split-axle construction with the legs joining the wings {{at the bottom}} of the X-form centre-section struts. Braced <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> carried the arrester claws required by the longitudinal arrester wires of Royal Navy aircraft carriers up to 1926. The undercarriage assembly was designed so that it could be easily removed with the aircraft on trestles, and replaced with a pair of aluminium single-step, V-bottomed round-topped floats. These carried water rudders for manoeuvring afloat.|$|R
50|$|A sliding pillar {{suspension}} {{is a form}} {{of independent}} front suspension for light cars. The <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> and wheel assembly are attached to a vertical pillar or kingpin which slides up and down through a bush or bushes which are attached to the vehicle chassis, usually as part of transverse outrigger assemblies, sometimes resembling a traditional beam axle, although fixed rigidly to the chassis. Steering movement is provided by allowing this same sliding pillar to also rotate.|$|R
50|$|The Ca.61a had a conventional, fixed {{undercarriage}} with double-tyred mainwheels {{under the}} outer engines. Each wheel was hinged on a V-strut from the fuselage {{side and a}} narrow V drag strut from the aft spar to the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> ends. A vertical, shock absorbing strut joined the axle to the forward spar. There were tailskids {{at the ends of}} the booms and a large nosewheel, half buried in the fuselage below the gunner, in case of nose-overs.|$|R

5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> attached to the suspension on the right.|$|R
