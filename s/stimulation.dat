5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} <b>stimulation</b> involves physical <b>stimulation</b> to {{the external}} anatomy of the clitoris– glans, hood and the external shaft. <b>Stimulation</b> of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may {{have the same effect}} as direct clitoral <b>stimulation.</b> Though these areas may also receive indirect physical <b>stimulation</b> during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect clitoral <b>stimulation</b> is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E
40|$|Kindling is a {{model of}} {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy in which repeated electrical <b>stimulations</b> in limbic areas lead to progressive increase of seizure susceptibility, culminating in generalized convulsions and the establishment of a permanent epileptic syndrome. We studied here the effect of <b>stimulations</b> in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) on. the development of seizures and hippocampal hyperexcitability in kindling elicited from the ventral hippocampus in rats. Animals given 12 kindling <b>stimulations</b> per day with 30 -min intervals for 4 consecutive days developed generalized convulsions on day 4. <b>Stimulations</b> in TRN delivered simultaneously with those in the hippocampus induced marked suppression of seizure generalization. Similarly, the number of generalized seizures and the duration of behavioral convulsions were reduced when rats subjected to 40 kindling <b>stimulations</b> with 5 -min intervals during about 3 h were costimulated in the TRN. The anticonvulsant effect of TRN costimulation was detected also when rats were test-stimulated in the hippocampus at 24 h and 2 and 4 weeks after the initial 40 hippocampal <b>stimulations.</b> Our data provide the first evidence that TRN <b>stimulations</b> can act to suppress limbic motor seizures in hippocampal kindling and suggest a new approach for seizure control in temporal lobe epilepsy.

5|$|If morning {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a <b>stimulation</b> test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar <b>stimulation</b> test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough {{for the purposes of}} the investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring the response of the adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH <b>stimulation</b> test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. <b>Stimulation</b> testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH <b>stimulation</b> test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Physical sexual <b>stimulation</b> of the {{clitoris}} is {{the most}} common way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral <b>stimulation</b> (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral <b>stimulation</b> (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal <b>stimulation</b> is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe rightward {{orientation}} bias {{of neglect}} patients {{has been shown}} to be decreased by postural changes, suggesting that afferences coding the posture relative to gravity might influence the body-centred spatial reference frame. In order to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of plantar <b>stimulations</b> on the subjective straight-ahead (SSA) of two neglect patients presenting with a strong rightward shift, as well as two non-neglect patients and three normal subjects. Vibratory or electrical <b>stimulations</b> were applied to the left or right plantar sole. Data showed that these manipulations influenced the SSA position in neglect patients only.

40|$|In this study, the {{desensitization}} of acetylcholine-induced inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate [I(1, 4, 5) P 3] formation, upon short-time prestimulations, {{was investigated}} in cultures of human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells. Four repeated <b>stimulations</b> for 10 seconds with 10 microM acetylcholine were necessary to induce a desensitization of the I(1, 4, 5) P 3 formation. The desensitization was observed 4 hours after the initiation of repetitive <b>stimulations.</b> The same effect was obtained by a single prestimulation with 1 mM acetylcholine. Preincubation of the cells with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) markedly down-regulated the acetylcholine-induced I(1, 4, 5) P 3 formation. However, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors H 7 and staurosporine did not influence the desensitization induced by four repeated <b>stimulations</b> with 20 microM acetylcholine. These {{results indicate that the}} signal transduction can be desensitized following repeated <b>stimulations</b> with sub-maximal concentrations of receptor agonist and although activation of PKC can induce the same down-regulation, PKC is most likely not involved in the desensitization induced by repetitive acetylcholine-stimulations...|$|R
5|$|The {{abundance}} of nerve endings in the clitoris, {{the majority of}} which exist specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. Sexual <b>stimulation</b> of the clitoris can produce female sexual arousal and orgasm, and may be achieved by masturbation or with a sexual partner. The most effective sexual <b>stimulation</b> of the organ is usually through manual or oral <b>stimulation</b> (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct clitoral stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral <b>stimulation.</b>|$|E

In contrast, the VH- and DH-kindled rats displayed much slower kindling and slow or no conditioning, respectively. No effects of conditioning on the convulsions, comparable with {{those associated with}} amygdala kindling, were observed.

5|$|EFS {{has mostly}} a repressive role of EFS on {{processes}} {{associated with the}} activation of mature T-cells, including IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and IL-2-dependent clonal expansion of T cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) <b>stimulation,</b> EFS dephosphorylation and release of the SRC family kinase FYN and phospholipase C-γ normally lead to self-limitation of the immune response. Consistent with this mechanism, EFS overexpression in T cell-derived cell lines decreased IL-2 concentration in supernatants in response to TCR <b>stimulation,</b> while T cells derived from mice lacking EFS gene showed increased IL-2 production. A dual role of EFS in mature T cells function has been proposed because both overexpression and siRNA knockdown of this protein in cell models resulted in decreased transcriptional activation of IL-2 dependent promoters following TCR <b>stimulation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; <b>stimulation</b> testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone <b>stimulation</b> test) are less useful, although a <b>stimulation</b> test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different <b>stimulation</b> tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on the front wall. For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral <b>stimulation.</b> The G-spot area {{has been described as}} needing direct <b>stimulation,</b> such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting to stimulate the area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult because of the particular angle of penetration required.|$|E
5|$|The {{synaptic}} tag hypothesis {{may also}} account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (see Properties) is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing <b>stimulation</b> while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas {{one might expect}} only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak <b>stimulation</b> alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), both synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong <b>stimulation</b> of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.|$|E

Case: We report a 10. 5 month old boy with agenesis of the corpus callosum. The intervention was administered based on sensory integration theory an hour a week for 20 weeks. The exercise intervention consisted of proprioceptive and linear, sustained and low frequency vestibular <b>stimulations</b> on suspension device and physio roll. A Denver Developmental Screening- II and milestones skill testing was completed pre-intervention and monthly. Post-intervention, age of gross motor, fine motor adaptive, language, and personal-social functions significantly improved. Based on milestones skills, maintenance of gross motor functions (e. g. sitting and quadruped position) improved. The child could roll from side to side and released objects voluntarily. The reaction time to auditory <b>stimulations</b> became less than 2 seconds. Conclusion: vestibulo-proprioceptive <b>stimulations</b> using the neuroplasticity ability of the central nervous system is effective for development of gross and fine motor, language, and personal-social functions.
