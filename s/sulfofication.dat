Plants {{have been found to}} require considerable amounts of sulfates for their best growth and inasmuch as sulfur is not present in soils in that form, but as unassimilable organic and inorganic compounds, the sulfur-feeding of crops will depend very largely upon the ability of a soil on which they grow to produce sulfates from these unavailable substances. In other words, the total sulfur content of a soil, alone, will not show the sulfur available for plant growth. The sulfofying power of the soil must also be ascertained...|$|E
