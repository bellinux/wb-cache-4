40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a survey of}} prescriptions dispensed in drugstores and pharmacies {{in the city of}} Araraquara in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, in May 2006. Their contents were assessed for compliance with the laws in force on drug prescription and dispensing. A total of 1, 335 prescriptions were examined: 40 (3 %) were unsigned, 212 (15. 9 %) did not contain the prescribing physician's stamp, 170 (12. 7 %) were undated. There were prescriptions containing corrections (4. 6 %), and written in code (4. 4 %). Only 58. 8 % were legible and easy to understand; nevertheless all of them were dispensed. Some did not specify the name of the patient (7. 2 %). On how to use the medication prescribed, not a single prescription contained all the information required by law. Specifically, 7. 6 % lacked information on dosage, 54. 3 % on presentation, 33. 6 % on how to take the drug, and 51. 2 % on duration of treatment. The data show a general failure to comply with the laws on drug prescription and dispensing. Incomplete information on the drugs and their correct use could lead to irrational use and errors in medication. The lack of prescribers' signature and <b>stamp,</b> <b>date</b> of emission and name of patient can lead to fraudulent and counterfeit prescriptions. Thus, the data found point to the need for capacitation of prescribing and dispensing professionals and the importance of the role of professional associations in guiding their members...|$|E
