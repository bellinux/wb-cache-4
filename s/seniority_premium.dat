40|$|We {{show how}} the age prole of earnings, {{retirement}} rules and retirement behavior are tightly linked through the general equilibrium of the economy. Generous Social Security benets nanced by large Social Security taxes discourage human capital accumulation. In Social Security systems where Social Security benets prioritize redistribution less productive workers {{with lower levels of}} human capital tend to retire earlier. These out ows of workers from the labor force tend to generate wage proles that are monotonically increasing over age and labor markets that display larger seniority premia. This paper theoretically rationalizes the links between retirement rules and the wage structures over the life cycle and uses data on European countries to show how social security taxes, the age prole of earnings, and retirement behavior are related.

Using a large administrative dataset for Norwegian manufacturing, I find that more educated workers have higher experience and <b>seniority</b> <b>premiums,</b> indicating that they accumulate more human capital (both general and firm-specific) than workers with less education. Firm characteristics are also found to be important for experience and <b>seniority</b> <b>premiums.</b> Indicators of technological change {{seem to be more}} important for returns to experience and seniority than indicators of technological level. The results suggest that workers learn from their colleagues, and that they learn the skills that their colleagues possess.

40|$|When {{human capital}} skills {{differ in their}} ability to attract offers from {{alternative}} employers, a potential inefficiency in human capital investment arises. If a worker's ability and investments are observed by the labour market only when the worker invests in self-promoting activities, then high-ability workers overinvest in self-promotion. No bond is posted in the contract that both attains efficient investment and minimizes the bond subject to individual rationality constraints and the zero profit condition. The contract is one in which the firm (i) offers to match outside offers strategically and (ii) guarantees a minimum wage. The model predicts that, under both the spot market contract and the efficient contract, wage declines with seniority even when conditioning on high ability. This prediction is consistent with the stylized fact regarding the decline of wages with seniority in academia. The model can also explain how the <b>seniority</b> wage <b>premium</b> may vary across disciplines, time, and schools. microeconomic theory, negative <b>seniority</b> wage <b>premium,</b> spot market contract, efficient contract, general human capital, multi-tasking...|$|R
