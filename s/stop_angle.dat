Angle continued to demand a match with Jarrett and he said if he couldn't get him at Final Resolution, he would wrestle Foley. Angle then slapped Foley causing Jarrett to come out and talk about what Angle wanted and then what Jarrett wanted (Angle to be fired). Because of Angle's contract clause, Jarrett could not fire him, so he made this stipulation: if Angle lost to Rhino, he would be fired from TNA; if Angle beat Rhino, he would get Jarrett at Genesis. Angle won, allowing him to face Jarrett at Genesis. The feud got even more personal when it started involving Jarrett's three daughters during the December 11, 2008 episode of Impact. Angle said that they would become orphans after Genesis and that [...] "Uncle Kurt" [...] may find it in his heart to adopt them and make them his. Jarrett came out to confront him but was held back by his longtime friend, BG James, TNA Personnel Terry Taylor, referee Earl Hebner, and Scott D'Amore. On January 11 at Genesis, Jarrett lost to Angle. Jarrett suffered some injuries, but able to compete on the TNA Maximum Impact Tour, by facing against Angle in two singles and a few tag team matches with A.J. Styles against Angle and Scott Steiner.

In particular, the debris flow is a severe disaster because it brings serious damage to villages and agricultural fields, as well as casualties. In {{order to reduce the}} damage caused by debris flows, this study carried out the predicting simulation of the affected area using a random walk model. The data of 12 debris flows were extracted from aerial photos taken in Inje and Pyeongchang counties, Gangwon province and Bongwha county, Gyeongbuk province, Korea in 2006 and 2008. In order to identify optimum parameter sets of the random walk model, these data of debris flows were used. There are three parameters, which are soil volume at a time, <b>stop</b> <b>angle</b> and inertia weight. These parameters are optimized when showing the highest correspondence rate, which means there is a comparison between a simulated sediment area and an actual sediment area after simulating 1, 250 of combinations. The simulation was conducted to extract the optimum parameters, and the method of calculating the correspondence rate was developed to evaluate the value of parameters. The criteria for determining the danger and warning zone and the soil volume of collapse were prepared to make the debris flow hazard map. The debris flow hazard maps in Inje and Pyeongchang counties of Gangwon province and Bongwha county of Gyeongbuk province were made on the scale of 1 : 5, 000.

40|$|A {{hydrodynamic}} model for dense granular flows, previously developed for confined flows, {{has been extended}} to address free surface flow down an inclined chute. Results show that the model can predict the existence of two critical inclination angles, namely, the avalanche starting angle θstart above which the granular bed begins flowing from an initially jammed configuration, and an avalanche <b>stopping</b> <b>angle</b> θstop, which is the minimum to maintain flowing conditions, in agreement with experiments and numerical simulations available from the literature. The dependence of these critical angles on the bed depth is also analytically formulated, reflecting the expected qualitative behavior. Such a hysteretic behavior is specific of granular flow and its prediction provides indications of consistence of the modeling approach. The improved model also captures the scaling of the velocity profiles down the bed depth...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{liquid water}} flow on Mars has been {{proposed}} based on geomorphological features, such as gullies. Recurring slope lineae — seasonal flows that are darker than their surroundings — are candidate locations for seeping liquid water on Mars today, but their formation mechanism remains unclear. Topographical analysis shows that the terminal slopes of recurring slope lineae match the <b>stopping</b> <b>angle</b> for granular flows of cohesionless sand in active Martian aeolian dunes. In Eos Chasma, linea lengths vary widely and are longer where there are more extensive angle-of-repose slopes, inconsistent with models for water sources. These observations suggest that recurring slope lineae are granular flows. The preference for warm seasons and the detection of hydrated salts are consistent with some role for water in their initiation. However, liquid water volumes may be small or zero, alleviating planetary protection concerns about habitable environments...|$|R
40|$|A small sphere {{placed on}} the top of a big static {{frictionless}} sphere, slips until it leaves the surface at an angle θ_l=cos^- 12 / 3. On the other extreme, if the surface of the big sphere has coefficient of static friction, μ_s→∞, the small sphere starts rolling and continues to do so until it leaves the surface at an angle θ_l =cos^- 110 / 17. In the case where, 0 ≤μ_s<∞, we get a simple phase diagram. The three phases are pure rolling, rolling with slipping and detached state. One phase line separates pure rolling from rolling with slipping. This diagram is obtained when <b>stopping</b> <b>angles</b> for pure rolling are plotted against static friction coefficients μ_s.

40|$|Various {{methods of}} {{producing}} sound from 'sounding' {{sand in the}} laboratory are explored. Low amplitude sound with frequency {{similar to that of}} 'booming' during spontaneous avalanches was produced in a small inclined chute and rotating flask. Shearing of dried sand with a stylus, and pouring from buckets or shaking in a jar produced loud sound in 200 - 500 Hz range. Dryness of the sand and flowrate have significant effect on the produced sound. A model based on kinetic theory is proposed to explain the production of oscillations in avalanching flows. The avalanching layer behaves like a breathing mode with infinite wavelength, and perturbations in volume fraction allow oscillatory behaviour to be sustained in the inclined shear flow. Finally, a phase transition model is used to explain the presence, and characteristics, of oscillations observed in numerical simulations of inclined flows near their <b>stopping</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{new version}} of ECB has been {{completed}} that allows nonuniform grid spacing and a new dieledric boundary condition. ECB was developed to retain the simplicity and speed of an orthogonal mesh while capturing much of the fidelity of adaptive, unstructured finite element meshes. Codes based on orthogonal meshes are {{easy to work with}} and lead to well-posed elliptic and parabolic problems that are comparatively easy to solve. Generally, othogonal mesh representations lead to banded matrices while unstructured representations lead to more complicated sparse matrices. Recent advances in adapting banded linear systems to massively parallel computers reinforce our opinion that iterative field solutions utilizing banded matrix methods will continue to be competitive. Unfortunately, the underlying ``stair-step`` boundary representation in simple orthogonal mesh (and recent Adaptive Mesh Refinement) applications is inadequate. With ECB, the curved boundary is represented by piece-wise-linear representations of curved internal boundaries embedded into the orthogonal mesh- we build better, but not more, coefficients in the vicinity of these boundaries-and we use the surplus free energy on more ambitious physics models. ECB structures are constructed out of the superposition of analytically prescribed building blocks. In 2 -D, we presently use a POLY 4 (linear boundaries defined by 4 end points), an ANNULUS, (center, inner & outer radii, starting & <b>stopping</b> <b>angle),</b> a ROUND (starting point & <b>angle,</b> <b>stopping</b> point & <b>angle,</b> fillet radius). A link-list AIRFOIL has also been constructed. In the ECB scheme, we first find each intercept of the structure boundary with an I or J grid line is assigned an index K. We store the actual z,y value at the intercept, and the slope of the boundary at that intercept, in arrays whose index K is associated with the corresponding mesh point just inside the structure. In 2 -D, a point just outside a structure may have up to 4 intercepts associated with it. We now construct PieceWise Linear Segments (PWLS) -from the slope and intercept- that will serve as the computational boundary-a boundary constructed as a superposition of the analytic elements given as input. The intersection of these PWLSs with other nearby PWLSs define the end- points. We insist that there be an endpoint within each cell for each sequence of PWLSs coming through that cell. We give directionality to a PWLS by the convention that looking from point 1 to point 2 will place the interior of the structure on the left. This scheme allows the generalization to those boundary structures that do not actually have any mesh points inside a structure. Since these structures are defined by their analytically defined bounding walls, points can always be found that are ``inside`` a given wall segment-even though it may, in fact, be outside the opposite bounding segment. Such subgrid geometry is useful, for example, in a gun configuration with a thin electrode, perhaps not parallel to any axes of the orthogonal mesh, in which the electrode simply contributes to an external focusing field...|$|R

Using various combinations of the ratios of branching ratios we argue that, depending on the scenario, the observable may be promising in exposing the light stop mass, the mixing angle and the CP phase.

But for angles between d and s, {{it can be}} either at rest or in motion with a constant velocity. It is shown that the limit velocity is given by the equilibrium between gravity driving and dissipation by the shocks. Moreover, the rough plane acts as a periodic potential trap whose width and depth decrease when the angle is increased: the static angle s corresponds to the angle for which the trap disappears; the dynamical angle d to that for which the limit velocity is sufficient {{to escape from the}} trap.
