The BoomSound <b>stereo</b> <b>system</b> {{is controlled by}} two five-volt NXP TFA9887 integrated circuits combining NXP’s CoolFlux audio DSP, a class-D amplifier with current sensing, and a DC-to-DC converter to boost the output level of micro-speakers up to five times (up to 2.6W RMS) without damaging the driver.|$|E
25|$|This {{new version}} {{featured}} the 147's dual-zone digital climate controller while the interior climate {{could also be}} controlled via an air quality sensor. A different choice of colours were available for the interior, with the option of a two-tone interior very much like that on offer from its European rivals. A wider range of options including xenon lighting, tele-informatics (CONNECT and CONNECT NAV) and a Bose <b>stereo</b> <b>system</b> were available, the <b>stereo</b> <b>system</b> could now also be operated via buttons {{on the steering wheel}}. Also the Selespeed gearbox control system was updated, buttons on the steering wheel were replaced by paddle shifters, as seen on the earlier Alfa Romeo 147. In the center console the designers added a multifunctional display with trip computer, fault and service monitor.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time as Toyota's Camry upgrade in April 1994, Apollo {{specifications}} were also uprated slightly. SLXs now had a four- and GSs a six-speaker <b>stereo</b> <b>system,</b> up from two and four, respectively. The SLX also received a tachometer and rear mudflaps, while the GS variant gained standard fitment cruise control and power windows. A second update in June 1994 fitted a driver's airbag as standard on all models bar the four-cylinder SLX.|$|E

These changes in aggregate reduce weight by 38lbs which {{is the reason why}} it accelerates even faster than before.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Tomographic PIV {{as a full}} volume 3 D- 3 C {{flow field}} {{measurement}} technique can also be applied to thin sheets used in standard PIV. Tomographic PIV and Stereo PIV are compared with experimental data from an impinging jet in water. The field of view is 60 mm x 40 mm, the light sheet thickness is varied from 8 to 55 pixel. Images have been recorded with 4 cameras to gain results from two independent <b>Stereo</b> PIV <b>systems</b> and from Tomographic PIV using 2 - 4 cameras. Different error sources for both techniques are quantified. It is shown that instantaneous flow fields from Tomographic PIV deviate less {{from each of the}} two <b>stereo</b> <b>systems,</b> than the two <b>stereo</b> <b>systems</b> deviate from each other. A systematic error pattern is identified for the two <b>stereo</b> <b>systems,</b> which is not present for Tomographic PIV. Thin volume Tomographic PIV allows the calculation of multiple vector planes. Two planes can be calculated even for the thinnest light sheet (8 pixel) providing the full 3 x 3 strain-tensor. Thicker sheets with up to twelve vector planes allow the visualization of the small vortex structures in this experiment...|$|R

25|$|In July 1995, the facelifted {{model was}} {{launched}} in Australia, although this differed to the update applied to the North American variants. The update brought a new grille, slight updates to the rear end, new hubcaps, a lighter interior colour scheme with a new range of fabrics, and the discontinuation of the Ultima trim. Equipment wise, a new security system was fitted with remote central locking, engine immobiliser and alarm. The CSi gained four-wheel disc brakes, and optional anti-lock brakes. Seat belt webbing clamps for the front seats were now fitted as was a lap-sash belt in the centre rear.

25|$|The Eagle Premier was {{launched}} in January 1988, with the first production models rolling {{off the assembly line}} on September 28, 1987. Although the car is sometimes referred to as a Renault Premier, this car was never marketed anywhere in the world as a Renault. Pre-production prototypes left the factory with Renault emblems on its grille and wheel covers. but Eagle nameplates on its trunk lid, and the Eagle division had to indicate this difference in its dealer information brochures and videos. Prior to its January 1988 launch, all pre-production cars had the Renault emblem removed from the grille and steering column horn hub pad. Depending on which <b>stereo</b> <b>system</b> was ordered, one would find either a Renault or Eagle emblem in the car through 1989 on the stereo. It was to have been the first bodystyle in a series of three, along with a four-door wagon and a two-door coupe. After Chrysler purchased Renault's stake (46%) in AMC and all other outstanding stock (54%), the wagon and coupe body styles were cancelled as was a planned Premier DL model featuring a five-speed manual gearbox.|$|E

He's just trying to fill his world with noise and with these things." [...] During the final shot of the episode, a steadicam shot filmed by Andrew Voegeli, Jesse turns his <b>stereo</b> <b>system</b> {{all the way up}} and leans directly against the pulsating speaker to try to shut out his pain. MacLaren wanted the speakers to pulse, but they could not actually play loud music without harming actor Aaron Paul. The special effects crew unsuccessfully tried several methods to make the speakers pulse, such as shaking them and pulling on strings, but they did not appear realistic. It was achieved after MacLaren visited a local stereo store and an employee provided her a bass tester which would run the <b>stereo</b> <b>system</b> with no noise, but cause the speakers to pulse as if music was playing. That employee was hired to come on the set and run the system, and the lights and pulsing were timed to match music which was later dubbed in.|$|E
