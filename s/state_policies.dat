5|$|Upon its {{establishment}} in 1871, Germany was about two-thirds Protestant and one-third Roman Catholic, with a notable Jewish minority. Other faiths {{existed in the}} state, but never achieved a demographic significance and cultural impact of these three confessions. Germany lost nearly all of its Jewish minority during the Holocaust. Religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through immigration and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through <b>state</b> <b>policies.</b> It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990, with an accompanying substantial decline in religiosity throughout all of Germany and a contrasting increase of Evangelical Protestants and Muslims.|$|E
5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always {{see eye to eye}} with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, there was always the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of <b>state</b> <b>policies.</b> Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the implementation of a}} Washington <b>state</b> <b>policy</b> which requires that school administrators give their subordinates the opportunity to appraise their performance. The importance of this topic is suggested by research findings that indicate appraisals of principals by teachers yield information to assess and improve the administrative skills of principals. Research questions sought information on activities at the state level which served to promote implementation of the <b>state</b> <b>policy.</b> Other research questions sought information on the extent and impact of local school district policies and practices that were consistent with the <b>state</b> <b>policy.</b> The methodology for the study combined survey research and interviews. The interview methodology was used to collect qualitative information on the efforts of officials at the state level to promote local implementation of the <b>state</b> <b>policy.</b> Mailed surveys were used to collect data on the extent and impact of local school district policies and practices consistent with the <b>state</b> <b>policy.</b> The results of this study showed that none of the officials interviewed cited any activities at the state level, which promoted the implementation of the <b>state</b> <b>policy.</b> Results of the mailed surveys indicated that only 7 % of local school districts had adopted policies on appraisal by subordinates that included the requirements of the <b>state</b> <b>policy.</b> Moreover, only 22 % to 29 % of school administrators were found to have complied with the requirements of the <b>state</b> <b>policy</b> by giving their subordinates the opportunity to appraise their performance. School personnel in a position to evaluate the effects of appraisal strategies reported that these strategies were beneficial for assessing administrator performance. Some school personnel also reported improvements in administrator performance and the school program, {{as a result of these}} appraisal activities. However, elements of the strategy described in <b>state</b> <b>policy</b> neither ensure changes in administrative behavior, nor protect subordinates against reprisals for making the appraisal...|$|R

5|$|At the beginning, {{there were}} no signs of the quarrels that would destroy the {{military}} committee. At the time, the members were bound together by their goal of building a prosperous nation. On 9 March the NCRC released Lu'ay al-Atassi from jail, promoted him to the rank of lieutenant general, appointed him commander-in-chief and NCRC chairman, the de facto head of state. Hariri was appointed chief of staff. While Atassi and Hariri held powerful posts, they did not possess enough personal or political power to threaten the NCRC. The Nasserist officers were also given notable offices with Muhammad al-Sufi becoming Minister of Defence and Rashid al-Qutayni becoming deputy chief of staff. However, the Military Committee, which had expanded its membership with five new members, ensured that the Ba'athists controlled the real levers of powers. The committee decided <b>state</b> <b>policies</b> before the sessions of the NCRC, and by doing so became the real seat of power.|$|E

25|$|Pobedonostsev did {{develop a}} social {{program for the}} Church while {{limiting}} its autonomy. He imposed repressive measures against the non-Orthodox. He carried out major Church reforms, but they resulted in a church that by 1900 was enmeshed in bureaucracy, alienated in many ways from society, resentful of secular authorities, and divided internally. Stagnation in church and <b>state</b> <b>policies</b> prevailed until Pobedonostsev retired in 1905. In the long run, argues Polunov, Pobedonostsev's attempts to impose safe conservative barriers to reform and his hostility toward innovation served only to weaken the autocratic state from within.|$|E
25|$|Under Stalin's leadership, the {{government}} launched a planned economy, industrialisation of the largely rural country, and collectivization of its agriculture. During {{this period of}} rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to penal labor camps, including many political convicts for their opposition to Stalin's rule; millions were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union. The transitional disorganisation of the country's agriculture, combined with the harsh <b>state</b> <b>policies</b> and a drought, led to the Soviet famine of 1932–1933. The Soviet Union, though with a heavy price, was transformed from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse in a short span of time.|$|E

25|$|White {{flight is}} a term that {{originated}} in the United States, starting in the 1950s and 1960s, and applied to the large-scale migration of people of various European ancestries from racially mixed urban regions to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions. The term has more recently been applied to other migrations by whites, from older, inner suburbs to rural areas, {{as well as from}} the US Northeast and Midwest to the milder climate in the Southeast and Southwest. The term has also been used for large-scale post-colonial emigration of whites from Africa, or parts of that continent, driven by levels of violent crime and anti-colonial <b>state</b> <b>policies.</b>|$|E
