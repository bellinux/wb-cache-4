50|$|Both had a {{fixed lens}} {{but to the}} front of which could be {{attached}} a <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens,</b> called the Teleskop 1.7x.|$|E
50|$|A <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens</b> is an {{accessory}} lens clipped, screwed or bayoneted {{to the front}} of a main lens that alters the lens' effective focal length. If it is a positive (converging) only supplement, it will shorten the focal length and reset the infinity focus of the lens to the focal length of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens.</b> These so-called close-up lenses are often uncorrected single element menisci, but are a cheap way to provide close focusing for an otherwise limited focus range lens.|$|E
50|$|To {{indicate}} heading, MineCams 1 and 2 used {{an ordinary}} spherical fluid-mounted car compass on an aluminium arm about 30 cm from the camera. A <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens</b> (from an old pair of spectacles) {{glued to the}} acrylic window brought the compass into focus {{at the corner of}} the frame.|$|E
50|$|We {{have already}} seen that the Contaflex I and II could only take the Teleskop 1.7x <b>supplementary</b> <b>lenses,</b> and that the Alpha, Beta and Prima had their own limited range of Pantar <b>supplementary</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Prima {{could take}} the Pantar <b>supplementary</b> <b>lenses</b> like the Alpha and Beta.|$|R
50|$|The Rapid and Super {{could take}} the same <b>supplementary</b> <b>lenses</b> as the III and IV.|$|R
50|$|An afocal {{attachment}} is a {{more sophisticated}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens.</b> It is a so-called Galilean telescope accessory mounted {{to the front of}} a lens that alters the lens' effective focal length without moving the focal plane. There are two types: the telephoto and the wide angle. The telephoto type is a front positive plus rear negative cell combination that increases the image size; the wide angle has a front negative and rear positive arrangement to reduce the image size. Both have cell separation equal to cell focal length difference to maintain the focal plane.|$|E
5000|$|The Kodak Retina IIIc and IIc (USA/West Germany) {{collapsable}} lens 35mm rangefinder cameras of 1954 {{took the}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens</b> idea {{to the extreme}} with their interchangeable lens [...] "components." [...] This system allowed swapping the front cell component of their standard Schneider Retina-Xenon C 50mm f/2 lenses (a Double Gauss) for Schneider Retina-Longar-Xenon 80mm f/4 long-focus and Schneider Retina-Curtar-Xenon 35mm f/5.6 wide-angle components. Component lens design is tightly constrained {{by the need to}} reuse the rear cell and the lenses are extremely bulky, range limited and complex compared with fully interchangeable lenses, but the Retina's interlens Synchro-Compur leaf shutter restricted lens options.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was also}} a Zeiss Pro-Tessar M 1:1 <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens,</b> that kept the focal length of 50mm but allowed 1:1 reproduction. The {{effective}} speed of the M 1:1 lens is f/5.6.The 50mm standard front elements, {{as well as the}} Pro-Tessar M 1:1 elements, were different between the early models III, IV, Rapid and Super with the old model of Tessar, and the later models Super (new), Super B, Super BC and S with the recomputed Tessar. It appears that the mount was very slightly modified, and it seems physically impossible to mismatch the elements as the journal diameterabove the bayonet mount had been reduced by approximately [...]006" ...|$|E
50|$|The Super BC and S {{could take}} the {{magazine}} backs, {{as well as the}} usual <b>supplementary</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the Super (new) and Super B, the Zeiss Tessar 50mm f:2.8 lens was recomputed and {{supposedly}} performed better. They could still {{take the same}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>lenses,</b> with one exception discussed in the relevant section.|$|R
50|$|The Contaflex III, {{launched}} in 1956, {{was the same}} as the I, but equipped with a Zeiss Tessar 50mm f:2.8 with helical focusing. The front element of the lens was removable and could be replaced by <b>supplementary</b> <b>lenses,</b> discussed in the section Contaflex lenses.|$|R
40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} anterior chamber maintainer with <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens</b> in anterior-posterior combined surgery in rabbit eyes. METHODS:Group A: anterior chamber maintainer and <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens</b> were applied in anterior-posterior combined surgery. Group B: conventional anterior-posterior combined surgery was used. The application value of this device were analyzed from the operation time, operation effect, postoperative complications. RESULTS:The application of anterior chamber maintainer with <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens</b> in anterior-posterior combined surgery played a positive role on the stripping time(P P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION:There are advantages of anterior chamber maintainer with <b>supplementary</b> <b>lens</b> in anterior-posterior combined surgery, such as more convenient in operation process, {{a wider range of}} observation, bimanualness, less complications and so on...|$|E
40|$|A camera unit {{suitable}} for most medical photographic purposes is described. The unit comprises a single-lens reflex camera, an {{electronic flash unit}} and <b>supplementary</b> <b>lenses.</b> Simple instructions for use of th's basic unit are presented. The unit is entirely {{suitable for}} taking fine-quality photographs of most medical subjects by persons who have had little photographic training...|$|R
50|$|This model {{featured}} four-element f/2.8 lenses {{rather than}} the three-element f/3.5 lenses used by the standard Realist. Most users under normal use will not notice the difference, though the f/3.5 lenses have slightly better contrast. The f/3.5 lenses all show vignetting at smaller apertures whereas the f/2.8 lenses do not. The f/2.8 lenses also work better with <b>supplementary</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nippon Kogaku {{also made}} scores of minor {{accessories}} for the F2, such as straps, cases, bags, remote firing cords, eyecups, eyepiece correction <b>lenses,</b> <b>supplementary</b> close-up <b>lenses,</b> lens hoods, filters and cases. In 1978 the complete Nikon photographic system of cameras, lenses and accessories totaled nearly 450 items priced {{in excess of}} US$110,000 - the most extensive and expensive in the world.|$|R
5000|$|The Kolibri took sixteen 3x4cm {{exposures}} on 127 film. The camera {{featured a}} collapsible lens tube and was {{arranged in a}} vertical format, with a flip-up viewfinder on the top. On the right-hand side was the winding knob and a tripod bush; there was another tripod bush at the bottom. The lens had small [...] "feet" [...] on either side, so the camera would stand horizontally, and a strut could be fixed below the lens to balance the camera vertically. There were two red windows on the back, for the small image format. A <b>supplementary</b> close-up <b>lens</b> was available, called Proxar, which allowed focusing down to 30 cm.|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{the optics}} of photorefractively {{computed}} ray tracing shows that, for short camera-to-subject distances, the function relating image size to defocus {{of the eye}} is not symmetrical for errors of focus in front of and behind the camera. This asymmetry is exploited in the new method of isotropic photorefraction, in which the <b>supplementary</b> cylinder <b>lenses</b> of the original orthogonal photorefractors are replaced by defocusing of the camera lens itself. By comparing photographs taken with the camera focused in front of and behind the subject, {{the sign of the}} eyes' defocus (myopic or hyperopic relative to the camera) can be determined. The axis of any astigmatism is readily apparent as the direction in which the photorefractive images are elongated. The method is well adapted for the refractive screening of infants and young children...|$|R
50|$|The Betavaron is a zoom {{enlarging}} lens for 35 mm film. The relative {{positions of}} the negative, paper easel, and lens remain fixed, while the magnification setting of the lens is changed to alter the degree of enlargement. The design is 11 elements. The Betavaron 3...10, the base model, is limited to 3.1-10× magnification, with a maximum aperture of f/4.1-f/5.6 (the aperture changes slightly with the magnification). Adding a <b>supplementary</b> -0.9 diopter <b>lens</b> turns the unit into a Betavaron 5,3...17, and changes the magnification range to 5.3-17×, and the maximum aperture to f/5.4-f/5.7.|$|R
40|$|A 61 -year-old {{woman with}} a {{penetrating}} keratoplasty and a pseudophakic <b>supplementary</b> toric intraocular <b>lens</b> (IOL) (Sulcoflex toric 653 T, 3. 00 sphere and + 5. 50 cylinder) in the right eye presented to our practice multiple times for IOL realignment. The IOL 2 ̆ 7 s undulating haptics were designed for lens stability; however, lid forces and ovalization of the sulcus resulted in repeated anticlockwise rotation off the desired axis. The IOL was therefore sutured transsclerally to maintain axis orientation at 20 degrees. The postoperative refraction was + 0. 50 - 1. 00 × 76 with visual acuity of 20 / 25. Transscleral fixation of a supplementary IOL in an eye with a previous corneal graft is described. This procedure can result in stabilization of a pseudophakic supplementary toric IOL with good visual rehabilitation.
