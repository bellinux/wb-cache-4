25|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>donation</b> is an exception, with a {{birth defect}} rate of almost a fifth {{compared}} to the general population. It {{may be explained by}} that sperm banks accept only people with high sperm count.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sperm</b> <b>donation</b> {{may provide}} the source for the sperm used in IVF {{procedures}} where the male partner produces no sperm or has an inheritable disease, or where the woman being treated has no male partner.|$|E

50|$|Restrictions on <b>sperm</b> <b>donations</b> or {{the ability}} to obtain IVF {{treatment}} in some jurisdictions has given rise to women seeking such donations or treatments traveling to countries which do not impose such restrictions, in a practice called fertility tourism.|$|R
5000|$|Most jurisdictions {{have laws}} that {{limit the number}} of {{children}} a sperm donor may give rise to. The main reason to limit <b>sperm</b> <b>donations</b> is the risk of accidental consanguinity or inbreeding between donor offspring. In some countries such limits are voluntary while in others they are imposed by law.|$|R
25|$|In embryo donation, these extra embryos {{are given}} to other couples or women for {{transfer}} {{with the goal of}} producing a successful pregnancy. The resulting child is considered the child of the woman who carries it and gives birth, and not the child of the donor, the same as occurs with egg donation or <b>sperm</b> <b>donation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Intracytoplasmic sperm {{injection}} (ICSI) {{is where}} a single sperm is injected directly into an egg. Its main usage as an expansion of IVF is to overcome male infertility problems, although {{it may also be}} used where eggs cannot easily be penetrated by sperm, and occasionally in conjunction with <b>sperm</b> <b>donation.</b> It can be used in teratozoospermia, since once the egg is fertilised abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence blastocyst development or blastocyst morphology.|$|E
25|$|Sunni Muslim nations {{generally}} allow IVF between {{married couples}} when conducted {{with their own}} respective sperm and eggs, but not with donor eggs from other couples. But Iran, which is Shi'a Muslim, has a more complex scheme. Iran bans <b>sperm</b> <b>donation</b> but allows donation of both fertilised and unfertilised eggs. Fertilised eggs are donated from married couples to other married couples, while unfertilised eggs are donated {{in the context of}} mut'ah or temporary marriage to the father.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} some Christian leaders (especially Catholic) who are {{concerned}} about all in vitro fertility therapies because they disrupt the natural act of conceiving a child where gamete donations, both egg and <b>sperm</b> <b>donations,</b> are seen to [...] "compromise the marital bond and family integrity". and they encourage infertile couples to consider adoption instead.|$|R
5000|$|Most jurisdictions {{which set}} {{limits on the}} number of <b>sperm</b> <b>donations</b> do so in terms of number of donor offspring, but some jurisdictions set the limits in terms of [...] "families", to allow for the {{children}} of the recipient woman to be true genetic siblings and because consanguinity issues are caught by a country's incest laws.|$|R
50|$|In {{the eighth}} season, he discovers {{he has a}} daughter, Niki, who {{was the result of}} a woman using one of his <b>sperm</b> <b>donations.</b> At first, Masuka {{suspects}} that Niki is using him for his money, and even has Debra (who has quit Miami Metro and started working as a private detective) look into her past. When he learns that she works in a strip club, he gets her a job as a forensics assistant at Miami Metro, allowing them to work together and get to know each other better.|$|R
25|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{not allowed}} to a Muslim woman during menstruation, postpartum period, during fasting and certain religious activities, disability and in iddah after divorce or widowhood. Homosexual relations and same sex marriages are forbidden to women in Islam. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is acceptable in Islam; but ovum donation along with <b>sperm</b> <b>donation,</b> embryo donation and child adoption are prohibited by Islam. These marriages meet with varying degrees of social approval, depending on the milieu./> Some debated fatwas from Shia sect of Islam, however, allow third party participation.|$|E

He finds Bianca instead, and is {{surprised}} to see that she is pregnant. He later finds an unconscious Kendall. As an ambulance arrives for her, it is stated that there is not enough room for Bianca and Zach to ride along to the hospital. There is, however, enough room for Zach and Kendall's children to ride in the front seat of the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall's fate. They also discuss Bianca's secret that she is pregnant with Zach's child via <b>sperm</b> <b>donation,</b> and Bianca's new lover named Reese. Zach had agreed to father Bianca's child for the couple, but did not know that she had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor. Zach helps deliver the new child into the world.|$|E

Reese Williams comes to Pine Valley, not long after the tornado with Miranda. She proposes marriage to Bianca and she accepts. Reese and Bianca have their share of obstacles to overcome as a couple, mainly Bianca's suspicions of Reese's sexuality and friendship with Zach, but they exchange wedding vows on February 13, 2009.|$|E
50|$|People may {{be unaware}} of a kinship {{relationship}} between them {{in a number of}} circumstances. For example, artificial insemination with an anonymous donated sperm may result in offspring being unaware of any biological relations, such as paternity or half siblings. To reduce the likelihood of accidental incest, fertility clinics usually limit the number of times that a donor's sperm may be used. Some countries have laws limiting the number of children a donor can father. while others limit <b>sperm</b> <b>donations</b> based on family numbers to enable one family to have true siblings.|$|R
40|$|Extract] Findlaw {{recently}} {{reported that the}} US Food and Drug Administration was seeking to stop Trent Arsenault from donating his sperm {{on the basis that}} he was in the business of manufacturing human cells. This apparently is in contravention of US regulations. While Mr Arsenault has received no payment for his <b>sperm</b> <b>donations,</b> it was his lack of 'sexual intimacy' with any of the recipients that caused him to fall foul of the rules. The primary concern of the charges against Mr Arsenault (in fact 'his Establishment') is that in failing to screen his sperm for certain agents, he has failed to 'provide adequate protections against the risks of communicable disease transmission'...|$|R

500|$|During MIT's CPW in 2007, Caltech {{distributed}} a sixteen-page fake {{edition of}} MIT's student newspaper, The Tech, containing articles such as [...] "Math Dept. Hires Rising Star Matt Damon", [...] "Infinite Corridor Not Actually Infinite", referring to MIT's iconic main thoroughfare, and a mock advertisement for <b>sperm</b> <b>donation</b> offering {{more money for}} Caltech students than MIT students. [...] The prank {{was inspired by the}} suggestion that a similar fake-newspaper caper had been perpetrated by the University of Southern California against the University of California, Los Angeles in the past, and the paper was prepared in just two weeks with 15,000 issues printed. [...] The three Caltech students sent to distribute the papers at MIT initially tried to drop the papers at The Techs normal distribution points, but these were quickly discovered and removed by MIT students. [...] The Caltech students then turned to distributing the papers individually on the sidewalk outside of Lobby 7, a location outside the jurisdiction of the MIT Police.|$|E

2500|$|At a sperm bank or {{fertility}} clinic, {{a special}} room or cabin may {{be set aside}} so that semen may be produced by male masturbation for use in fertility treatments such as artificial insemination. Most semen used for <b>sperm</b> <b>donation,</b> and all semen donated through a sperm bank by sperm donors, is produced in this way. The facility at a sperm bank [...] {{used for this purpose}} is known as a masturbatorium (US) or men's production room (UK). A bed or couch is usually provided for the man, and pornographic films or other material may be made available.|$|E

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that egg and <b>sperm</b> <b>donations</b> {{account for more than}} 60, 000 births every year in the United States. However, surprisingly, and despite common misconceptions, there are no federal requirements and barely any state requirements to screen and test sperm and egg donors for genetic diseases. The only nationwide standards for genetic screening and testing of donated reproductive tissue are guidelines created by professional organizations, but compliance with those guidelines is voluntary so they cannot be enforced effectively. Furthermore, the few reported cases involving children born from genetically-compromised reproductive tissue illustrate the court system’s failure to afford such children and their families the relief they need and deserve. With a continuing {{rise in the number of}} babies born each year who are conceived with donated reproductive tissue, it is necessary to create a regulatory framework requiring the screening and testing of reproductive tissue donors for genetic diseases. This article makes the case for federal regulation of the genetic aspects of donated reproductive tissue under the authority granted to the FDA by the Public Health Service Act...|$|R
2500|$|Most {{allogeneic}} blood donors donate {{as an act}} {{of charity}} and do not expect to receive any direct benefit from the donation. The sociologist Richard Titmuss, in his 1970 book The Gift Relationship: From Human Blood to Social Policy, compared the merits of the commercial and non-commercial blood donation systems of the US and the UK, coming down in favor of the latter. The book became a bestseller in the US, resulting in legislation to regulate the private market in blood. The book is still referenced in modern debates about turning blood into a commodity. [...] The book was republished in 1997 and the same ideas and principles are applied to analogous donation programs, such as organ donation and <b>sperm</b> <b>donation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jewish thinkers hold a {{broad range}} of {{positions}} on <b>sperm</b> <b>donation.</b> Some Jewish communities are totally against <b>sperm</b> <b>donation</b> from donors that are not the husbands of the recipient, while others have approved the use of donor insemination in some form, while liberal communities accept it entirely.|$|E

30|$|To {{compare the}} use of each {{framework}} across these issues, {{it was found that}} use of the utilitarian framework was most prominent in the GM issue, with over 90 % of the teachers considering this framework while deciding whether to accept or reject the applications of the GM technique for serving different purposes. The use of the rights and duties framework can be found more easily in the GT context. As evident in the data, 35 % of the teachers viewed the GT issue regarding this framework, providing justifications such as “human rights” or “natural law.” However, such use rarely occurred in the GM or ART contexts. For the autonomy framework, 10 %, 6 % and 7 % of the teachers adopted this framework in their considerations of GM, GT, and ART, respectively. For instance, teacher T 44 addressed the need to respect the choice for having ART. Teacher T 22 rejected {{the use of}} GT by arguing that such use may disrespect the autonomy of subsequent generations. Last, for the framework of virtue-based ethics, there was an apparent difference in the use of this framework between the ART context and the GM or GT contexts. Thirty-three percent of the teachers used the framework of virtue-based ethics, particularly Chinese traditional ethics, as a basis for opposing egg or <b>sperm</b> <b>donations.</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{offers a}} new {{paradigm}} to examine the legal regulation of reproductive technologies. The main argument is that a cure paradigm has shaped historical and current legal baby-making markets. Namely, reproductive technologies that have historically been understood as a cure for infertility (such as <b>sperm</b> <b>donations</b> and egg donations) have developed into market commodities, while others (such as full surrogacy) which have not been understood as a cure, have not. The article examines and critiques the cure paradigm. Specifically, the article challenges one current manifestation of the cure paradigm: the legal distinction between 2 ̆ 7 full surrogacy 2 ̆ 2 (where a surrogate is impregnated using her own ova) and 2 ̆ 2 gestational surrogacy 2 ̆ 2 (where an embryo is created in vitro and then transferred into the surrogate 2 ̆ 7 s uterus). Gestational surrogacy has been established by many state courts and legislatures as a legitimate means of curing female infertility, while full surrogacy has generally been either prohibited or deemed unenforceable. This distinction is problematized in this article {{not only because it}} is based on contestable values, but also because it has produced serious market failures that have effectively excluded many potential participants from entering baby-making markets. Thus, the article argues {{that it is time to}} reevaluate the cure paradigm...|$|R

50|$|Desperate to have {{children}} but with no stable partner in her life, Shortland Street clinic's head of nursing Carrie Burton (Lisa Crittenden) accepted <b>sperm</b> <b>donations</b> from nurse Steve Mills (Andrew Binns), Guy Warner (Craig Parker), Dr. Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) and Dr. Chris Warner (Michael Galvin); refusing to disclose whose sperm she used. She fell pregnant and married Steve's father Declan Kennedy (Kevin J. Wilson). Carrie gave birth to triplets during good friend Meredith Fleming's (Stephanie Wilkin) leaving party and named them, Finbar, Frank, and Sarah. Declan {{proved to be a}} useless father and ended up fleeing the country to escape criminal associates he had, leaving Steve to be a surrogate parent. It turned out Sarah had a hole in her heart and came close to death during surgery. Carrie decided to flee Ferndale after receiving threats from Declan's criminal past, taking her triplets with her and leaving Steve (who had decided the children were likely his) heart broken. Several months later Steve was devastated to realise Chris had discovered he was the father and had been visiting Carrie and the triplets in Australia. This caused a rivalry between the two that ultimately led to Steve driving off the road and dying in an explosion. In November 1995 Chris visited Carrie and the triplets so that he could introduce his father Bruce (Ken Blackburn) to them before he succumbed to terminal cancer.|$|R
