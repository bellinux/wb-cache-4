5|$|In {{addition}} to the parody of King Leopold II, Méliès's scenario for the film features another topical element: the scene with the tar wagon {{is based on the}} experiments of Ernest Guglielminetti, who spread tar over a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravel road to Monaco. This experiment, widely reported by the press, successfully eliminated the dust clouds kicked up by cars on gravel and sand roads.|$|E
5|$|Welles {{later said}} that casting {{character}} actor Gino Corrado in the <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waiter at the El Rancho broke his heart. Corrado {{had appeared in}} many Hollywood films, often as a waiter, and Welles wanted all of the actors to be new to films.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, {{at a party}} meeting, {{it was decided that}} {{administrative}} actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since only a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues. Control over Literární noviny and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.|$|E

5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud is only a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|During {{his watch}} one night while the crew were camped on the ice, a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice floe broke away {{and he was}} only rescued due to the quick {{intervention}} of {{the men of the}} next watch who threw him a line allowing him to jump back to safety. Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.|$|E
5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which only a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately {{from the rest of}} the troop.|$|E

5|$|Econometric {{analysis}} of DSGE models suggested that real factors sometimes affect the economy. A paper by Frank Smets and Rafael Woulters (2007) stated that monetary policy explained only a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluctuations in economic output. In new synthesis models, shocks can affect both demand and supply. The new synthesis implies that monetary policy {{can have a}} stabilizing effect on the economy, contrary to new classical theory.|$|E
5|$|Effective {{with the}} 100th Congress in 1987, {{adjustments}} {{were made by}} the legislature to the boundaries. A <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Montgomery County territory was detached, as were parts of Fayette County in Washington Court House in Union Township and the townships of Jasper and Marion. Part of Brown County was added, Jackson and Eagle Townships. These were the boundaries for the rest of McEwen's service in Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1854 the Barton, Eccles, Winton and Monton Local Board of Health was {{established}} for {{the northern part of}} the township of Barton. Eccles was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1892, part of which was in Barton poor law union, an inter-parish unit established to provide social security, and in 1933 this was expanded to include most of Barton Moss civil parish, and part of Worsley Urban District. A <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borough was transferred in 1961 to the County Borough of Salford. In 1974 the borough was abolished and its area transferred to Greater Manchester to form part of the City of Salford.|$|E

5|$|Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR): A single Saturn V could {{launch a}} {{spacecraft}} that {{was composed of}} a mother ship which would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a smaller, two-stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface, return to dock with the mother ship, and then be discarded. Landing only a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft on the Moon and returning an even smaller part to lunar orbit minimized the total mass to be launched from the Earth.|$|E

Tioga State Forest and Elk State Forest also occupy a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed, on the northeastern and edges, respectively.|$|E
5|$|RAF Uxbridge {{closed on}} 31 March 2010 {{as part of}} a {{reduction}} in the number of Ministry of Defence properties in the Greater London area. Many of its remaining military units were relocated to nearby RAF Northolt the following day. Plans for redevelopment, consisting of a mixture of new residential and commercial properties and the retention of all listed buildings, were approved in January 2011. A <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station incorporating the Battle of Britain Bunker retains the RAF Uxbridge name and is owned by Hillingdon Council.|$|E

5|$|Selenium occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E
5|$|The Lower Earley development, {{built in}} 1977, {{was one of}} the largest private housing {{developments}} in Europe. It extended the urban area of Reading as far as the M4 motorway, which acts as the southern boundary of the town. Further housing developments have increased the number of modern houses and hypermarkets in the outskirts of Reading. A major town-centre shopping centre, The Oracle, opened in 1999, is named after the 17th century Oracle workhouse, which once occupied a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site. It provides three storeys of shopping space and boosted the local economy by providing 4,000 jobs.|$|E
5|$|The RMNDH {{was only}} a <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{armed forces of the}} NDH, largely due to {{restrictions}} imposed by Italy. To avoid these restrictions, the Germans raised the Croatian Naval Legion which fought as part of the German Navy in the Black Sea campaign between 1941 and 1944. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Germans transferred several captured Italian vessels to the RMNDH, although all of the significant ones had been lost by December 1944 when the remaining personnel were assigned to duties ashore to circumvent their defection to the Yugoslav Partisans. The RMNDH was disbanded in May 1945 with the collapse and defeat of the NDH.|$|E

5|$|The major {{applications}} of copper are electrical wire (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%), and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is used mostly as a pure metal, but when greater hardness is required, it {{is put into}} such alloys as brass and bronze (5% of total use). For more than two centuries, copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish. A <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Machining of copper is possible, although alloys are preferred for good machinability in creating intricate parts.|$|E

Oryzomyini is one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily Sigmodontinae, which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America. Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily of the family Cricetidae, other members of which include voles, lemmings, hamsters, and deermice, all mainly from Eurasia and North America.|$|E
