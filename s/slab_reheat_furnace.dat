40|$|Steel {{reheating}} is an energy-intensive process requiring uniform {{temperature distribution}} within reheating furnaces. Historically, recuperators have ben used to preheat combustion air, thereby conserving energy. More recent innovations include oxygen enrichment {{and the use}} of regenerative burners, which provide higher preheat air temperatures than recuperators. These processes have limitations such as equipment deterioration, decreasing energy efficiency over time, high maintenance costs, and increased NO{sub x} emissions with increased air preheat temperature, unless special equipment is used. Praxair, Inc., supplier of oxygen and other industrial gases to the steel industry, proposes to introduce an innovative oxy-fuel burner technology (using 100 % oxygen) to the steel reheating industry. Oxy-fuel combustion reduces or eliminates nitrogen in combustion air and substantially reduces waste heat carried out with flue gas. Based on technology currently used in the glass, hazardous waste, and aluminum industries, Praxair has developed and patented low temperature, oxy-fuel burners {{that can be used in}} high temperature industrial furnaces where temperature uniformity is critical and extremely low NO{sub x} emissions are desired. The technical goal of the project is to demonstrate the use of oxy-fuel burners in a <b>slab</b> <b>reheat</b> <b>furnace</b> while reducing energy consumption by 45 % and NO{sub x} emissions by 90 % within the converted furnace zones. Successful implementation of this technology also will eliminate the need to periodically replace recuperators and install NO{sub x} removal equipment...|$|E
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} {{can be used}} as a useful design tool for studying new furnace configurations with different operating conditions. However, this potential cannot be realized until the numerical models that are used in the simulations are fully validated against experimental results. In the present work, the combustion process in an experimental regenerative, <b>slab</b> <b>reheat</b> <b>furnace</b> was simulated in order to validate several numerical models in the FLUENT code. A total of 14 cases employing different numerical models were simulated with a uniform fuel distribution. Out of the 14 cases, only 11 obtained a converged solution. The results from these 11 cases were compared against experimental measurements in terms of the energy input and output rates and the temperature distribution in the center of the slab. The three best cases in terms of both accuracy and computational effort were cases that employed the k-epsilon turbulence model, the Delta Thesis, and a constant absorption coefficient. These three cases were simulated again using a second set of operating conditions in order to evaluate their performance in the case of a non-uniform fuel distribution. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Key words: <b>slab</b> optimal heating, <b>reheating</b> <b>furnace,</b> {{hot strip}} mill, energy {{consumption}} and management, {{iron and steel}} industry. Optimal heating for <b>slabs</b> in a <b>reheating</b> <b>furnace</b> is investi-gated numerically to aid in managing energy consumption of the <b>reheating</b> <b>furnace</b> in a hot strip mill, where an arctangent function is applied as the heating curve. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the relationship among the temperature uniformity, discharging target temperature and retention time of the slabs. The results indicate that the temperature difference between the slab surface and the core increases rapidly in the initial period and the maximum value of the temperature difference is close to the inflection point of the heating curve. After that, the internal temperature tends to be uniform. For a given retention time of slabs, it is difficult to simultaneously reach the requirements of discharging target temperature and desired temperature uniformity. A method to evaluate the optimal heating time is thus developed, using the Newton scheme. Some correlations linking the desired temperature uniformity and optimal heating time are established. They suggest that heating thinner <b>slabs</b> in the <b>reheating</b> <b>furnace</b> can facilitate employing energy more efficiently in contrast to heating thicker slabs. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{cooperative}} effort was to evaluate the potential of Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys, such as IC 221 M and IC 396 M, for use as transfer rolls in heating treating <b>furnaces</b> and <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> <b>furnaces</b> used during the normal hot processing of steel ingots into rolled products. Rolls consist of three parts: the center tube section which forms the roll surface {{in direct contact with}} the steel, and the sections welded {{at each end of the}} tube, called trunnions, which bear the load. The work in this CRADA focused on weldments and base materials. The transfer rolls in the furnaces used in the hot processing of steel have been made, almost exclusively, from iron-chromium-nickel heat resistant alloys for over 35 years. The iron-based heat resistant alloys experience a variety of problems when exposed to temperatures above 760 C including: cracking, dimensional instability, and excessive oxidation. Many defects in rolled steel products can be traced directly to rolls used in the processing. Also the demand for higher quality products, spurred in part by competition from foreign producers, requires that various avenues for improving overall quality of rolled steel products be pursued. Initial work done by the Contractor and Metallamics indicated that Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys may perform better than existing iron-chromium-nickel alloys do as transfer rolls in heat treating furnaces. The use of Ni{sub 3 }Al may lead to rolls with longer operational life, improved high temperature oxidation resistance and mechanical properties, higher quality rolled steel products, and improved energy and operational efficiencies in the hot processing of steel. The goal of the work was to test Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys for the transfer roll application in order to improve process efficiency, minimize waste by virtue of producing rolled steel of higher quality and to enhance the competitiveness of US-based steel producers...|$|R

40|$|Current European {{industrial}} furnaces (steel industry, metallurgy, ceramic, glass, forging, heat treatments, …) massively use {{natural gas}} as fuel. In {{order to save}} energy, most furnaces include an energy recuperation system on the exhaust gases to preheat the combustion air to temperatures up to 1000 °C (in case of regenerative burners). Enriching combustion air with oxygen also leads to not only a reduction of combustion products volume but also to energy savings. Unfortunately, this is generally achieved while NOx emissions are raised due to a higher flame temperature, and sometimes hot spots appear in furnaces, which can be harmful to the load. Conventional regenerative burners have the same pros and cons as the oxygen enriching air technique. For {{more than ten years}} now, important studies have been realized in Japan, Germany, and USA to develop new types of burners operating with high temperature combustion air (over 1000 °C) while not only reducing NOx emissions, but also increasing furnaces temperature uniformity (by suppressing hot spots).

Hot rolling of steel is an energy-intensive process, especially in respect of preheating the steel slabs. The present work was carried out {{with the aim of}} reducing the initial slab temperature {{while at the same time}} improving properties by optimization of the steel composition and process parameters. Optimization of <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> and hot rolling parameters in connection with plate and strip rolling was carried out on low C-Mn high-strength steels microalloyed with Mo-Ti-Nb-B, both in laboratory and full scales processing. The effects of a low <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> temperature, high finish rolling temperature (FRT) during thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) and accelerated cooling rates following hot rolling to RT or to the coiling temperature have been investigated. Improvement of yield strength of the plate has been obtained by lowering the <b>slab</b> <b>reheating</b> temperature, especially with high cooling rates (> 20 °C/s) to room temperature. The results obtained for strip steels also show that a reduced reheating temperature combined with high finish rolling temperatures and cooling rates (> 20 °C/s) to a coiling temperature of 450 °C produces very positive microstructures and mechanical properties in the present steels.
