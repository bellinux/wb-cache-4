40|$|Abstract-Gear teeth failure due to fatigue is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} observed. Even a slight reduction in the root tensile stress results in great increase in the fatigue life of a gear. If gear fails in tensile fatigue, the results are catastrophic and occur {{with little or no}} warnings. Therefore for all the reasons mentioned above, this work is of more practical importance. For many years, gear design has been improved by using improved material, hardening surfaces with heat treatment and carburization, and shot penning to improve surface finish etc. Few more efforts have been made to improve the durability and strength by altering the pressure angle, using the asymmetric teeth, altering the geometry of root fillet curve and so on. Most of the above methods do not guarantees the interchangeability of the existing gear systems. This work presents the possibilities of using the stress redistribution techniques by introducing the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> features in the stressed zone to the advantage of reduction of root fillet stress in spur gear. This also ensures interchangeability of existing gear systems. In this work, combination of circular and elliptical <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> features are used and better results are obtained than using circular <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> features alone which are used by earlier researchers. A finite element model with a segment of three teeth is considered for analysis and <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> features of various sizes are introduced on gear teeth at various locations.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} an investigation which was undertaken to reveal the similarities and differences in the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics of three Ni-Hard I alloys. One alloy (B 1) is ASTM A 532 class IA Ni-Hard containing 4. 2 wt. pct. Ni. The second alloy (B 2) is similar to B 1 but higher in Cr, Si, and Mo. The third alloy (T 1) also falls in the same ASTM specification, but it contains 3. 3 wt. pct. Ni. The alloys were evaluated in both as-cast and stress-relieved conditions except for B 2, which was evaluated in the stress-relieved condition only. While the matrix of the high Ni alloys is composed of austenite and martensite in both conditions, the matrix of the low Ni alloy consists of a considerable amount of bainite, in addition to the martensite and the retained austenite in as cast condition, and primarily bainite, with some retained austenite, in the <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> condition. It was found that the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> treatment does not change the tensile strength of the high Ni alloy. Both the as cast and <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> high Ni alloys had a tensile strength of about 350 MPa.
