Some of the birds are silent, some are shrieking and some are in shock and lost” <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist.</b> “Many Armenians who managed to survive were separated from their families. It changed the country forever and millions lost their lives.” ...|$|E
5000|$|During the {{restoration}} 25 new angels statues {{had been created}} by sculptor Ton Mooy, including the one with a modern twist. The last angel in the series holds a mobile phone and also wears jeans. [...] "The phone has just one button, <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist.</b> - It dials directly to God". The mobile-using angel had to be first approved by the cathedral's fathers, who rejected earlier designs with the jet engines on the angel's back.|$|E

I would <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> I find most interesting today is the South African William Kentridge, for the scope of his work, using so many different disciplines, and the way his work connects to social concerns, as well as its quality and innovative nature.” ...|$|R

5000|$|For Bawa, {{drawing is}} his first love. [...] "I enjoy doing it, for it isn't {{decorative}} and loud. One can use minimum essentials to extract the maximum effect," [...] <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist.</b> [...] "I was inspired to return to drawing after seeing Michelangelo's sketches and drawings at an exhibition in Amsterdam, where I had gone for one of my shows. The idea stuck in my mind. I don't work on demand, but follow my heart and mind, for I feel everything has a time and a place." ...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{not mere}} {{repetition}} of reality such as photos. Painted objects have a something more, like a [...] "soul", suggests Boatto. [...] "The technique {{needed to achieve}} hyper-realistic effect - <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> - {{is the use of}} airbrush ...”. And by the repeated spraying emerge, little by little, details, transparency, and the chrome effect, and that original [...] "nuanced" [...] which is essential to give the illusion of objects in the background, blurred to the subject.A technique which is not easy, practiced by few.|$|E
5000|$|Artist Warren (Henry Jaglom), who designs the {{psychedelic}} posters {{advertising the}} band, freaks out badly in his gallery, apparently on STP. He sees everyone, including himself, as walking dead {{and tries to}} cut off his own (to him festering) hand with a circular saw. While they help him, Jenny notices a large sculpture resembling abstract flames {{in a corner and}} recognizes it as her brother's work. The gallery owner <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> is known as [...] "The Seeker", an itinerant preacher. Ex-band member Dave (Dean Stockwell) may know The Seeker's current whereabouts.|$|E

His remixes can be recognized by the intro where he <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist's</b> name following [...] "you know I had to do this, right? It's the Russ Castella remix." [...] Russ has also scored a full length soundtrack for the movie titled Swamp Zombies in 2006 which starred porn star Jasmin St. Claire.|$|R

60|$|Strange to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> indomitable <b>artist</b> {{had held}} on tight to his sketch-book, {{possibly}} {{because it was}} almost as dear to him as life, but more probably because of that feeling which induces a drowning man to clutch at a straw.|$|R
50|$|Plastino {{also worked}} on Sunday episodes of Nancy from 1982 to 1983 after Ernie Bushmiller died. Plastino's {{official}} website <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> {{was commissioned by}} the United Media newspaper syndicate to ghost Peanuts when Charles Schulz underwent heart surgery in 1983, but David Michaelis, author of Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography, revealed that syndicate president William C. Payette had hired Plastino to draw a backlog of Peanuts strips during contract negotiations with Schulz in the 1970s. When Schulz and the syndicate reached a successful agreement, United Media stored these unpublished strips, the existence of which eventually became public.|$|E
5000|$|... "I came to (Venice Beach) in ’59 {{right out}} of art school because it was cheap", <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> born in Chicago in 1939. He {{followed}} friends like Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Ken Price, and Craig Kauffman to the beach. [...] "He {{was the first and}} youngest person to crash the art scene of that era", says Edward Ruscha. The two met in the late 1950s at the Chouinard Art Institute (now part of CalArts), where Bell went from 1957-1959 with the intention of becoming a Disney animator. [...] He found representation at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, together with Edward Ruscha, Ed Moses, Billy Al Bengston.|$|E
5000|$|Swift co-wrote [...] "Bad Blood" [...] {{about an}} {{undisclosed}} female musician. Swift <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> attempted to sabotage {{one of her}} concert tours by hiring people who worked for her. Publications such as Billboard, Rolling Stone, Time, and The Washington Post have speculated that Katy Perry {{is the subject of}} the song. Daniel D'Addario for Time and Emily Yahr for The Washington Post noted parallels between [...] "Bad Blood"'s lyric [...] "If you live like that, you live with ghosts" [...] and [...] "Ghost", a song from Perry's 2013 album Prism. The album version of the song only contains Swift as the vocalist on verses, while the single version features a re-worked instrumental and guest vocals from rapper Kendrick Lamar on verses.|$|E

50|$|Kitaj {{married his}} first wife, Elsi Roessler, in 1953; {{they had a}} son, screenwriter Lem Dobbs, and adopted a daughter, Dominie. His first wife {{committed}} suicide in 1969. After living together for 12 years, he married Sandra Fisher in December 1983; they had one son, Max. Sandra Fisher died in 1994, at age 47, from hyperacute haemorrhagic leuco-encephalitis (not an aneurysm, as is commonly written). Kitaj had a mild heart attack in 1990. He died in Los Angeles in October 2007, eight days before his 75th birthday. Seven weeks after Kitaj's death, the Los Angeles County coroner ruled {{that the cause of}} death was suicide by suffocation, <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> placed a plastic bag over his head.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Laighton <b>says</b> that <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> who adorned Trinity Church in New York with {{sculpture}} {{wanted some}} real wings {{from which to}} imitate the wings of cherubim.

5000|$|On the South Pier, at the Port of Catania, is {{recovered}} aground {{the first}} boat that in 2013 carried migrants from Africa to {{the coasts of}} Catania. Among them, six children Egyptians, exhausted for the trip on that vessel, were tragically drowned {{trying to reach the}} seashore, a few meters far from the Lido Beach Green (Lido Verde). The artist chose to merge his body with the wreck and the history of which he is a silent witness for his first shot of the MIGRANTS project, dated 2015, supported by Boxart gallery. The scenario of the tragedy evoked by the first work, the Lido Verde, provides the second background to the Liu Bolin's photographic project. [...] "Being immigrants lying on the sand," [...] <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> [...] "for someone they may seem dead; instead my intent is to describe their arrival and the start of their future." ...|$|E
5000|$|Revolú*tion is a {{site-specific}} text-based {{work on the}} façade of {{a chapel}} in San Juan, commissioned for the 3rd Poly/Graphic Triennial. It is solely composed of found text arbitrarily selected from Internet sites that cover the wall in what MacQueen refers to as “a turbulence of conflicting verbal conditions.” Cullen finds language to be “a critical element in her works, that shifts easily between Spanish and English, and incorporates counterpoints that range from diaristic, poetic snippets to snatches from advertising, signage, or the news.” The context of her work, writes MacQueen, “is the human psyche, disparate and unknowable, yet manifest in the actions we undertake.” Whether through visual or textual signs, throughout her work, there is a consistent emphasis on the relation between perception and the technological environment {{and its impact on}} human relations. “I’m neither critiquing technology nor supporting it,” <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> “rather, exploring the contemporary reality it has produced.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite his aviophobia, {{the artist}} has adopted a nomadic lifestyle. “Movement creates {{opportunities}} for [...] and mutation”, <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> who {{is always on the}} move and {{spends much of his time}} abroad. He is constantly trying to connect his projects to different realities planet wide, finding balances between art, science and the world. Vanmechelen: “I am trying to connect people and ideas, finding the right intersection of space and time to hatch the egg in the infinite collision of beautiful ‘accidents’ created by perpetual movement.” Hence Vanmechelen’s fascination for biological and cultural diversity, or biocultural diversity. Among the streams that facilitate the ebb and flow of endless motion, migrating people and other animals, he looks for the genes and memes that have always been gathering. Some of these he takes home. In his home base in Meeuwen-Gruitrode, he has collected scores of bird and other animals - and keeps more than one thousand chickens: Gallus Gallus, the 17 breeds of Mechelse hybrids and other species. In total, Vanmechelen has 3,000 chickens on eight farms on three continents.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{positive}} review, NME complimented the duo of Damon Albarn and André 3000. Writer Priya Elan stated [...] "Murphy makes a brilliant backstage star, but {{the song is}} all about the Damon and Andre moment." [...] Beats Per Minute named the track the best one so far of <b>the</b> [...] "Three <b>Artists.</b> One Song." [...] project, calling it [...] "a potent reminder of the power of collaborative music." [...] They gave the track 9 out of 10, <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> [...] "play off of each other remarkably well." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that the track was [...] "one of the best collaborations we've heard in a while," [...] saying it [...] "merges three genre pools, but still highlights the traits distinctive to each musician." ...|$|R
50|$|The two {{remaining}} acts would battle each other, choosing a music year, for example, 1972. They {{were treated to}} five music videos by a vortex video wall, both <b>the</b> song and <b>artist</b> would have to identified. The winner of the most money would go through to play Musical Families, the jackpot. In the earlier series the video wall displayed names of <b>artists,</b> and <b>the</b> team had to pick the one they knew about the most. Blur were one of a very few that were never chosen. In the last few series, the team chosen before the show started the year they thought they knew the most about, with various videos playing.

50|$|When My Ship Comes In, {{the artwork}} {{found at the}} Milnerton MyCiTi station, plays on the ideas of luck and superstition. The graphic design is meant to depicts the number of lotto {{winnings}} relative {{to the number of}} ships coming in to Cape Town harbour. The idea comes from <b>the</b> English <b>saying.</b> <b>The</b> <b>artists</b> thought a topic related to gambling would be appropriate because of the bus station's close location to the old Milnerton racecourse. The graph shows a wave-like pattern, representing ships entering the harbour, that collides with bright yellow circles, that vary in size to show the number of lottery wins. The data covers monthly lotto wins and ships entering the harbour from 2007 to 2010. The data was taken from the National Lottery and Transnet.|$|R
50|$|Femininity on a Plate (Breast Stupa Cookery - 2005) An {{adverse effect}} of Pinaree Sanpitak’s {{signature}} work provokes hallucinating objects like boobs, whether fried eggs, bowls, lampshades etc. Sanpitak expresses her thoughts and experiences through breasts taking into culinary art. “It’s my lifetime project,” <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> who has collaborated with cooks and chefs from many countries {{to express the}} symbol of femininity on the plate. Sanpitak worked with professional and amateur chefs to create meals using specially designed breast stupa- shaped cooking molds made in glass aluminum and glazed stoneware. The artist and her collaborator-chefs have hosted many of these events, presenting their five-course nourishing nipple- meals to audiences in Thailand, Japan, China, Spain, France, and the United States. “The inspiration came when I gave birth to my son. I used the breast shape, which is a beautiful form, to represent myself and also to symbolize not only motherhood but also femininity, and womanhood. There is a deeper meaning because {{when you look at}} mothers breast- feeding their child, it’s about both giving and receiving”. The recipes and cooking process are documented and compiled as videos and cookbooks. In August 2005, the first official Breast Stupa Cookery event took pace at the Jim Thompson House, which involved four chefs in preparing a buffet banquet for 200 guests. Over four years, Breast Stupa Cookery events has been organized over the world. The Breast Stupa culinary experience changes people’s perceptions and make them look beyond what they see on the plate.|$|E
5000|$|... "I Wish You Would" [...] {{is another}} song that Swift wrote with Antonoff. Like [...] "Out of the Woods", {{the song was}} written to a track Antonoff sampled and lyrically {{describes}} a boy who [...] "drives past an ex-girlfriend's house and he thinks she hates him but she's {{still in love with}} him." [...] The electropop song [...] "Bad Blood" [...] was written about an unnamed female musical artist; Swift <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> attempted to sabotage one of her concert tours by hiring people who worked for her. [...] "Wildest Dreams" [...] is the ninth song in the album. The song features a recording of Swift's own heartbeat which serves as the beat of the song. [...] "How You Get the Girl" [...] was described by Swift as an [...] "instruction manual for men". She told Us Weekly, [...] "It's written for a guy who has broken up with his girlfriend, then wants her back after six months," [...] and added, [...] "but it's not going to be as simple as sending a text like, 'Sup? Miss you.'" [...] "This Love" [...] was originally a poem Swift wrote in late 2013 which evolved into the song. [...] "I Know Places" [...] features imagery of foxes representing Swift and her lover being pursued by [...] "hunters", the media. Swift has once said her spirit animal is a fox for the same reason. [...] "Clean" [...] describes Swift ridding herself of a metaphorical addiction; it is interpreted as the singer casting off relationships in favor of self-enlightenment.|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of a site-specific work made by Mimmo Paladino for the piazza Santa Croce in Florence in 2012 stands as an important testimony to a possible relationship between urban space and sacred symbols. The installation, commissioned by the International Biennal of Cultural and Landscape Heritage of Florence, is a monumental work: a giant cross made by arranging huge blocks of marble {{in front of the}} magnificent Franciscan cathedral of Florence. With this urban installation Mimmo Paladino faces once again the limit and the possibility of communication through symbols and images in contemporary art, exploring the vitality of figurative archetypes, including Christian ones. “The stones” - <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> - “come from Carrara as they were dug out. Some will carry engravings and signs, others will become a sort of base for three metal sculptures: acircle and a star, that is two of the mazzocchi studied by Paolo Uccello, and an anthropomorphic stele that arises in dialogue with the statue of Dante. The passer-by cannot take in with a glance the form in its entirety: to discover it he will have to approach it and pass through it”. It’s an archaic work that changes the perception of the square: it suggests and requires new perspectives, it balances the space inviting the viewer to take action and to experience a new urban place, recreating a Renaissance cantiere. The symbol of the cross, in the artist’s poetic vision, is an ancient sign with an “orthodox” meaning. It’s the cross of Jesus, it’s an ancient and modern sign that rewrites and generates a new public space, like a square: a place of civil life...|$|E

50|$|Thanjavur has {{a unique}} place {{in the history of}} Indian painting, in that it houses the 11th century Chola wall {{paintings}} in the Brihadeeswarar temple (Periya koyil or Pervudaiyar koyil in Tamil) as also paintings from the Nayak period (many times superimposed on the earlier Chola paintings) dating to the 16th century. The fall of the Vijayanagar Empire and the sack of Hampi in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 CE resulted in the migration of painters who had been dependent on the patronage of the empire. Some of them migrated to Thanjavur and worked under the patronage of the Thanjavur Nayakas. Subsequently, the Maratha rulers who defeated the Thanjavur Nayakas began to nurture the Thanjavur atelier. Needless to <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> absorbed <b>the</b> local influences and the individual tastes of their Maratha patrons which helped evolve the unique Thanjavur style of painting. <b>The</b> Thanjavur <b>artists</b> in addition to decorating temples also began painting and decorating the major buildings, palaces, chatrams and residences of the Maratha kings and nobility.|$|R
40|$|Artists making books {{often use}} {{photography}} {{as a means}} of recording a narrative of places or their travels, but what if they are documenting something that isn’t actually there at all? A few examples of the artists who inspired me to do the talk are: Scott McCarney (USA) publishes many books in his biography / autobiography series. As we get older, the more we forget, and for McCarney, the more things he accumulates in recompense. His 2007 edition Photographs, is an empty book, a reproduction of an early 20 th Century photography album with text annotations and photo corners with the pictures removed. Dedicated to anyone’s lost family histories. Kurt Johannessen (Norway) photographed flying rocks for his book flygande steinar. Frans Baake (The Netherlands) travels to islands around the world, to gather photographs for his books. But he cannot always access the land, some are private islands, some impossible to reach, so, in 2004 he produced Never Been There, a collection of islands photographed from nearby or from a distance. As he <b>says,</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> has been to the specific regions in order to say that he hasn’t been there: Wow, how many places he didn’t visit!' In my own Flowers in Hotel Rooms series, these small photographic books document my actions in tribute to characters in novels I am reading, but these aren’t real events. They involve an impromptu stage set and camera, depending on what I am reading and what I can find to quickly produce a postcard-sized image in a hotel room. Dinner and a Rose was a collaboration with the poet Nancy Campbell, in tribute to Patricia Highsmith's Ripley quartet. This included hosting a one-day dinner party for invited guests, at which the meals and drinks mentioned in the books were served. Ripley is neither seen or referred to in the book or the video. TOAST: A Night on Weevil Lake, a collaborative book and video produced on World Book Night, Saturday 5 th March 2011. A tribute to Douglas Coupland's novel The Gum Thief, which consisted of an evening of nothing being cooked, no hosting and Chinese food having to be ordered in and eaten off of paper plates from Staples. And finally, No Dutch Details, Tom Sowden and Sarah Bodman, January 2011. A video-book tribute to Ed Ruscha’s Dutch Details produced whilst travelling. Produced on an intercity train from Amsterdam Schiphol to Enschede, The Netherlands between 19. 47 and 20. 00 on Sunday 16 th January 2011. The film recreates the zoom-in image format of Ruscha’s Dutch Details, as a chronological tribute to of all his books published between 1963 and 1978, but using only props found or created in miniature that could be photographed on the train. The film, of course fails to produce a faithful reproduction of any of Ruscha’s books, as the end titles indicate...|$|E

40|$|For {{all of the}} caution {{they have}} urged towards his self-portraits, critics have long taken William Robinson at face value. By this we mean they have {{followed}} Robinson 2 ̆ 7 s presentation {{of himself as a}} kind of artistic outsider and accepted his own explanation of the work, despite clear evidence to the contrary. There is undoubtedly a lot to make us believe that Robinson 2 ̆ 7 s work {{is the result of a}} simple engagement with the Australian bush, filtered perhaps through a source as unfashionable as Pierre Bannard, but this is to make it less not more interesting as art. This understanding is also to lose sight of the challenge Robinson poses to current constructions of Australian art history, within which he can be safely acknowledged as an 2 ̆ 7 old master 2 ̆ 7 of little relevance to the present, or as a conservative protest against recent developments. However, the most productive thing to do today would be to grasp Robinson not as apart from, but as part of, contemporary Australian art.

In so doing, we would grasp Tillers through Robinson as an unconscious landscape artist, and Robinson through Tillers as an unexpected conceptualist...|$|R
