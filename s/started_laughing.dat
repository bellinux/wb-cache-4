25|$|During the performance, Henriette {{received}} such enthusiasm {{from the}} public that her anger vanished, but {{when they reached the}} part of the play at which Susanna was to slap Figaro seven times, she did so with such enthusiasm that the audience <b>started</b> <b>laughing.</b>|$|E
500|$|Destiny Jones was in {{the studio}} when they were {{recording}} [...] "Daughters". [...] "We were in a big studio so Destiny was doing other things", Nas later told Vibe. [...] "She {{walked into the room}} where I was recording it and heard a few words and said, ‘What’s going on?’ The whole room just <b>started</b> <b>laughing</b> and she kind of smiled and walked backwards out of the room. She didn’t know what it was about and she didn’t want to listen to it, but later on she heard the song." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2007 state {{semifinal}} {{game played}} at the Orange Bowl, Robinson led his team to within two points of upsetting Miami Northwestern, the top-ranked high school team in the country. While warming up, Robinson noticed that a Miami Northwestern lineman had taped a photograph of Robinson onto {{the front of his}} helmet. Robinson <b>started</b> <b>laughing</b> and told the player, [...] "You think that scares us?" [...] Robinson had Deerfield ahead in the game, 12–7, but Miami Northwestern completed a 99-yard touchdown drive with 18 seconds left to give them a 14–12 win.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Ivan Malinin {{performed}} the autopsy at the Tyree Funeral House. Malinin found hemorrhages {{in the heart}} and neck and pronounced {{the cause of death}} as [...] "insufficiency of the right ventricle of the heart". That evening, when the announcer at Canton announced Williams' death to the gathered crowd, they <b>started</b> <b>laughing,</b> thinking that it was just another excuse. After Hawkshaw Hawkins and other performers started singing [...] "I Saw the Light" [...] as a tribute to Williams, the crowd, now realizing that he was indeed dead, sang along. Dr. Malinin also wrote that Williams had been severely beaten and kicked in the groin recently. Also local magistrate Virgil F. Lyons ordered an inquest into Williams' death concerning the welt that was visible on his head.|$|E
500|$|While Hurley {{had been}} able to command Friday's respect, {{it soon became clear that}} Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager. Indeed, soon after moving to Cardiff, Friday {{appeared}} one day in Hurley's office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading. [...] "He still called me boss", Hurley recalled. [...] "I can't play for that little bastard", Friday told Hurley, referring to Andrews. [...] "You're the one who seems to be able to get me right. Can I come back to you?" [...] Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team, the club could not afford to repay the £28,000 transfer fee to Cardiff, so he would have to go back and continue playing there. Unhappy living so far from home, Friday began to travel back to London at weekends; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting, [...] "Tickets, please!", pretending to be the ticket inspector. When the occupant passed his ticket under the door to be checked, Friday would pick it up, walk off and use it for himself. Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head. A player standing near the forward <b>started</b> <b>laughing,</b> leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball. Friday viciously punched the laughing player in the jaw, striking him with such force that he wore a neck brace for two weeks afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Kesha's second studio album Warrior used {{considerably}} less autotune, although it still showed {{in a number}} of songs. The album's piano and guitar-driven ballads such as [...] "Love Into The Light", [...] "Wonderland" [...] and [...] "Past Lives" [...] display Kesha's vocal ability. Kesha also uses a trademark talky [...] "white-girl" [...] rapping style with exaggerated discordant phrasing and enunciation. Her vocal technique has led her to be credited as a rapper, a topic she disagreed with until fellow rappers André 3000, Wiz Khalifa, and Snoop Dogg endorsed her. On the subject, she said: [...] "The first time someone called me a rapper, I <b>started</b> <b>laughing.</b> I was shocked, and thought it was hilarious. It's crazy and funny to me." [...] The New York Times said Kesha [...] "threatens to become the most influential female rapper of the day, or at least the most popular. Pretending Kesha isn't a rapper is no longer feasible." [...] "Crazy Kids" [...] and [...] "C'Mon" [...] took greater shifts into [...] "party rap". Most of her lyrics chronicle her relationships and partying; the lighthearted subject matter of the latter and her unfiltered language saw many critics criticizing her for releasing frivolous and crass music. Jonah Weiner of Slate, however, stated that her jarring lyrics allowed her songs to become more memorable. In [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] and [...] "Boots & Boys", she objectifies men to poke fun at how male fronted rock bands and rappers can get away with objectifying women and not vice versa. The title track to her debut, [...] "Animal", is more aspirational and is intended to inspire people to embrace their individuality. Much more experimental than Animal, her second album, Warrior, contains dubstep elements and explores erotic experiences Kesha encountered with ghosts on the song [...] "Supernatural". Overall, Kesha said the theme of Warrior is magic.|$|E

500|$|During 2007 spring practice, Scott {{was third}} on the depth chart, but {{suffered}} a left knee injury, which forced him to miss most of camp. During the 2007 season, he played in nine games as a reserve tailback behind Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore and as a kickoff returner. Despite the team's abundance of running backs, Friedgen wanted to utilize Scott in some capacity because of his speed, which had been recorded at 4.25seconds in the 40-yard dash. Maryland wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, [...] "On paper it says I'm faster, but Da'Rel, he's just {{a different type of}} animal." [...] Against Wake Forest, he saw his first action when he returned four kickoffs for 101yards. Scott's special teams performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, [...] "I think I've got to try to get him involved within the offense. I think he's a guy that can make some plays for us." [...] The following week, unranked Maryland upset 10th-ranked Rutgers, and Scott made his first career appearance as a tailback. He had three carries for 29yards. After sitting out the Georgia Tech game because of an ankle injury, he returned four kicks for 68yards against Virginia, three for 56yards against Clemson, and two for 40yards against North Carolina. Against eighth-ranked Boston College, Scott caught a short screen pass from quarterback Chris Turner and ran 57yards for a touchdown. It was his first career reception and first career touchdown. It was one of just two offensive plays for Scott in that game, and incidentally, he was not intended to be in it. Friedgen said:"When he was in the game, I didn't even know he was in the game. I called a screen pass. I looked up, and it was Da'Rel in there. I figured we were just giving Lance a rest, but I asked [...] Zacharias about it Sunday and he <b>started</b> <b>laughing.</b> I said 'Did you put Da'Rel in for that screen pass?' He said, 'Lance's equipment was broken, so he had to go in the game.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Chang {{continued}} {{to suffer from}} cramps, but managed to take a 5–3 lead in the fifth set with two match points on Lendl's serve. Aiming to break Lendl's concentration one more time, Chang stood almost at the T-line in {{the centre of the}} court while waiting to receive Lendl's serve. The crowd <b>started</b> <b>laughing</b> at the bizarre situation and Lendl seemed to think everyone was mocking him. The tactic worked, as Lendl produced a double-fault to give Chang the victory, 4–6, 4–6, 6–3, 6–3, 6–3, in 4 hours and 37 minutes. Chang sank to his knees and broke down in tears {{at the conclusion of the}} match.|$|E
2500|$|... "That's a funny story. I {{was with}} this fella down in Alices Springs and I'd been {{playing by the}} river. We were walking back when we noticed this mob of blackfellas in a circle about a hundred yards to our right. They motioned me to play without speaking. I sat down and played {{a little bit and}} they <b>started</b> <b>laughing.</b> I'd always had this {{reservation}} about my first encounter with top dog players and I thought they were rubbishing me, but with traditional black people communication always happens very slowly and that's how it was. After a while I got to understand that they were pleased at seeing it being played by a whitefella with his own spirit. Aboriginal people say I play walla walla didgeridu. very fast, attack style." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{programme}} {{has received}} a mixed reception. The Daily Mirror wrote that, [...] "While many of us moan about TV dumbing down, attempts like this to dumb-up, as it were, leave you confused about whether to <b>start</b> <b>laughing</b> or cramming." ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{next door}} {{a pair of}} porters are moving another guest's {{belongings}} in, ominously including a trombone. Soon, the unseen neighbor begins playing, waking Twiddle. While he unsuccessfully tries to shut out the noise, {{a woman in the}} same room as the horn player <b>starts</b> <b>laughing.</b> Soon the musician, a deep-voiced man, <b>starts</b> <b>laughing</b> as well. Twiddle repeatedly attempts to ask the neighbors to be quiet, but is rudely and physically rebuffed each time; he soon resorts to violent tactics himself (a club, a cannon, a bomb, and finally a safe suspended by a rope), but they backfire on him as well. The entire time, the noisy neighbors are never seen, except for an occasional hand.|$|R

2500|$|On 9 August 1991, {{during a}} match between England and the West Indies at the Oval, Ian Botham fell over his stumps whilst {{attempting}} to hook Curtly Ambrose {{and so was}} dismissed [...] "hit wicket". Later in the day, Brian Johnston of BBC Radio's Test Match Special read {{out the details of}} the scorecard as normal. When he came to Botham's dismissal, his fellow presenter Jonathan Agnew commented that Botham 'just didn't quite get his leg over'. This was a double entendre meaning that {{he was not able to}} avoid hitting his stumps by getting his leg higher than the stumps, and also a reference to sex. Johnston slowly <b>started</b> <b>laughing</b> until he could commentate no more, leaving about a minute of broadcasting being just him in a fit of giggles.|$|E
2500|$|After {{coming back}} from the feast at Kubera's palace, Ganapati was riding on his mouse on the way home. It was a full moon that night. As he was riding, his mouse saw a snake and ran behind the bush. Ganapati fell to the ground and his stomach broke open. Ganapati started to put the food back in his stomach. The moon god saw him and <b>started</b> <b>laughing</b> loudly. Angered by this, Ganapati {{pronounced}} a curse on the moon god: [...] "You shall be always black and never be seen by anyone". Frightened by the curse, the moon god started pleading for mercy. Ganapati said [...] "Ok, but you shall be changing from new moon to full moon. Also if anyone sees the moon on my birthday, he or she shall not attain moksha (liberation)." [...] The moon god kept quiet. After Ganapati had finished putting the food in his stomach, he took the snake and tied it around his belly. Then he continued going back home.|$|E
2500|$|George de Mohrenschildt {{testified that}} he [...] "knew that Oswald disliked General Walker." [...] Regarding this, de Mohrenschildt and his wife Jeanne {{recalled}} an incident that occurred the weekend following the Walker assassination attempt. The de Mohrenschildts testified that on April 14, 1963, just before Easter Sunday, they were visiting the Oswalds at their new apartment and had brought them a toy Easter bunny to give to their child. As Oswald's wife Marina was showing Jeanne around the apartment, they discovered Oswald's rifle standing upright, {{leaning against the wall}} inside a closet. Jeanne told George that Oswald had a rifle, and George joked to Oswald, [...] "Were you the one who took a pot-shot at General Walker?" [...] When asked about Oswald's reaction to this question, George de Mohrenschildt told the Warren Commission that Oswald [...] "smiled at that." [...] When George's wife Jeanne was asked about Oswald's reaction, she said, [...] "I didn't notice anything"; she continued, [...] "we <b>started</b> <b>laughing</b> our heads off, big joke, big George's joke." [...] Jeanne de Mohrenschildt testified that this was the last time she or her husband ever saw the Oswalds.|$|E

6000|$|... "What," [...] they said, [...] "you're {{getting off}} at Midgeville? You're {{going to give}} the Jones Hardware Company a try, eh?"--and then they all <b>started</b> <b>laughing</b> and giving me the merry ha! ha! Well, I just got my grip packed and didn't say a thing and when the train slowed up for Midgeville, out I slid. [...] "Give my love to old man Jones," [...] one of the boys called after me, [...] "and get {{yourself}} a couple of porous plasters and a pair of splints before you tackle him!"--and then they all gave me the ha! ha! again, out of the window as the train pulled out.|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} they {{got the idea that}} what the public wanted was not {{anything}} instructive but something light and amusing. Mullins said that people loved to laugh. He said that if {{you get a lot of}} people all together and get them laughing you can do anything you like with them. Once they start to laugh they are lost. So they got Mr. Dreery, the English Literature teacher at the high school, to give an evening of readings from the Great Humorists from Chaucer to Adam Smith. They came mighty near to making a barrel of money out of that. If the people had once <b>started</b> <b>laughing</b> it would have been all over with them. As it was I heard a lot of them say that they simply wanted to scream with laughter: they said they just felt like bursting into peals of laughter all the time. Even when, in the more subtle parts, they didn't feel like bursting out laughing, they said they had all they could do to keep from smiling. They said they never had such a hard struggle in their lives not to smile.|$|E

6000|$|To one {{experience}} of my tour as a lecturer I shall always {{be able to}} look back with satisfaction. I nearly had the pleasure of killing a man with laughing: and this in the most literal sense. American lecturers have often dreamed of doing this. I nearly did it. The man in question was a comfortable apoplectic-looking man with the kind of merry rubicund face that is seen in countries where they don't have prohibition. He was seated near the back of the hall and was laughing uproariously. All of a sudden I realised that something was happening. The man had collapsed sideways on to the floor; a little group of men gathered about him; they lifted him up and I could see them carrying him out, a silent and inert mass. As in duty bound I went right on with my lecture. But my heart beat high with satisfaction. I was sure that I had killed him. The reader may judge how high these hopes rose when a moment or two later a note was handed to the chairman who then asked me to pause for a moment in my lecture and stood up and asked, [...] "Is there a doctor in the audience?" [...] A doctor rose and silently went out. The lecture continued; but there was no more laughter; my aim had now become to kill another of them and they knew it. They were aware that if they <b>started</b> <b>laughing</b> they might die. In a few minutes a second note was handed to the chairman. He announced very gravely, [...] "A second doctor is wanted." [...] The lecture went on in deeper silence than ever. All the audience were waiting for a third announcement. It came. A new message was handed to the chairman. He rose and said, [...] "If Mr. Murchison, the undertaker, is in the audience, will he kindly step outside." ...|$|E
