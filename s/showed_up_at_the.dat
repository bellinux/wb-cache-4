5|$|Flick entered semi-professional {{baseball}} by chance. When he was 15 years old, {{he was at}} a {{train station}} to support the local baseball team as it left for a road trip. Only eight of the team's players <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station, so Flick was recruited to go on the trip with the team. Though Flick did not have a uniform or shoes, he hit well in both games of the doubleheader, though Bedford lost both games. He joined the Bedford team on a regular basis, and he continued to play semi-pro baseball throughout his teenage years.|$|E

On 11 July 2009 during the International Paralympic Day celebration in Berlin, the team <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Brandenburg Gate before 58,000 visitors, and Kühn gave President Horst Köhler {{a demonstration of the}} sport. The team won gold at the European Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Stoke Mandeville, England, in 2009, and silver at the Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Birmingham, England the following year. In 2011, they again won the European Championship, which this time was held in Nazareth, Israel.|$|E

5|$|One hundred cyclists {{had entered}} for the 1906 Tour de France; only 82 of them <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start. Only 49 cyclists {{finished}} the first stage, {{and the number}} of active cyclists quickly fell to 37 in stage two, 29 in stage three, until 16 after stage eight. At that point, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages. At the end of the Tour de France, only 14 cyclists finished. The cyclists were not grouped in teams; some cyclists had the same sponsor, but they were not allowed to work together.|$|E
5|$|Talbot and de Lacy then {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the town of Bath. While scouting, the two men were attacked by forces from the city, and Talbot was captured by forces {{under the control of the}} bishop of Bath, Robert of Lewes. The Empress' forces then arranged a parley with the bishop and offered him a safe conduct, but when the bishop <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> meeting, he was threatened with hanging unless Talbot was released. The bishop released Talbot under duress. The release affected the bishop's relations with Stephen, who accused the bishop of supporting Matilda, and was only with difficulty persuaded to accept the bishop's explanation.|$|E
5|$|The largest mass {{shooting}} {{perpetrated by}} the Einsatzgruppen {{took place on}} 29 and 30 September 1941 at Babi Yar, a ravine northwest of Kiev, a city in Ukraine that had fallen to the Germans on 19 September. The perpetrators included a company of Waffen-SS attached to Einsatzgruppe C under Rasch, members of Sonderkommando 4a under SS-Obergruppenführer Friedrich Jeckeln, and some Ukrainian auxiliary police. The Jews of Kiev were told to report to a certain street corner on 29 September; anyone who disobeyed would be shot. Since word of massacres in other areas had not yet reached Kiev and the assembly point was near the train station, they assumed they were being deported. People <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rendezvous point in large numbers, laden with possessions and food for the journey.|$|E

He <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> National Assembly hall on the next day with the suspicion that he had already destroyed important evidence.

25|$|The {{history of}} the canteen can first {{be traced back to}} December 17, 1941. Just ten days after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, men of the 134th Infantry Regiment of the Nebraska Army National Guard were on their way from Camp Joseph T. Robinson near Little Rock, Arkansas to an unknown destination. Rumor had it that the train would arrive at 11, but by noon it hadn't shown up. After another false alarm, the train finally rolled in around 4:30. By this time, at least five hundred {{relatives}} and friends of local servicemen <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> depot.|$|E

After he found out Ruth was pregnant, Wanderer hired a vagrant as part of a bizarre scheme. Wanderer told the man that his relationship with his wife was deteriorating, and he wanted to stage a fight to prove himself a hero to Ruth. When Watson <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> apartment, however, Wanderer shot both him and his wife with the two Colts and staged it so that Ruth's mother would think Watson had killed Ruth.|$|E

25|$|Hogshead was red-shirted by Duke University {{after the}} fall of 1981 after she was raped by a {{stranger}} while running between campuses, and suffered from PTSD for several months. In the fall of 1982, her coach offered her a scholarship and a position on the team if she merely <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> competitions. Entering competitive swimming awakened competitive juices. She left Duke in the spring semester of 1983 to train full-time for the 1984 Olympics. This time she switched from butterfly to freestyle. She won the 1984 National indoor 200-yard event and qualified for the 1984 US swimming team.|$|E
25|$|In 262, the Wei regent Sima Zhao had the {{intention}} of launching a campaign to conquer Shu. In 263, three separate Wei armies led by Zhong Hui, Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu invaded Shu. While Jiang Wei led Shu forces to hold off Zhong Hui and Zhuge Xu's forces at the mountain pass Jiange (劍閣; in present-day Jiange County, Sichuan), the Wei army led by Deng Ai took a more dangerous route across mountainous terrain, bypassed Shu's defences, and <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Shu capital, Chengdu. The Shu emperor Liu Shan, having been taken by surprise, voluntarily surrendered to Deng Ai, thus bringing {{an end to the}} Shu state's existence.|$|E

When Bayinnaung and his armies <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gates of Chiang Mai on 31 March 1558, Mekuti surrendered without a fight on 2 April 1558. The Burmese king allowed Mekuti to remain ruler of Lan Na, and brought several artisans, many of whom were notable lacquerware workers, back to Pegu. He left a small garrison of 1000 men commanded by Binnya Dala and Binnya Set at Chiang Mai.|$|E
