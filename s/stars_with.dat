5|$|Cadmium {{is created}} via the s-process in low- to medium-mass <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> masses of 0.6 to 10 solar masses, over {{thousands}} of years. In that process, a silver atom captures a neutron and then undergoes beta decay.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{the star}} will {{increase}} its gravitational force, {{which increases the}} number of planets the solar system can have. They will {{also be able to}} attract solar systems composed of <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> lower mass than that of the player, or being attracted to <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> bigger mass. If both stars collide, they will be reduced to a lesser size within the same type of object. For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI-controlled star will be reduced to a small star. Being reduced from small star to life planet is not possible, as well as being reduced from small planet to asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided.|$|E
5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{from the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, HD 28185 has a parallax of 23.62 milliarcseconds, which {{corresponds to a}} distance of 42 parsecs (138 light-years). Since the star is located further than 25 parsecs from Earth, it is not listed in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby <b>Stars.</b> <b>With</b> an apparent magnitude of 7.81, the star is not visible with the naked eye, though {{it can be seen}} using binoculars.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{mortuary}} inscription of Pacificus, archdeacon of Verona, {{records that}} he constructed a night clock (horologium nocturnum) {{as early as}} 850, his clock {{has been identified as}} being an observation tube used to locate <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> an accompanying book of astronomical observations, rather than a mechanical or water clock, an interpretation supported by illustrations from medieval manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{formation}} of Type Ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf <b>stars,</b> <b>with</b> the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. There is much variation in this type of event, and in many cases there may be no supernova at all, but it is expected that they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal SN Type Ia.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> a planet, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} several {{observations}} in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been suggested as a destination for interstellar travel. From Epsilon Eridani, the Sun would appear as a 2.4-magnitude star in Serpens.|$|E
25|$|Exoplanets {{have been}} {{discovered}} in seven star systems in the constellation. Mu Arae is a sunlike star that hosts four planets. HD 152079 is a sunlike <b>star</b> <b>with</b> a planet.

5|$|Christian and Muslim {{philosophers}} modified Ptolemy's {{system to}} include an unmoved outermost region, the empyrean heaven, which came {{to be identified as}} the dwelling place of God and all the elect. Medieval Christians identified the sphere of <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> the Biblical firmament and sometimes posited an invisible layer of water above the firmament, to accord with Genesis. An outer sphere, inhabited by angels, appeared in some accounts.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to be}} rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 is a bright, blue B-type main {{sequence}} {{star in the}} Upper Scorpius association, a loose star cluster composed of <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> a common origin. The star {{is estimated to be}} approximately 2.5 times the mass of the Sun. Ages of the Upper Scorpius group have been quoted at 5 million years, however a more recent estimate suggests that the group is somewhat older (approximately 11 million years old). Its effective temperature is estimated at 10500 K, less than twice the effective temperature of the Sun.|$|E

In 1909, the symbiotic nova RT Serpentis appeared near Omicron, although it only reached a maximum magnitude of 10.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387 was a {{gravitational}} microlensing event {{detected by}} the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics collaboration on July 24, 2009, which searches and documents chance and brief alignments of <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> other stars or objects; such alignments cause a gravitational lens effect, which bends light and causes distorted, but magnified, images {{that can be}} interpreted. The detection of two caustics were logged {{over the next few}} days by the South African Astronomical Observatory, the Perth Observatory, and the Canopus Hill Observatory in Tasmania, with a separation of about seven days between caustic events.|$|E

5|$|Most main-sequence <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> a {{spectral}} class between O5 and F5 {{have been}} found to rotate rapidly. For stars in this range, the measured rotation velocity increases with mass. This increase in rotation peaks among young, massive B-class stars. As the expected life span of a star decreases with increasing mass, this can be explained as a decline in rotational velocity with age.|$|E
5|$|Radial {{velocity}} {{is measured}} by the doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of km/s. The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year. With knowledge of the star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. <b>Stars</b> <b>with</b> high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days {{before returning to the}} night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other <b>stars,</b> <b>with</b> a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior to the summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E

500|$|... color index, B−V, is the {{difference}} between the magnitude of the star in blue light, or B, and the magnitude in visual light (green-yellow), or V. Large positive values indicate a red <b>star</b> <b>with</b> a cool surface temperature, while negative values imply a blue <b>star</b> <b>with</b> a hotter surface.|$|R
5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} tail, Eta Serpentis, is similar to Alpha Serpentis' primary {{in that it is}} a red giant of spectral class K. This star, however, is known to exhibit solar-like oscillations over a period of approximately 2.16 hours. The other two stars in Serpens Cauda forming its asterism are Theta and Xi Serpentis. Xi, where the asterism crosses over to Mu Serpentis in the head, is a triple star system located approximately 105 parsecs away. Two of the <b>stars,</b> <b>with</b> a combined apparent magnitude of around 3.5, form a spectroscopic binary with an angular separation of only 2.2 milliarcseconds, and thus cannot be resolved with modern equipment. The primary is a white giant with an excess of strontium. Theta, forming the tip of the tail, is also a multiple system, consisting of two A-type main-sequence <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> a combined apparent magnitude of around 4.1 separated by almost half an arcminute.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>stars</b> <b>with</b> {{planetary}} {{systems have}} been found. HD87883 is an orange dwarf of magnitude7.57 and spectral type K0V 18parsecs distant from Earth.

It is orbited by a planet around 1.78times the mass of Jupiter every 7.9years, and there are possibly other smaller planets. HD 82886 is a yellow dwarf of spectral type G0 and visual magnitude7.63. A planet 1.3times the mass of Jupiter and orbiting every 705 days was discovered in 2011.|$|E
