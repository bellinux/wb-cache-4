5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the <b>specific</b> <b>humidity</b> of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

The measurements are usually expressed as <b>specific</b> <b>humidity</b> or percent relative humidity. The temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure; 100% relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure. This condition {{is often referred to as}} complete saturation. Humidity ranges from 0gram per cubic metre in dry air to 30grams per cubic metre (0.03 ounce per cubic foot) when the vapor is saturated at 30°C.|$|E

50|$|The {{ability to}} detect {{variations}} in humidity is critical for many animals. Birds, reptiles and insects all show preferences for <b>specific</b> <b>humidities</b> that influence their mating, reproduction and geographic distribution. Because of their large surface area to volume ratio, insects are particularly sensitive to humidity, and its detection can influence their survival. Two types of hygroreceptors exist in insects: one responds to an increase (moist receptor) {{and the other to}} a reduction (dry receptor) in humidity. Although previous data indicated that mechanosensation might contribute to hygrosensation, the cellular basis of hygrosensation and the genes involved in detecting humidity remain unknown. To understand better the molecular bases of humidity sensing, investigated several genes encoding channels associated with mechanosensation, thermosensing or water transport.|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the persistent slope glaciers, the glaciers on Kilimanjaro's crater plateau have appeared and disappeared repeatedly during the Holocene epoch, with each cycle lasting a few hundred years. It appears that decreasing <b>specific</b> <b>humidity</b> instead of temperature changes has caused the shrinkage of the slope glaciers since the late 19th century. No clear warming trend at the elevation of those glaciers occurred between 1948 and 2005. Although air temperatures at that elevation are always below freezing, solar radiation causes melting on their vertical faces. [...] "There is no pathway for the plateau glaciers other than to continuously retreat once their vertical margins are exposed to solar radiation." [...] Vertical ice margin walls are a unique characteristic of the summit glaciers and a major place of the shrinkage of the glaciers. They manifest stratifications, calving, and other ice features.|$|E

However, inspection of the <b>specific</b> <b>humidities</b> for these conditions reveals systematic drying trends that are a maximum at the lowest measurement level above the surface. These drying trends occur for any prevailing wind direction. Latent heat fluxes are calculated from the humidity budget equation and from a Penman-Monteith dewfall model, with the results suggesting that during clear, stable nights the observed latent heat fluxes as obtained from the eddy-correlation technique are erroneously small.

We generate synthetic spectra using atmospheric methane profiles {{that do not}} contain supersaturation or discontinuities to fit the observations, and thereby retrieve minimum saturation altitudes and corresponding <b>specific</b> <b>humidities</b> in the boundary layer. We relate these in turn to surface-level relative humidities using independent surface temperature measurements. We also compare our results with general circulation model simulations to interpret and constrain the relationship between humidities and surface liquids.

While our observations are consistent with considerably more liquid methane existing at the north pole than is present in observed lakes, a degeneracy between low-level methane and haze leads to substantial uncertainty in determining {{the extent of the}} source region.

40|$|For over a decade, several {{research}} {{groups have been}} developing air-sea heat flux information over the global ocean, including latent (LHF) and sensible (SHF) heat fluxes over the global ocean. This paper aims to provide new insight into the quality and error characteristics of turbulent heat flux estimates at various spatial and temporal scales (from daily upwards). The study is performed within the European Space Agency (ESA) Ocean Heat Flux (OHF) project. One of the main objectives of the OHF project is to meet the recommendations and requirements expressed by various international {{programs such as the}} World Research Climate Program (WCRP) and Climate and Ocean Variability, Predictability, and Change (CLIVAR), recognizing the need for better characterization of existing flux errors with respect to the input bulk variables (e. g. surface wind, air and sea surface temperatures, air and surface <b>specific</b> <b>humidities),</b> and to the atmospheric and oceanic conditions (e. g. wind conditions and sea state). The analysis is based on the use of daily averaged LHF and SHF and the asso- ciated bulk variables derived from major satellite-based and atmospheric reanalysis products. Inter-comparisons of heat flux products indicate that all of them exhibit similar space and time patterns. However, they also reveal significant differences in magnitude in some specific regions such as the western ocean boundaries during the Northern Hemisphere winter season, and the high southern latitudes. The differences tend to be closely related to large differences in surface wind speed and/or <b>specific</b> air <b>humidity</b> (for LHF) and to air and sea temperature differences (for SHF). Further quality investigations are performed through comprehensive comparisons with daily-averaged LHF and SHF estimated from moorings. The resulting statistics are used to assess the error of each OHF product. Consideration of error correlation between products and observations (e. g., by their assimilation) is also given. This reveals generally high noise variance in all products and a weak signal in common with in situ observations, with some products only slightly better than others. The OHF LHF and SHF products, and their associated error characteristics, are used to compute daily OHF multiproduct-ensemble (OHF/MPE) estimates of LHF and SHF over the ice-free global ocean on a 0. 25 ° × 0. 25 ° grid. The accuracy of this heat multiproduct, determined from comparisons with mooring data, is greater than for any individual product. It is used as a reference for the anomaly characterization of each individual OHF product...|$|R

40|$|Mesoscale {{transport}} {{of energy and}} matter between the surface and the atmosphere often occurs in form of non-propagating organized structures or thermally-induced circulations. Spatially resolving measurements are required to capture such fluxes and, thus far, airborne measurements are the only means to accomplish this. In contrast, tower-based eddy-covariance measurements are conducted at one point and therefore inherently cannot capture the total atmospheric exchange, which is recognized as {{a major contributor to}} energy balance closure problems. As long as there are mean vertical thermal and humidity gradients in the Atmospheric Boundary-Layer, with higher potential temperatures and <b>specific</b> <b>humidities</b> in the surface layer as compared with the outer-layer, such organized structures will lead to a systematic underestimation of turbulent energy fluxes from eddy-towers. Firstly, we address the question of how deep such meso-γ scale motions penetrate into the surface layer. We present indications from Doppler-LiDAR, airborne and tower-based measurements, which show that mesoscale motion can indeed be found quite close to the surface, but the mesoscale effect vanishes when measurements are actually conducted within the roughness sublayer and when shear stress is sufficiently large to break up mesoscale contributions into smaller eddies. This will be illustrated by observations from Germany and Israel. Secondly, we investigate whether the common practice of adjusting the measured eddy tower fluxes for energy balance closure by conserving the Bowen ratio is supported by experimental evidence. Mesoscale and small-scale turbulent fluxes from four different flight campaigns are presented, which were carried out on board of the Canadian Twin Otter (National Research Council of Canada) and the German Polar 5 (Alfred-Wegener Institute) research aircraft over different landscapes in Canada and Alaska...|$|R

Two hours were required to reach such stabilized points. Afterwards, thermoelectric coolers were turned on and the desired subcooling temperature was reached in less than 2 min. The condensation starting point parameters were thus well controlled. The gas temperature and relative humidity were constant and the dew point temperature was quickly reached thanks to the fast thermoelectric cooler response. Thanks to that, the measured parameters at the first detected droplets was constant and had already reached their setpoint.|$|R

As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. The differences in the amount of water vapor in a parcel of air can be quite large, for example; A parcel of air that is near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 30 °C, but only 8 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 8 °C.|$|E
40|$|Water vapor {{distributions}} {{obtained from}} the fourth generation ECHAM general circulation model are compared with satellite observations of total precipitable water (TPW) from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and upper tropospheric relative humidity (UTH) from TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). The model simulations generally agree with the satellite observed climatological mean and seasonal variation of moisture abundance. The interannual variabilities of vapor amount shown in the model are also comparable to the observed data. There are, however, biases in the details. The underestimates in TPW and UTH are found off {{the west coast of}} continents, especially in the boreal summer over the eastern subtropical Pacific. The biases are related to both an enhanced dray advection associated with a too strong subtropical high and more vigorous large scale subsidence in the model. A slightly different geographical location and more intense tropical circulation in ECHAM 4 is manifest at the broadening of the high TPW and UTH zone that coincides with the active convective region. The anomalous equatorial UTH and TPW simulated in the model are found to be more sensitive to the tropical SST anomalies than the satellite data. The impact of changes in physical parameterizations on the moisture distribution is examined by comparing the simulations from the previous ECHAM 3 and the current ECHAM 4 models. The dry bias at the equator in ECHAM 3 is related to the closure assumption used for deep convection. The dry bias in UTH over the higher latitude of the winter hemisphere in ECHAM 3 {{is a result of the}} negative <b>specific</b> <b>humidities</b> produced by the spectral vapor advection scheme. With the new semi-Lagrangian advection scheme in ECHAM 4, the simulated UTH over the same region becomes more moist than TOVS observations suggest. The discrepancies in simulating water vapor distributions affect the simulation of the radiation budget and cloud distribution in the model. (orig.) 56 refs.
