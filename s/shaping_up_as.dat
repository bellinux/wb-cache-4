Kim Manners said preparations were confusing since it wasn't known at the time how the storyline would unfold.

[...] Den of Geek's Simon Brew felt the character's storyline with her sister in [...] "Escape to L.A."

Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffrey stated that throughout the fourth series, [...] "Alexa Havins was consistently excellent, bringing a real warmth and likability to her role." [...] The character attracted comparisons to previous Torchwood characters. Dan Martin wrote after the broadcast of [...] "Rendition" [...] that the character of Esther [...] "is <b>shaping</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> a Toshiko-style tragedy queen". Dave Golder, writing for SFX noted the character's incompetency in the episode [...] "Escape to L.A."

[...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe described it as a [...] "maniacally zippy single," [...] and Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com referred to it as an [...] "unapologetically sassy dance hit." [...] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch commented that [...] "based on their efficacious American debut single, [...] the Spice Girls might be expected to deliver more of that zingy pop on their debut album," [...] but she felt that [...] "aside from 'Wannabe,' the album's dance tracks are color-by-numbers bland."

2500|$|However, on September 12, Vivendi {{announced}} that both The Treason of Isengard and the Return of the King games had been cancelled. The official reason given by Vivendi was that Treason [...] "was not <b>shaping</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> strongly as anticipated and would likely not satisfy {{the expectations of}} Tolkien fans." [...] Vivendi reiterated that The Hobbit, Middle-earth Online and War of the Ring were all still on schedule. Andrew Shiozaki, senior brand manager of Vivendi Universal Games, commented that [...] "it was determined that The Lord of the Rings: The Treason of Isengard {{was not going to}} achieve the strict, but crucial, standards for our Tolkien games. With that, the decision has been made to cancel this title and focus on the remainder of the Tolkien lineup."

5000|$|In what <b>shaped</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> a close primary, Bebout {{gained the}} support of the party's popular former U.S. Senator Alan Kooi Simpson, a lawyer from Cody and the leader of GOP [...] "moderates". Simpson was {{particularly}} vitriolic in attacks on Hunkins. Bebout received 44,417 votes (49 percent) to Hunkins' 25,363 (28 percent). Sniffin, Watt, and Self split the remaining 23 percent. An outright majority is not required for a party nomination in Wyoming. There has been speculation that the intraparty strife doomed Bebout in the general election.|$|R
50|$|The season would <b>shape</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> {{a two-man}} battle between Rahal and Michael Andretti. Andretti won at Milwaukee, which {{put him in}} the points lead for the first time. On Father's Day, Andretti was leading on the final lap at Portland. His car ran out of fuel on the final turn of the final lap, and his father Mario beat him to the finish line by 0.07 seconds. It would go down in lore {{as one of the most}} {{shocking}} finishes in Indy car history, as well as the closest finish in Indy car history on a road course (until 1997).|$|R
50|$|Kennett's {{personal}} popularity {{was mostly}} average to high through his first term, though {{that of the}} government as a whole went through peaks and troughs. Without a by-election in the previous four years, the 1996 state election <b>shaped</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> the first test of the 'Kennett Revolution' with the electorate. The Coalition was expected to win a second term at the 30 March election, albeit with a somewhat reduced majority. At the federal election held four weeks earlier, while Labor was heavily defeated, it actually picked up a swing in Victoria. However, {{to the surprise of}} most commentators, Kennett was reelected with a 32-seat majority, a loss of only two.|$|R
2500|$|The Fallen Lords was {{originally}} conceived by Jason Jones as Bungie were {{nearing the end}} of development of Marathon Infinity in late-1995. They had planned to do another first-person shooter as their next game. However, the initial screenshots of id Software's Quake had just been released, and when Jones saw them, he felt Bungie's new game was <b>shaping</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> too similar. As such, he approached his colleagues with the question [...] "What do you think about having this world with 100 guys fighting 100 other guys in 3D?" [...] Bungie had worked on several 3D action games for Mac OS, and Jones' idea was to bring that experience to a real-time strategy game rather than another first-person game. The team agreed with Jones that their new shooter could end up as being very similar to Quake, and, as such, after working on the project for two months, Jones explains [...] "in one day we switched our project from a shooter game that would have had us chasing our competition's tail to what has basically become Myth." ...|$|E

50|$|Nascent slums were a {{byproduct}} of what was <b>shaping</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> a full-tilt, post-war regional boom. Another was the rapid increase in auto use in the Bay Area in the late ’40s, bringing with it Los Angeles-scale traffic congestion. The Bay Area Council played a leading - and ultimately successful - role in the push for new Bay spans, including the Dumbarton and Richmond/San Rafael bridges.|$|E
30|$|The {{absence of}} an {{adequate}} device description format as pointed out in Sections 1 and 2 {{led to the development}} of ODDs as novel device description format, as it will be introduced in this section. In broad state-of-the-art surveys and several alternative implementations of technical prototypes using different technologies, OWL with its expressiveness and nonetheless very easy and minimalistic RDF data model <b>shaped</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> the most suitable technology. ODDs are purely based on OWL and its RDF-based XML serialization. This is in contrast to other existing approaches (cf. Section 2), which use either proprietary languages and ASCII- or XML-based formats, or which are purely based on RDF or use OWL only partially.|$|R
50|$|LORE (Low Overhead Rendering Engine) is {{the name}} of the {{graphics}} engine used by Civilization V (and its successor Civilization: Beyond Earth). There was a presentation of LORE at the GDC2011.While Direct3D 11 was still in alpha stage, Firaxis decided to design the rendering engine natively for the Direct3D 11 architecture, and then map backwards to Direct3D 9. This approach <b>shaped</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> being that advantageous, that Civilization V officially supports AMD's proprietary Mantle low-level rendering API, which is stateless, as are Vulkan and Direct3D 12. With Vulkan being heavily based upon Mantle, it should be relatively easy to also include an Vulkan rendering path, but no such announcements have been made by Firaxis.|$|R

Conway led 31 of the first 45 laps, but after a sequence of pit stops, and a failed tire strategy, was shuffled back to third in the closing stages. After a nine-car accident that took out several front-runners, the final stint <b>shaped</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> a three-car battle between Simon Pagenaud, James Jakes, and Conway. Pagenaud came to the lead when Jakes pitted on lap 58. Jakes came {{back out on the}} track close behind, with Conway charging in third.
