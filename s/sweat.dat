40|$|That <b>sweating</b> is an {{exceedingly}} common pheno-menon in ill {{children can be}} attested by any nurse or paediatrician.

Cold <b>sweating</b> may be defined as <b>sweating</b> which occurs without an ade-quate temal stimulus (Hemingway, 1944), thus excluding <b>sweating</b> due to cold stimuli (Kuno, 1934). The possible clinical importance of cold <b>sweating</b> in children was suggested during investigations on insulin tolerance in children with coeliac disease...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sweating</b> {{measurement}} is a {{very useful}} tool for the physiological health state of the human body. A <b>sweating</b> measuring system developed {{in this study was}} composed of several sensors. All sensors were calibrated to ensure the accuracy. Three pretreatment physiological states for test subjects before <b>sweating</b> measurement included sit and rest for 5 min, walking for 5 min, and running for 5 min. The whole <b>sweating</b> value was measured and calculated over 5 -min periods. The results of <b>sweating</b> measurement indicated the usefulness of this device. The <b>sweating</b> quantity of three states did not have a significant relationship with the height, weight and body mass index (BMI) values of subjects. The first <b>sweating</b> index is the difference between active treatment and sitting state. The second <b>sweating</b> index is the ratio between active state and sitting. The relationship between two <b>sweating</b> index and BMI values could be found. This device could serve as a detecting tool to establish the <b>sweating</b> database for normal conditions and to be used for diagnosis.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} revealed psychological <b>sweating</b> to be a ubiquitous {{phenomenon in}} passively heated individuals. Since heating potentiates <b>sweating,</b> and since most research into psychological <b>sweating</b> was not conducted in this thermal state, these observations required thermoneutral verification. Thermoneutral subjects performed mental arithmetic (at 26 o C) with psychological <b>sweating</b> evaluated from nine sites (ventilated capsules, skin conductance). Discharged <b>sweating</b> was evident from three glabrous sites (P 3 ̆c. 05). However, significant <b>sweating</b> was evident from two nonglabrous surfaces (P 3 ̆c. 05), and skin conductance increased at the volar and dorsal finger surfaces (P 3 ̆c. 05). Each {{of these changes}} occurred while core and skin temperatures remained stable (P 3 ̆e. 05). These thermoneutral observations further refute the proposition that psychological <b>sweating</b> in humans is restricted to the glabrous skin surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Thermally induced eccrine <b>sweating</b> is cholinergically mediated, {{but other}} neurotransmitters have been {{postulated}} for psychological (emotional) <b>sweating.</b> However, {{we hypothesized that}} such <b>sweating</b> is not noradrenergically driven in passively heated, resting humans. To test this, nine supine subjects were exposed to non-thermal stimuli (palmar pain, mental arithmetic and static exercise) known to evoke <b>sweating.</b> Trials consisted of the following four sequential phases: thermoneutral rest; passive heating to elevate (by ∼ 1. 0 ◦C) and clamp mean body temperature and steady-state <b>sweating</b> (perfusion garment and footbath); an atropine sulphate infusion (0. 04 mg kg− 1) with thermal clamping sustained;andfollowingclamp removal. Sudomotor responses from glabrous (hairless) and non-glabrous skin surfaces were measured simultaneously (precursor and discharged <b>sweating).</b> When thermoneutral, these non-thermal stimuli elicited significant <b>sweating</b> only from the palm (P 0. 05). However, when the thermal clamp was removed, core and skin temperatures became further elevated and <b>sweating</b> was restored (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), indicating that the blockade had been overcome, presumably through elevated receptor competition. These observations establish the dependence of both thermal and non-thermal eccrine <b>sweating</b> from glabrous and non-glabrous surfaces on acetylcholine release, and challenge theories concerning the psychological modulation of <b>sweating.</b> Furthermore, no evidence existed for the significant participation of non-cholinergic neurotransmitters during any of these stimulations...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sweating</b> {{in cooking}} is the gentle heating of {{vegetables}} {{in a little}} oil or butter, with frequent stirring and turning to ensure that any emitted liquid will evaporate. <b>Sweating</b> usually results in tender, sometimes translucent, pieces. <b>Sweating</b> is often a preliminary to further cooking in liquid; onions, in particular, are often <b>sweated</b> before including in a stew. This differs from sautéing in that <b>sweating</b> is done over a much lower heat, sometimes with salt added to help draw moisture away, {{and making sure that}} little or no browning takes place.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sweating</b> events {{occur in}} {{response}} to mental stress (psychogenic) or with increased body temperature (thermogenic). We previously found that both were linked to activation of common brain stem regions, suggesting that they share the same output pathways: a putative common premotor nucleus was identified in the rostral-lateral medulla (Farrell MJ, Trevaks D, Taylor NA, McAllen RM. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 304 : R 810 -R 817, 2013). We therefore looked in higher brain regions for the neural basis that differentiates {{the two types of}} <b>sweating</b> event. Previous work has identified hemispheric activations linked to psychogenic <b>sweating,</b> but no corresponding data have been reported for thermogenic <b>sweating.</b> Galvanic skin responses were used to measure <b>sweating</b> events in two groups of subjects during either psychogenic <b>sweating</b> (n = 11, 35. 3 ± 11. 8 yr) or thermogenic <b>sweating</b> (n = 11, 34. 4 ± 10. 2 yr) while regional brain activation was measured by BOLD signals in a 3 -Tesla MRI scanner. Common regions activated with <b>sweating</b> events in both groups included the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, insula, premotor cortex, thalamus, lentiform nuclei, and cerebellum (P(corrected) < 0. 05). Psychogenic <b>sweating</b> events were associated with significantly greater activation in the dorsal midcingulate cortex, parietal cortex, premotor cortex, occipital cortex, and cerebellum. No hemispheric region was found to show statistically significantly greater activation with thermogenic than with psychogenic <b>sweating</b> events. However, a discrete cluster of activation in the anterior hypothalamus/preoptic area was seen only with thermogenic <b>sweating</b> events. These findings suggest that the expected association between <b>sweating</b> events and brain regions implicated in "arousal" may apply selectively to psychogenic sweating; the neural basis for thermogenic <b>sweating</b> events may be subcortical.

5000|$|Gustatory <b>sweating</b> {{refers to}} thermal <b>sweating</b> {{induced by the}} {{ingestion}} of food.

An increase in the gain constant as a result of acclimation would indicate an increased sensitivity of the <b>sweating</b> mechanism per unit of central <b>sweating</b> drive, i. e., enhanced peripheral sensitivity. A displacement of the point of zero central drive as a result of acclimation would indicate that central mechanisms are responsible for the heightened <b>sweating</b> response.

40|$|Background: When asked, a {{significant}} number of patients report having experienced night <b>sweats.</b> Those who do are more likely to report decreased physical health, mental health, and quality of life. In most cases the cause of night <b>sweats</b> is unknown. We therefore do not know how much to worry about patients with this symptom. The present study examined associations between night <b>sweats</b> and mortal-ity. Methods: We used logistic regression and proportional hazards analyses to investigate potential pre-dictors of mortality, including night <b>sweats</b> reported at baseline, among 2 different cohorts of people older than 65 years of age (n 682 and n 852) who were followed for an average of 7. 3 and 7. 5 years, respectively. Results: Patients who reported night <b>sweats</b> were not more likely to die or to die sooner {{than those who did not}} report night <b>sweats</b> after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, education, and income. This held true as well for patients who reported more severe night <b>sweats</b> among the cohort in which the severity of night <b>sweats</b> was quantified. Conclusions: Patients who report night <b>sweats</b> on a primary care health history questionnaire do not seem, on average, to be at increased risk for mortality.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPatients with {{terminal}} cancer frequently {{suffer from}} sleep <b>sweats,</b> which occur while sleeping and cease after waking; {{the cause of}} these <b>sweats</b> is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of a modified Dang Gui Liu Huang Tang in managing sleep <b>sweats,</b> as well as to identify any associated adverse effects. MethodsWe enrolled 41 patients with terminal cancer who were receiving hospice care. We excluded patients whose <b>sweating</b> had known causes, as well as those taking drugs that can affect the <b>sweating</b> threshold. Patients received a modified Dang Gui Liu Huang Tang twice a day for 10 consecutive days. ResultsThe quantitative assessment revealed that sleep <b>sweating</b> was completely relieved in 29 (70. 7 %) patients, and that the average time required for a 50 % decrease in <b>sweating</b> was 5. 3 days. Using a visual analog <b>sweating</b> scale that ranged from 0 to 10, patients and caregivers estimated that the mean decrease in <b>sweating</b> was 7. 6 and 8. 0, respectively. Furthermore, 78. 0 % of patients experienced an increased appetite after treatment. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (14. 6 %), nausea (12. 1 %), and allergy (2. 4 %), although the severity of these symptoms was never greater than Grade 2, and they resolved after the treatment was stopped. ConclusionThe results suggest that the modified Dang Gui Liu Huang Tang is safe and effective in treating sleep <b>sweats</b> of an unknown cause in elderly patients with terminal cancer...|$|R
