5|$|Among Scott's first acts as {{governor}} was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first {{address to the}} legislature on December 13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when he <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> icy steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term {{as governor}}.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight on ice, and that their own horses had been trained to fight on ice without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and dug into the ice with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing on to their spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice, and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally tooth and nail battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Patching was one {{of several}} backstrokers who had <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{starting}} area earlier in the meet, so Kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto the soles of his feet. The Soviet organisers had provided a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best. He finished his leg in 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead after posting a time of 56.81s, with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was the last to reach the 100m mark, recording a time of 58.84s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The four leading teams had broken away, leaving a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans.|$|E

5|$|Jacqui meets {{homeless}} teenager Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) {{and invites}} {{her to move}} into her flat. At Tony and Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring)'s wedding, a bus crashes in to the venue. Rhys becomes trapped under the debris and apologises to Jacqui as he dies in her arms. Jacqui returns home to discover Rhys had planned to leave her and had left a note, detailing his plans to leave her and his affair with a mystery woman. Jacqui becomes suspicious that Cindy {{was having an affair}} with Rhys. Jacqui confronts Cindy who is with Bart's pregnant girlfriend Sinead O'Connor. She accuses Cindy only for Sinead to confess to having sex with Rhys. Jacqui confronts Sinead and realises Rhys is the father of her baby. She allows Sinead to keep the baby's paternity a secret when Bart proposes to her. On Christmas Day at the McQueens, which Tony and Cindy have both been invited to, Jacqui discovers items belonging to Rhys in the closet, including his mobile phone, which her family had been hiding from her. She recharges Rhys' phone and discovers that it was Cindy he {{was having an affair with}}. A disgusted Jacqui attacks Cindy with a Santa statue, Cindy recovers in hospital and is persuaded by Tony to keep quiet about attack and say she <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice. Jacqui drags Cindy from Hospital to Rhys' grave and warns her to stay away.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Viscous Couette flow {{is derived}} for flow between two {{infinitely}} long con-centric rotating cylinders with Navier <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> both. Its axisymmetric linear stability is studied within {{a regime that}} would be hydrodynamically stable according to Rayleigh’s criterion: opposing gradients of angular velocity and specific angular momentum, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rotation rates and radii of the cylinders. Stability conditions are analyzed, by methods based on those of Synge and Chandrasekhar. For sufficiently small <b>slip</b> length <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outer cylinder no instability occurs with arbitrary <b>slip</b> length <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inner cylin-der. As a corollary, <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inner cylinder is shown to be stabilizing, with no <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outer cylinder. Two slip configurations are investigated numerically, first with <b>slip</b> only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outer cylinder, then second with equal <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> both cylinders. It is found that instability does occur (for large outer slip length), and the principle of exchange of stabilities emerges. The instability disappears for sufficiently large slip length in the second case; Rayleigh’s criterion provides an explanation for these phenomena. 1. Introduction. In many areas of scienc...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of the dog {{was published in the}} Connecticut Quarterly, (April–June, 1898), by New York geologist W.H.C. Pynchon. According to Pynchon, in February 1891 he and geologist Herbert Marshall of the USGS were conducting geologic research in the Hanging Hills when they saw the dog. Pynchon had seen the dog once before. Marshall, who had seen the dog twice, scoffed at the legend. Shortly after the two of them saw the dog, Marshall <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice atop one of the cliffs and plunged to his death. His body was recovered by authorities. Reports of the Black Dog continue to circulate today.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} {{most of the day}} in fruitless attempts to parley with the rebel force, Nicholas ordered a cavalry charge which <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> icy cobbles and retired in disorder. Eventually, {{at the end of the}} day, Nicholas ordered three artillery pieces to open fire, with devastating effect. To avoid the slaughter the rebels broke and ran. Some attempted to regroup on the frozen surface of the river Neva, to the north. However, here too they were targeted by the artillery and suffered many casualties. As the ice was broken by the cannon fire, many of the dead and dying were cast into the river. After a nighttime mopping-up operation by loyal army and police units, the revolt in the north came to an end.|$|E
30|$|From {{the above}} {{simulation}} results, {{it is found}} that when wheels <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rail and the friction coefficient between the wheel and rail is large enough, unstable vibration of the wheel–rail system will occur, signifying that rail corrugation will arise. Therefore, the effective method for controlling and suppressing rail corrugation in high-speed tracks is to prevent wheels <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> rails. If <b>the</b> wheel does not <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rail, self-excited vibration of the wheel–rail system will not take place. Thus, rail corrugation will not occur. The present result explains why rail corrugation most probably takes place in train brake sections of tracks. This is because the wheel is easy to <b>slip</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rail due to a low coefficient of friction when a train is braked at a high speed. This result {{can also be used to}} explain why most of rails in high-speed tracks are not subjected to corrugation, where wheel <b>slipping</b> <b>on</b> rail rarely takes place.|$|R

25|$|Sophomore Bob DeStefano {{filled in}} at {{quarterback for the}} injured Scarbath. In the first quarter, DeStefano {{connected}} with Stan Karnash on a 37-yard touchdown pass. In the second quarter, quarterback Andy Davis, fourth-ranked {{in the nation in}} total yardage, led George Washington to tie the game before the half. In the third quarter, DeStefano hit Shemonski for a three-yard touchdown. In the final period, Davis led the Colonials on a 43-yard drive, but they were stopped on the Maryland 3-yard line. Petruzzo then stopped another G.W. drive when he intercepted a pass and returned it 44 yards. Ed Modzelewski rushed to the Colonials' three-yard line setting up a scoring run by Fullerton. In the final minutes, G.W.'s John Shullenbarger <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wet turf in the end zone for a Maryland safety.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco {{started the}} second half with a drive into Washington territory, aided by a {{controversial}} ruling in which running back Wendell Tyler dropped the ball just a second after catching it and then dove on it. Officials ruled the play a fumble and recovery for the 49ers rather than an incompletion. But kicker Ray Wersching later <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> muddy field while attempting a 50-yard field goal and it fell well short. On Washington's next drive, they ran another trick play, this time a pass from Riggins, who threw a 36-yard completion to Charlie Brown inside the 49ers 15-yard line. But all that led to was Moseley's third missed field goal attempt of the day, this one from 38 yards, that he once again sent wide right.|$|E
25|$|The play most {{directly}} {{analogous to the}} Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On Thanksgiving Day 1993, the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in sleet. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, {{waiting for it to}} come to rest in order to down it {{as close as possible to}} the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end Leon Lett sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slick surface and touched the ball. His touch meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16–14 victory.|$|E

25|$|The {{championship}} game {{took place on}} Christmas Eve in Cleveland {{a week after the}} conference playoffs. On the Rams' first play after the opening kickoff, Waterfield passed to Glenn Davis for an 82-yard touchdown, giving Los Angeles an early 7–0 lead. Martin was covering Davis, but <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slick turf, leaving the receiver open. Graham and the Browns' offense responded with a drive later in the first quarter that evened the score, but the Rams went ahead again by a touchdown on a three-yard Hoerner rush. Cleveland scored a second touchdown in the second quarter, this time a 37-yard pass from Graham to Lavelli. Groza's extra point attempt failed, however, because of a high snap, putting the Browns behind by one point. Waterfield missed a 15-yard field goal attempt {{at the end of the}} first half, leaving the score at 14–13 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|The Cleveland Browns of the NFL {{selected}} Martin in {{the second}} round of the 1950 draft. Led by an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, Cleveland had won four championships in the All-America Football Conference leading up to the 1950 season, the team's first in the NFL. With Martin playing at defensive end, the Browns finished the 1950 season with a 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship. In a divisional playoff game against the New York Giants before the championship, Martin sacked Giants quarterback Charlie Conerly in his own end zone for a safety that helped secure a narrow 8–3 victory. The Rams scored a touchdown on their first play from scrimmage in the championship game, an 82-yard pass from Bob Waterfield to Glenn Davis. Martin was covering Davis and <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> play, although the Browns came back to win in the final seconds of the game.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Washington drove into the Bears red zone and sent their special teams unit to attempt a 35-yard field goal. Backup quarterback Jay Schroeder, who was the holder on the play, called an audible for a fake field goal, but due the roaring crowd at Soldier Field, his {{receivers}} didn't hear the call. As a result, he {{had no one to}} throw to after the snap, and <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 25-yard line while trying to run for a first down. Chicago then took over and drove to the Washington 14-yard line. But with just over nine minutes left in the game, McMahon's pass was intercepted by Barry Wilburn in the end zone. Later on, McMahon was intercepted again, this time by Dennis Woodberry at the Chicago 43. Three plays later, Washington attempted to put the game away with a quarterback sneak on fourth and inches, but Williams was stopped short with 1:13 left, giving the Bears one last chance to drive for a winning score. However, the Redskins defense again rose to the occasion, forcing Walter Payton out of bounds one yard short of the first down marker on fourth down and 8.|$|E

25|$|Game4 {{was pushed}} back a day because of rain, {{the first time}} a rainout had {{occurred}} in the World Series since Game1 in 1996. The fans from the game were to attend Game5. (Thus, fans who had tickets for Game5 went to Game4 instead.) The Cardinals won, taking a 3–1 series lead. The Tigers took a 3–0 lead into the top of the third, after Sean Casey had two RBIs, including a home run. The other RBI came from Detroit's Iván Rodríguez, who singled in Carlos Guillén. Rodriguez, who had been hitless in the previous three games, also went 3-for-4. In the bottom of the third, the Cardinals struck back with a run-scoring double by David Eckstein, scoring Aaron Miles who had the first stolen base of the series by either team. Yadier Molina doubled in Scott Rolen in the fourth to cut the Tiger lead to 3–2. The score remained that way, until the bottom of the seventh, when Eckstein led off with a double over the head of Curtis Granderson, who had <b>slipped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wet Busch Stadium outfield. Eckstein then scored on a sacrifice bunt by So Taguchi that was thrown over the head of Plácido Polanco covering first by Fernando Rodney, and that tied the score at three. Later that same inning, Preston Wilson hit a single to left with two outs that scored Taguchi from third. The Tigers tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth on a Brandon Inge double that scored Iván Rodríguez. In the bottom of the eighth inning, the Cardinals would regain and keep the lead when Miles scored on a double by Eckstein just off the glove of outfielder Craig Monroe, who had been playing shallow and dove for a ball just out of his reach.|$|E
