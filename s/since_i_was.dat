5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took {{the easy way out}} and <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a child Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, {{and the person}} in the world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E
500|$|... "You're Not the One" [...] {{was written}} in 2012, at a time when—according to Ferreira—she [...] "was in a {{different}} headspace". [...] "I had been dating someone for three years, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 17, and that person guarded me from everything", she said. Ferreira explained that her life was essentially limited to modelling, crafting songs and [...] "watch TV", which resulted in her not having a [...] "chance to discover self." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Obama {{likened the}} Zionist {{movement}} to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said that both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, [...] "To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish {{is part and parcel}} with the values that I've been fighting for <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> politically conscious and started getting involved in politics." [...] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.|$|E
500|$|In 1949, Turner was to {{headline}} A Life of Her Own (1950). The project was shelved for several months, and Turner insisted in December 1949 {{that she had}} nothing to do with it, saying: [...] "Everybody agrees that the script is still a pile of junk. I'm anxious to get started. By the time this one comes out, it will be almost three years <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> last on the screen, in The Three Musketeers. I don't think it's healthy to stay off the screen that long." ...|$|E
500|$|Phillip Leslie Wilcher {{was born}} on 16 March 1958 to Naomi Joy Thompson (8 April 1929 – 21 June 2005) and Leslie James Wilcher (born 16 January 1923), a World War II veteran. Wilcher grew up in Camperdown. As of 2004, he resided in Concord and owns no cell phone, watch, computer, or car: [...] "My entire life <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a boy was writing music and that has overshadowed everything. [...] I would be happy living in an {{oversized}} cardboard box with a piano and a blank sheet of manuscript paper".|$|E

500|$|Eight {{days after}} {{publication}} of the Guardian article, Joseph Bruce Tweeted [...] "I think [...] crazy how some press say we're a Christian band and act like we're all religious [...] I'm proud that we believe in God but I haven't been to church <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like 10.

[...] Christianity Today writer Mark Moring also challenged Ronson's characterization, writing that [...] "The guys in ICP haven't used the word 'Christian' or 'evangelical' [...] so let's not call them anything that they're not claiming for themselves".|$|E
500|$|Smith {{was born}} on July 3, 1964, in Paris. Her father, Joseph Smith, worked for United Press International in Paris and moved to Washington, D.C., in 1966, where he became The Washington Posts first {{official}} obituary editor. Her mother, Martha Mayor, was a paper conservator for the Freer and Sackler Galleries at the Smithsonian Institution. Smith's parents later divorced. Smith labeled her family [...] "upper crust and reserved". As a child, Smith was often teased because of her unusual voice. Smith has stated: [...] "I've sounded {{pretty much the same}} way <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> six. Maybe [...] a little deeper now." [...] She made her acting debut in a sixth-grade play.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale had {{an eight-year}} {{relationship}} with actor Michael Sheen from 1995 until 2003. They met when {{cast in a}} touring production of The Seagull in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards. In 1997, they voiced a radio production of Romeo and Juliet. Their daughter, Lily, was born in London in 1999. The actress has said she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] that Sheen never proposed, but {{felt as though she}} were married. Their relationship ended in early 2003, after the filming of Underworld. Beckinsale and Sheen remain close friends. She remarked in 2016: [...] "He's really dear, close family. He's somebody I've known <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 21 years old. I really love him a lot." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery in London mounted Mood Swings, an {{exhibition}} in which Dylan displayed seven wrought iron gates he had made. In a statement {{released by the}} gallery, Dylan said, [...] "I've been around iron all my life ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid. I {{was born and raised}} in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference." ...|$|E
500|$|Sevigny {{has only}} had {{long-term}} relationships with men, though in 2006 she stated to the New York Post Gossip column: [...] "I've questioned issues {{of gender and}} sexuality <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a teenager, and I did some experimenting." [...] In a later interview, she stated that she [...] "wouldn't call herself bisexual," [...] and that she could never see herself {{in a relationship with}} a woman. Nonetheless, she has been popular with the gay community throughout her career. Following her on and off relationship with Harmony Korine, which ended in the late 1990s, Sevigny dated British musician Jarvis Cocker, and later Matt McAuley, a member of the noise-rock band A.R.E. Weapons. Sevigny and McAuley ended their eight-year relationship in early 2008.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Mulder {{prepares to}} submit his {{application}} to be reassigned to X-Files division. Meanwhile, Mulder's boss, Deputy Director Kersh, informs Doggett {{that he intends}} to deny the request. As season eight was nearly over, the producers and writers decided to refuse Mulder re-admittance into the FBI as a way to segue John Doggett and Monica Reyes into the series as the new main stars of season nine. David Duchovny agreed with this method, noting, [...] "I completely thought it was correct that they should be trying to focus elsewhere, and that, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to come back for the second half of season eight, if you were to refocus on whatever Mulder's up to, you'd be in the same lousy situation at the beginning of season nine." ...|$|E

500|$|Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, John Mayer, Jennifer Hudson, Usher, Jermaine Jackson, and Shaheen Jafargholi {{performed}} at the event. Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson gave eulogies, while Queen Latifah read [...] "We Had Him", a poem written for the occasion by Maya Angelou. The Reverend Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: [...] "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway." [...] Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she told the crowd: [...] "Ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born, Daddy {{has been the best}} father you could ever imagine ... I just wanted to say I love him ... so much." [...] Reverend Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer.|$|E
500|$|... "Yoda" [...] was {{originally}} written by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{during the initial}} run of the second Star Wars movie, the 1980 American epic space opera The Empire Strikes Back. The film introduced the character of Yoda, the ancient Jedi Master who trains Luke {{in the ways of}} The Force following the demise of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Yankovic later jokingly said that, [...] "Prior to The Empire Strikes Back, the thought of writing a song about Yoda had never occurred to me." [...] He {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable piece to parody until one of his friends proposed that he use [...] "Lola"—"which I couldn't believe that I hadn't thought of myself, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> such a huge Kinks fan." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E

500|$|Garbage drummer and co-producer Butch Vig {{said that}} when the group contributed to film soundtracks, [...] "one of our fantasies would be to do the Bond theme or do the new Bond song." [...] Manson called herself {{a fan of the}} series, [...] "an {{institution}} I admire and has always captured my imagination <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a child", and the films had a [...] "sensibility quite similar to how we approach making music". The chance to record a Bond theme appealed to her because [...] "you know it's going down in movie history", and coming from Scotland, like original Bond Sean Connery, [...] "that's very close and inherent in our culture. It's not Bond if it's not Scottish!" [...] The singer considered Garbage's music and the series' concepts [...] "something that you can enjoy on the surface, but underneath there are lots of conflicting themes you can get into." ...|$|E
500|$|Tyler {{attended}} the Congressional Schools of Virginia, Breakwater School, and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine, {{before returning to}} New York City with her mother at age 12. She went to York Preparatory in New York City for {{junior high and high}} school after her mother researched the school to accommodate Tyler's ADHD. She graduated in 1995 and left to continue her acting career. [...] When asked about the way she spent her youth, Tyler said: [...] "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind of thing. I have no regrets. I love the way my life has gone." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music {{publishing}} company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. This deal {{gave him the}} rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others. In March 2007, Jackson gave a brief interview to the Associated Press in Tokyo, where he said: [...] "I've been {{in the entertainment industry}} <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 6 years old, and as Charles Dickens would say, 'It's been the best of times, the worst of times.' But I would not change my career ... While some have made deliberate attempts to hurt me, I take it in stride because I have a loving family, a strong faith and wonderful friends and fans who have, and continue, to support me." [...] That month, Jackson visited a U.S. Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet over 3,000 U.S. troops and their families. The hosts presented Jackson with a Certificate of Appreciation.|$|E
