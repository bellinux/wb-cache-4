25|$|While {{there are}} close to 4,000 {{varieties}} of potato, it has been bred into many standard or well-known varieties, {{each of which has}} particular agricultural or culinary attributes. In general, varieties are categorized into a few main groups, such as russets, reds, whites, yellows (also called Yukons) and purples—based on common characteristics. Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK. For culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness. Floury, or mealy (baking) potatoes have more starch (20–22%) than waxy (boiling) potatoes (16–18%). The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two potato starch compounds: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose, a long-chain molecule, diffuses from the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape when boiled.|$|E
50|$|Glutinous or waxy type of {{starches}} {{occur in}} maize, sorghum, wheat, and rice. An interesting characteristic of glutinous rice {{is that it}} stains red when iodine is added whereas non-glutinous rice stains blue. This phenomenon occurs when iodine is mixed with iodide to form tri-iodide and penta-iodide. Penta-iodide intercalates between the starch molecules and stains amylose and amylopectin blue and red respectively. The gelation and viscous texture of glutinous rice is due to amylopectin being more hygroscopic than amylose, so it has a higher affinity for water. Thus, water enters the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> causing it to swell, while the amylose leaves the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> and becomes part of a colloidal solution. In other words, the higher the amylopectin content, the higher the swelling of the <b>starch</b> <b>granule.</b>|$|E

30|$|Regarding the {{localization}} of <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> in culm, it can {{be observed}} that most <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> localized in the parenchyma cells, around nuclei or close to cell walls. As parenchyma cells are the storage tissue for the plant, abundant <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> can fill up the cells [16]. Similar trend was also reported in wheat stems that the <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> are found predominantly in parenchyma cells surrounding the vasculature [1].|$|R

50|$|Starch {{gelatinization}} is {{a process}} of breaking down the intermolecular bonds of starch molecules in the presence of water and heat, allowing the hydrogen bonding sites (the hydroxyl hydrogen and oxygen) to engage more water.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to understand the developmental regularity of wheat endosperm cells at different Days After Pollination (DAP) using microscopic and histochemical methods. Resin semi-thin sections of the endosperm and the enzymatically dissociated Starchy Endosperm Cells (SECs) were observed under a light microscope. The results showed that: (1) SECs were irregular-shaped and had two types of starch granules: large oval-shaped A-type <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> and small spherical B-type <b>starch</b> <b>granules.</b> (2) The growth shape of SECs was referred to as S-curve and the fastest cell growth period was at 16 – 24 DAP. (3) The largest increase and growth of A-type <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> were mainly at 4 – 16 DAP. B-type <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> increased rapidly after 16 DAP and made up over 90 % of the total <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> in SEC during the late stage of endosperm development. (4) The nuclei of SEC deformed and degenerated during the middle and late stages of endosperm development and eventually disappeared. However, <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> still increased and grew after the cell nuclei had degenerated.

50|$|Starch {{gelatinization}} occurs {{around the}} same time as when expansion stops and the cake sets or collapses. When <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> are exposed to heat and water, they swell, leaching out some starch and forming hydrogen bonds with other <b>starch</b> <b>granules.</b> About 96% of the <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> are gelatinized. <b>Starch</b> <b>granules</b> create very strong and rigid gel networks. The starch gel network is interspersed throughout the structure along with the aggregated protein network. The formation of the starch gel may interfere with expanding bubbles, causing them to burst and air to leave the cake. This would result in s collapsed cake.|$|R

50|$|Even {{though the}} {{amylopectin}} content {{plays a major}} role in the defined characteristic of viscosity in glutinous rice, factors such as heat also play a very important role in the swelling since it enhances the uptake of water into the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> significantly.

50|$|Still the {{extensive}} (mushroomed) agro-research {{did not lead}} to any large scale use in the feed industry due to analytical research analysing the pancreatic digestibility of starches of several genotypes. Waxy starch of the genome type ae, as also the genome type du and su2, for starches with a high amylose content, show an excellent digestibility. Thus, amylopectin, waxy starches alone, cannot be correlated to good digestibility. Sandsted suggests that digestibility could lie more in the structure of <b>starch</b> <b>granule,</b> in differences in bonding of the starch molecules and in possible anomalous linkages between the molecules.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pollen grains with a {{diameter}} of more than 10 ?m preferentially deposit in the upper airways. Their contribution to lower airway inflammation is unclear. One hypothesis is that lower airway inflammation is mainly caused by allergen containing pollen <b>starch</b> <b>granules,</b> which are released from the pollen grains and can easily enter the peripheral airways because of their smaller size. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differential effect of pollen grains and pollen <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> on nasal symptoms and lower airway inflammation. METHODS: In a 2 -period crossover design, 30 patients with allergic rhinitis and mild intermittent asthma underwent 2 allergen challenges on consecutive days in an environmental challenge chamber with either a mixture of pollen grains plus <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> or <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> only. End points were the total nasal symptom score (TNSS), nasal secretion weight, nasal flow, spirometry, and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). RESULTS: The presence of pollen grains had a significant and considerable effect on increase in TNSS and secretion weight and on decrease in nasal flow. <b>Starch</b> <b>granules</b> alone only had minimal effects on nasal symptoms. Challenges with <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> significantly increased eNO. Pollen {{had no effect on}} eNO. CONCLUSION: Pollen grains cause nasal symptoms but do not augment lower airway inflammation, whereas <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> trigger lower airway inflammation but hardly induce nasal symptoms...|$|R

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism of}} amylolysis of rice <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> was investigated using isolated <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> from wild-type, {{as well as}} SBEllb mutant and down-regulated lines. Fused granule agglomerates isolated from mutant and transgenic lines were hydrolysed at similar rates by amylases, and had similar crystalline patterns and thermal properties as individual granules. Surface pores, a feature previously only reported for A-polymorphic <b>starch</b> <b>granules,</b> were also observed in B- and C-polymorphic rice <b>starch</b> <b>granules.</b> Although the microscopic patterns of hydrolysis among granules with different crystalline polymorphs were qualitatively similar, the extent {{and the rate of}} amylolysis were different, suggesting that B-type crystalline polymorphs are intrinsically more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis than A-type in rice <b>starch</b> <b>granules.</b> It is proposed that the slightly longer branch lengths of amylopectin which leads to the formation of more stable B-type double helical structures compared to their A-type counterparts is the major parameter, with other factors such as granule size, surface pores and interior channels having secondary roles, in determining the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of rice <b>starch</b> <b>granules.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The {{starches}} in {{parboiled rice}} become gelatinized, then retrograded after cooling. Through gelatinization, amylose molecules leach {{out of the}} <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> network and diffuse into the surrounding aqueous medium outside the granules which, when fully hydrated are at maximum viscosity. The parboiled rice kernels should be translucent when wholly gelatinized. Cooling brings retrogradation whereby amylose molecules re-associate {{with each other and}} form a tightly packed structure. This increases the formation of type 3-resistant starch which can act as a prebiotic and benefit good health in humans. However, this also makes the kernels harder and glassier. Parboiled rice takes less time to cook and is firmer and less sticky. In North America parboiled rice is either partially or fully precooked before sale. Minerals such as zinc or iron are added, increasing their potential bioavailability in the diet.|$|E

50|$|Stromules {{are usually}} 0.35-0.85 µm in {{diameter}} and of variable length, from short beak-like projections to linear or branched structures up to 220 µm long. They are enclosed by {{the inner and outer}} plastid envelope membranes and enable the transfer of molecules as large as RuBisCO (~560 kDa) between interconnected plastids. Stromules occur in all cell types, but stromule morphology and the proportion of plastids with stromules vary from tissue to tissue and at different stages of plant development. In general, smaller plastids produce shorter stromules, although the largest plastids, mesophyll chloroplasts procuce relatively short stromules, indicating that other factors control stromule formation. In general, stromules are more abundant in cells containing non-green plastids, and in cells containing smaller plastids. The primary function of stromules is still unresolved, although the presence of stromules markedly increases the plastid surface area, potentially increasing transport to and from the cytosol. Other functions of stromules, such as transfer of macromolecules between plastids and <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> formation in cereal endosperm, may be restricted to particular tissues and cell types.|$|E
40|$|The Escherichia coli {{glycogen}} {{branching enzyme}} (GLGB) was fused {{to either the}} C- or N-terminus of a starch-binding domain (SBD) and expressed in two potato genetic backgrounds: the amylose-free mutant (amf) and an amylose-containing line (Kardal).

The altered <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> in both amf and Kardal backgrounds were visible from the initial stage of potato tuber development. High-throughput transcriptomic analysis showed that expression of GLGB/SBD fusion protein in potato tubers did not affect the expression level of most genes directly involved in the starch biosynthesis except for the up-regulation of a beta-amylase gene in Kardal background. The beta-amylase protein could be responsible for the degradation of the extra branches potentially introduced by GLGB...|$|R

40|$|Background: It is {{somewhat}} unclear how pollen allergens cause lower airway inflammation because pollen grains with {{a diameter of}} 30 mm are too large to reach the lower airways. One hypothesis is that lower airway inflammation is caused by allergen containing pollen <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> which are released from the pollen grains and can easily enter the peripheral airways due to their smaller size. However, no data are available which have investigated the contribution of pollen <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> to nasal symptoms and lower airway inflammation. Methods: In an 2 part cross over design 30 patients with allergic rhinitis and mild intermittent asthma underwent 4 h allergen challenges on two consecutive days in the Fraunhofer Environmental Challenge Chamber with either a normal and established mixture of pollen grains (4000 pollen/ m 3) plus <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> (app. 8000 granules/m 3) or only <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> (app. 8000 granules/m 3). Prior to and during the challenges, the total nasal symptom score (TNSS), spirometry, nasal secretion weight, and nasal flow measured by rhinomanometry was determined. Furthermore the exhaled NO was measured prior to challenge and 24 h after the second challenge in each part. Results: The presence of pollen grains had a significant and considerable effect on increase in TNSS and secretion weight and on decline in nasal flow. <b>Starch</b> <b>granules</b> alone only had minimal effects on nasal symptoms. Challenges with <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> alone increased exhaled NO. Pollen had no additional effect on exhaled NO. Conclusion: Pollen grains elicit nasal symptoms and <b>starch</b> <b>granules</b> trigger lower airway inflammation. This difference is probably caused by the different sizes of pollen grains and <b>starch</b> <b>granules...</b>|$|R

50|$|Noodle {{production}} {{starts with}} dissolving the salt, starch, and flavoring in water {{to form a}} mixture which is then added to the flour. The dough is then left {{for a period of}} time to mature, then for even distribution of the ingredients and hydration of the particles in the dough, it is kneaded. After it is kneaded, the dough gets made into two sheets compounded into one single noodle belt by being put through two rotating rollers. This process is repeated to develop gluten more easily as the sheet is folded and passed through the rollers several times. This will create the stringy and chewy texture found in instant noodles. When the noodle belt is made to the desired thickness by adjusting the gap in the rolls, it is then cut right away. Wavy noodles are made in a slow paced conveyor belt and are hindered by metal weights when coming out of the slitter which gives the noodle its wavy appearance. If the strands are to be molded into other shapes, liquid seasoning could be added as well. Once the noodles are shaped, they is ready to be steamed for 1-5 minutes at 100 C to improve its texture by gelatinizing the starch of the noodles. When steaming, the addition of water and heat breaks up the helix structure and crystalinity of amylose. Amylose begins to diffuse out of the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> and forms a gel matrix around the granule.|$|E
5000|$|Professor Donald's deeply {{innovative}} and productive research is in experimental soft condensed matter physics, incorporating polymer and colloidal physics, {{and more recently}} biological physics. Her early Cornell work on glassy polymer crazing remains very influential and was followed by insightful studies of shear deformation in liquid crystal polymers (LCPs).Here {{she was able to}} demonstrate the ubiquity of the so-called banded texture after shear of LCP's and study the underlying packing of the molecules by electron microscopy showing how they followed a serpentine trajectory in several thermotropics. She also carried out important work on lyotropic systems, including a synthetic polypeptide, studying its gelation and phase diagram.Donald's mid-career launch into biological physics followed naturally from this polymer work leading to the physics of food and thence to starch. The <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> structure and its changes during different processing histories were brilliantly analysed using a novel X-ray scattering technique. Structural changes during cooking, with the amylopectin molecule imaginatively treated as a side chain liquid crystalline polymer, brought understanding to different processing treatments. The misfolding of proteins forming amyloid fibrils is well recognized in the aetiology of many diseases, particularly those of old age. Donald's recent work has demonstrated that this important and challenging problem can be powerfully addressed by the approaches of polymer science and furthermore suggests an intriguing connection between the structures observed in both fields.Donald's impressive achievements in biological physics are strongly based on the imaginative use environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), neutron and X-ray scattering, optical microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. With ESEM in particular her success is supported by her many earlier pioneering investigations of its basic physics. To maintain this vital interchange between soft matter physics and biology, Donald has founded a well resourced Biology and Soft Systems (BSS) Group at the Cavendish.|$|E

40|$|The sun is {{the primary}} source of all {{chemical}} energy on the planet. Starch granules have evolved as storage deposits for captured light energy. Many complex biological functions take place at the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> surface, including <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> metabolism and defense. The starch granule-associated protein puroindoline is a known antimicrobial with unique functional and biological properties, attributed to the presence of a unique tryptophan-rich domain. To test puroindoline's tight association, puroindoline removed from the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> surface during water-washing was assessed. Washing more than eight times failed to further reduce puroindoline content of starch granules, suggesting a strong association of puroindoline with the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> surface. To identify the tryptophan-rich domain tightly associated with the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> surface, we used a combination of in situ tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry. We identiﬁed the tryptophan-rich domain of puroindoline directly bound to the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> surface of wheat. This is the first instance of the tryptophan-rich domain directly observed at the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> surface. In addition, using mass spectrometry, we determined that during development and maturation, wheat seeds appear to have resisted infection and lysed the pathogens where, upon desiccation, the molecular evidence remained fixed at the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> surface. Proteins with known antimicrobial activity were identified, as well as several proteins from the plant pathogens Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Fusarium graminearum, Magnaporthe grisea, Xanthomonas axonopodis, and X. oryzae. Future characterization may reveal previously unknown host-pathogen interactions. Finally, we have demonstrated that puroindoline, when expressed in the seeds of transgenic corn, will localize and associate with the <b>starch</b> <b>granule</b> surface in a pattern similar to the puroindoline expression pattern observed in wheat. Surprisingly, puroindoline expression in transgenic corn is correlated with an increase in total seed oil content...|$|E
