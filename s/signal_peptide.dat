The mature APOA5 protein spans a length of 366 amino acid residues, of which 23 amino acids code for the <b>signal</b> <b>peptide.</b> The molecular mass of the precursor was calculated to be 41 kDa, while the mature APOA5 protein was calculated to be 39 kDa.|$|E

In Caucasians, the common variants are inherited mostly in three haplotypes, which are characterised by two SNPs, namely rs662799 (T-1131˃C; in almost complete LD with A-3˃G, where the minor allele is associated with about 50% lower gene expression) and rs3135506 (Ser19˃Trp; C56˃G; alters the <b>signal</b> <b>peptide</b> and influences APOA5 secretion into plasma). There are also a further three common variants (A-3˃G, IVS+476 G˃A and T1259˃C) which are not necessary for haplotype characterisation.|$|E

40|$|Extra-cytoplasmic polypeptides {{are usually}} {{synthesized}} as 'preproteins' carrying amino-terminal, cleavable <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> and secreted across membranes by translocases. The main bacterial translocase comprises the SecYEG protein-conducting channel and the peripheral ATPase motor SecA. Most proteins {{destined for the}} periplasm and beyond are exported post-translationally by SecA. Preprotein targeting to SecA is thought to involve <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> and chaperones like SecB. Here we show that <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> have a new role beyond targeting: they are essential allosteric activators of the translocase. On docking on their binding groove on SecA, <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> act in trans to drive three successive states: first, 'triggering' that drives the translocase to a lower activation energy state; second, 'trapping' that engages non-native preprotein mature domains docked with high affinity on the secretion apparatus; and third, 'secretion' during which trapped mature domains undergo several turnovers of translocation in segments. A significant contribution by mature domains renders <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> less critical in bacterial secretory protein targeting than currently assumed. Rather, it is their function as allosteric activators of the translocase that renders <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> essential for protein secretion.

25|$|Ricin is {{synthesized}} in the endosperm of {{castor oil}} plant seeds. The ricin precursor protein is 576 amino acid residues {{in length and}} contains a <b>signal</b> <b>peptide</b> (residues 1–35), the ricin A chain (36–302), a linker peptide (303–314), and the ricin B chain (315–576). The N-terminal signal sequence delivers the prepropolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then the <b>signal</b> <b>peptide</b> is cleaved off. Within the lumen of the ER the propolypeptide is glycosylated and a protein disulfide isomerase catalyzes disulfide bond formation between cysteines 294 and 318. The propolypeptide is further glycosylated within the Golgi apparatus and transported to protein storage bodies. The propolypeptide is cleaved within protein bodies by an endopeptidase to produce the mature ricin protein that is composed of a 267 residue A chain and a 262 residue B chain that are covalently linked by a single disulfide bond.|$|E

It is thought that, once trimerisation has occurred, these beta strands further fold into a 12-stranded beta-barrel.

40|$|Protein {{targeting}} to specified cellular compartments {{is essential}} to maintain cell function and homeostasis. In eukaryotic cells, two major pathways rely on N-terminal <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> to target proteins to either the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria. In this study, we show that the ER <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> of the prion protein-like protein shadoo, the neuropeptide hormone somatostatin and the amyloid precursor protein have the property to mediate alternative targeting to mitochondria. Remarkably, the targeting direction of these <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> is determined by structural elements within the nascent chain. Each of the identified <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> promotes efficient ER import of nascent chains containing alpha-helical domains, but targets unstructured polypeptides to mitochondria. Moreover, we observed that mitochondrial targeting by the ER <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> correlates inversely with ER import efficiency. When ER import is compromised, targeting to mitochondria is enhanced, whereas improving ER import efficiency decreases mitochondrial targeting. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism of dual targeting to either the ER or mitochondria that is mediated by structural features within the nascent chain...|$|R

25|$|The Sec-dependent {{system is}} divided into three {{pathways}}. TAAs are one of those pathways and also go by the name type Vc secretion pathway. The mechanism is split into two.

The <b>signal</b> <b>peptide</b> on the N-terminus acts as a temporary tether to hold it in place. Next, it must move to the outer membrane. The trimerisation aids translocation, and no translocation would occur without its beta-barrel membrane anchor.

To understand their properties and functions, we expressed and purified soluble forms of gE and gI in the baculovirus system. Extracellular domains of gE and gI were cloned into baculoviruses, using either native or insect-derived <b>signal</b> <b>peptides.</b> Each recombinant virus yielded soluble protein in culture medium although {{a higher level of}} secretion was achieved with insect-derived <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> in recombinant gE baculoviruses. A soluble gE–gI complex was formed by co-infecting insect cells with recombinant gE and gI baculoviruses and detected by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting analyses.

Interestingly, two recombinant gI proteins in which <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> were replaced with insect-derived <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> did not associate with gE. Amino-terminal sequencing and site-specific mutational studies showed that the replacement of only the <b>signal</b> <b>peptides</b> did not prevent complex formation but alterations in the processed amino-terminus of gI abrogated its ability to complex with gE.

25|$|In prokaryotes {{translation}} generally {{occurs at}} the point of transcription (co-transcriptionally), often using a messenger RNA that is {{still in the process of}} being created. In eukaryotes translation can occur in a variety of regions of the cell depending on where the protein being written is supposed to be. Major locations are the cytoplasm for soluble cytoplasmic proteins and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum for proteins that are for export from the cell or insertion into a cell membrane. Proteins that are supposed to be expressed at the endoplasmic reticulum are recognised part-way through the translation process. This is governed by the signal recognition particle—a protein that binds to the ribosome and directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum when it finds a <b>signal</b> <b>peptide</b> on the growing (nascent) amino acid chain.|$|E

A robust protein, OSM is stable between pH2 and 11 and resistant to heating for one hour at 56°C. A partial amino acid sequence allowed the isolation of human OSM cDNA and subsequently genomic clones. The full cDNA clone of hOSM encodes a 252 amino acid precursor, the first 25 amino acids of which functions as a secretory <b>signal</b> <b>peptide,</b> which on removal yields the soluble 227 amino acid pro-OSM.

They are also termed S-type lectins due to their dependency on disulphide bonds for stability and carbohydrate binding. There have been 15 galectins discovered in mammals, encoded by the LGALS genes, which are numbered in a consecutive manner. Only galectin-1, -2, -3, -4, -7, -8, -9, -10, -12 and -13 {{have been identified in}} humans.

Members of the galectin family have also been discovered in other mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, nematodes, sponges, and some fungi. Unlike the majority of lectins they are not membrane bound, but soluble proteins with both intra- and extracellular functions.
