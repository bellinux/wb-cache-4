5|$|The {{king vulture}} has, {{relative}} to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the New World vultures. This bill has a hooked tip {{and a sharp}} cutting edge. The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail. The irises of its eyes are white and bordered by bright red <b>sclera.</b> Unlike some New World vultures, the king vulture lacks eyelashes. It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.|$|E
5|$|This type of dojūtsu {{was awakened}} by Boruto Uzumaki, Naruto's and Hinata's son. When {{activated}} either at will or subconsciously , {{the color of the}} eye changes, sporting a light blue Iris surrounded by black <b>sclera.</b> It is capable of detecting if a person is possessed by an evil entity, and detecting weak points in a chakra system, thus enabling Boruto to strike it with precision, this ocular jutsu may have other visual powers thou they are yet to be seen. Boruto can awaken it only in his right eye subconsciously, though in the future, he became trained enough to activate it at will.|$|E
5|$|Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had {{starred in}} the title role of Roddenberry's earlier series on NBC, The Lieutenant; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes, which were {{produced}} by an expert contact lens fabricator who sandwiched wrinkled tinfoil between two <b>sclera</b> contact lenses which covered the entire eye. These were outdated even in the 1960s and dangerous {{to the health of the}} actors' eyes. Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them almost impossible to use. He needed to raise his face and sight along his nose in order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an arrogant and haughty demeanor.|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} polymeric collagen of {{the skin}} of 19 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta has been examined. In those with severe bone disease, who often have white <b>sclerae,</b> this collagen fraction is less resistant to depolymerization than that of age-matched controls, though the total amount is normal. In patients with less severe bone disease, whose <b>sclerae</b> are usually blue, the polymeric collagen may have normal stability but the total amount is reduced. These results suggest defective cross-linking of collagen in severe osteogenesis imperfecta...|$|R

50|$|As {{the nerve}} fibers {{pass through the}} lamina cribrosa <b>sclerae</b> they lose their {{medullary}} sheaths and are continued onward through the choroid and retina as simple axis-cylinders.|$|R
5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the <b>sclera</b> is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E

40|$|T H E disease {{which has}} been called fragilitas ossium, Lobstein's disease, 1 or osteopsathyrosis is {{characterized}} by the remarkable symptomatic triad of blue <b>sclerae,</b> brittle bones, and deafness. The general features of the disease have been well summarized by Apert, 2 and by Ottley, 3 who give comprehensive re-views of the literature. Ottley lists the following as characterizing the syndrome of osteopsathyrosis: 1. Fragility of bone. 2. Peculiar conformation and structure of bone. 3. Peculiar shape of the skull. 4. Laxity of the ligaments. 5. Blue coloration of the <b>sclerae.</b> 6. Deafness. 7. Abnormal electrical reaction of the muscles. 8.

25|$|Ocular tumors* in {{dogs are}} found in the eyelid, conjunctiva, third eyelid, cornea, <b>sclera,</b> iris, ciliary body, retina, choroid, optic nerve, and orbit. The most common types are Meibomian gland adenoma (eyelid), {{papilloma}} (eyelid), melanoma (eyelid, conjunctiva, <b>sclera,</b> iris, ciliary body, choroid), squamous cell carcinoma (conjunctiva), adenoma (ciliary body), adenocarcinoma (ciliary body), lymphoma (retina, choroid, ciliary body), medulloepithelioma (retina, choroid), ganglioglioma (retina, choroid), osteosarcoma (orbit), mast cell tumor (orbit), and optic nerve sheath meningioma.|$|E
25|$|The human cornea borders {{with the}} <b>sclera</b> via the corneal limbus. In lampreys, the cornea is solely an {{extension}} of the <b>sclera,</b> and is separate from the skin above it, but in more advanced vertebrates it is always fused with the skin to form a single structure, albeit one composed of multiple layers. In fish, and aquatic vertebrates in general, the cornea plays no role in focusing light, since it has virtually the same refractive index as water.|$|E
40|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an {{inherited}} disorder of connective tissue involving genes encoding {{the synthesis of}} type 1 collagen.

50|$|Astrocytes {{can heal}} {{partially}} the lesion leaving a scar. These scars (<b>sclerae)</b> are the known plaques or lesions usually reported in MS. A repair process, called remyelination, {{takes place in}} early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath. Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons.|$|R
50|$|Of great {{importance}} are the novaculites from Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas which were deposited {{at the close}} of the Devonian. The novaculites are milky-white, thinly-bedded cherts of great hardness; they underwent a low-grade metamorphism during the Ouachita orogeny. Their mineralogy consists of microquartz with a grain-size of 5 to 35 µ. The microquartz is derived from the <b>sclerae</b> of sponges and the tests of radiolarians.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} {{surgical}} approach currently {{used for the}} treatment of glaucoma is trabeculectomy, in which the <b>sclera</b> is punctured to alleviate intraocular pressure.|$|E
25|$|Jaundice may be {{noticeable}} in the <b>sclera</b> of {{the eyes}} at levels of about 2 to 3 mg/dl (34 to 51 μmol/l), and in the skin at higher levels. For conversion, 1mg/dl = 17.1 µmol/l.|$|E
25|$|Ocular {{melanosis}} (OM) is {{a disease}} of the eye which in dogs is almost found exclusively in the Cairn Terrier. The disease is caused by an increase of melanocytes in the iris, <b>sclera,</b> and surrounding structures.|$|E
50|$|Like tafluprost and travoprost, {{latanoprost}} is an ester prodrug that {{is activated}} {{to the free}} acid in the cornea. Also like the related drugs, latanoprost acid is an analog of prostaglandin F2α {{that acts as a}} selective agonist at the prostaglandin F receptor. Prostaglandins increase the <b>sclera's</b> permeability to aqueous fluid. So, an increase in prostaglandin activity increases outflow of aqueous fluid thus lowering intraocular pressure.|$|R

40|$|Presented at the American College of Physicians New Mexico Chapter Scientific Meeting, 10 / 28 / 2011, Albuquerque, NM. A 58 {{year old}} male {{presented}} to the emergency department with worsening jaundice and icteric <b>sclerae.</b> His other symptoms included pruritis, dark urine, yellow colored stool, and fatigue. Review of systems included a ten-pound weight loss over two weeks. The patient denied excessive alcohol or drug use. Pertinent exam findings included diffuse jaundice, icteric <b>sclerae,</b> and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory findings showed elevated alkaline phosphate (935), total bilirubin (23. 7), and direct bilirubin (18. 2); as well as decreased total protein (5. 2) and albumin (1. 8). Transaminase levels were relatively unremarkable – mildly elevated AST (74) and normal ALT (66). Extensive work up for other etiologies was unremarkable except for elevated ferretin (1191) and CA 19 - 9 (113). Abdominal ultrasound, CT, and MRCP were also unremarkable and non-diagnostic for PSC. A liver core needle biopsy demonstrated histologic features consistent with PSC. Colonoscopy showed no evidence of IBD, and biopsy samples were negative for malignancy...|$|R

25|$|Telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels) {{over the}} white (<b>sclera)</b> of the eyes, making them appear bloodshot. These are not {{apparent}} in infancy and may first appear at age 5–8 years. Telangiectasia may also appear on sun-exposed areas of skin.|$|E
25|$|Vitrectomy {{is often}} done under local anesthesia. The doctor makes a tiny {{incision}} in the <b>sclera,</b> or {{white of the}} eye. Next, a small instrument is placed into the eye to remove the vitreous and insert the saline solution into the eye.|$|E
50|$|Carotenemia most {{commonly}} occurs in vegetarians and young children. Carotenemia is more easily appreciated in light-complexioned people, {{and it may}} present chiefly as an orange discolouration of the palms and the soles in more darkly pigmented persons. Carotenemia does not cause selective orange discoloration of the conjunctival membranes over the <b>sclerae</b> (whites of the eyes), and thus is usually easy to distinguish from the yellowing of the skin and conjunctiva caused by bile pigments in states of jaundice.|$|R
40|$|The author {{discusses}} five infants, aged {{eight to}} 11 months, with carotenemia secondary to excessive consumption of carotene-containing foods. These infants had white <b>sclerae</b> {{in spite of}} yellow discoloration of the skin. Simple elimination of these foods led to clearing of the yellow skin color and normalization of serum carotene levels. All infants had normal vitamin A levels, white cell count, serum glucose, lipids, liver- and thyroid-function tests. The benign nature of this condition is emphasized...|$|R
5000|$|The skin's {{pigmentation}} (in this condition) {{has been}} described as uniformly gray, grayish purple, slate gray, or grayish blue, and is usually limited to exposed portions of the body. It may involve the conjunctivae over the <b>scleras</b> but usually not the oral mucosa. Location of pigment predominantly in the upper dermis leads to the blue component of skin color through the scattering phenomenon. It is much less likely to be deposited in the nails and hair.|$|R
25|$|Their {{body color}} is a grayish green flat color marked by {{five to six}} bold pale gray chevrons {{alternating}} with dark gray to black chevrons.

25|$|Collie eye anomaly (CEA) is a congenital, inherited, {{bilateral}} {{eye disease}} of dogs involving the retina, choroid, and <b>sclera.</b> It {{can be a}} mild disease or cause blindness. It is known to occur in Smooth and Rough Collies, Shetland Sheepdogs, Australian Shepherds, Border Collies, and Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the ulcer depends somewhat on the cause. Central ulcers are typically caused by trauma, dry eye, or exposure from facial nerve paralysis or exophthalmos. Ulcers in the inferior nasal cornea {{may be caused by}} foreign material trapped under the third eyelid. Entropion or distichiae may cause ulceration of the peripheral cornea. Immune-mediated eye disease can cause ulcers at the border of the cornea and <b>sclera.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{clinical and}} biochemical findings from 132 probands with nonlethal forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) whose fibroblasts {{were sent to}} the University of Washington for diagnostic studies in the years 1981 - 87. In cells from 86 % of probands with nonlethal OI we identified biochemical alterations compatible with heterozygosity for a mutation that affected expression or structure of alpha chains of type I procollagen. We observed two major biochemical phenotypes. Cells from 40 probands (group A) secreted about half the normal amount of normal type I procollagen and no identifiable abnormal molecules; these patients were generally of normal stature, rarely had bone deformity or dentinogenesis imperfecta, and had blue <b>sclerae.</b> Cells from 74 probands (group B) produced and secreted normal and abnormal type I procollagen molecules; these patients were usually short and had bone deformity and dentinogenesis imperfecta, and many had grey or blue-grey <b>sclerae.</b> In cells from an additional 18 probands (group C) we were unable to identify altered type I procollagen synthesis or structure. Detection of these abnormalities has value in the determination of mode of inheritance and in the prediction of clinical severity...|$|R
5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis {{refers to the}} scars (<b>sclerae</b> – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, {{and the rest of}} the body. The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.|$|R
5000|$|Jean Lobstein {{is remembered}} for {{contributions}} {{made in the}} field of pathological anatomy. He described a disorder known today as osteogenesis imperfecta type I, which is sometimes called [...] "Lobstein's disease". This disease is an hereditary, generalized connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility and a blue-gray <b>sclerae</b> of the eyes. In 1813 he founded an impressive pathological museum in Strasbourg, a collection that remained intact until the years following the Franco-Prussian War, when its artifacts were either dispersed or lost.|$|R
