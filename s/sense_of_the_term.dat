5|$|In 1909, Liliʻuokalani {{brought an}} {{unsuccessful}} {{lawsuit against the}} United States under the Fifth Amendment seeking {{the return of the}} Hawaiian Crown Lands. The US courts invoked an 1864 Kingdom Supreme Court decision over a case involving the Dowager Queen Emma and Kamehameha V, using it against her. In this decision the courts found that the Crown Lands were not necessarily the private possession of the monarch in the strictest <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{the great}} expeditions were over, the old trade routes closed, and the Viking ships no longer made ready each spring for voyages to east and west, then {{that meant the}} end of the carving and setting up of rune stones in the proper <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term.</b> They may be called the monuments of the Viking voyages, and the {{sensitive}} reader may catch in many of their inscriptions the Viking's love of adventure and exploits of boisterous daring.|$|E

5|$|The seventh symphony, the Sinfonia antartica (1952), a {{by-product}} of the composer's score for Scott of the Antarctic, has consistently divided critical opinion on whether it can be properly classed as a symphony. Alain Frogley in Grove argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener, it is neither a true symphony in the understood <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The work is in five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano {{in the first and}} last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for wind machine.|$|E

25|$|In {{theoretical}} investigation {{there is}} only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation: an increase in the quantity of money (in the broader <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in the broader <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term),</b> so that a fall in the objective exchange-value of money must occur.|$|E
30|$|We {{believe that}} beyond <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> structure, {{organization}} mode can {{be associated with}} HRM practices.Pichault and Nizet (2000) defend this hypothesis by retaining a configurational and contextual approach in <b>the</b> Pettigrew (1987) <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms.</b> <b>The</b> following insert summarizes <b>the</b> five models <b>of</b> HRM that appear within specific organizational configurations.|$|R
50|$|Sense (2) is {{in general}} {{stronger}} than sense (1), and caution {{must be taken}} to distinguish between the two senses. For example, some variation in <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> locally compact arises from different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> locally.|$|R

25|$|Beginning in the mid-1970s, U.S. Federal courts {{began using}} the term “tax protester” in still another, more narrow sense—to {{describe}} persons who raised frivolous arguments about the legality of Federal taxes, particularly income taxes.

25|$|In {{non-specific}} usage, {{the term}} Amesha Spenta denotes all the divinities that furthered or strengthened creation {{and all that}} are bounteous and holy. It not only includes the ahuras (a term that in the Gathas is also used in the plural but only includes Ahura Mazda by name), but also all the other divinities that are alluded to in these texts. In this non-specific <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> Amesha Spenta is then equivalent to the term yazata.|$|E
25|$|In geology and geography, {{a strict}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> would {{incorporate}} the Delaware River's main drainage basin, and so encompass major tributaries {{such as the}} Schuylkill River and Lehigh River and their valleys or sub-basins. These extensions also apply culturally with decreasing degree gradually decreased by proximal distance because the ease of land travel enables {{a great deal of}} daily interaction; for example, the large number of commuters who travel daily 45–90 minutes creates cultural blends and parallel values.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages of the First Punic War (264 BC) the first known Roman gladiatorial munus was held, {{described}} as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a Roman military aristocrat. The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice, probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose. Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods, and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods. The event was therefore a sacrificium in the strict <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice.|$|E

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1900-1915, advocates of {{scientific}} management, such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Harlow Stafford Person, recognized that their ideas {{could be applied}} not only to manual labour and skilled trades but also to management, professions, and sales.

25|$|Thus, in English law all {{errors of}} law are {{now to be}} {{considered}} as jurisdictional and ultra vires in a broad <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term.</b> This implies that ouster clauses should not be effective against any error of law. The Anisminic principle was upheld by the Supreme Court in R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal (2011) so that {{the rule of law}} is promoted, among other reasons. Since it is practically immaterial to the victim of an error of law whether it is a jurisdictional error or otherwise, it would be manifestly unjust if judicial review was precluded when a non-jurisdictional error was egregious and obvious, but allowed for a small jurisdictional error.|$|E
25|$|However, in English law, the {{decision}} in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1968) is seen as having done away with the distinction, even though {{that was not the}} intention of the House of Lords. In R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page (1992), it was held that since Parliament only confers power on a public authority on the basis that it is to be exercised on the correct legal basis, any misdirection in law will render {{the decision}} ultra vires. Thus, in general, all errors of law are now considered as jurisdictional and ultra vires in a broad <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> and the High Court can intervene to correct them.|$|E
25|$|A creole {{language}} is a stable natural language developed from a mixture of different languages. While the concept {{is similar to that}} of a mixed or hybrid language, in the strict <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> a mixed/hybrid language has derived from two or more languages, to such an extent that it is no longer closely related to the source languages. Creoles also differ from pidgins in that, while a pidgin has a highly simplified linguistic structure that develops as a means of establishing communication between two or more disparate language groups, a creole {{language is}} more complex, used for day-to-day purposes in a community, and acquired by children as a native language. Creole languages, therefore, have a fully developed vocabulary and system of grammar.|$|E
