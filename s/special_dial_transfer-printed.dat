2500|$|Like the Varityper {{with which}} it competed, the {{original}} machine required that material be typed twice if the type was to be justified. The first time was to measure {{the length of the}} line and count the spaces, recording measurements read from a <b>special</b> <b>dial</b> on the right margin. [...] The second time it was typed, the operator set the measurements into the dial to set justification for each line. The process was tedious and slow, but provided a way to get camera-ready, proportionally spaced, justified copy from a desk-sized machine.|$|R

As such, N11s are restricted by NANP design to N = 2 through 9, creating the 8 allowable N11s. This is also why NPAs (Area Codes) or 7-digit phone numbers (designated by NXX-XXXX) cannot have a 0 or 1 as the first digit (N).|$|R

40|$|Only a {{few years}} ago Argentina had a very low Internet {{penetration}} compared with its neighbouring countries in Latin America. In 1993, for example, the country had only 0. 05 Internet hosts per 10, 000 people, while Chile had as many as 1. 01 (Brazil had 0. 27, Mexico had 0. 40 and Venezuela 0. 23). By July 1999, however, the situation had changed in some fundamental ways. While countries like Chile and Brazil had 25 Internet hosts per 10, 000 people, Argentina was enjoying the presence of almost 39 Internet hosts per 10, 000 people. The number of estimated users had climbed from some 70, 000 in late 1996 to more than 900, 000 in mid- 1999; while the number of Internet accounts had grown almost nine fold, from 40, 000 in late 1996 to some 348, 000 in mid- 1999. The poor market prospect that reigned {{in the early days of}} the Internet had certainly been reversed. Argentina became, by late 1999, the country with the highest Internet host density among the large economies of Latin America. A number of obvious questions come to mind when confronted with this puzzle: How can it be that in a short period of time the country reversed the situation in which it was in 1993 ? What happened between 1993 and 1999 that the number of connections to the Internet grew more than 255 percent a year, shooting the hosts density from 0. 05 to 39 Internet hosts per 10, 000 people? This case study attempts to provide some clues to the Internet growth puzzle in Argentina. Most analysts would agree that changes in market structure and profile are not the product of a single factor. This paper argues, however, that the Internet boom in Argentina lies mainly on two main policy decisions: (a) the reduction in the price of leased lines and (b) the reduction of tariffs for local calls through the creation of a <b>special</b> <b>dialling</b> scheme for Internet-related calls. The paper pays special attention to these regulatory changes, their impact on the evolution of the Internet in Argentina, and the subsequent benefits that the Net has brought to both businesses and consumers.

50|$|South Africa has {{switched}} to a closed numbering system. Within South Africa, from 16 January 2007 it became mandatory to dial the full 10 digit telephone number including the zero in the three-digit area code even for local calls (for example: 011 must be dialled from within Johannesburg). Area codes within the system are generally organised geographically. All telephone numbers are 9 digits long (but always prefixed by 0 for calls within South Africa), except for certain Telkom <b>special</b> services. When <b>dialled</b> from another country, the '0' is omitted and replaced with the appropriate international access code and the country code 27.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as pulse dialing (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the local loop between the telephone exchange and the calling party's telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the rotary dial as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of <b>special</b> subscriber trunk <b>dialing</b> equipment. Operators used an earlier type of multi-frequency signaling.|$|R
50|$|When built, the {{building}} had its business office on the first floor, with space for customers to transact business with the phone company, public telephone booths, and rooms for long distance calls. The next 12 floors contained telephone equipment, such as long distance switchboards, other <b>special</b> switchboards, and <b>dial</b> central office equipment for the MAin, ATlantic, and BRidgeport central offices. There were also breakroom facilities and a lunch room for telephone operators who were off duty. The 14th, 25th, and 26th floors were mechanical floors. Finally, a tower on the 15th through 24th floors housed administrative offices of the telephone company. There were also three basement floors with power and heating equipment, along with cable vaults. The building measured 346 ft above street level, 42 ft in the basements, and had 26 stories. Many of these stories were somewhat taller than those in office buildings due {{to the size of}} central office equipment. The building had 24000 sq ft of floor space, and housed about 1,000 employees.|$|R

All the trends are moving towards restructure the Costs, to be a guide for Cost Reduction efforts, and using the Costs in analyzing business rather than income followed in a traditional Accounting. This changes were reflected in searching a new techniques for measuring the values of activities can not be measured by a traditional Accounting measuring, as a measure of pollution in values in environmental activity, Which Accounting thought efforts to be restructured and modeled under a new Accounting measuring techniques, called (CBS) Cost Breakdown Structure technique. that USEPA decided in 2014 to used it as a costs measuring approach and modeling for restructure the components of unit cost to contamination drinking water for three types of drinking water treatment techniques are(Packed tower aeration, Multistage bubble aeration, and granular activated carbon). Although, US EPA used this technique in measuring treatment costs for various contaminants, but it focus on aeration or liquid phase of treatment process, and did not worked on radiological properties of Radon. The dangerous nature of Radon need a <b>special</b> technology to <b>dialing</b> with it, because of its a radioactive nature. The alpha particles emitting from radon during its decay, and the exposure for the radioactive Radon particles by inhalation or ingestion causes cancer. So, {{there is a need for}} a technique to controlling, treating contaminate levels of Radon to a achieve the safety levels, as well as study the economic feasibility of treatment costs and Compliance Costs. By using a new innovative treatment technique called (CICS) "Closed Integrated Circuit System", to measuring treatment costs of Radon pollution, with compliance cost, by designing a special CBS" Cost Breakdown Structure" to achieve the safety a contaminant levels issued by US EPA. The results indicated high accuracy measurements, and the success of anew technique in reducing Radon contamination levels. At reduction rate 81 % up to 36. 66 Bq/m 3, which is more security than UA EPA level. The treatment operation costs is (4. 616 ID/gallon), and the compliance cost at (7. 396 ID per/gallon) which show the advantage more than 150 %...|$|R
