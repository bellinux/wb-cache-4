5|$|Soon after, Catherine conceived, but the child, a girl, was <b>stillborn</b> on 31 January 1510. About {{four months}} later, Catherine again became pregnant. On New Year's Day 1511, the child – Henry – was born. After the grief {{of losing their}} first child, the couple were pleased to have a boy and festivities were held, {{including}} a two-day joust known as the 1511 Westminster Tournament. However, the child died seven weeks later. Catherine had two <b>stillborn</b> sons in 1514 and 1515, but gave birth in February 1516 to a girl, Mary. Relations between Henry and Catherine had been strained, but they eased slightly after Mary's birth.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the contribution of Toxoplasma gondii to reproductive failure using nested PCR and histopathological examination of fetuses, <b>stillborns</b> and placentas. We examined 245 organs of fetuses and 28 placentas from 35 abortions and <b>stillborns</b> from naturally occurring miscarriages in sheep in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. At necropsy, fragments of brain, cerebellum, medulla, lung, heart, spleen, liver and placenta were taken for nested PCR and histopathological tests. Pathological examination revealed macroscopic lesions, suggesting T. gondii infection in 5 / 35 (14. 3 %) of the placentas. The histopathological examination revealed no lesions characteristic of toxoplasmosis in the organs investigated. In the five placentas, lesions consistent with toxoplasmosis were observed as an inflammatory non-suppurative infiltrate, along with multiple necrosis and mineralization. Nested PCR showed three aborted fetuses and two <b>stillborns</b> (14. 3 %) to test positive for T. gondii, with DNA amplification in all organs and the placenta, especially the heart and the placenta, which are the tissues of choice. This study substantiates the theory that T. gondii is involved in miscarriages and stillbirths and in the placentas of naturally infected sheep in Brazil. Such findings have not previously been described in the national literature...|$|R
25|$|Males can {{ejaculate}} {{multiple times}} in a row, and this {{increases the likelihood of}} pregnancy as well as decreases the number of <b>stillborns.</b> Multiple ejaculation also means that males can mate with multiple females, and they exhibit more ejaculatory series when there are several oestrous females present. Males also copulate at shorter intervals than females. In group mating, females often switch partners.|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the completeness {{and accuracy of}} reporting on Wisconsin fetal death report forms (FDF) through case by case comparison with data from the Wisconsin Stillbirth Service Project (WiSSP), which uses extensive protocols for etiologic investigation of <b>stillborns.</b> Fetal deaths are underreported: no FDF was submitted for 17. 8 per cent of fetal deaths evaluated through the WiSSP. For those for whom FDF were submitted, fetal anomalies were often unrecognized or unreported: only 60 per cent of <b>stillborns</b> identified by the WiSSP as having fetal anomalies had any indication {{of the presence of}} such anomalies on FDF. When causes of death were classified into fetal, placental/cord, maternal/environmental, and unknown, comparison of reported underlying cause of death revealed marked inaccuracies on FDF. Placental/cord causes reported on FDF often could not be documented subsequently while, in contrast, fetal causes of death were underreported. Few accurate fetal diagnoses were present on FDF. Even among common lethal malformations misdiagnosis occurred frequently...|$|R

5|$|Mary {{was born}} on 18 February 1516 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, London. She was {{the only child of}} King Henry VIII by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive infancy. Her mother had many miscarriages; before Mary's birth, four {{previous}} pregnancies had resulted in a <b>stillborn</b> daughter and three short-lived or <b>stillborn</b> sons, including Henry, Duke of Cornwall. She was baptised into the Catholic faith at the Church of the Observant Friars in Greenwich three days after her birth. Her godparents included her great-aunt the Countess of Devon, Lord Chancellor Thomas Wolsey, and the Duchess of Norfolk. Henry VIII's cousin once removed, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, stood sponsor for Mary's confirmation, which was held immediately after the baptism. The following year, Mary became a godmother herself when she was named as one of the sponsors of her cousin Frances Brandon. In 1520, the Countess of Salisbury was appointed Mary's governess. Sir John Hussey, later Lord Hussey, was her chamberlain from 1530, and his wife, Lady Anne, daughter of George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent, was one of Mary's attendants.|$|E

40|$|Background: Microtia is a {{congenital}} defect characterized by disturbances {{in the size}} and form of the ear lobe. Anotia corresponds {{to the absence of}} the ear lobe. Aim: To study the prevalence of microtia and anotia at the Maternity of the University of Chile Clinical Hospital. Material and methods. Analysis of the database of the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Defects (ECLAMC). All newborns and <b>stillborns</b> with {{congenital defect}}s are incorporated to this database. Results. The prevalence of microtia-anotia in the period 1982 - 2001 was 8. 7 per 10, 000 born alive. Chilean hospitals have an uniform prevalence of 5. 2 per 10, 000 born alive. Thirty seven percent presented as isolated malformations and the rest were associated to other defects. Eighty six percent of non isolated cases were pan of a syndrome. Sixty eight percent were mild or moderate firms and the rest, severe forms. Two cases were <b>stillborns</b> and two newborns died before hospital discharge. Conclusions:. The prevalence of microtia in this hospital and in the rest of Chilean hospitals is significantly higher than in the rest of non Chilean hospitals participating in the ECLAMC, that is 4. 1 per 10, 000 born alive...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of hyaline}} membrane {{disease of the}} newborn remains controversial. In an attempt to identify early morphologic lesions of hyaline membrane disease, the authors reviewed the histologic sections of lung of all infants that survived for 12 hours or less and all <b>stillborns</b> on which autopsies had been performed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1975 and 1983. Subjects showing more than trivial autolysis or with major congenital malformations {{were excluded from the}} study. Among the 70 live births included in this study, 10 (14 %) surviving for 7 - 12 hours had typical hyaline membranes, which are composed of predominantly necrotic epithelial cells. Nine (13 %) subjects surviving for 1 - 10 hours had hyaline membranes plus intraairway necrotic epithelial cell clumps, and 15 (21 %) subjects surviving for 10 seconds to 4 hours had only intraairway necrotic epithelial cell clumps. Among the 44 <b>stillborns,</b> 3 (7 %) had intraairway necrotic epithelial cell clumps, and 1 of them given resuscitation had hyaline membranes in addition. The results suggest that the initial lesion of hyaline membrane disease of the newborn is necrosis of respiratory epithelial cells, and that this process may begin before birth...|$|R

40|$|Th e {{blockade}} of peripheral nerves carries a certain risk of unwanted complications, which can follow after unintentional intraneural injection {{of a local}} anesthetic. Up till today, the re-search of measuring injection pressure {{has been based on}} animal models, even though the histological structure of periphery nerve is diff erent for animal and human population, so the application pressure which presages intraneural injection in human population is still un-known. As material in performing this study there have been used Wistar rats and de-livered <b>stillborns.</b> After bilateral access to the median nerve, we applied ml of lidocaine with epinephrine, with the help of automatic syringe charger. Th e needle was at fi rst placed perineural on one side, and then intraneural {{on the other side of}} both examination groups.

5|$|Developed in {{response}} to the American Polaris programme, the Tu-142 grew out of the need for a viable Soviet ASW platform. It succeeded the <b>stillborn</b> Tu-95PLO project, Tupolev's first attempt at modifying the Tu-95 for maritime use. The Tu-142 differed from the Tu-95 in having a stretched fuselage to accommodate specialised equipment for its ASW and surveillance roles, a reinforced undercarriage to support rough-field capability, improved avionics and weapons, and enhancements to general performance. The Tu-142's capability was incrementally improved while the type was in service, eventually resulting in the Tu-142MZ, the final long-range Tu-142 with highly sophisticated combat avionics and a large payload. Tupolev also converted a number of Tu-142s as avionics (Tu-142MP) and engine (Tu-142LL) testbeds.|$|E
