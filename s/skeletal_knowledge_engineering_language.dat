To overcome such a problem, knowledge fusion is one of the solutions. This paper introduces the CyberBrain: a framework that combines approaches based on <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Engineering</b> and <b>Language</b> <b>Engineering</b> to provide the effective knowledge service. CyberBrain is a dynamic structure, interconnecting organization and communities. It behaves as a natural ecosystem, self-organizing, emerging and adaptive to acquire, collect, extract, and aggregate the related knowledge. With CyberBrain, appropriate and personalized knowledge services will be provided to support problem solving, decision making and early warning. At the current state, the framework is demonstrated with Rice Knowledge Portal using the PMM (Problem-Methods-Man) map generation. In addition, AGROVOC concept Server 1 has also been used focusing primarily on the process of knowledge integration...|$|R

The objective of this thesis is to explore the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for modelling in flexible manufacturing. The work consists of three main parts. In the first part, the structure and performance of various types of flexibly automated batch manufacturing systems are discussed, the modelling challenge {{for the design of}} these types of manufacturing systems is identified, and the currently available modelling techniques are examined and comparatively assessed. In the second part, the research into the structure and design of a knowledge based modelling system is reported. Potential advantages of AI techniques for manufacturing systems modelling are identified. The modelling system is then developed using the LOOPS <b>knowledge</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>language</b> on the Xerox 1186 AI Workstation. Major features of the modelling system include its knowledge driven requirement to enab,l e evaluation of alternative systems with different criteria, the capability of modelling over multiple levels of detail, the transparency of its solution procedure, and the modularity of the system structure to allow convenient modification and extension. The third part is concerned with the evaluation of the AI based modelling method [...] Parallel experiments are conducted on an extended case study cell by using the knowledge based modelling system, the emulator and the tool flow modelling system. Merits of the AI based method are then critically assessed, drawn on the comparison of the results obtained from the three studies. Conclusions drawn from this research and directions for future work are finally indicated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—When {{programming}} in languages such as C, Java, etc., {{it is difficult}} to reconstruct the programmer's ideas only from the program code. This occurs mainly because, much of the programmer's ideas behind the implementation are not recorded in the code during implementation. For example, physical aspects of computation such as spatial structures, activities, and meaning of variables are not required as instructions to the computer and are often excluded. This makes the future reconstruction of the original ideas difficult. AIDA, which is a multimedia programming language based on the cyberFilm model, can solve these problems allowing to describe ideas behind programs using advanced annotation methods as a natural extension to programming. In this paper, a development environment that implements the AIDA language is presented with a focus on the annotation methods. In particular, an actual scientific numerical computation code is created and the effects of the annotation methods are analyzed.

This method is based on an alternating decomposition of the goals that a language tries to achieve and the linguistic methods it empIoys to achieve these goals. This new method for comparing languages allows a general comparison at high levels of abstraction, while not preventing more precise comparisons whenever possible. One result of our comparison method is an insight in the different assumptions that underly the languages to be compared. Two further consequences follow from the proposed comparison method, namely (i) a measure for the degree of similarity between languages, and (ii) a method for translating between languages. After describing our method, we apply it to a pair of KE modelling languages, and show how it yields insights in the assumptions underlying the languages and how {{it can be used to}} produce a translation procedure between the languages...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} and {{discusses}} two main approaches in building semantic structures for electrophysiological metadata. It {{is the use}} of conventional data structures, repositories, and programming languages on one hand and the use of formal representations of ontologies, known from knowledge representation, such as description logics or semantic web languages on the other hand. Although <b>knowledge</b> <b>engineering</b> offers <b>languages</b> supporting richer semantic means of expression and technological advanced approaches, conventional data structures and repositories are still popular among developers, administrators and users because of their simplicity, overall intelligibility, and lower demands on technical equipment. The choice of conventional data resources and repositories, however, raises the question of how and where to add semantics that cannot be naturally expressed using them. As one of the possible solutions, this semantics can be added into the structures of the programming language that accesses and processes the underlying data. To support this idea we introduced a software prototype that enables its users to add semantically richer expressions into a~Java object-oriented code. This approach does not burden users with additional demands on programming environment since reflective Java annotations were used as an entry for these expressions. Moreover, additional semantics need not to be written by the programmer directly to the code, but it can be collected from non-programmers using a graphic user interface. The mapping that allows the transformation of the semantically enriched Java code into the Semantic Web language OWL was proposed and implemented in a library named the Semantic Framework. This approach was validated by the integration of the Semantic Framework in the EEG/ERP Portal and by the subsequent registration of the EEG/ERP Portal in the Neuroscience Information Framework...|$|R
