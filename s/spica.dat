5|$|Hikari Konohana, a shy {{and quiet}} girl, {{is the main}} focus among the main {{characters}} who attend <b>Spica.</b> The next <b>Spica</b> character is Yaya Nanto, a rebellious girl who is Hikari's best friend and roommate in the dormitory. In the anime, she is very much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. Both she and Hikari {{are members of the}} St. <b>Spica</b> Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other <b>Spica</b> students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by many of the students from <b>Spica</b> as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention. In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from <b>Spica</b> is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. <b>Spica</b> Choir, although Hikari was her main motivation for joining. In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, she, like Yaya, is not a prominent character. Tsubomi once remarked that Yaya was more skilled than Hikari at singing in the choir.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} named after <b>Spica,</b> a binary star system in the {{constellation}} Virgo {{and one of the}} brightest stars in the nighttime sky. It appears as one star because of the relatively low center-to-center distance between the two component stars, estimated at an average of 11 million miles (17.7 million km). Astronomical observations also suggest that there may be additional stars in the <b>Spica</b> system. In the story, Asumi mentions Spica's distance to Earth as 350 light-years. This figure is also cited by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; however, other sources indicate a distance of approximately 260 light-years.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting for}} Strawberry Panic! is , {{a very large}} hilltop where the three {{affiliated}} schools of Miator, <b>Spica</b> and Lulim, are located. Each school has its own student council, which governs the matters of each respective school. Periodically the three student councils, along with the Etoiles, meet in the Astraea Joint Student Council. The Astraea Hill school system employs the Scottish system of grade numbering. Students are ranged from grades one through six, {{the equivalent of the}} three years of junior-high and high school in Japan, and seventh through twelfth grade in North America.|$|E

5|$|In December 2003, the {{characters}} from <b>Spica</b> (Hikari, Amane, Yaya, and Tsubomi) and Lulim (Kizuna, Chikaru, Remon, and Kagome) were introduced {{and in the}} January 2004 issue the first illustrations of the three schools and the Strawberry Dorms were published, drawn by Chitose Maki; the reader participation game began in this issue. Polls were posted in the January 2004 issue where the readers could vote on how the story would start and progress in the following months. Before the votes were counted, the first three short stories were written and published in the February 2004 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine. Each story featured an illustration of the two girls who were the couple paired in each respective story.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{animation}} studio Group TAC produced Twin Spicas anime adaptation, {{which was}} broadcast by NHK. The 20-episode series premiered on November 1, 2003, and aired until its conclusion on March 27, 2004. Tomomi Mochizuki directed the anime series, and Rika Nakase wrote its screenplay. Masako Goto designed the characters for animation. When the series reached its conclusion, only 30 {{chapters of the}} manga had been published. Chapter 25, which concludes the story of Asumi and her classmates undergoing a test of their survival skills, was the final chapter to be adapted for the anime. Consequently, the series concludes prematurely with Asumi's ghost companion Lion-san leaving when he no longer has anything to teach her and her friends. The manga, however, continues with Lion-san appearing in subsequent chapters until his eventual departure in chapter 88. The anime series also aired {{in other parts of}} Asia on Animax. It was released in VHS and DVD formats by King Records in five compilation volumes each. A special DVD collection containing the five flashback episodes—episodes 1, 5, 9, 12, and 16—was released on May 26, 2004, and a five-disc DVD box set was released on July 22, 2004. A two-part novelization of the anime and an official guide book to the adaptation were published in April 2004. The English-language dubbing of the Twin <b>Spica</b> anime premiered on Animax Asia on January 24, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine was published, the editors of the {{magazine}} have hosted reader participation games whose outcome is directly influenced by the people who read the magazine. Strawberry Panic!s origin was in the October 2003 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine where it was announced after the ending of Sakurako Kimino's previous work Sister Princess that a new reader participation project would start the following month. In the November 2003 issue, the first batch of characters from St. Miator were introduced (Nagisa, Shizuma, Tamao, and Chiyo) and it was revealed how readers could participate in the project. The initial system had the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna (given without surnames) who were sisters {{and at the same time}} younger sisters of the readers of the magazine, effectively putting the reader in the position of the elder brother. Each girl entered her respective school and became the main character of that school. It was explained that the coupling of the main characters could be to an upperclassman, a classmate, or an underclassman, but had to stay within the school they attended. For example, Nagisa, who attended Miator could not be coupled with another character from either <b>Spica</b> or Lulim at first. Playing the role of the elder brother, the reader gave advice to the younger sisters who were bewildered by their new lives at each of the schools. Thus, the readers had the ability to influence the coupling formations which would later be written by Kimino as short stories serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine.|$|E

25|$|A hip <b>spica</b> {{includes}} {{the trunk of}} the body and one or more legs. A hip <b>spica</b> which covers only one leg to the ankle or foot may be referred to as a single hip <b>spica,</b> while one which covers both legs is called a double hip <b>spica.</b> A one-and-a-half hip <b>spica</b> encases one leg to the ankle or foot and the other to just above the knee. The extent to which the hip <b>spica</b> covers the trunk depends greatly on the injury and the surgeon; the <b>spica</b> may extend only to the navel, allowing mobility of the spine and the possibility of walking with the aid of crutches, or may extend to the rib cage or even to the armpits in some rare cases. Hip spicas were formerly common in reducing femoral fractures, but today are rarely used except for congenital hip dislocations, and then mostly while the child is still an infant.|$|E
25|$|Spring. Spring {{is marked}} by the Great Diamond {{consisting}} of Arcturus, <b>Spica,</b> Denebola, and Cor Caroli. An East-West line from Arcturus to Denebola forms an equilateral triangle with Cor Caroli to the North, and another with <b>Spica</b> to the South. The Arcturus, Regulus, <b>Spica</b> triangle is given the name Spring Triangle. Together these two triangles form the Diamond. Formally, {{the stars of the}} Diamond are in the constellations Boötes, Virgo, Leo, and Canes Venatici.|$|E
25|$|Upper {{extremity}} casts {{are those}} which encase the arm, wrist, and/or hand. A long arm cast encases the arm from the hand to about 2inches below the arm pit, leaving the fingers and thumbs free. A short arm cast, in contrast, stops {{just below the}} elbow. Both varieties may, depending on the injury and the doctor's decision, include one or more fingers or the thumb, in which case it is called a finger <b>spica</b> or thumb <b>spica</b> cast.|$|E

However, the group disbanded shortly before their scheduled debut in 2007 due to Good Entertainment's financial troubles and the members all left for separate Korean entertainment companies.|$|R

50|$|SRON’s {{leading role}} in the {{development}} of SAFARI is mainly due to the infrared detectors developed by SRON scientists. Extremely sensitive detectors must be used in SAFARI to gain maximum benefit from the low infrared emissions of <b>SPICA’s</b> cooled mirror. In June 2010, an international evaluation committee selected, out of four different technologies, the Transition Edge Sensor (TES) detectors from SRON together with the associated readout electronics.|$|R

50|$|A rite {{called the}} Florifertum is {{described}} by one source as involving the bearing (fert-) of wheat ears (<b>spicae)</b> into a shrine (sacrarium). It is unclear whether the offering was made to Flora or to Ceres, or whether if made to Flora it occurred on April 27 or May 3. Ovid describes a florifertum in honor of Juno Lucina on March 1, a date also celebrated as the dies natalis ("birthday") of Mars in whose conception Flora played a role.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the large}} size and extreme {{immobilization}} some casts, particularly {{those used in}} or before the 1970s, the popular term full body cast {{is something of a}} misnomer. The popular and media-driven conception of a massive cast encasing all four limbs, the trunk, and the head – sometimes leaving only small slits for the eyes, nose, and mouth – is a true rarity in recorded medical history, and this type of large scale cast appears more commonly in various Hollywood movies and on television shows. The term body cast (or full body cast) is sometimes casually used by laymen to describe any of a number of body and/or <b>spica</b> casts, from a simple body jacket to a more extensive hip <b>spica.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some cases, a hip <b>spica</b> {{may only}} extend down {{one or more}} legs to above the knee. Such casts, called pantaloon casts, are {{occasionally}} seen to immobilize an injured lumbar spine or pelvis, {{in which case the}} trunk portion of the cast usually extends to the armpits.|$|E
