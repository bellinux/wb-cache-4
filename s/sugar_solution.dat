40|$|Abstract: The volume {{required}} for the rheological characterization of fluids can be minimized by using micromechanical cantilevers as viscosity sensors. Here, a simple measurement tool for the characterization of <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> is proposed. The sensor consists of a micromechanical cantilever as used in an atomic force microscopy which is integrated into a closed fluid handling system. Fluid properties are derived from {{an analysis of the}} power spectral density of the fluctuations of the cantilever deflection signal. The data acquisition system is operated with standard consumer computer components, which limits the costs for the hardware. Measurements with different <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> indicate that the sensor system provides reliable viscosity values for sugar concentrations as they occur in biological systems. The viscosities of the <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> could be evaluated with an error smaller than 5 %...|$|R
25|$|The Feria Nacional del Dulce Cristalizado (National Crystallized Candy Fair) {{takes place}} {{each year in}} the Santa Cruz Acalpixca {{community}} at the Plaza Civica. This fair is dedicated to a traditional sweet of various fruits and sometimes plants, which are conserved in a <b>sugar</b> <b>solution</b> until they crystallize. These include squash, pineapple, nopal cactus, tomatoes, chili peppers, figs and more. These traditional sweets are often sold alongside others such as coconut confections, palanquetas de cacahuate (similar to peanut brittle), and nuez con leche (a nut-milk confection). These candies are the result of a blending of pre-Hispanic and European sweet traditions. The main European contributions are sugar and milk products, which are often mixed with native or other introduced ingredients. Originally, fruits and other foods were crystallized this way for conservation. Many in the community of Santa Cruz Acalpixca specialize in the making of {{one or more of these}} sweets, which began in 1927 with two shops belonging to Santiago Ram√≠rez Olvera and Aurelio Mendoza in the Tepetitla neighborhood. In the 1980s, the town decided to hold an annual fair to promote their products, which originally was held in conjunction with the festival to the local patron saint. The event includes prizes for the best confections in several categories and the introduction of new types of candies.|$|E
2500|$|Food {{should be}} offered at {{the first signs of}} {{possible}} hypoglycemia. [...] If the animal refuses it, a <b>sugar</b> <b>solution</b> (corn syrup, honey, pancake syrup, etc.) should be poured on the finger and rubbed on its gums or under the tongue (sublingually). The solution must be applied this way to prevent possible aspiration of it. Intervet suggests one tablespoon of a <b>sugar</b> <b>solution</b> rubbed onto the gums, regardless {{of the size of the}} dog. Another hypoglycemia formula is 1gram of glucose for every kilogram (2.2lb) of the animal's body weight. Since sugar acts quickly, a response should be seen within a minute or two.|$|E

2500|$|Female {{mosquitoes}} use {{two very}} different food sources. They need sugar for energy, which is taken from sources such as nectar, and they need blood {{as a source of}} protein for egg development. Because biting is risky and suitable hosts may be difficult to find, mosquitoes take as much blood as possible when they have the opportunity. Digesting large volumes of blood takes time, requiring the use of energy from sugars during the feeding process. To avoid this problem, mosquitoes possess a digestive system which can store both food types, giving access to both as needed. When the mosquito drinks a <b>sugar</b> <b>solution,</b> it is directed to a crop. The crop can release sugar into the stomach as it is required. At the same time, the stomach never becomes full of <b>sugar</b> <b>solution,</b> which would prevent the mosquito taking a blood meal. Blood is directed straight into the mosquito's stomach. In species that feed on mammalian or avian blood, hosts whose blood pressure is high, the mosquito feeds selectively from active blood vessels, where the pressure assists in filling the gut rapidly.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>sugar</b> <b>solution</b> is {{clarified}} by {{the addition}} of phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide, which combine to precipitate calcium phosphate. The calcium phosphate particles entrap some impurities and absorb others, and then float {{to the top of the}} tank, where they can be skimmed off. An alternative to this [...] "phosphatation" [...] technique is [...] "carbonatation", which is similar, but uses carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide to produce a calcium carbonate precipitate.|$|E
2500|$|Honey, syrup, or sugar, {{as simple}} carbohydrates, act rapidly {{and will make}} the blood glucose rise, but the rise will not last very long, as they are broken down quickly by the body. Feeding {{something}} containing [...] complex carbohydrates when the pet is able to eat will make sure another hypoglycemia event does not overtake the rapid rise in blood glucose levels from the <b>sugar</b> <b>solution.</b> Complex carbohydrates take longer to be broken down by the body, so they do not raise blood glucose levels until some time after being eaten. [...] A small meal should be fed and the animal taken for medical evaluation to determine if further treatment is needed. Treatment of a serious hypoglycemia episode {{is similar to that}} of diabetic humans: using glucose or glucagon infusions, depending on severity.|$|E

40|$|A UNIFAC type {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to describe and}} predict phase equilibria in aqueous and nonaqueous <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions.</b> One new main UNIFAC group, CHOHsugar, has been introduced to describe all monosaccharides. This main group contains three different subgroups, CH 2 OH, CHOHaxial and CHOHequatorial, which are introduced based on considerations of the actual saccharide ring forms in solution. UNIFAC interaction parameters between the new group and the CH 2; OH; H 2 O; CH 2 -O groups have been estimated from the solubility data of monosaccharides in water, alcohol and their binary solvent mixtures. Another UNIFAC main group, CH-O-CH, has been introduced to describe the disaccharide osidic bond. Interaction parameters between the new group and the CH 2; OH; H 2 O; CH 2 -O; CHOHsugar groups have been estimated too. The model gives very satisfactory correlation and prediction of solute activity properties (i. e. solubility and i-butanol/water partition coefficients of sugars {{are determined by the}} activity of the solute) as well as satisfactory prediction of solvent activity properties (i. e. bubble and freezing points are: determined by the activity of the solvent). A comparison with the UNIFAC model developed recently by Peres and Macedo [Fluid Phase Equil. 139 (1997) 47 - 74], which is the only other predictive model applicable to nonaqueous <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions,</b> suggests that both models provide similar results for aqueous <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions,</b> but the proposed model is more suitable for the prediction of phase equilibrium of <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> involving also nonaqueous solvents as well as in such two-phase systems.

40|$|In the Western world, {{consumption}} of soft drinks {{has increased the}} last three decades and is partly responsible for the epidemic-like increase in obesity. Soft drinks, originally sweetened by sucrose, are now sweetened by other caloric sweeteners, such as fructose. In this study, we investigated the short-term effect of sucrose, glucose or fructose solutions on food intake and body weight in rats, and on peripheral and central appetite signals. Rats received water containing either of the sugars and standard rat chow for two weeks. Rats receiving water alone and standard chow were controls. All rats offered the <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> increased their total caloric intake. The increased caloric intake occurred {{despite the fact that the}} rats offered either of the <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> consumed less chow. As a consequence of the increased caloric intake, the sugar-drinking rats had elevated serum levels of free fatty acids, triglycerides and cholesterol. In addition, consuming <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> resulted in increased serum leptin, decreased serum PYY and down-regulated hypothalamic NPY mRNA. Serum ghrelin was increased in rats receiving fructose solution. Moreover, {{consumption of}} sucrose or fructose solution resulted in up-regulated hypothalamic CB 1 mRNA. Hypothalamic POMC mRNA was down-regulated in rats receiving glucose or fructose. In conclusion, consumption of glucose, sucrose or fructose solution results in caloric overconsumption and body weight gain through activation of hunger signals and depression of satiety signals as well as activation of reward components. The weight-promoting effect of these <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> may possibly be ameliorated by the down-regulation of NPY mRNA and increased serum leptin...|$|R
2500|$|The {{state is}} {{better known as the}} {{producer}} of a number of food products such as cajeta, bread, candy, and ice cream. The best-known food product is cajeta, a soft, spreadable sweet product made with goat's milk, sugar, and flavorings. The best known place for this is Celaya. The cajeta can be flavored with vanilla, coconut, strawberry, and others; it is eaten with a spoon from the container, spread on bread, or made into candies. Another typical sweet in the state is called charamuscas. It is made with piloncillo, which is melted to form shapes. In the city of Guanajuato, one can find charamuscas in the shape of mummies. Alfe√±ique refers to glass sugar based candies used to form figures and is most popular for Day of the Dead. Chilacayote is a candy made from a type of melon of the same name, which is prepared by soaking pieces of the fruit in <b>sugar</b> <b>solution.</b> Handmade ice cream is a specialty of Dolores Hidalgo, made with all natural ingredients, often using recipes passed down for generations. While ice cream and ices are made {{in other parts of the}} state, these stand out because of the many unusual flavors offered such as beer, pulque, chile relleno, even shrimp and mole. [...] The Franciscans taught the indigenous how to work with wheat and bake bread. Because there had already been a tradition of kneading clay for pottery, the kneading and baking of wheat bread became established quickly, adapting the original recipes to local tastes. The best known breads are those from Ac√°mbaro, especially the type called [...] "pan grande". Other well-known types are pan ranchero, tallado, pan huevo and pan leche. The first indigenous master baker in Guanajuato was Abraham de Silva Cu√≠n, who, in 1526, began to make breads in unique forms and flavors.|$|E
60|$|A short {{immersion}} {{in water for}} 20 m. did not retard the subsequent action of the phosphate, or of splinters of glass placed on the glands; but in two instances an immersion for 50 m. prevented any effect from a solution of camphor. Several leaves which had been left for 20 m. in a solution of one part of white sugar to 218 of water {{were placed in the}} phosphate solution, the action of which was delayed; whereas a mixed solution of sugar and the phosphate did not in the least interfere with the effects of the latter. Three leaves, after being immersed for 20 m. in the <b>sugar</b> <b>solution,</b> were placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia (one part to 218 of water); in 2 m. or 3 m. the glands were blackened, and after 7 m. the tentacles were considerably inflected, so that the solution of sugar, though it delayed the action of the phosphate, did not delay that of the carbonate. Immersion in a similar solution of gum arabic for 20 m. had no retarding action on the phosphate. Three leaves were left for 20 m. in a mixture of one part of alcohol to seven parts of water, [page 214] and then placed in the phosphate solution: in 2 hrs. 15 m. there was a trace of inflection in one leaf, and in 5 hrs. 30 m. a second was slightly affected; the inflection subsequently increased, though slowly. Hence diluted alcohol, which, as we shall see, is hardly at all poisonous, plainly retards the subsequent action of the phosphate.|$|E

To determine if mosquitoes discriminate between sterile <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> and <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> with bacteria, a method for screening mosquito feeding preferences was developed. This method was tested for Aedes aegypti, Anopheles arabiensis and An. gambiae s. s. mosquitoes and is based on a dual-choice test of solutions labelled with food dyes. Three different tests (dye/colour detection, sugar detection and sugar-concentration detection) were performed to evaluate the method, after which bacteria previously isolated from mosquitoes were used in the experiments. It was shown that mosquitoes do not discriminate between <b>sugar</b> <b>solutions</b> with or without these bacteria indicating that sugar-feeding is a possible means to introduce bacteria into mosquitoes.
