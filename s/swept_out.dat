5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in {{addition}} to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of quantum field theory called a conformal field theory. This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the surface <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> by a string propagating through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 2013, Liberal {{candidate}} and City of Perth councillor Eleni Evangel defeated Hyde and Labor in an upset victory {{with a significant}} swing amid the Liberals' decisive victory that year, becoming the first Liberal member for Perth since the 1960s. However, Evangel was herself <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> four years later by Labor's John Carey, {{the mayor of the}} City of Vincent, amid the Liberals' collapse in the metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{recorded}} {{their first}} 100-point season in 1987â€“88, earning the Presidents' Trophy {{for having the}} league's best record and ending the Oilers' six-year reign atop the Smythe Division in the process. Joe Nieuwendyk became the second rookie in league history to score 50+ goals, earning the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year. Looking to bolster the line-up for a playoff run, the Flames dealt young sniper Brett Hull, along with Steve Bozek, to the Blues for Rob Ramage and Rick Wamsley on March 7, 1988. Their playoff frustrations continued, however, after defeating the Los Angeles Kings in five games, Calgary was <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> of the playoffs in four straight by the Oilers.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the island {{became part of the}} front line for invasion and was heavily fortified. Along with other coastal resorts, the island drew in evacuees from London, though as the war progressed, these were moved to safer settlements further inland. 2000 troops were stationed on the island to guard against invasion. A battery of 4.7 inch guns was installed along the beach along with a Battery Observation post and a number of searchlights and pillboxes. Several of these installations survived and can still be seen along the south coast of the island, one of which has been converted into a cafe. After the war, the island suffered from severe winter weather in 1947 which destroyed much of the oyster fishery, and from the flooding of 1953, where numerous beach huts were <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> to sea.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in {{portions}} of western Connecticut and Massachusetts. Strong surf from Isabel caused {{a man to}} drown after losing his footing along the beach near Narragansett, Rhode Island, and being <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> to sea. Officials in Connecticut contacted a water company in Watertown and a grocer in Cheshire for donations to assist the residents affected in North Carolina. A few days after Isabel moved ashore, the officials sent a tractor trailer truck with 2,000gallons (7570l) of water and 25,000pounds (11,340kg) of ice to North Carolina. In Vermont, the strong pressure gradient produced a peak wind gust of 55mph (89km/h) in Pleasant Valley, causing sporadic downed trees and power lines throughout the state. In Richmond, trees fell on and damaged threetrucks, and in Salisbury a falling tree damaged a car. Damage in the state totaled about $100,000 (2003USD, $117,000 in 2008USD). Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in various portions of New Hampshire and Maine.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Carlos {{affected}} 79municipalities in Oaxaca with flooding or rainfall, {{and much}} of the region was declared a disaster area; as a result, disaster funds were opened. Across the region, the combination of rainfall and strong winds downed power lines, disrupted phone service, and flooded two major highways; additionally, the storm left widespread damage to other roads and airstrips. In northwestern Oaxaca, seven people were killed when the heavy rainfall triggered a mudslide. Mudslides were reported elsewhere in the state, and about 30,000homes were damaged. In one town, the flooding forced 150families to evacuate to shelters. In Guerrero, a flooded river killed two people. Four fishermen were reported missing, possibly <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> to sea due to the storm; the Mexican army searched offshore for several days, rescuing two of the four fishermen by four days after the storm. Overall, the storm affected about 148,000people, and monetary damage totaled 86.7million pesos (2003MXN, $8million 2003USD).|$|E

5|$|Wind {{and water}} damage across the Outer Banks was extensive. Strong waves and {{the storm surge}} from Hurricane Isabel knocked about 30 to 40 houses and several motels off of their pilings. Two {{families}} who did not evacuate were nearly <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> to sea when their home was destroyed. Local rescue was unable to reach them; however, they were ultimately able to reach safety. The rough waves greatly affected piers in Nags Head, Rodanthe, and Frisco, with three being completely destroyed. Several locations along North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed out or covered with debris, and 15foot (4.5m) sections of pavement {{on both sides of}} a bridge near Ocracoke were washed away. Strong waves destroyed a beach access ramp, as well. Several thousand homes and businesses were damaged by the passage of the hurricane, and damage in Dare County totalled nearly $350million (2003USD, ($ USD)). In the Outer Banks, no deaths or injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|Prior to landfall, twelve provinces, {{including}} some in Luzon, {{were placed on}} typhoon alert. Upon moving through the central Philippines, Typhoon Lee affected {{some of the same}} areas devastated by Typhoon Irma earlier that month, which was considered the strongest storm to affect the island since 1970. Lee knocked out communications and left many coconut-producing areas isolated. Railway services to and from Manila was suspended. Even though nine domestic flights were canceled, the Manila International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the typhoon. Across Manila, some flooding was reported and high winds tore off some Christmas decorations in hotels along the bay. The Sorsogon Province was one of the hardest hit areas by the typhoon; 20casualties happened there because of flooding. In the coastal region of Legaspi, home to a large volcano, 150houses were demolished due to storm surge, 25 of which were <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> at sea. Telephone lines were also cut off for four days in the city. Storm surge was also noted in coastal towns in the Sorsogon, Masbate, and Albay provinces. In the latter, three villages were damaged. Just south of the capital city of Manila, in the coastal town of Calapan on Mindoro Island, 5,600 houses were damaged, and 20,000persons or 85% of the town's residents were left without a home. Two fatalities were reported in the city. In the fishing village of San Fernando on Masbate Island, 50thatched huts were flattened. Elsewhere, four people were killed and three others injured in Naujan, where 86 homes were either damaged or destroyed.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{spokesperson}} for the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG), the quake was felt in several mainland towns, but no damage or deaths were reported.

As of October 30, 2010, the confirmed death toll stands at 435, with 110 more unaccounted for. Many of the missing are believed to have been <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> to sea.|$|E

25|$|There {{are quite}} regular records of live and {{stranded}} leatherback turtle {{in and around}} the Irish Sea. This species travels north to the waters off the British Isles every year following the swarms of jellyfish that form its prey. Loggerhead turtle, Ridley sea turtle and green turtle are found very occasionally in the Irish Sea but are generally unwell or dead when discovered. They have strayed or been <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> of their natural range further south into colder waters.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 70,000 gallons (265,000 litres) of Bunker C oil leaked {{from the}} wreckage, {{although most of}} it was <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> to sea by the wind. The oil that did wash ashore, however, posed a significant threat to the local wildlife. Brown pelicans and other coastal birds were found on the beaches covered in oil, and despite the best efforts of volunteers, over 250 birds did not survive their ordeal. Other marine species, such as razor clams, were also thought to be in danger.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 1738, a {{boat with}} {{passengers}} {{was on its}} way from Pamplona to Aparri. Near the port, a sudden gale blew and it was <b>swept</b> <b>out</b> to sea.

They all did; soon afterward, the rain stopped, the winds died down and the boat and its passengers made it safely to port.|$|E
