40|$|An {{understanding}} of the motion of <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> in microchannels is useful for a number applications. This knowledge {{can be used to}} develop devices to sort biological cells based on their size and stiffness. For example, cancer cells have a different stiffness from healthy cells and thus can be readily identified. Additionally, devices can be developed to detect flaws in synthetic particles. Using a 3 D hybrid lattice Boltzmann and lattice spring method, the motion of rigid and <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> in a pressure-driven microfluidic flow was probed. The effect of inertial drift is evaluated in channels different Reynolds numbers. Other system parameters such as capsule elasticity and channel size are also varied to determine their effect. The equilibrium position of capsules in the channel is also obtained. The equilibrium position of rigid and <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> depends on the relative particle size. If the capsule is small, the equilibrium position is found to be closer to the channel wall. Conversely, for larger capsules, the equilibrium position is closer to the channel centerline. The capsule stiffness affects the magnitude of the cross-stream drift velocity. For a given Reynolds number, the equilibrium position of <b>softer</b> <b>capsules</b> is closer to the channel centerline.

40|$|Background: Darunavir, a second-generation {{protease}} inihibitor, is {{used with}} a low boosting dose of ritonavir to improve its clinical efficacy. The boosting dose of ritonavir acts as an inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4, thereby increasing darunavir bioavailability. Recently, ritonavir tablet has been on sale in place of <b>soft</b> <b>capsule.</b> However, pharmacokinetic study of darunavir by changing ritonavir form is still not clear. In this study, we aimed to compare with plasma darunavir concentrations by switching ritinavir <b>soft</b> <b>capsule</b> to tablet in Japanese HIV- 1 infected patients. Methods: We analyzed 34 Japanese HIV- 1 infected patients (32 males: 2 females) recruited at the National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center. All patients had been administered with 800 / 100 mg darunavir/ritonavir once daily {{in combination with other}} antiretrovirals. Plasma darunavir concentrations were determined by an HPLC method. A pared t-test was used to compare with their concentrations by switching from ritonavir <b>soft</b> <b>capsule</b> to tablet. Results: The mean of age, body weight, and duration of antiretroviral therapy for 34 patients were 41. 9 (range: 24 &#x 2013; 62) years, 66. 3 (range: 51. 4 &#x 2013; 90. 0) kg, and 436 (range: 182 &#x 2013; 739) days, respectively.

Plasma samples were analyzed with LC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic parameters of L-NBP were calculated using non-compartmental analysis with WinNonlin software. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. All adverse events (AEs) were mild and of limited duration; AEs in this study occurred less frequently and more mildly than AEs listed for the DL-NBP <b>soft</b> <b>capsule.</b> No serious adverse event (SAE), death or withdrawal from the study was observed. In the single-dose study, Cmax was reached at about 1 h, and the mean t 1 / 2 was approximately 13. 76 h. Area under curve (AUC) and Cmax increased with dose escalation, but dose proportionality was not observed over the range of 160 to 480 mg. In the multiple-dose study, the steady-state was reached within 3 days with slight accumulation. In summary, the L-NBP tablet was well tolerated in healthy Chinese subjects. Slight accumulation appeared after repeated doses...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: The {{microemulsion}} {{concept was}} introduced in 1943 by Hoar and Schulman. Self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (S(M) EDDS) are much more recent and {{can be described as}} isotropic solutions of oils and surfactants that form oil-in-water O/W microemulsions when they are poured into an aqueous medium. When they are presented as <b>soft</b> <b>capsules</b> for oral delivery, S(M) EDDS have the ability to considerably improve the intestinal absorption of agents that are incorporated into the S(M) EDDS. Forty percent of newly discovered drug candidates have little or no water solubility and therefore have low and/or variable bioavailability profiles. Many of these drugs are good candidates for formulation into S(M) EDDS. Areas covered: This paper describes the preparation and assessment of these formulations and their current applications. The characterisation of this type of formulation has improved, and in vitro models (Caco- 2 cell cultures, Ussing chambers, the everted sac technique, etc.) can be used for screening different formulations. It describes also marketed formulations (i. e., cyclosporin and saquinavir S(M) EDDS) and some other formulations. Expert opinion: Actual applications of S(M) EDDS remain rare. The first drug marketed as a S(M) EDDS was cyclosporin, and it had significantly improved bioavailability compared with the conventional solution. In the last decade, several S(M) EDDS loaded with antiviral drugs (e. g., ritonavir, saquinavir) were tested for treatment of HIV infection, but the relative improvement in clinical benefit was not significant. The S(M) EDDS formulation of Norvir® (<b>soft</b> <b>capsules)</b> has been withdrawn in some countries...|$|R
