40|$|The {{aftermarket}} {{business is}} a highly profitable activity for companies, and they can earn considerable profits from selling <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> <b>Spare</b> <b>parts</b> demands are more uncertain and intermittent in comparison with finished goods and associated work in progress parts. In the aftermarket, the demand uncertainty of the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> for the OEMs {{is complicated by the}} fact that the other competitors, known as market players or will-fitters, supply substitutable parts usually with lower cost of production and deliver them to the market at cheaper prices. This uncertainty makes <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management challenging, and this study develops strategic approaches for <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> price <b>setting</b> and inventory level control to further exploit the benefits of the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> business. This dissertation is divided into four main parts. ^ In the first part, a brief review of inventory system policies is provided. The review starts with an introduction to the inventory systems terminology and follows with a categorization of the inventory systems with the aim of developing <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> inventory models. Moreover, a discussion about the computations related to the (Q,r) policy is provided. An algorithm is proposed to find the optimal re-order point/lot-size and a Monte Carlo simulation is designed to evaluate the mathematical optimization solutions including the new algorithm and the other classical methods. In the second part, a literature review related to <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management is presented. The literature review is organized in such a way that in the beginning the inventory control policies are introduced. Then the perspective of uniqueness of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> on the inventory management is illustrated. Next, <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> clustering and demand are studied and forecasting methods are reviewed. The use of Game Theory for inventory systems planning is studied. Also <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing as a strategic method to increase the profit of the suppliers is evaluated. In the third part, to investigate the profitability of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> business, the notion of renewal cost versus the replacement cost is proposed. The replacement cost of a product is defined as the current market price of the product and the renewal cost of a product is the acquisition cost of spares to completely renew the product excluding labor costs. These costs are calculated for some products with specific characteristics, and the ratio between the renewal cost and the replacement cost as a scale to evaluate the sustainability of the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing is determined which declares that the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing is unfair. In the last part, Game Theory as a tool to find ideal decision-making in <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management taking into account the interactions among <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> manufacturers. According to definite assumptions, <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> inventory games in the form of normal, cooperative and non-cooperative, non-zero-sum, evolutionary, and competitive fringes are studied. The proposed games study the OEMs 2 ̆ 7 decision-making on <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing strategies, inventory levels, batch productions and re-manufacturing efforts. ^ The proposed strategic <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> pricing methods as an alternative for regular pricing can factor in customers 2 ̆ 7 willingness to purchase <b>spare</b> <b>parts,</b> demand uncertainty, market uncertainty, competitiveness of the parts in the market, stability of the cooperation or competition in price setting, marginal costs of designing an agreement for cooperation, and the marginal cost of production and inventory.

40|$|<b>Spare</b> <b>parts</b> for {{drill rigs}} are a {{complicated}} and important task to be handled. The operations are run on tight schedules and costs {{are based on}} the number of days to complete the operations. There are strict regulations concerning the safety while running operations offshore, since consequences for both the personnel involved and the environment can be severe. To avoid having to stop the drilling operations it is very important to have a functioning system to provide <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> if a component breaks down or need maintenance. To further complicate the handling and logistics of <b>spare</b> <b>parts,</b> a drill rig will be located at several different locations during its life time, compared to a fixed production rig, which may spend decades at one location producing hydrocarbons from an oil or gas field. A set of parameters that affect the importance of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> have been <b>set</b> up to explain the need for <b>spare</b> <b>parts,</b> with a basis on drill rigs and their complications with being moved from one location to another. The usage rates of which parts are used, replaced or maintained play an important role and needs extensive monitoring and analysis to have a good estimate of the expected life time of a given component, part or system. Rules, regulations and criticality of equipment affect the safety of the drill rig, personnel and the environment. There need to be detailed analyses and planning of consequences, safety systems and the availability of such critical parts. Storing and transport of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> to offshore drill rigs will have affect on the logistics for <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> Offshore drill rigs has limited storage space and weight limitations that need to be taken into consideration when deciding which <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> are to be located on the rig, and which can be stored at onshore facilities. The concept of moving the rig after a relatively short period complicates the process of having equipment stored and establishing means of transportation. Simplified, the parts that are considered highly critical to safety, required by governmental and other regulations and parts that are essential to avoid downtime should be kept available at the rig. Such parts can be replaced with only a few hours of downtime and possibly even without stopping the operations. Less critical parts are kept at onshore storage facilities or ordered from manufacturers based on the timeframe to be available offshore. To complicate the planning of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> further, many parts have an unpredictable demand, some parts will become unavailable, new manufacturers and brands are introduced and delivery times may vary from the stated values. In addition to part or system history, analyses of usage rates and modeling there are recommendations from manufacturers to aid creating a system for controlling <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> Finally costs will always be an important factor in decision making. The costs of having a drill rig wait for several days and the consequences of a serious accident while drilling are of such magnitude that expensive equipment, advanced monitoring, redundant systems and other safety measures may often be worthwhile. Because of the large numbers of different parts on a drill rig, the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> are categorized into high, medium and low criticality groups, where computerized programs and modeling has great potentials in simplifying the logistics and reducing costly over- and under stocking.

40|$|Estimates which {{indicate}} {{a large share}} of the world’s undiscovered oil and gas resources {{is to be found in}} the Arctic areas and the increasing demand for energy are important reasons for the growing interest in the High North region. As the offshore industry expands into the High North, system failures associated with these projects is expected to increase significantly. Hence, the quest for effective maintenance and maintenance support services are increased. However, the demanding physical conditions of the Arctic, the remote location, and the uncertainty from various sources are expected to increase the challenges related to the <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> planning, especially the transportation of <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> The aim of this thesis is to study, review, and propose a model for risk-based <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> planning, especially for <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> transportation, considering the effect of operational conditions. Furthermore, the concept of both static and dynamic transportation networks is used to calculate the mean <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> transportation time and <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> deliverability.

In this thesis, the theoretical framework chapter covers a brief survey of <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> planning, risk-based approaches, risk assessment methods, and application of risk analysis to <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> planning. Then, types and sources of uncertainties, factors affecting <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> planning and <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> forecasting methods are reviewed. Afterward, a static model is developed for <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> transportation by considering the operating conditions of the Arctic region. The model is based on the concept of the transportation block diagram. A case study for the oil & gas (O & G) industry is presented to demonstrate how the proposed model can be applied. Furthermore, a dynamic model for <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> transportation is also developed. In this model, the factors which provide dynamic behavior of a <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> transportation network such as season (months) of the year (i. e. to transport the <b>spare</b> <b>part),</b> and criticality of the <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> are modeled. The results obtained from data analysis showed that operational conditions of the Arctic region leads to approximately 20 % extended delay’s during the winter season, when we transport the <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> from the southwestern Norway to the northern Norway.

In view of this situation, management of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> become critical in ensuring the equipment reliability. This paper describes an innovative risk quantification technique using Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) for the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> inventory control. The technique modified the BDD concept by translating the failure history into binary decision. From the binary process, the data will be converted into <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> probability table and failure impact is analyzed. These two functions of risk, will be calculated in order gain the risk in monetary value...|$|R

Life cycle costing methods {{can be applied}} to the procurement of some, but not all, <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> As a result, a decision model is needed to determine which <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> should be considered for life cycle costing. This thesis discusses a decision model for determining the applicability of life cycle costing to <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> procurement. The thesis briefly reviews the application of the life cycle costing concept to the acquisition of major systems and associated <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> It then reviews current <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> acquisition techniques and identifies critical criteria to be considered during the acquisition of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> using life cycle costing techniques. Finally, the thesis uses the identified characteristics to develop the decision model. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

Traditional asset management could not meet the requirement of present equipment. Due {{to the complexity of}} inventory plus limitation of offshore platform, it is one complicated issue to accomplish effective and efficient inventory control for offshore operation. Having reasonable inventory is crucial for improving the continuous efficiency for <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> and decreasing the maintenance budget, especially for the offshore operations. Inventory analysis requires one criteria to optimize the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> stock. Most commonly used models for inventory are <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> value-usage, criticality, frequency of demand. The combination of management policy and mathematical model is very complicated for the maintenance management. It needs too much mathematical knowledge and is not very efficient in <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> analysis. Thus one classical model for analyzing the <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> demand is ABC model. A specific example of platform in the Bohai Bay is used to demonstrate the <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management condition more specifically. Through systematic inventory analysis, unchangeable <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> {{in the last five years}} account for high percentage. It is mainly composed of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> of turbine, compressor, and crane. After reorganization, <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> on the platform are optimized and it saves much budget and space for platform...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Scheduled {{building}} maintenance requires {{appropriate and}} adequate <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> to replace existing parts {{on a regular}} basis. Management of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> {{is seen as an}} important criterion to ensure the efficiency of scheduled maintenance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the contributors of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management and investigate the relationship between these contributors and maintenance cost performance. Design/methodology/approach - This research adopted a quantitative approach, which utilised questionnaire surveys to study the relationship between the contributors of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management and maintenance cost performance. The data were analysed through descriptive analysis, correlation, and regression analysis. Additionally, a case study was examined to validate the results obtained from the survey. Findings - The results of this research demonstrated that the quality of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> (QSP), budget allocation for acquisition of <b>spare</b> <b>parts,</b> and level of stocks were significantly correlated to the maintenance cost variance (MCV). Moreover, the results of the regression analysis indicated that the QSP was the significant predictor of MCV. Originality/value - This research highlights the importance of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management in building maintenance. It recommends that maintenance management <b>set</b> up a <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> management department for updating stocks frequently. Meanwhile, the management should avoid ad-hoc acquisition of <b>spare</b> <b>parts,</b> as this is always more expensive. The management should also select <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> based on quality instead of lowest cost. In addition, building managers should also apply the developed regression model in practice to predict and improve maintenance performance...|$|R
