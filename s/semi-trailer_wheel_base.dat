40|$|In {{order to}} explain the {{theoretical}} ground for the weeding-out of the two axle wagons with short <b>wheel</b> <b>base,</b> {{we are going to}} prove by numerical calculations how the rail side-thrust caused by vehicle yawing is changed by the size of <b>wheel</b> <b>bases.</b> 　The yawing of two axle vehicles running on the rails with sinuous form deformations was analyzed and we got the following conclusion by applying to this the data of the present vehicles. lf a goods wagon of 10 t. carrying capacity uses a 4 m. <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> instead of a 3 m. <b>wheel</b> <b>base,</b> the rail side-thrust by yawing will decrease 25 %...|$|R
50|$|Later that year, in August 1934, {{the long}} <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> version was {{launched}} {{with a range}} of bodies that included a six-seater “Limousine” (sedan/saloon), a six-seater (soft top) “Cabrio-Limousine”, a 6-seater “Pullman-Limousne” (with a more vertical back-end), a Torpedo bodied “Laundaulet” and a “Droschken-Landaulet”. Although only the last of these spelled out the target market in its name, all the various long <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> Opel 2-litres were designed with the taxi trade in mind. The least expensive of them, the four door six seater long <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> “Limousine” came with a manufacturer’s listed price of 4,800 Marks throughout the model’s production period. A buyer determined to buy even the least costly “Limousine” bodied Mercedes-Benz Typ 200s with the same long <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> would have needed, in 1934, to find 5,700 Marks.|$|R

40|$|In this study, tractor {{stability}} {{was discussed}} from {{the aspects of}} rollover initiation, vertical and lateral vibration characteristics considering tractor dynamics in Phase I overturn. As two of the key geometric parameters of a tractor, track width ratio and <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> ratio were intro–duced into the mathematical model developed earlier as the independent variables. Results showed that both factors greatly reduced the risk of initializing tractor rollover with their in–creasing values. Higher track width ratios were found to generally enhance the contact condition between the sensitive tire and the ground, while higher <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> ratios showed an effect of stabilizing the vehicle more rapidly after a disturbance. However, no obvious changes in tractor bounce acceleration were observed with the variation in track width ratio, nor were the changes in lateral acceleration found with different values of <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> ratio...|$|R
