40|$|The {{position}} of the cochlear-implant electrode is important to audiological outcomes after cochlear implantation. The common technique to evaluate the intracochlear electrode’s position {{involves the use of}} ionized radiation in MSCT, DVT, or flat-panel tomography (FPT). Recent advances in knowledge regarding the handling of MRI artifacts in cochlear implantees indicate that estimating the intracochlear electrode’s position with an MRI could be possible. This study’s aim was to evaluate the ipsilaterally {{position of}} electrodes using MRI at 1. 5 [*]T. In a retrospective study of 10 implantees with postoperative need for MRI scanning, we evaluated the intrascalar electrode’s position using a T 2 -weighted sequence at 1. 5 [*]T. We compared the resulting estimate of the intracochlear position with the estimates from the postoperative FPT scan and the intraoperative NRT ratio. For each ear, the MRI-estimated scalar position corresponded with the estimated positions from the FPT and NRT ratio. For eight ears, a scala tympani’s position was observed in the MRI. In one case, an electrode scalar translocation was found. In one case, the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli’s</b> position was observed. Thus, MRI-based estimation of the scalar position of a cochlear-implant electrode is possible. Limitations to this method include implant-specific magnet and fixation configurations, which can cause complications...|$|R

[Conclusion]: Cell {{transplantation}} {{into the}} utriculus provides an efficient and non-invasive route to introduce embryonic stem (ES) cells into the vestibular and cochlear {{portions of the}} inner ear. [Objective]: The transfer of stem cells into the inner ear for therapeutic purposes is an important approach to cure damage to the cochlea and vestibulum. A key issue is to provide an entry point for cell transplants into the inner ear that does not affect its physiologic functions. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the feasibility of transferring ES cells into the inner ear via the utriculus. [Materials and methods]: ES cells were injected via utriculostomy into the mouse inner ear. The distribution of the injected cells was determined using a beta-galactosidase marker gene expressed by the ES cells.

5000|$|It reaches about half-way {{toward the}} outer {{wall of the}} tube, and {{partially}} divides its cavity into two passages or scalae, of which the upper is named the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli,</b> while the lower is termed the scala tympani.|$|E
50|$|The basal {{end of the}} cochlea, where sounds enter {{from the}} middle ear, encodes the higher end of the audible {{frequency}} range while the apical end of the cochlea encodes {{the lower end of}} the frequency range. This tonotopy plays a crucial role in hearing, as it allows for spectral separation of sounds. A cross section of the cochlea will reveal an anatomical structure with three main chambers (<b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli,</b> scala media, and scala tympani). At the apical end of the cochlea, at an opening known as the helicotrema, the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> merges with the scala tympani. The fluid found in these two cochlear chambers is perilymph, while scala media, or the cochlear duct, is filled with endolymph.|$|E
50|$|The helicotrema (from Greek ἕλιξ meaning coil and τρη̂μα meaning hole) is {{the part}} of the {{cochlear}} labyrinth where the scala tympani and the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> meet. It is the main component of the cochlear apex. The hair cells near this area best detect low frequency sounds.|$|E
50|$|The saccule is {{the smaller}} sized {{vestibular}} sac (the utricle being the other larger size vestibular sac); it is globular in form, and {{lies in the}} recessus sphæricus near {{the opening of the}} <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> of the cochlea. Its anterior part exhibits an oval thickening, the macula of saccule (or saccular macula), to which are distributed the saccular filaments of the acoustic nerve.|$|E
50|$|The cochlea is the tri-chambered {{auditory}} detection {{portion of}} the ear, consisting of the scala media, the scala tympani, and the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli.</b> Regarding mammals, placental and marsupial cochleae have similar cochlear responses to auditory stimulation as well as DC resting potentials.

5000|$|The human ear {{is made up}} {{of three}} areas: the outer, middle and inner ear. Within the inner ear sits the cochlea. The cochlea is a snail-shaped {{formation}} that enables sound transmission via a sensorineural route, rather than through a conductive pathway. [...] The cochlea is a complex structure, consisting of three layers of fluid. The <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> and scala media are separated by Reissner’s Membrane whereas the scala media and scala tympani are divided by the basilar membrane. [...] The diagram below illustrates the complex layout of the compartments and their divisions: ...|$|E
50|$|The fluids {{in these}} two tubes, the {{endolymph}} and the perilymph are very different chemically, biochemically, and electrically. Therefore, they are kept strictly separated. This separation is the main function of Reissner's membrane (between <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> and scala media), {{and it is also}} the function of tissue held by the basilar membrane such as the inner and outer sulcus cells (shown in yellow) and the reticular lamina of the organ of Corti (shown in magenta). For the organ of Corti the basilar membrane is permeable to perilymph. Here the border between endolymph and perilymph occurs at the reticular lamina, the endolymph side of the organ of Corti.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in {{the fifth}} week of development, the {{auditory}} vesicle also {{gives rise to the}} cochlear duct, which contains the spiral organ of Corti and the endolymph that accumulates in the membranous labyrinth. The vestibular wall will separate the cochlear duct from the perilymphatic <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli,</b> a cavity inside the cochlea. The basilar membrane separates the cochlear duct from the scala tympani, a cavity within the cochlear labyrinth. The lateral wall of the cochlear duct is formed by the spiral ligament and the stria vascularis, which produces the endolymph. The hair cells develop from the lateral and medial ridges of the cochlear duct, which together with the tectorial membrane make up the organ of Corti.|$|E
50|$|In the {{mammalian}} cochlea, amplification {{occurs in}} the outer hair cells of the Organ of Corti. These cells sit directly above a basilar membrane (BM) that has high sensitivity for differences in frequency. Sound waves enter the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> of the cochlea and travel throughout it, carrying with them various sound frequencies. These waves exert a pressure on the basilar and tectorial membranes of the cochlea which vibrate in response to sound waves of different frequencies. When these membranes vibrate and are deflected upward (rarefaction phase of sound wave), the stereocilia of the OHCs are deflected toward the tallest stereocilia. This causes the tip links of the OHC hair bundle to open allowing inflow of Na+ and K+ which depolarize the OHC. Upon depolarization, the OHC can then begin its process of amplification through positive feedback.|$|E
50|$|In most {{reptiles}} the perilymphatic duct and lagena {{are relatively}} short, and the sensory cells {{are confined to}} a small basilar papilla lying between them.

All of these structures together constitute the cochlea.|$|E
50|$|The basilar {{membrane}} on the tympanic duct presses against the hair {{cells of the}} organ as perilymphatic pressure waves pass. The stereocilia atop the IHCs move with this fluid displacement and in response their cation, or positive ion selective, channels are pulled open by cadherin structures called tip links that connect adjacent stereocilia. The organ of Corti, surrounded in potassium rich fluid endolymph, lies on the {{basilar membrane}} {{at the base of}} the scala media. Under the organ of Corti is the scala tympani and above it, the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli.</b> Both structures exist in a low potassium fluid called perilymph. Because those stereocilia are in the midst of a high concentration of potassium, once their cation channels are pulled open, potassium ions as well as calcium ions flow into the top of the hair cell. With this influx of positive ions the IHC becomes depolarized, opening voltage-gated calcium channels at the basolateral region of the hair cells and triggering the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. An electrical signal is then sent through the auditory nerve and into the auditory cortex of the brain as a neural message.|$|E
50|$|Air {{pressure}} {{changes in}} the ear canal cause the vibrations of the tympanic membrane and middle ear ossicles. At {{the end of the}} ossicular chain, movement of the stapes footplate within the oval window of the cochlea, in turn, generates a pressure field within the cochlear fluids, imparting a pressure differential across the basilar membrane. A sinusoidal pressure wave results in localized vibrations of the organ of Corti: near the base for high frequencies, near the apex for low frequencies. The cochlea thus acts as an 'acoustic prism', distributing the energy of each Fourier component of a complex sound at different locations along its longitudinal axis. Hair cells in the cochlea are stimulated when the basilar membrane is driven up and down by differences in the fluid pressure between the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> and scala tympani. Because this motion is accompanied by a shearing motion between the tectorial membrane and the reticular lamina of the organ of Corti, the hair bundles that link the two are deflected, which initiates mechano-electrical transduction. When the basilar membrane is driven upward, shear between the hair cells and the tectorial membrane deflects hair bundles in the excitatory direction, toward their tall edge. At the midpoint of an oscillation the hair bundles resume their resting position. When the basilar membrane moves downward, the hair bundles are driven in the inhibitory direction.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Only a few {{case reports}} and small series of intralabyrinthine schwan-nomas (ILSs) have been reported. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess prevalence, MR charac-teristics, location, {{clinical}} management, and growth potential/patterns of ILSs in the largest series reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lesion localization, MR characteristics, lesion growth, and clinical man-agement were reviewed in 52 patients diagnosed with an ILS between February 1991 and August 2007 in 2 referral centers. The number of ILSs and vestibulocochlear schwannomas in the cerebel-lopontine angle/internal auditory canal was compared to assess the prevalence. RESULTS: ILSs most frequently originate intracochlearly, are hyperintense on unenhanced T 1 -weighted images, enhance strongly after gadolinium administration, and are sharply circumscribed and hypointense on thin heavily T 2 -weighted 3 D images. The scala tympani is more frequently or more extensively involved than the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli.</b> Follow-up MR imaging, available in 27 patients, showed growth in 59 % of subjects.

40|$|Abstract: In recent papers we {{have shown}} that the mode of {{vibration}} of the ossicular chain in cat and human temporal bones is more complex than a simple rotation about a fixed axis and that it also changes with frequency. For the stapes e. g. it was shown that rotations of the footplate about its long and short axis are present besides the predominant piston-like velocity component. As the footplate motion gives rise to the pressure wave set up in the cochlea, we investigated whether the non-piston components contribute to the pressure produced in the gerbil cochlea: 3 -D vibration velocity of the stapes along with the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> pressure were measured in the same animals. We found no correlation between non-piston components and <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> pressure...|$|E

Beta-trace protein {{is a very}} sensitive and specific clinical marker and can confirm reliably the presence of CSF in patients with a suspected CSF leakage. Design: Perilymph specimens from the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> (n= 10) and from the lateral semicircular canal (n= 4) were taken from patients undergoing stapedotomy or surgery for acoustic neuroma. During post-mortem examinations perilymph specimens from the <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> (n= 70), the scala tympani (n= 11), endolymph specimens (n= 21) and CSF specimens (n= 17) were obtained. All specimens were analyzed by a one-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis using a polyclonal, monospecific antibody. Results: Specimens from live surgery showed a mean concentration of 51. 5 ± 48. 9 mg/l β-TP in <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> perilymph. Specimens from post-mortem examinations revealed a mean concentration of 49. 1 ± 17. 7 mg/l in CSF, 71. 9 ± 29. 3 mg/l in perilymph and 68. 0 ± 21. 7 mg/l in endolymph.

40|$|Partial {{cochlear}} obstruction is {{a relatively}} common finding in candidates for cochlear implants and frequently involves the inferior segment of the scala tympani in the basal turn of the cochlea.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{simultaneous}} sound pressure measurements in <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> and scala tympani of the cochlea in human cadaveric temporal bones. The technique we employ, which exploits microscale fiberoptic pressure sensors, enables {{the study of}} differential sound pressure at the cochlear base. This differential pressure is the input to the cochlear partition, driving cochlear waves and auditory transduction. In our results, the sound pressure in <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> (PSV) was much greater than scala tympani pressure (PST), except for very low and high frequencies where PST significantly affected the input to the cochlea. The differential pressure (PSV − PST) is a superior measure of ossicular transduction of sound compared to PSV alone: (PSV−PST) was reduced by 30 to 50  dB when the ossicular chain was disarticulated, whereas PSV was not reduced as much. The middle ear gain PSV/PEC and the differential pressure normalized to ear canal pressure (PSV − PST) /PEC were generally bandpass in frequency dependence. At frequencies above 1  kHz, the group delay in the middle ear gain is about 83  μs, over twice that of the gerbil. Concurrent measurements of stapes velocity produced estimates of cochlear input impedance, the differential impedance across the partition, and round window impedance. The differential impedance was generally resistive, while the round window impedance was consistent with compliance in conjunction with distributed inertia and damping. Our technique of measuring differential pressure {{can be used to}} study inner ear conductive pathologies (e. g., semicircular dehiscence), as well as non-ossicular cochlear stimulation (e. g., round window stimulation and bone conduction) —situations that cannot be completely quantified by measurements of stapes velocity or <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> pressure by themselves...|$|E
40|$|An intense, low-frequency tone (about 30 Hz) modulates the {{sensitivity}} of the inner ear to high-frequency stimulation. This modulation is correlated with the displacement of the basilar membrane. The findings suggest that the modulation may also affect cochlear tuning. We have investigated modulation of cochlear tuning by low-frequency sound in the guinea pig. Applying indirect methods of measurement (narrow-band analysis of compound action potentials and compound-action-potential tuning curves), the results suggest a shift of the excitation pattern along the basilar membrane towards higher-frequency areas. The shift occurred for both scala tympani and <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> displacement of the cochlear partition. Tuning curves, obtained from single units in the cochlear nerve, show sensitivity loss and a tip shift towards lower frequencies. This was also found for both scala tympani displacement and <b>scala</b> <b>vestibuli</b> displacement. The shift of the tip of the tuning curve towards lower frequencies corresponds to the inferred high-frequency shift of the excitation pattern. The relationship of these phenomena with the pathophysiology of Ménière's disease and with possible active mechanisms in cochlear transduction is discussed...|$|E
