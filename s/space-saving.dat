25|$|Starting in 2002, Apple {{moved to}} {{eliminate}} CRT displays from its product line {{as part of}} aesthetic design and <b>space-saving</b> measures with the iMac G4. However, the new iMac with its flexible LCD flat-panel monitor was considerably more expensive on its debut than the preceding iMac G3, {{largely due to the}} higher cost of the LCD technology at the time. In order to keep the Macintosh affordable for the education market and due to obsolescence of the iMac G3, Apple created the eMac in April 2002 as the intended successor; however the eMac's CRT made it relatively bulky and somewhat outdated, while its all-in-one construction meant it could not be expanded to meet consumer demand for larger monitors. The iMac G4's relatively high prices were approaching that of laptops which were portable and had higher resolution LCD screens. Meanwhile, Windows PC manufacturers could offer desktop configurations with LCD flat panel monitors at prices comparable to the eMac and at much lower cost than the iMac G4. The flop of the Power Mac G4 Cube, along with the more expensive iMac G4 and heavy eMac, meant that Macintosh desktop sales never reached the market share attained by the previous iMac G3. For the next half-decade while Macintosh sales held steady, it would instead be the iPod portable music player and iTunes music download service that would drive Apple's sales growth.|$|E
500|$|Another <b>space-saving</b> {{innovation}} was {{the dielectric}} resonator, {{which can be}} used in other filter formats as well as waveguide. [...] The first use of these in a filter was by S. B. Cohn in 1965, using titanium dioxide as the dielectric material. [...] Dielectric resonators used in the 1960s, however, had very poor temperature coefficients, typically 500 times worse than a mechanical resonator made of invar, which led to instability of filter parameters. [...] Dielectric materials of the time with better temperature coefficients had too low a dielectric constant to be useful for space saving. [...] This changed with the introduction of ceramic resonators with very low temperature coefficients in the 1970s. [...] The first of these was from Massé and Pucel using barium tetratitanateO9 (Young et al., page 655) at Raytheon in 1972. [...] Further improvements were reported in 1979 by Bell Labs and Murata Manufacturing. [...] Bell Labs' barium nonatitanateTi9O20 (Nalwa, page 443) resonator had a dielectric constant of 40 and Q of 5000–10,000 at [...] [...] Modern temperature-stable materials have a dielectric constant of about 90 at microwave frequencies, but research is continuing to find materials with both low loss and high permittivity; lower permittivity materials, such as zirconium stannate titanateSnxTiO4 (Gusmano et al., page 690) (ZST) with a dielectric constant of 38, are still sometimes used for their low loss property.Maasé & Pucel (1972)|Cohn (1965)}} ...|$|E
40|$|Turn-based {{stochastic}} {{games and}} its important subclass Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide models for systems with both probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviors. We consider turn-based stochastic games with two classical quantitative objectives: discounted-sum and long-run average objectives. The game models and the quantitative objectives {{are widely used}} in probabilistic verification, planning, optimal inventory control, network protocol and performance analysis. Games and MDPs that model realistic systems often have very large state spaces, and probabilistic abstraction techniques are necessary to handle the state-space explosion. The commonly used full-abstraction techniques do not yield <b>space-savings</b> for systems that have many states with similar value, but does not necessarily have similar transition structure. A semi-abstraction technique, namely Magnifying-lens abstractions (MLA), that clusters states based on value only, disregarding differences in their transition relation was proposed for qualitative objectives (reachability and safety objectives). In this paper we extend the MLA technique to solve stochastic games with discounted-sum and long-run average objectives. We present the MLA technique based abstraction-refinement algorithm for stochastic games and MDPs with discounted-sum objectives. For long-run average objectives, our solution works for all MDPs and a sub-class of stochastic games where every state has the same value...|$|R

2500|$|The market {{changed in}} the 1960s, as the United States [...] "Big Three" [...] {{automakers}} began facing competition from imported cars, the European makers adopted advanced technologies and Japan emerged as a car-producing nation. Japanese companies began to export some of their more popular selling cars in Japan internationally, such as the Toyota Corolla, Toyota Corona, Nissan Sunny, and Nissan Bluebird in the mid-1960s. The success of American Motors' compact-sized Rambler models spurred GM and Ford to introduce their own downsized cars in 1960. Performance engines became a focus of marketing by United States automakers, exemplified by the era's muscle cars. In 1964, the Ford Mustang developed a new market segment, the pony car. New models {{to compete with the}} Mustang included the Chevrolet Camaro, AMC Javelin, and Plymouth Barracuda. Captive imports and badge engineering increased in the United States and the UK as amalgamated groups such as the British Motor Corporation consolidated the market. BMC's <b>space-saving</b> Mini, which first appeared in 1959, was marketed under the Austin and Morris names, until Mini became a marque in its own right in 1969.
