500|$|The 2012–13 {{season was}} Wenger's first without Rice, {{who retired in}} late spring. Bould was named as his replacement, who {{specialised}} in defensive work. Arsenal struggled to find consistency {{in the league and}} were 12 points behind leaders Manchester United by November 2012. A month later, Wenger came under strong criticism following his side's exit in the League Cup to Bradford City, when a full-strength team lost on penalties to opposition three divisions below. Further cup defeats to Blackburn Rovers and Bayern Munich in the FA Cup and Champions League, respectively, ended Arsenal's trophy chances for an eighth consecutive season. Before the first leg, Wenger had criticised the media for reporting he was about to sign a contract extension, and said of the Blackburn game: [...] "We lost it in the last 20 minutes, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of superficial analyses that you cannot accept.

At the same time, you've always got to have one eye keeping an eye on the movie side as well, ensuring that you have fun games that give you the actions that you need for the movies. So that was really challenging, but a really enjoyable aspect of the development. There were two main things: the segmentation technology and the creative aspect of it--coming out with things that are fun, coming up with enough variety. We've got loads of genres in there, from horror movies to sci-fi movies. Coming up with all of those different things and coming up with the games as well, making the two things kind of intermix, so keeping an eye on that, the management of that, and making sure everything worked was a challenge." ...|$|E
50|$|Chakra protects {{database}} and enterprise properties which {{are stored in}} database through database access control. Recently, DBMS(s) have already offered some security function <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of database infringement cases such as log integrity and information leakage abusing data access privilege by internal users rather than external users like hackers. Therefore, Chakra controls user’s database access per privilege level and then a user is able to access only the part of database according to the policy of minimum privilege or Chakra offers a function which parts of data are masked. Especially, data masking reduces burden of the performance and cost for database encryption which is the top security issue recently. Chakra locates between client which requests query to {{database and}} network stream of database and it is monitoring in/out data flow in real time. Also, it saves as audit data. Chakra guarantees log integrity for saved audit data and Chakra policy management history and it protects those safely. Also, it helps administrators to manage audit data safely by backing up those as encryption algorithm. An administrator is able to search the audit data per condition later or handle organization security audit by printing multiple documents above 14 types like *.pdf, *.doc, *.hwp, *.csv, *.xls and so on. Currently, Chakra supports 14 DBs like Oracle, IBM DB2, MS SQL, Sybase IQ, Sybase ASE, Teradata, Altibase, Tibero, Cubrid, Informix, Netezza, Mysql, PostgreSQL and Mainframe DB2.|$|E
5000|$|Wenger's {{preparations}} for the 2011-12 season were disrupted by player unrest. Though he insisted none of his top players would leave the club, Fàbregas eventually moved to Barcelona, while Gaël Clichy and Samir Nasri joined Manchester City. Suspensions and injuries left Wenger fielding an understrength side against Manchester United on 29 August 2011; Arsenal were trounced 8-2, which represented their worst defeat in 115 years. Needing to address the squad's lack of depth, Wenger completed a series of deals {{in the final days}} of the summer transfer window. He mostly brought in experienced players, such as Yossi Benayoun on loan from Chelsea, Everton's Mikel Arteta and Germany international Per Mertesacker. By October, Arsenal had made their worst start to a season in 58 years, losing four of their opening seven matches. However, the team soon harmonised, and in the same month club captain Robin van Persie scored a hat-trick as Arsenal beat Chelsea 5-3. Despite another season of no silverware, Wenger guided Arsenal to third position in the Premier League, thus qualifying for the Champions League for a 15th successive campaign. Van Persie had scored 37 goals, in his first injury-free season for the club. He, however, grew disillusioned with Arsenal's transfer policy, and decided not to renew his contract, with one year remaining. When Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson learnt of the situation, he called Wenger to push through a deal and Van Persie agreed to join Manchester United in August 2012. The club purchased strikers Olivier Giroud and Lukas Podolski in anticipation of the sale. The 2012-13 season was Wenger's first without Rice, who retired in late spring. Bould was named as his replacement, who specialised in defensive work. Arsenal struggled to find consistency in the league and were 12 points behind leaders Manchester United by November 2012. A month later, Wenger came under strong criticism following his side's exit in the League Cup to Bradford City, when a full-strength team lost on penalties to opposition three divisions below. Further cup defeats to Blackburn Rovers and Bayern Munich in the FA Cup and Champions League, respectively, ended Arsenal's trophy chances for an eighth consecutive season. Before the first leg, Wenger had criticised the media for reporting he was about to sign a contract extension, and said of the Blackburn game: [...] "We lost it in the last 20 minutes, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of superficial analyses that you cannot accept. Because one guy says something, everybody goes the same way".Arsenal's chances of finishing in the top four appeared over by March, after defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. With ten league matches remaining, they were seven points behind their rivals, and Wenger admitted his side could not afford any more dropped points. He made changes to the side for their second leg against Bayern, dropping captain Thomas Vermaelen and Szczęsny, in place of Koscielny and Łukasz Fabiański. Though Arsenal were eliminated on the away goals rule, Wenger's adjustments worked in the league as his team went on a run to overhaul Tottenham for a second successive season. A win on the final day against Newcastle United secured fourth position, which Wenger described as a [...] "relief".|$|E
