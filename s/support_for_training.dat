2500|$|In 1615, Stoskopff's {{father died}} and his widowed {{mother went to}} the Strasbourg council once again to ask for <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>training</b> from a {{recognized}} painter. Stoskopff was then sent to Daniel Soreau, a painter who was active in Hanau. In the beginning, Soreau was not very enthusiastic, since he usually chose his apprentices from among his relatives and close friends. However, he finally complied with {{the request of the}} council and assured them that would [...] "make an Albrecht Dürer of this apprentice". There is not a single definite picture by Daniel Soreau existing. It is only possible to draw conclusions about how well the master passed on his artistic skills to his students through the works of his sons, other apprentices of his workshop and through Stoskopff's works.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>training</b> Edinburgh {{swimmers}} was reduced and the City of Edinburgh programme became a separate swimming club. Warrender decided to train its own elite swimmers {{and won the}} Solripe Trophy (East District Swimming Championship) in 2000 [...] {{and for the next}} 12 years,. In the early 2000s, Warrender formed partnerships with SwimEasy (a swimming lessons business started by Gail Smith and Ian Write, two former Warrender coaches) to recruit promising young swimmers. [...] Merchiston Castle School allowed Warrender swimmers to use their pool in exchange for swimming lessons and training to schoolchildren. Club swimmers trained in Barcelona, Spain, Eger, Hungary, Castres, France, Fort Lauderdale, USA, Bühl (Baden), Germany and Reykjavík, Iceland. Between 2005 and 2013, Warrender won the top club award most years at the Scottish National Age Group Championships, several times won the top club award at the Scottish National Short Course and Open Championships and with swimmers were regularly winning medals at Scottish and British national meets.|$|E
