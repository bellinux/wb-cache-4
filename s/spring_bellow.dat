In order to have smooth journey these coaches are fitted with Air <b>Spring</b> <b>Bellows</b> which absorbs the shocks and jerks which are created due to undulation of track and many other reasons. Since Air <b>spring</b> <b>bellows</b> are filled with compressed air some mechanism is required to detect and apply the brakes in the train in case of any such failure. There are many such designs of FIBA which detects the Failure of Air Spring and apply the Brakes. Most of these designs involve {{a large number of}} parts and are comparatively bulkier in size. These reasons have made it a very expensive device. In order to make it more affordable there is need of doing further research on it {{so that it can be}} made economical with out compromising on its functionality and can be used on all kind of passenger trains. This research paper is an attempt in this direction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Solenoid {{operated}} electromagnetic {{control valve}} (ECV) playing {{an important role}} for car’s air conditioning control system. ECV is used in external variable displacement swash plate type compressor and controls the entire air conditioning system {{by means of a}} pulse width modulation (PWM) input signal supplying from an external source (controller). Complete form of ECV contains number of internal features like valve body, core, valve guide, plunger, guide pin, plunger <b>spring,</b> <b>bellows</b> etc. While designing the ECV; dimensions of different internal items must meet the standard requirements as it is quite challenging. In this research paper, especially the dimensioning of ECV body and its three pressure ports through which the air/refrigerant passes are considered. Here internal leakage test analysis of ECV body is being carried out from its discharge port (Pd) to crankcase port (Pc) when the guide valve is placed inside it. The experiments have made both in ordinary and digital system using different assumptions and thereafter compare the results. Keywords—Electromagnetic control valve (ECV), Leakage...|$|R
40|$|The {{precision}} {{and stability of}} adjusted temperatures are critical requirements for electromechanical thermostats. The key element in meeting the requirement is a thermostat bellows. It is a convertor of pressure into force that actuates the mechanical system of the thermostat. Convolutions enabling the axial movement of the bellows cause that the bellows is partly behaving as a <b>spring.</b> Therefore, the <b>bellows</b> has its own spring rate. The setting of the <b>bellows</b> <b>spring</b> rate influences the critical parameters of the thermostat. The aim of the article {{is to find the}} difference between the setting done by bellows producer and setting done by thermostat producer and its influence on the thermostat adjustment...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 years, the {{industry}} standard tool for thermal analysis, SINDA, has been expanded to include advanced thermodynamic and hydrodynamic solutions (“FLUINT”). With the recent culmination of the unique modeling tools, SINDA/ FLUINT has arguably become the most complete general-purpose thermohydraulic network analyzer that is available. Traditional network elements for fluid circuit analyzers include control volumes and flow passages. During the development of modeling tools capable of handling phasic nonequilibrium within SINDA/ FLUINT, several new network elements were created as by-products. This paper describes one of them: control volume interfaces or “ifaces ” for short. Ifaces are used to describe how one control volume abuts another. While originally developed to model liquid-vapor interfaces within two-phase control volumes, {{they can also be}} used to describe pistons, <b>spring</b> <b>bellows,</b> liquid slugs, and curved interfaces such as those between bubbles and liquid as well as those within capillary structures (e. g., sintered wicks). More importantly, they can be used as an imaginary film to subdivide quasi-stagnant control volumes, extending the reach of a 1 D network into certain 2 D and 3 D problems. Despite their abstract nature, ifaces have been well received by analysts for a variety of modeling tasks. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{shows the}} {{relevance}} of the approaches to the object-oriented programming when modeling the pneumatic units (PU). Based on the analysis of the calculation schemes of aggregates pneumatic systems two basic objects, namely a cavity flow and a material point were highlighted. Basic interactions of objects are defined. Cavity-cavity interaction: ex-change of matter and energy with the flows of mass. Cavity-point interaction: force interaction, exchange of energy in the form of operation. Point-point in-teraction: force interaction, elastic interaction, inelastic interaction, and inter-vals of displacement. The authors have developed mathematical models of basic objects and interactions. Models and interaction of elements are implemented in the object-oriented programming. Mathematical models of elements of PU design scheme are implemented in derived from the base class. These classes implement the models of flow cavity, piston, diaphragm, short channel, diaphragm to be open by a given law, <b>spring,</b> <b>bellows,</b> elastic collision, inelastic collision, friction, PU stages with a limited movement, etc. A numerical integration of differential equations for the mathematical models of PU design scheme elements is based on the Runge-Kutta method of the fourth order. On request each class performs a tact of integration i. e. calcu-lation of the coefficient method. The paper presents an integration algorithm of the system of differential equations. All objects of the PU design scheme are placed in a unidirectional class list. Iterator loop cycle initiates the integration tact of all the objects in the list. One in four iteration makes a transition to the next step of integration. Calculation process stops when any object shows a shutdowns flag. The proposed approach was tested in the calculation of a number of PU designs. With regard to traditional approaches to modeling, the authors-proposed method features in easy enhancement, code reuse, high reliability, and low time consuming development. The calculation results of the traditional and authors-proposed approaches are identical. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The article {{describes}} the technology of making thin-walled components and elastic by additive technology SLS using a polyamide powder PA 2200. The characteristics of the selected elements {{and the results of}} their strength tests are presented. The research focuses on the anisotropy of the materials in the various models. Printing processes were investigated on surfaces perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the model. Based on measurements of deformation, coefficients of elasticity, and the influence of selected parameters of the printing process, the accuracy of tested elements were determined. Comparing results of the research indicated that there is a significant influence of direction and printing process parameters on elastic properties. Research can be helpful in the future in the design process of elastic and thin-walled components such as <b>springs</b> and <b>bellows...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the type {{synthesis}} {{of freedom and}} constraint elements for design of general flexure mechanisms. As {{an important step in}} the conceptual design stage, the goal of type synthesis is to qualitatively determine the topology or connectivity of flexure elements and rigid bodies in a mechanism. The synthesis procedure presented here is based on a recently emerging screw theory based approach for flexure mechanisms. We first categorize a list of commonly used atomic flexure primitives including blades, wires, notches and <b>bellow</b> <b>springs</b> etc. We then derive their twist and wrench matrices that mathematically represent their freedom and constraint spaces. The synthesis procedure rigorously follows screw algebra. Freedom elements including R-joints and P-joints are defined as basic motion elements that allow a single rotation or a single translation. By using parallel structures of these flexure primitives, eleven designs of R-joints and eight designs of P-joints are systematically synthesized. As a duality, constraint elements including P-constraints and R-constraints remove a single translation or rotation. In contract to freedom elements, we synthesized serial chains of flexure primitives and obtained six designs of P-constraints and three designs of R-constraints. These freedom and constraint elements form a catalogue of basic building blocks for designing more complex flexure mechanisms. At last we utilize four design examples to demonstrate how to synthesize hybrid structures with serial and parallel combination of these elements...|$|R
