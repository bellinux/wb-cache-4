The effects of dopexamine on the 3 '- 5 '-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -generating system in membrane particles of the human kidney were also investigated. It was found that [3 H]-dopexamine was specifically bound by sections of the human kidney. The binding was partly inhibited by the DA- 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390, by the beta 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118, 551 and by the DA- 2 receptor antagonist domperidone. The 3 antagonists in combination reduced [3 H]-dopexamine binding to nonspecific values.

Proliferation of the connective tissue in hypertrophying muscle was evident in light micrographs, and electron micrographs identified the proliferating cells as enlarged fibroblasts and macrophages; the connective tissue cells remained after hypertrophy was completed.
