The effects of dopexamine on the 3 '- 5 '-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -generating system in membrane particles of the human kidney were also investigated. It was found that [3 H]-dopexamine was specifically bound by sections of the human kidney. The binding was partly inhibited by the DA- 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390, by the beta 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118, 551 and by the DA- 2 receptor antagonist domperidone. The 3 antagonists in combination reduced [3 H]-dopexamine binding to nonspecific values.

To determine the cell type(s) responsible for the increased RNA synthesis, we compared light autoradiographs of control and hypertrophying muscles from rats injected with tritiated uridine 12, 24, and 48 h after inducing hypertrophy. There was an increased number of <b>silver</b> <b>grains</b> over autoradiographs of hypertrophied muscle.

Proliferation of the connective tissue in hypertrophying muscle was evident in light micrographs, and electron micrographs identified the proliferating cells as enlarged fibroblasts and macrophages; the connective tissue cells remained after hypertrophy was completed.
