25|$|The 2013 models gain a new {{front end}} sheet metal along with {{standard}} HID headlamps, {{along with a}} new LED tail light assembly. Performance changes include twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GT’s <b>single</b> <b>supply</b> pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up Tremec 6060 six-speed with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft. Larger Brembo front disc brakes with six-piston calipers, reinforced axle tubes, and aero tweaks to help the car reach 200+mph safely. Ford says the changes {{have resulted in a}} 14-percent reduction in drag and a 66-percent increase in front-end downforce. Also new for 2013 is a larger front anti-roll bar and retuned springs. An rpm-adjustable electronic launch-control function is standard, as is four-mode electronic stability control.|$|E

A <b>single</b> sided <b>supply</b> op-amp is {{one where}} the input and output {{voltages}} can be as low as the negative power supply voltage instead of needing {{to be at least}} two volts above it. The result is that it can operate in many applications with the negative supply pin on the op-amp being connected to the signal ground, thus eliminating the need for a separate negative power supply.|$|R

50|$|For older K&T installations, {{the supply}} and return wires were not {{necessarily}} installed as a pair, and did not necessarily have to be near each other at all. From the fusebox, a <b>single</b> <b>supply</b> wire {{would go to the}} first switch. From there, it would divide into two switching wires. At the second, remote switch the two wires would come together to be a <b>single</b> <b>supply</b> wire again. Finally this supply wire would be routed from the second switch to the light fixture, and then a single return wire would take the shortest path through the building back to the fusebox. The foregoing {{is an example of the}} so-called Carter system wire layout.|$|E

40|$|Balanced {{operation}} of three phase synchronous motors have {{been dealt with}} extensively in the literature. However, unbalanced operation has not received as much attention. One of the interesting unbalanced modes of these motors is their operation from a <b>single</b> phase <b>supply.</b> Such a mode of operation can be of special importance in remote areas where only <b>single</b> phase <b>supply</b> is available {{or in the case}} of an open circuited single line fault. In this paper, the possibility of operating three phase synchronous motors from a <b>single</b> phase <b>supply</b> through the use of a phase balancer capacitor is explored. The criteria for selecting the required phase balancer capacitor is presented, and the analysis of the behaviour of such motors during the starting process is carried out. For this purpose, a rigorous state space mathematical model has been developed. The validity of this model have been verified experimentally. IEE...|$|R

50|$|Admiral Arleigh Burke {{originated}} {{the concept}} of a <b>single</b> <b>supply</b> ship system. He saw the design as an answer to logistics problems he encountered during World War II. The limited speed, range, and payload of early underway replenishment (UnRep) groups prevented resupply due to bad weather and tactical demands of the war. To counter these problems, the Fast Combat Support Ship (AOE) was designed.|$|E
50|$|Regulatory {{bodies and}} {{industry}} can implement strategies and use tools {{in order to}} protect their supply chains and processing facilities from intentional contamination or adulteration.

50|$|For a {{complete}} understanding, {{the game is}} played not only within a supply chain, but two or three supply chains are set up (when there are enough players and volunteers to help).

50|$|The {{output of}} the {{amplifier}} may be direct-coupled to the load, coupled by a transformer, or connected through a dc blocking capacitor. Where {{both positive and negative}} power supplies are used, the load can be returned to the midpoint (ground) of the power supplies. A transformer allows a <b>single</b> polarity power <b>supply</b> to be used, but limits the low-frequency response of the amplifier.

5000|$|In many <b>single</b> <b>supply</b> {{digital and}} analog {{circuits}} the negative power supply is also called [...] "GND".

Power-sensitive designs often have multiple power rails at a given voltage, using them to conserve energy by switching off supplies to components which are not in active use.|$|E
50|$|The first {{single-line}} {{parallel system}} for industry {{was introduced in}} 1937 by Lincoln Engineering (now known as Lincoln Industrial) in the United States.

In this type of system, a central pump station automatically delivers lubricant through a <b>single</b> <b>supply</b> line to multiple branches of injectors. Each injector serves a single lubrication point, operates independently and may be individually adjusted to deliver the desired amount of lubricant.|$|E
