25|$|Born in Franklinton, North Carolina, a small textile {{and tobacco}} town, Harvey grew up {{alongside}} his father who owned his own land, {{which was very}} uncommon for black farmers in the 1930s. When his tenants stole from his property, Harvey’s father lost his land. Refusing to join the sharecropping business, Harvey looked for work in Durham. In 1936, Harvey found {{a job at the}} American Tobacco Company where the segregated unions troubled him. In a journal article about his father, the younger Harvey wrote, “I got my hatred for segregation from my father. He was raised up in the house of a white couple, two liberal lawyers. He learned to always <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> himself.” In 1943, Harvey worked at the Krueger Bottling Company in Durham where he successfully led efforts to integrate the segregated black and white unions. During the black union protest against the segregated pay scales, forty-four out of the forty-five whites in the plant joined the black union in their strike.|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{gave her}} first post-election {{interview}} to The Politics Show Scotland on 18 December 2011, {{speaking of the}} [...] "huge challenge" [...] of rebuilding public trust in Scottish Labour after its election defeat of the previous May, and a general decline in support over the preceding decade. Attributing the party's losses to its failure to engage with the electorate, she told the programme that Labour needed to <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> {{the interests of the}} Scottish people, and accept more devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament. Attending her first session of First Minister's Questions as Labour leader on 22 December 2011, she addressed the issue of child neglect following the conviction of a Glasgow woman for the murder of her son and asking what lessons could be learned from the case.|$|E
500|$|Like Powderfinger's {{previous}} album Internationalist, Odyssey Number Five {{commented on}} social and political issues heavily, with the primary point of focus being Aboriginal affairs. The lyrics of [...] "Like a Dog" [...] attacked former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard's Liberal government for its treatment of Indigenous Australians, and for breaking the [...] "relaxed and comfortable" [...] promise he made in the Australian federal election, 1996. Lead singer Bernard Fanning related this to the band's other ethical stances—refusing to appear on Hey Hey it's Saturday, for its anti-gay commentary, or not allowing Powderfinger songs {{to be used in}} jingles, amongst others—stating, [...] "We're not here to set an example. We just want to be happy with ourselves and not end up with a guilty conscience." [...] Fanning said that despite [...] "Like a Dog" [...] being about a political issue, it was not a political song, rather just Powderfinger [...] "voicing our opinions". The band worked with boxer Anthony Mundine on the song's music video, whom Fanning praised as [...] "the perfect lead, {{in terms of what the}} song is about and the fact that he’s prepared to <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> what he believes in." ...|$|E

500|$|Ward's {{trial began}} at the Old Bailey on 28 July. He was charged with living off the {{earnings}} of Keeler, Rice-Davies and two other prostitutes, and with procuring women under 21 {{to have sex with}} other persons. [...] The thrust of the prosecution's case related to Keeler and Rice-Davies, and turned on whether the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments they had given to Ward while living with him amounted to his living off their prostitution. Ward's approximate income at the time, from his practice and from his portraiture, had been around £5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time. In his speeches and examination of witnesses, the prosecuting counsel Mervyn Griffith-Jones portrayed Ward as representing [...] "the very depths of lechery and depravity". The judge, Sir Archie Marshall, was equally hostile, drawing particular {{attention to the fact that}} none of Ward's supposed society friends had been prepared to <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> him. Towards the end of the trial, news came that Gordon's conviction for assault had been overturned; Marshall did not disclose to the jury that Gordon's witnesses had turned up and testified that Keeler, a key prosecution witness against Ward, had given false evidence at Gordon's trial.|$|E
500|$|Colin Stutz of Filter {{gave the}} album {{a score of}} 91% and stated: [...] "Wilco has {{constructed}} their most straightforward release in recent memory, which relies heavily on the inspired intricacies of a full-hearted band." [...] Richard Cromelin of Los Angeles Times gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it [...] "The most musically direct and down to earth of the band's six-album career." [...] Andrew C. Bradick of Prefix Magazine gave the album a favorable review and called it [...] "Wilco's first step toward aging well, but it transcends transition and is an album that sounds right in its place and time." [...] Alan Shulman of No Ripcord gave it a score of eight stars out of ten and said, [...] "Wilco {{has come up with}} 50% of a classic album and 50% of a merely decent one. Buy it for the moments you simply won’t hear anywhere else." [...] Will Hermes of Spin gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it [...] "A near-perfect album by a band that seems, finally, to have found their identity." [...] Alternative Press gave it four stars out of five and said, [...] "It's apparent it takes deft skill to sound this simple." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes also gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "While the elders will rejoice [...] this sober, satisfied, and craftily subdued effort, the younglings of the bunch, with their abbreviated attention spans, iPod shuffles, and demand for instant gratification, will declare the album a boring and lethargic affair." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine likewise gave it four stars out of five and said that [...] "Though it may not fit comfortably alongside any other albums in Wilco's catalogue, Sky Blue Sky is further confirmation that, even at their most retro, they're among contemporary pop music's most vital acts." [...] Likewise, Graeme Thomson of The Observer gave it four stars and said, [...] "The closer you listen to the jazzy guitars, Beatles touches and easy, shuffling rhythms ... the more it transpires that Tweedy is simply allowing the songs sufficient room to <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|J.R. {{explains}} to Jock and Bobby that Ewing Oil is doing fine, leaving Bobby suspicious. J.R. had swindled {{most of the}} other oilmen that he knows to salvage Ewing Oil by convincing their cartel to buy worthless oil fields from him just prior to nationalization. Cartel member, Jordan Lee hounds the Ewings about their underhandedness and makes sure they know Seth Stone committed suicide {{as a result of the}} dealings. Soon thereafter, Sue Ellen nurses a hangover while watching the local news to see reports that Ewing oil sold off its holdings just before the nationalization. The report ends with the story of the widowed Marilee Stone, whose husband Seth had bought shares from Ewing Oil. Marilee's calls to J.R. are refused. Cartel member Vaughn Leland, who lost $20 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in the deal, reaches Ewing Oil offices to express his belief that J.R. duped him, but Jock refuses to offer any restitution. All of the cartel members have lost everything they had in the deal and J.R. increased his wealth in the dealings. [...] The Ewings question whether J.R. took advantage of inside information. J.R. assures his father and brother that such unethical behavior was beneath him. [...] Lucy Ewing spends time with her professor/boyfriend who is only interested in her for one reason. Attorney Alan Beam visits Kristin Shepard for ideas about how J.R. might have swindled everyone. Shepard suggests Hank Johnson may have information. [...] Shepard has been tape recording secrets of the cartel members from between the sheets and learned how J.R. got them all to buy his oil wells. Beam asks her to try to get information from Johnson by pretending to still be J.R.'s secretary. Bobby talks with Miss Ellie about Pam who has flown to Corpus Christi to find her mother, Rebecca. They both think it is because she is grieving from the recent death of her father Digger. Sue Ellen apologized for her drunken behavior the prior night and laments that it gave J.R. fodder for his plans to re-institutionalize her. Bobby says he will try to keep J.R. from taking that action. J.R. tells Johnson to ignore Shepard's request for records and to shred them. [...] Sue Ellen sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Elby. She gets a reminder about drinking until you are unconscious and promises to stop. J.R. confronts Kristin about her mischief. He tries to bribe her to leave, but she does not accept the offer. J.R. spends some time with Sue Ellen. She alerts him that Bobby is going to <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> her. He is not worried. She then inquires about whether he is going to be unfaithful. When he leaves for another woman she gets upset, but finds a gun lying around, which gives her pause.|$|E
