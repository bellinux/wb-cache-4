40|$|Abstract. —Evaluation of the biases in {{sampling}} methodology {{is essential for}} understanding the limitations of abundance and biomass estimates of fish populations. Estimates from surveys that rely solely on bottom trawls may be particularly vulnerable to bias if pelagic fish are numerous. We evaluated the variability in the vertical distribution of fish biomass during the U. S. Geological Survey’s annual <b>spring</b> <b>bottom</b> trawl survey of Lake Superior using concurrent hydroacoustic observations to (1) test the assumption that fish are generally demersal {{during the day and}} (2) evaluate the potential for predictive models to improve bottom trawl– determined biomass estimates. Our results indicate that the assumption that fish exhibit demersal behavior during the annual <b>spring</b> <b>bottom</b> trawl survey in Lake Superior is unfounded. Bottom trawl biomass (B BT estimates (mean 6 SE) for species known to exhibit pelagic behavior (cisco Coregonus artedi, bloater C. hoyi, kiyi C. kiyi, and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax; 3. 01 6 0. 73 kg/ha) were not significantly greater than mean acoustic pelagic zone biomass (B APZ) estimates (6. 39 6 2. 03 kg/ha).

Plots of maximum sheer stress and maximum reversing shear versus the axial load for the 57 mm SSME HPTOP bearing were created. A plot of the bearing thermal growth versus preload spring deflection was generated.
