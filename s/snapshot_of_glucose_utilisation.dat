40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the permeation {{of cardiac}} muscle cells by glucose {{and the effect}} of insulin on this process were examined in the isolated perfused rat heart. Previous attempts to determine the parameters <b>of</b> permeation by <b>glucose</b> are considered to be imprecise because endogenous insulin influenced experi¬ mental results, intracellular glucose was inaccurately measured and estimates <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> were not associated with defined concentrations of extracellular or intracellular glucose. In principle the parameters of permeation can be deter¬ mined from a steady state relationship between glucose uptake and the intracellular and extracellular concentration <b>of</b> <b>glucose.</b> Alternatively they can be determined from the relationship between the uptake and the extracellular concentration <b>of</b> <b>glucose.</b> if the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> metabolism are taken into account. A novel apparatus for cardiac perfusion was therefore developed in which hearts were brought to a steady state <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> permeation and <b>utilisation.</b> In the apparatus hearts were perfused with a small volume of perfusate under well controlled conditions. Glucose concentration in perfusates was estimated by rapid and accurate automated methods which met the requirements of the procedure. The <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> was determined not only in the steady state but also throughout the approach to that state. The first method for the determination of the parameters of permeation was impracticable because accurate estimates <b>of</b> intracellular <b>glucose</b> could not be made with methods currentlyavailable. Consequently the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> were compared with the predictions of a mathematical model in which permeation was assumed to be a simple carrier mechanism and the phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> to be an irreversible enzymecatalysed reaction. Agreement was found. Estimates made of the parameters of permeation in the presence and absence of insulin were in qualitative accord with previous work. The hormone increased the half saturation constant at least 3 -fold and the maximum rate of permeation 5 -fold. The estimates of the parameters of permeation in the presence of insulin may be inaccurate because in their determination the possibility of a concentration gradient in the extracellular glucose was ignored. However, the estimates provide a reason¬ able explanation of a phenomenon which was observed when the time-course <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> was studied in the absence of exogenous insulin. A stimulation of utilisation, presumably by endogenous insulin, occurred consistently only at concentra¬ tions <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> greater than ImM. It was concluded that the estimates are an improvement on previous values and that the apparatus is a useful addition to the methods available {{for the study of the}} metabolism of isolated hearts...|$|R

40|$|Gut fuel {{utilisation}} {{has several}} unique features. Arterial and luminal fuels provide nutrition for the enterocyte, the former being of more importance. This factor, and {{the heterogeneity of}} cell types within the gut {{makes it difficult to}} define its fuel utilisation. Metabolic control logic suggests that modulation of the maximal activity of any pathway resides in those enzymes that operate in vivo at rates far below their maximal capacity and that catalyse non-equilibrium reactions. On this basis, although enterocyte hexokinase activity is much higher than in other 'glycolytic' cells (for example, brain), potentially high rates <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> are modulated by substrate cycling <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> 6 -phosphate back to glucose through glucose 6 -phosphatase. Glutamine metabolism proceeds by glutaminase to produce glutamate, which may then be transaminated (aspartate-aminotransferase and alanine-amino transferase) to produce alpha-ketoglutarate, alanine, and aspartate. The end products of glutamine metabolism by incubated gut preparations in vitro (mainly alanine), suggests that enterocytes, not immune cells, are responsible for most gut glutamine metabolism. High flux rates <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> and glutamine metabolism in the enterocyte may result from the need for de novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines and ribose sugars for nucleic acid synthesis. Sepsis reduces rates <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> and glutamine metabolism, perhaps to preserve the increased consumption of these fuels by activated lymphocytes and macrophages in the gut wall...|$|R

This is a powerful technique, which provides researchers and clinicians the opportunity to study the status of healthy and pathological tissue by examining how it processes substances of interest. Widely used tracers include 18 F-uorodeoxyglucose, an analog <b>of</b> <b>glucose,</b> which is used as the radiotracer in over ninety percent of PET scans. This radiotracer provides a way of quantifying the distribution <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> in vivo. The interpretation of PET time-course data is complicated because the measured signal is a combination of vascular delivery and tissue retention effects. If the arterial time-course is known, the tissue time-course can typically be expressed in terms of a linear convolution between the arterial time-course and the tissue residue function. As the residue represents the amount of tracer remaining in the tissue, this {{can be thought of as}} a survival function; these functions been examined in great detail by the statistics community. Kinetic analysis of PET data is concerned with estimation of the residue and associated functionals such as ow, ux and volume of distribution. This thesis presents a Markov chain formulation of blood tissue exchange and explores how this relates to established compartmental forms. A nonparametric approach to the estimation of the residue is examined and the improvement in this model relative to compartmental model is evaluated using simulations and cross-validation techniques. The reference distribution of the test statistics, generated in comparing the models, is also studied. We explore these models further with simulated studies and an FDG-PET dataset from subjects with gliomas, which has previously been analysed with compartmental modelling.

In 14  patients follow up PET scans were performed after a mean (SD) period of 11. 6  (9. 5) months.  RESULTS—PET scans showed hypometabolism {{in at least one}} brain region in all patients with severe or mild CNS symptoms (100 %) as compared with patients without cerebral symptoms (40 %) (p< 0. 0025). Parieto-occipital regions were most commonly affected (96 %), followed by parietal regions (32 %). In contrast, MRI images were abnormal in only 11  of 22  patients (50 %) with neuropsychiatric symptoms and in one of four patients (25 %) without symptoms. In 12  of 14  patients examined in follow up PET scans persistence, improvement or worsening of cerebral symptoms were associated with unchanged, decreased or increased brain hypometabolism, respectively. No significant correlation was found between PET or MRI findings and autoantibody profiles.  CONCLUSIONS—PET imaging represents a sensitive tool to detect manifest or subclinical CNS involvement in SLE and PET findings correlate well with the clinical course of disease. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the recent}} years, {{multiple}} studies demonstrated that C-peptide {{is not an}} inert peptide, but exerts important physiological effects. C-peptide binds to cell membranes, stimulates the Na,K-ATPase and the endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Moreover, {{there is evidence that}} C-peptide decreases glomerular hyperfiltration and increases <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Nevertheless, there is still limited knowledge concerning mechanisms leading to an increased <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> either in rats or in humans. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give an overview over the published studies regarding C-peptide and glucose metabolism from in vitro studies to longer lasting studies in humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of the absorption and metabolism <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> in rat small intestine by insulin was studied by the perfusion of isolated loops of proximal jejunum in vitro. The addition of an active, monomeric form of insulin, despentapeptide-insulin, to the serosal side of the intestine from normal rats inhibited luminal glucose absorption (421 (11) to 285 (11) mumol/h/g dry wt, p less than 0. 001) and lactate production (340 (28) to 192 (26) mumol/h/g dry wt, p less than 0. 001), but {{had no effect on}} <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> (231 (11) and 210 (16) mumol/h/g dry wt). The production of acute insulin deficiency by the injection of anti-insulin serum in vivo caused a marked inhibition <b>of</b> luminal <b>glucose</b> absorption (421 (11) to 240 (13) mumol/h/g dry wt, p less than 0. 001), <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> (231 (11) to 48 (2) mumol/h/g dry wt, p less than 0. 001) and lactate production (340 (28) to 94 (2) mumol/h/g dry wt, p less than 0. 001) in vitro. The effects of insulin deficiency were reversed by despentapeptide-insulin in vitro, so that the rates of absorption and metabolism for intestine from insulin deficient and normal rats were similar {{in the presence of the}} modified insulin. All the effects caused by insulin deficiency and despentapeptide-insulin were apparent within minutes and could not be attributed to hyperglycaemia. It is concluded that rat small intestine is subject to rapid and direct regulation by insulin...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a single}} {{injection}} of 7. 5 x 10 (7) U kg- 1 of human recombinant tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) to female NMRI mice, marked hypoglycaemia was observed within a 2 h period, {{accompanied by a}} severe depletion of liver glycogen and a drop in rectal body temperature when compared with pair-fed controls. There was no alteration in plasma alanine, lactate or pyruvate values, but an elevation of acetoacetate and 3 -hydroxybutyrate when compared with pair-fed controls. Production of 14 CO 2 from U- 14 C-glucose was reduced in TNF-alpha treated animals, while production of 14 CO 2 from U- 14 C-palmitate was {{not significantly different from}} controls, suggesting that the glucose was not being used to provide an increased metabolic rate. <b>Glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> by different tissues was investigated by the 2 -deoxyglucose tracer method. This showed that 2 h following TNF-alpha infusion <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> was increased in colon, liver, kidney and spleen by 500, 350, 36 and 25 % respectively. However, when calculated on a whole-animal basis the major contributor to the increased glucose consumption was the liver. Plasma levels of both FFA and triglycerides were also elevated in TNF-alpha treated animals, suggesting that increased consumption <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> by the liver may be utilised for lipogenesis. The rate <b>of</b> conversion <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> into lipids in the liver was more than doubled 2 h after TNF-alpha administration with a concomitant rise in plasma and adipose tissue. These results suggest that administration of TNF-alpha produces a severe hypoglycaemia in order to serve an increased lipogenesis in liver and adipose tissue, which appears to be independent of the anorectic effect...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a growing}} problem in South Africa and of concern to traditional African health practitioners in the Nelson Mandela Metropole, because they experience {{a high incidence of}} diabetic cases in their practices. A collaborative research project with these practitioners focused on the screening of Bulbine frutescens, Ornithogalum longibracteatum, Ruta graveolens, Tarchonanthus camphoratus and Tulbaghia violacea for antidiabetic and cytotoxic potential. In vitro <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> assays with Chang liver cells and C 2 C 12 muscle cells, and growth inhibition assays with Chang liver cells were conducted. The aqueous extracts of Bulbine frutescens (143. 5 %), Ornithogalum longibracteatum (131. 9 %) and Tarchonanthus camphoratus (131. 5 %) showed significant increased <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> activity in Chang liver cells. The ethanol extracts of Ruta graveolens (136. 9 %) and Tulbaghia violacea (140. 5 %) produced the highest increase in <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> in C 2 C 12 muscle cells. The ethanol extract of Bulbine frutescens produced the most pronounced growth inhibition (33. 3 %) on Chang liver cells. These findings highlight the potential for the use of traditional remedies in the future for the management of diabetes and it is recommended that combinations of these plants be tested in future...|$|R
40|$|Alcaligenes eutrophus NCIMB 40529 {{was grown}} in {{continuous}} culture (D= 0. 1 h- 1) under glucose, ammonium, potassium and oxygen limitation. The rates of PHB production (qPHB) were highest during ammonium-limited growth and lowest during glucose-limited growth. The PHB content of cells grown under ammonium limitation exhibited {{an inverse relationship}} to the dilution rate (D), whilst the rate <b>of</b> substrate (<b>glucose)</b> <b>utilisation</b> (qS) increased with D. It was concluded that glucose is utilised increasingly {{for the production of}} non-polymer biomass (NPB) as D increases, with the resulting diminution of PHB synthesis. PHB production from alternative carbon substrates was also studied in ammonium-limited chemostat culture (D= 0. 1 h- 1). PHB content, the rate of PHB production (qPHB) and qS varied substantially with the nature of the carbon source in the order lactate pyruvate glucose/gluconate fructose. qPHB was not related to umax in batch culture or to the relative oxidation-reduction states of the substrates, but was directly related to the qSsurplus i. e. the rate of substrate utilisation above that required solely for the production of NPB. The substantially higher qPHB from lactate than from glucose in ammonium limited chemostat culture reflected the inability of the cell to regulate lactate utilisation at D umax, whereas <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> is partially repressed under these conditions. Washed cells prepared from, glucose- and lactate-limited chemostat cultures (D= 0. 1 h- 1) metabolised glucose and lactate respectively at significantly faster rates than the cultures from which they were derived. Both types of washed cells synthesized PHB, indicating that the biosynthetic enzymes are constitutive; this was confirmed by assay of a representative biosynthetic enzyme in broken cells prepared from carbon- and ammonium-limited chemostat cultures. Washed cells also excreted pyruvate. It is suggested that carbon-limited cells are derepressed for carbon substrate uptake and catabolism, and that pyruvate excretion reflects the limited capacity of non-growing cells for pyruvate utilisation. Citrate synthase, a potentially important regulatory enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in A. eutrophus, was purified. The enzyme consisted of a single type of subunit with a Mr of 47, 000, and exhibited a native Mr of 227, 000. Citrate synthase activity displayed a hyperbolic dependence on both oxaloacetate (Km= 1. 2 mM) and acetyl Co A (Km= 94 uM) concentration, and a sigmoidal dependence of inhibition by NADH (I 50 = 0. 62 mM). It is concluded that, apart from its insensitivity to AMP, the enzyme is similar to citrate synthases purified from other Gram-negative aerobes...|$|R
40|$|Morphologic and {{metabolic}} {{change is}} a known property of the adult brain. A number of behavioural tasks alter local cerebral blood flow and <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation.</b> The expression <b>of</b> the <b>glucose</b> transporter 1 (GLUT 1), which allows the entry <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> to the brain, also {{has been shown to}} change in response to long-lasting neuronal activation. However, {{little is known about the}} effect of acute neuronal activation on GLUT 1 expression. Using immunohistochemistry and Western blot, we investigated cerebral GLUT 1 expression and vasculature density in mice undergoing a 48 -hour voluntary wheel running period. The results showed that the striatum was the main region where GLUT 1 protein was up-regulated: There was a trend for GLUT 1 expression and blood vessels density to be associated with the distance run during the experiment. These results indicate that short-term increased neuronal activation is associated with rapid changes in glucose transport and possibly vascular remodelling...|$|R

40|$|Metabolic changes {{following}} injury {{have been}} observed for many years, and John Hunter discussed such changes in 1794. Changes in carbohydrate metabolism {{have been observed}} for a similar length of time, and glycosuria and hyperglycaemia have been reported {{by a number of}} observers. This paper records and quantitates the extent of hyperglycaemia in patients undergoing surgery of different degrees of severity and relates them to changes in blood insulin, growth hormone, cortisol, and catecholamine concentrations. Further animal studies were performed which suggested that a fall in intracellular <b>glucose</b> <b>utilisation</b> may be a contributory factor. The use of isotope labelling <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> in man has enabled further studies to be done to clarify changes in exchangeable glucose mass, replacement rate, and space both in the normal situation and in the presence of infusions <b>of</b> glucagon, noradrenaline, <b>glucose,</b> and amino-acids. The hyperglycaemia is clearly the result of a complex interaction of changes in the availability and activity of hormones which control glucose metabolism both within and outside the cell...|$|R
40|$|The short chain fatty acids, acetate, propionate, and {{butyrate}} {{are produced}} by colonic bacterial fermentation of non-starch polysaccharides. Butyrate is the major fuel source for the colonic epithelium and {{there is evidence to}} suggest that its oxidation is impaired in ulcerative colitis. Triplicate biopsy specimens were taken at colonoscopy from five regions of the large bowel in 15 sufferers of ulcerative colitis. These patients all had mild or quiescent colitis as assessed by clinical condition, mucosal endoscopic and histological appearance. The rate <b>of</b> oxidation <b>of</b> <b>glucose,</b> glutamine, and butyrate through to carbon dioxide was compared with that in biopsy specimens from 28 patients who had no mucosal abnormality. Butyrate (272 (199 - 368)) was the preferred fuel source for the colitic mucosa followed by glutamine (33 (24 - 62)) then glucose (7. 2 (5. 3 - 15)) pmol/micrograms/hour; medians and 95 % confidence intervals, p < 0. 01. There was no regional difference in the rate of utilisation of these metabolites. In the group with colitis the rate of butyrate oxidation to carbon dioxide was significantly impaired compared with that in normal mucosa decreasing from 472 (351 - 637) pmol/micrograms/hour to 272 (199 - 368) pmol/micrograms/hour; median and 95 % confidence intervals, p = 0. 016. The rate <b>of</b> <b>glucose</b> and glutamine <b>utilisation</b> were not significantly different between normal and colitic mucosa.
