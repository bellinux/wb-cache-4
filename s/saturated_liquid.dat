Testing Aspects of Superdielectric Behavior, 25 July 2014 - ME Auditorium 1300 with Lecturer Jon Phillips, Research Professor, Physics Department, Naval Postgraduate School. To test {{a theory}} of the {{recently}} discovered phenomenon of superdielectric behavior, the dielectric constants of several ‘pastes’, composed of porous alumina powders lled {{to the point of}} incipient wetness with water containing dissolved sodium chloride, were measured. The dielectric constants of some of the pastes were greater than 1010, which is dramatically higher than that of any material ever reported. These results are consistent with this recently postulated model of superdielectric behavior in porous, non-conductive materials <b>saturated</b> with ion-containing <b>liquids.</b> Upon the application of an electric eld, ions dissolved in the <b>saturating</b> <b>liquid</b> contained in the pores will travel to the ends of pore lling liquid droplets creating giant dipoles. The elds of these giant dipoles oppose the applied eld, reducing the net eld created per unit of charge on the capacitor plates, e ectively increasing charge/voltage ratio, hence capacitance. Other observations reported herein include, i) the impact of ion concentration on dielectric values; ii) a maximum voltage similar to that associated with the electrical breakdown of water; iii) the loss of capacitance upon drying; and iv) the recovery of capacitance upon the addition of water to a dry super dielectric material. All observations are consistent with the earlier proposed model of the super dielectric phenomenon. An extrapolation of results suggests this technology can lead to energy density greater than the best lithium ion battery. NPS Defense Energy Progra...|$|R
