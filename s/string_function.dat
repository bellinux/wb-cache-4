40|$|Just as {{a stream}} {{function}} gives both a {{qualitative and quantitative}} description of the flow, a 'string function' can be constructed to describe the propagation in a rotating fluid of large-scale energy anomalies such as eddies and Rossby waves. To simply introduce the <b>string</b> <b>function</b> in this paper, we consider only a homogenous 1 -layer fluid. In this case, the <b>string</b> <b>function</b> is inversely proportional to large-scale potential vorticity and the contours of both are aligned.

40|$|The authors derive a <b>string</b> <b>function</b> that {{describes}} the propagation of large-scale, potentially large amplitude, baroclinic energy anomalies in a two-layer ocean with variable topography and rotation parameter. The generality of the two-layer results allows results for the 1 -layer, 1. 5 -layer, inverted 1. 5 -layer, lens, and dome models to be produced as limiting-cases. The <b>string</b> <b>function</b> is a scalar field {{that acts as a}} streamfunction for the propagation velocity. In the linear case the <b>string</b> <b>function</b> is simply c 2 o/f, where co is the background baroclinic shallow water wave speed, and typically describes propagation poleward on the eastern boundaries, westward (with some topographic steering) over the middle ocean, and equatorward on the western boundaries. In the more general nonlinear case, the <b>string</b> <b>function</b> is locally distorted by the anomaly. In the fully nonlinear examples of a lens or dome, there is no rest or background string function; the <b>string</b> <b>function</b> is generated entirely by the disturbance and propagation is due to asymmetric distribution of the anomalous mass over the <b>string</b> <b>function</b> contours. It is shown that conventional beta/topographic propagation results (e. g., beta drift of eddies, the Nof speed of cold domes) can be obtained as limiting cases of the <b>string</b> <b>function.</b> The <b>string</b> <b>function</b> provides, however, more general propagation velocities that are also usually simpler to derive. The first baroclinic mode <b>string</b> <b>function</b> for the global oceans is calculated from hydrographic data. The westward propagation speeds in the ocean basins as derived from the meridional gradient of the <b>string</b> <b>function</b> are typically two to five times faster than those expected from standard theory and agree well with the propagation speeds observed for long baroclinic Rossby waves in the TOPEX/Poseidon data...|$|E

Results for an aluminium sheet of roughness R_a = 0. 84 5 m, showed a maximum in friction coefficient of 0. 04 at a speed of 16 mm s^- 1. Below this speed the friction coefficient fropped to 0. 002 at 0. 2 mm s^- 1 and results from different ice samples were very reproducible. Above 16 mm s^- 1, the friction coefficient initially dropped to about 0. 002 at 100 mm s^- 1 and then increased again to 0. 037 at 400 mm s^- 1.

40|$|We have {{generated}} and characterized a Drosophila cyclin E hypomorphic mutation, DmcycEJP, that is homozygous viable and fertile, but results in adults with rough eyes. The mutation arose from an internal deletion {{of an existing}} P[w+lacZ] element inserted 14 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the DmcycE zygotic mRNA. The presence of this deleted P element, but not the P[w+lacZ] element from which it was derived, leads to a decreased level of DmcycE expression during eye imaginal disc development. Eye imaginal discs from DmcycEJP larvae contain fewer S phase cells, both anterior and posterior to the morphogenetic furrow. This results in adults with small rough eyes, largely due to insufficient numbers of pigment cells. Altering the dosage of the Drosophila cdk 2 homolog, cdc 2 c, retinoblastoma, or p 21 (CIP 1) homolog dacapo, which encode proteins known to physically interact with Cyclin E, modified the DmcycEJP rough eye phenotype as expected. Decreasing the dosage of the S phase transcription factor gene, dE 2 F, enhanced the DmcycEJP rough eye phenotype. Surprisingly, mutations in G 2 /M phase regulators cyclin A and string (cdc 25), but not cyclin B 1, B 3, or cdc 2, enhanced the DmcycEJP phenotype without affecting the number of cells entering S phase, but by decreasing the number of cells entering mitosis. Our analysis establishes the DmcycEJP allele as an excellent resource for searching for novel cyclin E genetic interactors.
