5|$|Destiny Fulfilled is {{the fifth}} and final studio album by American R trio Destiny's Child. It was {{released}} on November 16, 2004, by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. Unlike their previous material, this record <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins {{as well as several}} new producers.|$|E

5|$|The 1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game {{featured}} Magic Johnson's Michigan State University team facing {{off against}} Larry Bird's Indiana State University team. This meeting has been immortalized {{as the beginning}} of the Lakers and Celtics rivalry of the 1980s, which <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> team being represented by either player respectively. The game also attracted the largest ever TV rating for an NCAA Championship game, with 38 percent of all television viewers that night tuned to the game.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} control and improve administration, various schemes {{to divide the}} work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried between 285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour between East and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), for the ultimate imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although the co-emperors often <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> other as rivals or enemies.|$|E
5|$|In 1823 Hogg met Jane Williams {{while they}} were both visiting Percy Shelley's friend John Gisborne, husband of Maria Gisborne. Jane and her common-law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley's shortly before his death. Edward Williams and Shelley died in a boating accident, leaving Jane alone with two young children. Hogg soon became very enamoured with her. They <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> other at the Gisborne {{household}} regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823. That December {{he went back to}} Northern England to see his family. While he was there, he began writing to Jane regularly. The following spring he frequently visited her at her mother's house, and they often took long walks together. In March she moved out of her mother's house into a home of her own, allowing Hogg to see her more freely.|$|E

5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{featured}} sixteen fighters, in either {{one or two}} weight categories. The first two seasons, however, were very different from each following season. The original format for The Ultimate Fighter <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> team compete in challenges, such as hoisting their respective coach up on their shoulders and sprinting down a beach, or a team tug-of-war. These challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn't fought, {{until late in the}} season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} heavy {{media attention}} with over ten television stations and seventy news reporters being represented. The North Carolina Tar Heels jumped {{out to an}} early 197 lead in the first half, before the Jayhawks were able to close the lead before halftime. In the second half, the Jayhawks managed to fully overcome the deficit and take the lead. However, the Tar Heels were able {{to tie the game}} in the final minute, sending the game to overtime. The first overtime <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> team score a basket before time ran out, while the second overtime saw zero points scored due to poor offensive execution on both teams parts. The third overtime saw more action take place, with the Tar Heels winning the game 5453 as Joe Quigg made two free throws in the closing seconds to give the Tar Heels the lead.|$|E
5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E

After the show has finished, the [...] "actors" [...] (the same characters with a more worn-out expression) break character and reveal themselves to be much older and grumpier than the characters they portray.|$|R
5|$|Austen met, danced with, {{and perhaps}} {{fell in love}} with Thomas Lefroy during the Christmas {{holidays}} in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> other again. Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying Austen in 1797. Austen family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the Austen family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved of this young man, but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again. Austen received her only proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. Austen at first accepted the proposal, then realized she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day. Austen biographer Park Honan suggests that Jane may have received a proposal of marriage from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer Claire Tomalin dismisses this claim.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> of Parliament's 272 geographical constituencies return one MP to the National Assembly. It {{resulted in}} a Pakistan Muslim League (N) majority, and a massive loss of seats for the Pakistan Peoples Party. Pakistan Muslim League (N) became the single largest party, though without an overall majority. The Pakistan Muslim League (N) won 188 seats in the National Assembly through a simple majority. This {{resulted in a}} hung parliament. A coalition agreement was then formed following negotiations with the independent candidates who joined the PML(N) which allowed party to form a simple-majority government by bringing on-board nineteen independent candidates, thirteen more than the minimum required to form a government. This swing ultimately resulted in Nawaz Sharif becoming the new Prime Minister of Pakistan for the third time. Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah won a PPP leadership vote to succeed Nisar Ali Khan as permanent Leader of the Opposition. Ayaz Sadiq and Murtaza Javed Abbasi of PML-N elected as the legislature’s speaker and deputy speaker, respectively.|$|E
5|$|With {{military}} action {{in close proximity to}} Goryeo territory, coupled with a cancelled Liao invasion of Goryeo in 947 and a strong diplomatic and cultural relationship between the Goryeo and Song dynasties, Liao-Goryeo relations were exceedingly poor. Both Liao and Goryeo <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> other as posing a military threat; the Khitans feared that Goryeo would attempt to foment rebellions among the Balhae population in Liao territory, while Goryeo feared invasion by the Liao. The Khitans did invade Goryeo in 992, sending a force that the Liao commander claimed to be 800,000 strong, and demanding that Goryeo cede to territories along the Yalu River. Goryeo appealed for assistance from the Song dynasty, with which they had a military alliance, but no Song assistance came. The Khitans made steady southward progress before reaching the Ch'ongch'on River, at which point they called for negotiations between Liao and Goryeo military leaders. While the Liao initially demanded total surrender from Goryeo, and Goryeo initially appeared willing to consider it, the Korean negotiator was eventually able to convince the Khitans to accept a resolution in which the Goryeo dynasty became a tributary state to the Liao dynasty. By 994, regular diplomatic exchanges between Liao and Goryeo began, and the relationship between Goryeo and Song irrevocably chilled.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after their}} accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by {{granting}} him the Earldom of Marlborough and Prince George was made Duke of Cumberland. Anne requested {{the use of}} Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused {{tension between the two}} sisters. Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow Prince George to serve in the military in an active capacity. The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction. From around this time, at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone. In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household. Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset. Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her. In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never <b>saw</b> <b>each</b> other again. Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.|$|E
