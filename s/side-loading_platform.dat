50|$|Inside {{the station}} building, escalators, stairs and an {{elevator}} {{provide access to}} the mezzanine level where the pedestrian overpass connects the station to Bow Trail and the Greyhound Bus Depot.

50|$|This station {{replaces the}} former centre-loading 10 Street SW {{platform}} and relocated one block to the west. Initially, {{the name of}} this new dual <b>side-loading</b> <b>platform</b> was to be just 11 Street SW. However, Calgary City Hall changed the name to its present form because {{of the history of the}} Kerby family name in this location and the proximity to the Kerby Centre (a major social services centre primarily for seniors). The only other two-platform station in downtown is the City Hall station at the eastern end of the 7 Avenue SW transit mall. As part of the Calgary Transit Seventh Avenue refurbishment project Downtown West-Kerby has been built to accommodate 4-car consists.|$|E

50|$|The station's <b>side-loading</b> <b>platforms</b> are {{staggered}} with {{a pedestrian}} {{crossing of the}} tracks between the two platforms. This is the first LRT station in Calgary to have staggered platforms. The second station to be constructed this way is Martindale in the N.E. 206 parking spaces are made available at the station.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other <b>side-loading</b> <b>platforms</b> on the 7 Avenue S transit mall, 10 Street {{station was}} the only centre-loading platform, {{allowing}} passengers to board {{on either side of}} the station (access to the station was offered from the nearby intersection, though users commonly jumped off the platform and walked across the street).|$|R
50|$|It {{is located}} near {{the north end of}} a short tunnel that passes {{underneath}} 42nd Avenue. 229 parking spaces are available at the station on both sides. The station consists of two <b>side-loading</b> <b>platforms</b> and is completely at grade. 39 Avenue Station is the most exposed station to the elements as there is no canopy at all, unlike every other LRT station.|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} one of two that was {{constructed}} as part of a 2.9-kilometer (1.8-mile) extension of the Northeast line from McKnight-Westwinds station to Saddletowne station. It is located in a reserved right-of-way within the community of Martindale, with the <b>side-loading</b> <b>platforms</b> to be staggered west and east of Martindale Boulevard. Due to its location in a residential area primarily serving local residents, there are no park-and-ride lots at the station nor a bus terminal, unlike most other CTrain stations in Calgary. Also, because of its location, CTrain speeds are reduced to 50 km/h (31.06 mi/h) in the general area.|$|R
2500|$|... 10 Street W – {{permanently}} {{closed and}} removed on September 15, 2012. The new station replacing it, which opened on December 8, 2012, has dual <b>side-loading</b> <b>platforms</b> and is located one block west. This project was initially proposed to be undertaken in 2006, following {{the opening of}} the new 1 Street W station. However, the City of Calgary decided to defer the project to coincide with {{the opening of the}} West Line and continue on with refurbishment of the other stations. This new station was initially called [...] "11 Street W" [...] up until the Summer of 2012 when it was renamed to Downtown West – Kerby.|$|R
