I lay a night upon the road and enjoyed delectable cookery of potatoes, and some other sensible things, adoption of which at home would inevitably be shown to be fraught with ruin, somehow or other, to that rickety national blessing, the British farmer; and at last I was rattled, like a single pill in a box, over leagues of stones, until--madly cracking, plunging, and flourishing two grey tails about--I made my triumphal entry into Paris.|$|E

Inbred Lines Are Highly Homozygous When we picture a population of laboratory animals, particularly rodents, we think almost reflexively about inbred lines. We are accustomed to thinking about inbred lines in the context of laboratory rodents because many laboratory populations are inbred. A number of inbred strains currently in use have an ancestry that traces back nearly a century, to the years shortly after the rediscovery of Mendel's laws. Inbred strains, once formed, are maintained over succeeding generations by repeated brother-sister mating (i. e., close inbreeding), so th...|$|R

In Aotearoa/New Zealand the indigenous Māori population has a substantially younger age structure than the non-indigenous population making it necessary to account for age differences when comparing population health outcomes. An age-standardised rate is a summary measure of a rate that a population would have if it had a standard age structure. Changing age standards have stimulated interest in the potential impact of <b>population</b> <b>standards</b> on disparities data and consequently on health policy. This paper compares the age structure of the Māori and non-Māori <b>populations</b> with two <b>standard</b> <b>populations</b> commonly used in New Zealand: Segi's world and WHO world populations. The performance of these standards in Māori and non-Māori mortality data was then measured against the use of the Māori <b>population</b> as a <b>standard.</b> It was found that the choice of <b>population</b> <b>standard</b> affects the magnitude of mortality rates, rate ratios and rate differences, the relative ranking of causes of death, and the relative width of confidence intervals. This in turn will affect the monitoring of trends in health outcomes and health policy decision-making. It is concluded that the choice of age standard has political implications and the development and utilisation of an international indigenous <b>population</b> <b>standard</b> should be considered. </p...|$|R

In 2014, the aged dependency ratio (the ratio of people over 65 to those age 15-65, indicating the ratio of the dependent elderly population to those of working age) was 40%, meaning two aged dependents for every five workers. This is expected to increase to 60% by 2036 and to nearly 80% by 2060.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Gardner et al.(2007) suggest that Hamilton's rule {{can be applied}} to multi-locus models, but that it should be done at the point of {{interpreting}} theory, rather than the starting point of enquiry. They suggest that one should [...] "use <b>standard</b> <b>population</b> genetics, game theory, or other methodologies to derive a condition for when the social trait of interest is favored by selection and then use Hamilton's rule as an aid for conceptualizing this result". A recent paper by Nowak et al. (2010) suggested that standard natural selection theory is superior to inclusive fitness theory, stating that the interactions between cost and benefit can not be explained only in terms of relatedness. This, Nowak said, makes Hamilton's rule at worst superfluous and at best ad hoc. Gardner in turn was critical of the paper, describing it as [...] "a really terrible article", and along with other co-authors has written a reply, submitted to Nature.In work prior to Nowak, various authors derived different versions of a formula for , all designed to preserve Hamilton's rule. Orlove noted that if a formula for [...] is defined so as to ensure that Hamilton's rule is preserved, then the approach is by definition ad hoc. However, he published an unrelated derivation of the same formula for [...] - a derivation designed to preserve two statements about the rate of selection - which on its own was similarly ad hoc. Orlove argued that the existence of two unrelated derivations of the formula for [...] reduces or eliminates the ad hoc nature of the formula, and of inclusive fitness theory as well. The derivations were demonstrated to be unrelated by corresponding parts of the two identical formulae for [...] being derived from the genotypes of different individuals. The parts that were derived from the genotypes of different individuals were terms {{to the right of the}} minus sign in the covariances in the two versions of the formula for [...] By contrast, the terms left of the minus sign in both derivations come from the same source.One study suggest the c/b ratio be considered as a continuum of this behavioral trait rather than discontinuous in nature. From this approach fitness transactions can be better observed because there is more to what is happening to affect an individual's fitness than just losing and gaining (Engles, W.R. 1982).|$|E
