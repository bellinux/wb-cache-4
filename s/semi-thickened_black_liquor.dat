40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>liquor</b> {{gasification}} at {{high temperature}} is a promising {{alternative to the}} conventional recovery boiler process used in chemical pulping today. In the <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> gasification process <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> is atomised by a gas- assisted nozzle and sprayed into a reactor where it is directly gasified by an reaction with oxygen steam and carbon dioxide.

The work presented in this report was performed to gain understanding and aid in optimisation of the atomisation process in the current <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> gasification process. The method used was spray visualisations by shadowgraphy using intensive lighting and high speed photography. The experiments were carried out in the spray test rig at the Energy Technology Centre (ETC) in Piteå and performed at elevated ambient pressures and different operational conditions. The first part of the work was to improve the current spray test rig at ETC considering the window purging system to avoid droplets on the sight windows, the nitrogen delivering system used for atomisation and a <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> heating and delivering system. The final setup of the spray test rig made it possible to keep the optical access windows clean, control the temperature of the atomisation gas and pump and heat the <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> up to 115 °C. The second part of the current work was to perform visualisations of the <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> atomisation process in the improved spray test rig. Variables like fluid temperatures, ambient pressure, nitrogen gas flow and <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> flow were changed in order to see how these influence the gas- assisted atomisation process of <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> The nozzle used in this work was a standard coaxial gas-assisted nozzle, which is not an optimised nozzle for the <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> gasification process.

40|$|Kraft pulping, {{also known}} as {{sulphate}} pulping is a complex process where the wood components are liberated from each other facilitated by chemical reactions. During the pulping process some dissolved and degraded compounds end up together with the spent cooking chemicals in the <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> In kraft pulping of hardwood, the <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> contains substantial amounts of dissolved hemicellulose, especially xylan due to the wood composition. The xylan content is of high value due to its ability to re-deposit by adsorption on cellulose fibres and its tendency to increase pulp strength and yield. In this work, the possibility of introducing xylan rich, hardwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> from the hardwood digester into the softwood digester at the process of SCA – Munksund was studied. The objective was to investigate if hardwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> addition in a softwood cook can increase the yield and pulp strength. The theoretical feasibility of altering the process was investigated by a literature review and a brief process investigation. During the study a total of eight lab cooks were conducted to obtain information on how hardwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> addition changes the pulp quality of regular softwood cooks. The wood chips, white <b>liquor</b> and hardwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> used were collected at Munksund and the process conditions in the lab cooks were chosen to simulate the actual process in the Munksund mill. In addition to the cooking, chemical and physical evaluation on pulps, cooking liquors and wood chips were performed. The theoretical evaluation indicates that the process in Munksund is well suited for introducing the hardwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> in to the softwood digester. The chemical analysis of the <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> show a xylan content that is approximately four times higher in the hardwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> compared to the softwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> In the kappa number range of approximately 80 - 90, a total yield increase of 0. 4 %-units was obtained for two cooks with hardwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> addition compared to their corresponding reference cooks. A carbohydrate analysis showed a higher xylan content in the pulp cooked with addition of hardwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> compared to the corresponding reference pulp. One pulp with hardwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> addition and its corresponding reference cook were refined in an Escher Wyss lab mill. The pulp with hardwood <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> addition exhibits an increase or retained strength for all strength evaluation tests made on handmade pulp sheets.

40|$|The Kraft pulping {{process is}} the {{dominant}} chemical pulping process in the world. Roughly 195 million metric tons of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> are produced annually as a by-product from the Kraft pulping process. <b>Black</b> <b>liquor</b> consists of spent cooking chemicals and dissolved organics from the wood and can contain up to 0. 15 wt% nitrogen on dry solids basis. The cooking chemicals from <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> are recovered in a chemical recovery cycle. Water is evaporated {{in the first stage}} of the chemical recovery cycle, so the <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> has a dry solids content of 65 - 85 % prior to combustion. During combustion of <b>black</b> <b>liquor,</b> a portion of the <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> nitrogen is volatilized, finally forming N 2 or NO. The rest of the nitrogen remains in the char as char nitrogen. During char conversion, fixed carbon is burned off leaving the pulping chemicals as smelt, and the char nitrogen forms mostly smelt nitrogen (cyanate, OCN-). Smelt exits the recovery boiler and is dissolved in water. The cyanate from smelt decomposes in the presence of water, forming NH 3, which causes nitrogen emissions {{from the rest of the}} chemical recovery cycle. This thesis had two focuses: firstly, to determine how the nitrogen chemistry in the recovery boiler is affected by modification of black liquor; and secondly, to find out what causes cyanate formation during thermal conversion, and which parameters affect cyanate formation and decomposition during thermal conversion of <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> The fate of added biosludge nitrogen in chemical recovery was determined in Paper I. The added biosludge increased the nitrogen content of <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> At the pulp mill, the added biosludge did not increase the NO formation in the recovery boiler, but instead increased the amount of cyanate in green liquor. The increased cyanate caused more NH 3 formation, which increased the NCG boiler’s NO emissions. Laboratory-scale experiments showed an increase in both NO and cyanate formation after biosludge addition. <b>Black</b> <b>liquor</b> can be modified, for example by addition of a solid biomass to increase the energy density of <b>black</b> <b>liquor,</b> or by separation of lignin from <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> by precipitation. The precipitated lignin can be utilized in the production of green chemicals or as a fuel. In Papers II and III, laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to determine the impact of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> modification on NO and cyanate formation. Removal of lignin from <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> reduced the nitrogen content of the <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> In most cases NO and cyanate formation decreased with increasing lignin removal; the exception was NO formation from lignin lean soda liquors. The addition of biomass to <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> resulted in a higher nitrogen content fuel mixture, due to the higher nitrogen content of biomass compared to <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> More NO and cyanate were formed from the fuel mixtures than from pure <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> The increased amount of formed cyanate led to the hypothesis that <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> is catalytically active and converts a portion of the nitrogen in the mixed fuel to cyanate. The mechanism behind cyanate formation during thermal conversion of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> was not clear before this thesis. Paper IV studies the cyanate formation of alkali metal loaded fuels during gasification in a CO 2 atmosphere. The salts K 2 CO 3, Na 2 CO 3, and K 2 SO 4 all promoted char nitrogen to cyanate conversion during gasification, while KCl and CaCO 3 did not. It is now assumed that cyanate is formed when alkali metal carbonate or an active intermediate of alkali metal carbonate (e. g. -CO 2 K) reacts with the char nitrogen forming cyanate. By testing different fuels (bark, peat, and coal), each of which had a different form of organic nitrogen, it was concluded that the form of organic nitrogen in char also has an impact on cyanate formation. Cyanate can be formed during pyrolysis of <b>black</b> <b>liquor,</b> but at temperatures 900 °C or above, the formed cyanate will decompose. Cyanate formation in gasifying conditions with different levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere was also studied. Most of the char nitrogen was converted to cyanate during gasification at 800 - 900 °C in 13 - 50 % CO 2 in N 2, and only 5 % of the initial fuel nitrogen was converted to NO during char conversion. The formed smelt cyanate was stable at 800 °C 13 % CO 2, while it decomposed at 900 °C 13 % CO 2. The cyanate decomposition was faster at higher temperatures and in oxygen-containing atmospheres than in an inert atmosphere. The presence of CO 2 in oxygencontaining atmospheres slowed down the decomposition of cyanate.

Out of the three fungi studied, Trametes versicolor U 97 showed the most degraded fungus onagar medium containing <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> In liquid medium, the percentage of decolorization ranged from 70 % to 89 % at 30 days depending on the fungal strain...|$|R

In the current work, the combustion of pre-dried solid samples of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> (BL), chlorination effluent (C/D), and extraction effluent (E 1) as well as two-component and three-component mixtures was investigated experimentally in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and in a Constant-Temperature Tube Furnace. Results of the thermogravimetric analyses showed that solids from the C/D stage were {{similar to those of the}} <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> solids in the volatile matter, char, and ash contents, while the solids from the E 1 stage contained less volatiles and were richer in their ash content. Results also revealed that both effluents were devolatilized and gasified at lower rates than that of <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> The addition of up to 20 % of either effluent did not have a significant impact of the TGA behaviour of <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> In addition, mixtures containing solids from the three liquors were very close to <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> in terms of their devolatilization and gasification rates and followed a weight-loss trend similar to that of <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> Effect of temperature, O 2, mixing ratio on the chemical compositions of combustion products was investigated in a constant-temperature tube furnace. Chemical analyses of the gaseous and solid phases were performed using a Mass Spectrometer (MS) and an Ion Chromatograph (IC), respectively. Results showed the combustion products of two-component mixtures containing up to 20 % of C/D or E 1 in <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> solids would not be significantly different from those of typical <b>black</b> <b>liquor,</b> except that they contained more HCl in the gas phase and larger amounts of chloride in the solid phase, especially when C/D was added. Their amounts were greatly influenced by temperature and oxygen. Combustion of three-component mixtures (BL-C/D-E 1) resulted in products very similar to those obtained during the combustion of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> alone.

40|$|Many of {{the pulp}} mill {{biorefinery}} concepts recently presented include removal of lignin from <b>black</b> <b>liquor.</b> In this work, {{the aim was}} to study how the change in liquor chemistry affected the evaporation of kraft <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> when lignin was removed using the LignoBoost process. Lignin was removed from a softwood kraft <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> and four different <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> were studied: one reference <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> (with no lignin extracted); two ligninlean <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> with a lignin removal rate of 5. 5 % and 21 %, respectively; and one liquor with maximum lignin removal of 60 %. Evaporation tests were carried out at the research evaporator in Chalmers University of Technology. Studied parameters were liquor viscosity, boiling point rise, heat transfer coefficient, scaling propensity, changes in liquor chemical composition, and tube incrustation. It was found that the solubility limit for incrustation changed towards lower dry solids for the lignin-lean <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> due to an increased salt content. The scaling obtained on the tubes was easily cleaned with thin liquor at 105 °C. It was also shown that the liquor viscosity decreased exponentially with increased lignin outtake and hence, the heat transfer coefficient increased with increased lignin outtake. Long term tests, operated about 6 percentage dry solids units above the solubility limit for incrustation for all liquors, showed that the heat transfer coefficient increased from 650 W/m 2 K for the reference liquor to 1500 W/m 2 K for the liquor with highest lignin separation degree, 60 %. Application: This study can be used to help assess the consequences for an evaporation plant concerning both changes in capacity and risk for fouling when evaluating a biorefinery concept, including lignin removal, at a mill. It also adds novel information to the research work on <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> evaporation.

The steam flow increases with increasing <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> dry solids content. Increasing closure of the pulp mill means that less heat per unit of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> dry solids will be available in the furnace.

This paper compares two alternative options for producing hydrogen from biomass: (A) pulp-mill-integrated hydrogen production from gasified back liquor; and (B) stand-alone production of hydrogen from gasified biomass. The comparison assumes that {{the same amount of}} biomass that is imported in Alternative A is supplied to a stand-alone hydrogen production plant and that the gasified <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> in Alternative B is used in a <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> gasification combined cycle (BLGCC) CHP unit. The comparison is based upon equal amounts of <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> fed to the gasifier, and identical steam and power requirements for the pulp mill. The two systems are compared on the basis of total CO 2 emission consequences, based upon different assumptions for the reference energy system that reflect different societal CO 2 emissions reduction target levels. Ambitions targets are expected to lead to a more CO 2 –lean reference energy system, in which case hydrogen production from gasified <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> (Alternative A) is best from a CO 2 emissions’ perspective, whereas with high CO 2 emissions associated with electricity production, hydrogen from gasified biomass and electricity from gasified <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> (Alternative B) is preferable...|$|R
40|$|Scaling in <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> {{evaporators}} has {{for long}} been recognised as a problem. Most problems {{are connected to}} the precipitation of sodium salts. In the <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> evaporation, as the <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> gets concentrated, sodium carbonate and sodium sulphate will saturate and precipitate from the solution. When precipitation occurs the salts may crystallise on the heat transfer surface or adhere to the surface as well as they can crystallise in the bulk. If crystals remain on the heat transfer surface an insulating layer of scales can quickly build up causing the heat flux to drop and eventually forcing the evaporator to be shut down for cleaning. The research in this paper focused primarily on scaling for <b>black</b> <b>liquors</b> with high ratio of carbonate to sulphate, a condition shown to be important in industrial <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> evaporators (Frederick et al. 2004). The scaling behaviour was investigated experimentally in a falling film evaporator. The aim was to find favourable operating conditions decreasing or eliminating scaling. The examined parameters were different heat flux, circulation flow rate, internal residence time and <b>black</b> <b>liquor</b> feed concentration. For the investigated operating conditions the main parameters affecting scaling were the circulation flow rate and heat flux whereas the scaling rate was seen independent of the internal residence time. </p...|$|R
