50|$|The {{property}} that secures the principal debt {{is referred to}} as the security object. The security parties are the debtor, known as the secured party, and the creditor, known as the <b>security</b> <b>holder.</b> Real security rights give the <b>security</b> <b>holder</b> the power to prevent the secured party from disposing of it, as well as a right of preference (ius praeferendi). Where the secured party is unwilling to repay the principal debt, or is insolvent, the <b>security</b> <b>holder</b> may, after the security object has been attached and sold in execution, claim the proceeds from that sale before any other creditor. Real security rights are limited real rights (or iura in re aliena, or rights in someone else’s property). They confer limited and specific entitlements on their holders and are enforceable against third parties.|$|E
50|$|Real {{security}} rights do not entitle the <b>security</b> <b>holder</b> to use {{and enjoyment}} of the security object, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.|$|E
50|$|The {{security}} agreement {{is not sufficient}} {{for the creation of}} a real security right. For the right to exist, the parties must comply with the publicity principle which holds that limited real rights are perfected by due publicity. Thus, the right must be publicised, although the manner will differ depending on whether the security object is movable (in which case it must be delivered to the <b>security</b> <b>holder)</b> or immovable (in which case it must be registered in the Deeds Registry). Once publicity has taken place, a real security right will vest in the <b>security</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{parties who}} are {{permitted}} to access CHESS {{are referred to as}} participants, who are either members of ASX (e.g., brokers) or otherwise approved non-brokers. Each participant is allocated a unique participant code. A <b>security</b> <b>holder</b> on CHESS must be either a CHESS participant or be sponsored by one (e.g., a client of a broker). Sponsored uncertificated security holders are allocated a unique holder identifying code (HIN) in CHESS, which together with the participant's code provides the authority under which CHESS will allow a transfer of securities.|$|E
50|$|In {{accordance}} with the specificity principle, the security object must be clearly determined and described in the security agreement. It cannot be property belonging to the <b>security</b> <b>holder,</b> because, by definition, one cannot have a limited real right in one’s own property. It may be movable or immovable; {{it may be a}} single thing (res singula) or an aggregate of things (universitas rerum); it may even be incorporeal, as with a servitude. The secured party must be the owner of the security object, or at least a duly-authorised representative of the owner.|$|E

25|$|Using US definitions, {{a person}} who owns street name {{securities}} and {{who is not a}} member of an exchange, holds the securities through a registration chain which involves one or more custodians. This is due to the perceived impracticality of registering traded securities in the name of each individual holder; instead, the custodian or custodians are registered as the holders and hold the securities in a fiduciary arrangement for the ultimate <b>security</b> <b>holders.</b> However, the ultimate <b>security</b> <b>holders</b> are still the legal owners of the securities. They are not merely beneficiaries of the custodian as a trustee. The custodian does not become at any point the owner of the securities, but is only a part of the registration chain linking the owners to the securities.|$|R
