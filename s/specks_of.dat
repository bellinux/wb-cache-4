5|$|A. m. sigillatum: Wax {{yellow to}} tan dorsal stripe forming spotty to {{irregular}} shaped blotches along body ending in dots or <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> dorsal color on head. Number of vomerine teeth equals 44. Number of costal grooves equals 13.|$|E
5|$|A. m. macrodactylum: Citrine, dull citrine, to tan {{dorsal stripe}} that is diffuse and {{continuous}} along grayish body. Pattern ending in diffuse <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> stripe color or absent on head and snout. White flecks on sides sometimes {{coming together to}} form larger flecks. Number of vomerine teeth equaling 33, forming a distinguished transverse arc. Number of costal grooves equals 13.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of attack}} {{may be found}} in the form of tiny piles of book-dust and <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> frass. Damage may be {{concentrated}} in the spine, the projecting edges of pages and the cover. Prevention of attack relies on keeping books in cool, clean, dry positions with low humidity, and occasional inspections should be made. Treatment can be by freezing for lengthy periods, but some insect eggs are very resistant and can survive for long periods at low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Saturn is {{probably}} {{best known for the}} system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique. The rings extend from 6,630km to 120,700km outward from Saturn's equator, average approximately 20meters in thickness and are composed of 93% water ice with traces of tholin impurities and 7% amorphous carbon. The particles that make up the rings range in size from <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> dust up to 10m. While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Battleship Division Nine's {{time with}} the Grand Fleet, combating boredom was a {{constant}} difficulty. Located at the northeastern tip of Scotland, the islands surrounding Scapa Flow {{were little more than}} barren, cold, windswept <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> land devoid of the trappings of civilization. Due to the efforts of the officers to keep their men entertained, however, morale remained high throughout the war. The British worked hard to turn the anchorage into a more inviting place. Central to these efforts were sporting events. The Fleet held numerous inter-ship competitions, including soccer, rugby, rowing, track, and boxing, which were followed with intense interest by the men of the respective ships.|$|E
5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E

5|$|The larvae {{of clothes}} moths (mainly Tineola bisselliella and Tinea pellionella) feed on fabrics and carpets, {{particularly}} those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres, including wool, silk and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> excrement. Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating {{and the use of}} chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, permethrin, pyrethroids or other insecticides may need to be used.|$|E
25|$|The word {{peridotite}} {{comes from}} the gemstone peridot, which consists of pale green olivine. Classic peridotite is bright green with some <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> black, although most hand samples tend to be darker green. Peridotitic outcrops typically range from earthy bright yellow to dark green in color; this is because olivine is easily weathered to iddingsite. While green and yellow {{are the most common}} colors, peridotitic rocks may exhibit a wide range of colors such as blue, brown, and red.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} stage, {{abnormal}} new blood vessels (neovascularisation) form {{at the back}} of the eye as part of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR); these can burst and bleed (vitreous hemorrhage) and blur the vision, because these new blood vessels are fragile. The first time this bleeding occurs, it may not be very severe. In most cases, it will leave just a few <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> blood, or spots floating in a person's visual field, though the spots often go away after few hours.|$|E

60|$|In {{the middle}} <b>of</b> the <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> light before him {{appeared}} a <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> black; {{and then a}} shrill whistle, dulled by {{millions of tons of}} earth, reached his ears from thence. It was what he had been on his guard against all the time,--a passing train; and instead of taking the trouble {{to come out of the}} tunnel he stepped into a recess, till the train had rattled past and vanished onward round a curve.|$|R
25|$|In Attappadi region gold grains {{are found}} only in native state and occur in {{different}} shapes and sizes. Visible <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> gold were noticed in the samples collected from veins, particularly where the associated sulphides {{have been subjected to}} weathering and leaching resulting in the formation of limonite. Gold grains with maximum dimension of 2mm were reported. Pyrite is the dominant sulfide phase within the quartz lodes (occurring as stringers and fracture fillings). Chalcopyrite, covellite, chalcocite, and galena are commonly observed in the mineral assemblage.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{bronchitis}} {{is defined}} as a productive cough that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. Most people with chronic bronchitis have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Protracted bacterial bronchitis {{is defined as}} a chronic productive cough with a positive bronchoalveolar lavage that resolves with antibiotics. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis may include wheezing and shortness of breath, especially upon exertion and low oxygen saturations. The cough is often worse soon after awakening and the sputum produced may have a yellow or green color and may be streaked with <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} {{eye and the}} ocelli supply insect vision. The compound eye {{consists of}} individual light receptive units called ommatidia. Some ants may have only one or two, however dragonflies may have over 10,000. The more ommatidia the greater the visual acuity. These units have a clear lens system and light sensitive retina cells. By day, the image flying insects receive {{is made up of}} a mosaic of <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> differing light intensity from all the different ommatidia. At night or dusk, visual acuity is sacrificed for light sensitivity. The ocelli are unable to form focused images but are sensitive mainly, to differences in light intensity. Colour vision occurs in all orders of insects. Generally insects see better at the blue end of the spectrum than at the red end. In some orders sensitivity ranges can include ultraviolet.|$|E

500|$|A team of restorers led by conservators Umberto Baldini and Ornella Casazza at the [...] "Laboratario del Restauro" [...] in Florence spent {{ten years}} reapplying paint. They worked {{in an almost}} {{pointillist}} manner, {{with the aid of}} computer modelling. The tiny <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> pigment floating around the piece were recovered with pliers by staff wading in the water after the torrents had subsided. The wooden frame had significantly weakened, and it was necessary to separate it from both the gesso and canvas to prevent buckling as the reapplied paint dried. The restorers succeeded in returning the work close to its original appearance, and it was put back on public display in 1976.|$|E
500|$|... "Music" [...] {{ended with}} a group of female dancers in cheerleading uniforms joining Madonna onstage for [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin. Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. joined her onstage, dressed in Egyptian-style clothing, and they danced as cheerleaders with pom-poms. During the song they stood on separate, {{elevated}} platforms, where Minaj and M.I.A. performed their respective verses. CeeLo Green came onstage with a marching band {{at the end of the}} song, and he and Madonna performed portions of [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] and [...] "Express Yourself". [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] opened to a darkened stadium, with small <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> light visible, and a large choir dressed in black joined Madonna onstage. She reached the top of the bleachers and sang the final line before being pulled beneath the stage, surrounded by smoke.

These are small spherical regions in which the iron oxide colouration has been discharged about a centre. A minute speck is usually found in the middle. The colour {{has been attributed to}} the decay of small <b>specks</b> <b>of</b> organic matter but recent work suggests that a radioactive centre may be responsible. Other examples of this secondary change of colour from red to greenish-grey are seen along joint planes where the altered zone may only be a fraction of a millimetre thick and sometimes on the cheeks of a gypsum vein.|$|E
