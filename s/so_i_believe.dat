500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "The Amazing Maleeni" [...] started with {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz. When pitching {{ideas for the}} seventh-season episodes, Spotnitz wanted an episode to deal solely on [...] "magic and illusion" [...] and {{have nothing to do}} with the paranormal. Spotnitz had been petitioning the writers of The X-Files for a magic-based episode since season two, but nothing ever came to light. Eventually, during the seventh season, Vince Gilligan was assigned to write the episode, something he described as [...] "agony". Gilligan explained, [...] "The episode started with Frank, because he—for several years—had wanted to write an episode about magicians. Frank was a fan of the TV show The Magician with Bill Bixby <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that was part of it, but Frank was interested in the idea of magic and the idea of fooling people who wished to be fooled." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Romanian Premier Alexandru Marghiloman {{traveled}} to Bessarabia to canvass for the unionist cause, {{he found the}} Peasant Faction divided between followers of Ion Inculeț, who endorsed the Romanian viewpoint, and deputies who sided with Tsyganko. Zamfirescu, who traveled with Marghiloman, recalls that Tsyganko [...] "thrice in one month" [...] attempted to recall the Republic's Directorate, his moves resisted by Inculeț. He also protested the selection of pro-Romanian students from Kiev and Odessa as representatives of the Transnistrian Moldavians, in which he saw efforts to shake {{the balance of power}} inside the Sfatul. Zamfirescu claims to have saved Tsyganko from an undisclosed mortal danger, and then to have conversed with him, trying to gain insight into his political motivations. The latter, he concluded, were [...] "most phantasmagorical socialist ideas", not dissuaded by the prospect of [...] "death, suffering, military disaster, sheer destitution, or degeneracy". He adds: [...] "It was late at night, I was experiencing chills, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> I have insulted the convictions of this visionary youth, reassuring him that all opinions lead to a ministerial chair, provided one makes sure to discard them on cue." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 224, when Zhang Wen was 31, he was {{appointed}} as General of the Household Who Upholds Righteousness (輔義中郎將) and sent on a diplomatic mission to Wu's ally state, Shu Han. Before he left, Sun Quan told him, [...] "I actually didn't want to send you on this mission. I did so because I was worried that Zhuge Liang might misinterpret my dealings with the Caos. We should work more closely together with Shu after eliminating {{the threat of the}} Shanyue. As an envoy, you've a mission to complete but you aren't restricted in speech." [...] Zhang Wen replied, [...] "I've never held great responsibilities in the court before, nor do I possess the ability to handle diplomatic affairs well. I'm afraid I can neither spread Wu's fame as well as Zhang Zhao did, nor make decisions as well as Zichan. However, Zhuge Liang is wise, discerning and good in long-term planning, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> he will definitely understand your intentions and the reasons behind your dealings with Wei. With the blessing of the imperial court, I believe it won't be difficult to understand what Zhuge Liang is looking out for. There is nothing to worry about." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in supports that will allow us to do that." ...|$|E
