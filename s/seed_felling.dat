40|$|The {{conservation}} of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) {{stands in the}} territory of Parco Lombardo Valle del Ticino (province of Milano and Pavia) : main results and management proposals {{after three years of}} testing [...] In the territory of “Parco Lombardo della Valle del Ticino” an experiment, aimed to assess the silviculture pattern suitable for the {{conservation of}} stands dominated by peduncolate oak, was set up in 2008. Four experimental areas were located, both in “meso-hygrophilous” and “mesophilous” sites, respectively corresponding to: (a) : less intense seed felling; (b) : more intense <b>seed</b> <b>felling</b> (both of them aimed to promote the natural regeneration); (c) : opening of gap (800 m 2) followed by artificial regeneration (both protected and non-protected by shelters); (d) : control. Three years after the set up of the experiment, the main results may be summarized as follows: (i) : both the seed fellings (the more and the less intense felling) produced a process of natural regeneration, at present insufficient to ensure the continuity of the forest canopy cover; (ii) : the branchwood released after utilization produced a positive effect on settlement and growth of peduncolate oak seedlings, attributable to the protection both from the roe deer browsing and wild boar acorn consumption; (iii) : ventilated shelters (Tubex Ventex®) produced a positive effect on planting stock, both in terms of survival and growth; (iv) : monitoring over time, especially as regards the analysis of the effects of different types of treatment on the processes of regeneration, can provide indications management extensible in similar populations in the territory of the Parco Lombardo Valle del Ticino...|$|E

40|$|Outline: Tells {{the parable}} in simple language; then gives the {{explanation}} of the meaning. Simple and straightforward. This script is a basic guideline for translation and recording in other languages. It should be adapted to different cultures and languages to make it relevant to each area where it is used. Some terms and concepts used may need a fuller explanation or even be omitted in different cultures. Script Text Jesus began to preach. Listen to what He told the people. One day a man went out to plant his garden. He scattered the seeds with his hands. Some <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> {{on the side of}} the path. The birds came and ate them. Some other <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> on stony ground only thinly covered with soil. These seeds grew quickly, but the roots could not go deep because of the stones. When the sun became hot, these plants dried up. The roots were not deep enough. Some other <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> among thorns and weeds. They grew up together. By and by the thorns became so thick that the plants could not grow any more. The plants never brought forth any good seeds. But some <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> into good ground. They grew well from the time they were small until they were big. Some plants brought forth 30 seeds; some had 60 seeds; some even had 100 seeds. Jesus said: "If you have ears, you ought to hear and understand this story! Jesus' friends said, "What does this story mean?" Jesus said, "The seed is the words of God. " They are the good news that God sends to all people. The ground is like the hearts of people who hear God's Word. Some people's hearts are hard like the ground {{on the side of the}} path. God's Word cannot penetrate them. For this reason Satan can steal the word away from them. Other people's hearts are like the stony ground. They are glad when they hear the story of God. They think that to be a Christian is easy. But when other people laugh at them or make trouble for them, they give up. Other people are like the ground where the thorns grew. They receive the Word of God, but they also love things of this life. They worry about many things instead of praying about them. They want to have a good time. At the finish they do not bear any seeds. But some people are like the good ground. These people hear God's Word and take it into their hearts. They obey it. Their lives show that they belong to God. They love Him with all their strength. They bear many seeds. Some of these good seeds are: Love, joy, peace, a quiet mind, kindness, goodness, promise keeping, gentle behavior, control over desires (Gal. 5 : 22) and telling others about Jesus. Will you say to Jesus these words? "Take my heart, Lord Jesus. I want it to be like the good ground. I want to bring forth much fruit. Amen. " The script can be found at [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The seed rain of Populus euphratica in Ejina Oasis was {{continuously}} {{studied in}} the years of 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008. The duration of P. euphratica seed rain in a community was usually 2 to 3 weeks, with a peak period of 7 to 14 days. Approximately 90 % {{of the total number}} of seeds were dispersed in the peak period, and for a single day most <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> between the hours of 10 : 00 to 16 : 00. It was found that the seed rain of P. euphratica was determined by a combination of biological rhythms and weather conditions. Wind speed and atmospheric humidity were the two main meteorological factors influencing seed dispersal. More <b>seeds</b> <b>fell</b> when there was higher wind speed and lower RH. After we completed our comprehensive study of the P. euphratica seed rain, temporal heterogeneity was found not only in different populations but also in different individuals, and not only in different phases of the seed rain but also in different times of the day. P. euphratica extends its seed rain season by these different kinds of temporal heterogeneity to ensure some propagules survive and germinate when floods occur. Furthermore, marked inter-annual fluctuation in the seed rain exists in P. euphratica in the study area. Finally, in relation to the water supply for P. euphratica in Ejina in recent years, we concluded that there is no dislocation in time of water supply and the seed rain of P. euphratica in Ejina Oasis, and the reason for the failure of sexual reproduction of P. euphratica may lie in the human disturbances of channeling and the cement lining of the channels...|$|R

Postotni udjeli tehničke oblovine određeni ovim istraživanjem uspoređeni su s planskim vrijednostima (sortimentnim tablicama) koje se primjenjuju u šumarskoj operativi. Na temelju rezultata istraživanja izrađene su nove sortimentne tablice prema Hrvatskim normama proizvoda iskorištavanja šuma od 1995. godine. Istraživanja su provedena na uzorku koji obuhvaća 787 stabala u proredama, 1025 stabala u pripremnim, 606 stabala u naplodnim i 583 stabala u dovršnim sjekovima. Sveukupno je istraživanjima obuhvaćeno 3001 primjerno stablo. Starost istraživanih sječina iznosila je od 59 do 91 godinu kod prethodnog prihoda (proreda), od 94 do 110 godina kod pripremnog sijeka, od 100 do 112 godina kod naplodnog sijeka te od 98 do 112 godina kod dovršnog sijeka. Dosadašnji je pristup određivanju sortimentne strukture jednodobnih bukovih sastojina u velikoj mjeri pogrešan. Operativne sortimentne tablice daju previsoke procjene za najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente svih vrsta sjekova osim zadnjih sjekova oplodnih bukovih sječina. Tablice šumskih drvnih sortimenata koje uvažavaju vrstu sijeka kao jedan od ulaza, omogućuju pouzdaniju procjenu sortimentne strukture sječine i preciznije planiranje sječivog etata. Pri tome su kao čimbenici razdvajanja uzeti kriteriji selekcije prilikom doznake stabala za sječu koji se primjenjuju do uključivo pripremnog sijeka. Iz tih su razloga tablice šumskih drvnih sortimenata izrađene zasebno za prorede i pripremni sijek, a zasebno za naplodni i dovršni sijek. The {{subject of}} {{research}} was probability of appearance of technical roundwood timber assortments in trees according to type of felling, {{as well as}} the difference between shares of technical roundwood timber assortments according to diameter class and type of felling. The percentages of technical roundwood established in this research were compared to the planned values (assortment tables) which are applied in forestry operational bodies. Research was carried out on a sample consisting of 787 trees in thinning felling, 1025 trees in preparatory felling, 606 trees in <b>seeding</b> <b>felling</b> and 583 trees in final felling. An overall number of 3001 exemplary trees were included in the research. The age of the felling areas studied was between 59 and 91 years in the preliminary yield (thinning), 94 to 110 years in preparatory felling, 100 to 112 years in <b>seeding</b> <b>felling,</b> and 98 to 112 years in final felling areas. We think that the approach to establishing the assortment structure of even-aged beech stands taken so far is to a large extent wrong. The operative assortment tables give too high estimates of top quality timber assortments of all types of felling, except the final <b>felling</b> of <b>seeding</b> beech <b>felling</b> areas. Timber assortment tables that take into consideration the type of felling as one of the inputs, enable a more reliable estimate of assortment structure of the felling area and more precise planning of timber mass marked for felling. In this case, as a distinguishing factor, we took the selection criterion for marking trees for felling which is applied for the types up to, and including, the preparatory felling. For that reason, timber assortment tables were made separately for thinning and preparatory felling, and separately for <b>seeding</b> and final <b>felling.</b> On the basis of the research results, new assortment tables were made according to Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995. <b>Seeding</b> and final <b>felling</b> show by ca 8 – 14 % higher shares of top quality timber assortment (F and L) than thinning and preparatory felling.
