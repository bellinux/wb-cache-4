25|$|Following the 1983 referendum, {{in which}} 66.3% of white voters {{supported}} the change, the Constitution was reformed {{to allow the}} Coloured and Asian minorities limited participation in separate and subordinate Houses in a tricameral Parliament. This {{was part of a}} change in which the Coloured minority was to be allowed limited rights, but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands. These <b>separate</b> <b>arrangements</b> were removed by the negotiations which took place from 1990 to provide all South Africans with the vote.|$|E
25|$|Harley came {{to power}} advocating peace – a just peace for Britain and all its allies. However, {{the other members of}} the Grand Alliance, as well as the Whig {{directors}} of the Bank of England, had viewed with apprehension Anne's new government, and interpreted the fall of the Whigs as signifying a shift in war policy. To avoid a credit crisis at home and to dispel Allied fears abroad – thereby forestalling Vienna and The Hague rushing to make their own <b>separate</b> <b>arrangements</b> – the Harley government at first returned to the war strategy undertaken by the previous administration to secure from a position of strength an advantageous settlement. Marlborough remained at the head of the Anglo-Dutch army in Northern France, and by the end of the 1710 campaign the Duke and Eugene had added to their earlier success by capturing Béthune, Saint-Venant, and in early November, Aire-sur-la-Lys, thereby penetrating the second line of the pré carré. Yet these sieges had been costly and time consuming, and there had been no decisive breakthrough; moreover, between Marlborough and Paris still lay several fortresses and a new defensive line.|$|E

Participants were shown the videos and asked to describe to another person (who could not see the videos) what they saw. This experiment includes two temporal arrangements: sequential and separate. The videos were shown one by one and took up the entire screen (the two videos that make up the <b>separate</b> <b>arrangement</b> were played as one video).

"England," [...] he went on, [...] "has {{no desire}} {{whatever}} to take under her protection any {{who do not}} earnestly desire it, and who are not willing, in return, to promote trade, and keep peace with their neighbors; nor can she make <b>separate</b> <b>arrangements</b> with minor chiefs. It was only because she understood that Sehi ruled over a considerable extent of territory, and was all powerful in this part, that his request was listened to.|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} the proper {{circumscription}} of the constituencies which elect the local representative bodies, the principle which, when applied as an exclusive and unbending rule to Parliamentary representation, is inappropriate, namely community of local interests, is here the only just and applicable one. The very object of having a local representation is in order {{that those who have}} any interest in common which they do not share with the general body of their countrymen may manage that joint interest by themselves, and the purpose is contradicted if the distribution of the local representation follows any other rule than the grouping of those joint interests. There are local interests peculiar to every town, whether great or small, and common to all its inhabitants; every town, therefore, without distinction of size, ought to have its municipal council. It is equally obvious that every town ought to have but one. The different quarters of the same town have seldom or never any material diversities of local interest; they all require to have the same things done, the same expenses incurred; and, except as to their churches, which it is probably desirable to leave under simply parochial management, the same arrangements may be made to serve for all. Paving, lighting, water supply, drainage, port and market regulations, can not, without great waste and inconvenience, be different for different quarters of the same town. The subdivision of London into six or seven independent districts, each with its <b>separate</b> <b>arrangements</b> for local business (several of them without unity of administration even within themselves), prevents the possibility of consecutive or well-regulated co-operation for common objects, precludes any uniform principle for the discharge of local duties, compels the general government to take things upon itself which would be best left to local authorities if there were any whose authority extended to the entire metropolis, and answers no purpose but to keep up the fantastical trappings of that union of modern jobbing and antiquated foppery, the Corporation of the City of London.|$|E

5000|$|Having {{decided to}} abandon its (1957-1960) {{experiment}} of allowing live telecasts of {{the last quarter of}} three VFL matches each Saturday afternoon on ABV-2, HSV-7, and GTV-9, the VFL rejected offers from the three television stations to broadcast replays on Saturday evenings.

5000|$|Having {{abandoned}} live telecasts of {{the last}} quarters of VFL matches {{at the end of}} 1960, and having forbidden Saturday evening replays during the 1961 season, the VFL agreed to allow television stations to broadcast one hour of replays each Saturday evening, provided no more than 30 minutes of any one match was broadcast.

50|$|Australian-based Fairfax Media {{obtained}} {{access to}} the cables under a <b>separate</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Fairfax newspapers began releasing their own stories based on the leaked cables on 7 December 2010. Unlike other newspapers given access, Fairfax originally had not posted any of the original cables online, citing {{the need to maintain}} its competitive advantage over other Australian newspapers. However, on 16 December 2010, Fairfax reversed its position, and began publishing the cables used in its stories.|$|R
50|$|Satie {{arranged}} the suite for piano 4-hands {{and made a}} <b>separate</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the first piece for solo piano under the title Rêverie de l'enfance de Pantagruel; both were published by Éditions de la Sirène in 1920. On December 19 of that year the composer and pianist André Salomon premiered the duet version during an all-Satie concert at the Galerie la Boétie in Paris. The original orchestral score was published in 1921.|$|R

50|$|Tauchnitz was {{the name}} of a family of German {{printers}} and publishers. They published English language literature for distribution on the European continent outside Great Britain, including initial serial publications of novels by Charles Dickens. Though copyright protection did not exist between nations in the 19th century, Tauchnitz paid the authors for the works they published, and agreed to limit their sales of English-language books to the European continent, as authors like Dickens or Bulwer-Lytton had <b>separate</b> <b>arrangements</b> for publication and sale in Great Britain.|$|E

50|$|In September 2012, the United Kingdom's {{competition}} authority, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), {{issued a}} statement of objections against Booking.com, its direct competitor Expedia and the hotel chain IHG.

Booking.com, Expedia and IHG made a proposal to the OFT to change their restrictions. The OFT accepted the proposal but it was later rejected by a higher authority at a tribunal.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, the Constitution was {{reformed}} {{to allow}} the Coloured and Indian minorities a limited participation in separate and subordinate Houses of a Tricameral Parliament, a development which enjoyed limited support and very low voter turnouts. The Indian house was called the House of Delegates. Some aspects of Indian life were regulated by this house, including education. The theory was that the Indian minority could be allowed limited rights, but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands. These <b>separate</b> <b>arrangements</b> were removed by the negotiations which took place from 1990 on to provide all South Africans with the vote.|$|E
