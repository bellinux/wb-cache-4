A cross sectional population-based study design was utilized in Sarnia, ON, Canada. Stratified random sampling in census tracts of residents aged 18 and over recruited 804 respondents. Respondents completed a community health survey of chronic disease, general health, and socioeconomic indicators. Residential concentrations of NO 2, SO 2, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o/m/p-xylene were estimated by land use regression on data collected through environmental monitoring. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) {{analysis was used to}} identify variables that interacted with sex and cardinal symptoms of exposure, and a series of logistic regression models were built to predict the reporting of five or more cardinal symptoms (5 + CS). Without controlling for confounders, higher pollution ranks increased the odds ratio (OR) of reporting 5 + CS by 28 % (p < 0. 01; Confidence Interval (CI) : 1. 07 – 1. 54). Females were 1. 52 (p < 0. 05; CI: 1. 03 – 2. 26) times more likely more likely to report 5 + CS after controlling for income, age and chronic diseases. The CART analysis showed that allergies and occupational exposure classified the sample into the most homogenous groups of males and females. The likelihood of reporting 5 + CS among females was higher after stratifying the sample based on occupational exposure. However, stratifying by allergic disease resulted in no significant sex difference in symptom reporting. The results confirmed previous research that found pre-existing health conditions to increase susceptibility to ambient air pollution, but additionally indicated that stronger effects on females is partly due to autoimmune disorders. Furthermore, gender differences in occupational exposure confound the effect <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> in studies based on residential levels of air pollution...|$|E

40|$|The {{current crisis}} {{stems from a}} long period of {{macroeconomic}} imbalances, characterised by excess liquidity and major current account imbalances in certain areas of the world. This environment encouraged the issuance of low-yielding debt instruments, but also spurred investors to seek higher yields through more risky products. In this context, the transfer of credit risk by fi nancial institutions to protect their balance sheets resulted, due to the fragmentation and opacity of the markets, in a situation where the location of risks and the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> were unclear. This crisis calls for a thorough review of fi nancial regulation and in particular of the relations between markets, players and products. In the light of this situation, the primary objective of all regulators is to restore confi dence in the fi nancial system. The fi rst step in achieving this is to re-establish the soundness of its players.

Methods: We conducted a 24 -month, four-wave longitudinal telephone study of a national sample of 6, 486 youth aged 10 to 14 years. Exposure measures: latent construct for screen exposure time (weekday time spent viewing television/playing videogames, presence of television in bedroom) and variables for movie content (proportion of PG- 13 and R movies viewed). Outcome measure: self- and parent reports of grades in school. Effects <b>of</b> media <b>exposures</b> on change in school performance between baseline and 24 months were assessed using structural equation modeling. Information about hypothesized mediators (substance use, sensation seeking, and school problem behavior) was obtained at baseline and at the 16 -month follow-up. Results: Adjusted for baseline school performance, baseline levels of mediators, and a range of covariates, both screen exposure time and media content had adverse effects on change in school performance. Screen exposure had an indirect effect on poor school performance through increased sensation seeking. Viewing more PG- 13 and R-rated movies had indirect effects on poor school performance mediated through increases in substance use and sensation seeking. R-rated viewing also had an indirect effect on poor school performance through increased school behavior problems.

The <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exposure</b> depends on the type of medical procedure, the technical condition of the X-ray unit and selected exposure conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the dose received by patients during dental X-ray examination and the assessment of the technical condition of medical equipment. Materials and Methods: The study included a total number of 79 dental X-ray units located in the region of Mazovia. The test methods for the assessment of the technical condition of dental X-ray units and measurement of radiation dose received by patients were based on the procedures elaborated in the Department of Radiation Hygiene and Radiobiology in the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene (Warszawa, Poland) accredited for the certification of compliance with PN-EN 17025. Results: The research found that 69. 6 % fully meets the criteria set out in the Polish legislation regarding the safe use of ionizing radiation in medicine, while 30. 4 % did not meet some of them. A tenfold difference in the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the dose received by patients during dental X-ray examinations was discovered. For example, during a radiography of the canine teeth of a child, the recorded entrance surface dose (ESD) ranged from 72. 8 to 2430 μGy with the average value of 689. 1 μGy.

40|$|Basel III {{responded to}} the {{financial}} crisis by redefining and expanding the capital requirements for risk-weighted assets and by proposing {{the introduction of a}} leverage ratio setting a minimum level of capital for banks in relation to total exposures.

As a result, there have been proposals that the leverage ratio requirement should also take into account the level of capital buffers and thus become a macroprudential policy tool. One argument in support of such proposals is that if the level of capital buffers is not taken into account, the leverage ratio may not create a sufficient constraint on the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> banks' <b>exposures</b> and hence not fulfil its intended purpose. This article examines the relationship between the capital and leverage ratios and discusses the options for, and effects of, introducing a macroprudential leverage ratio.

The measure {{of the quality of}} a selected path is its exposure, which is the total weight of vertices in its closed neighborhood. In order to minimize the risk of intercepting the information, we are interested in selecting a secluded path, i. e. a path with a small exposure. Similarly, the Secluded Steiner Tree problem is to find a tree in a graph connecting a given set of terminals such that the <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> the tree is minimized. In this work, we obtain the following results about parameterized complexity of secluded connectivity problems. We start from an observation that being parameterized by the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exposure,</b> the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). More precisely, we give an algorithm deciding if a graph G with a given cost function w:V(G) ->N contains a secluded path <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> at most k with the cost at most C in time O(3 ^{k/ 3 }(n+m) log W), where W is the maximum value of w on an input graph G.

The ad-vantage of local reconstruction is {{the reduction in}} the required measurement time. Difficulties with limited projection angles and image noise make the development of accurate reconstruc-tion algorithms particularly challenging. In this paper, both wavelet-based and traditional filtered back projection (FBP) tech-niques are investigated. Segmentation algorithms are applied to reconstructed images with low contrast and the resultant segments are compared with a known ground truth to explore the ability of a QCL to image target objects with complex contours. In our experiments, a polystyrene object with a hole drilled inside is used as the imaging target. The region of interest is adjusted through changing the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exposure</b> regions. It is found that 3 -D local reconstruction of the interior hole suffers from shape distortion, since scattering caused by the target’s exterior contours intro-duces errors in the measured optical parameters of the object. It is found that wavelet-based local computed tomography for terahertz image reconstruction results in lower misclassification of pixels than traditional FBP algorithms.

40|$|Abstract Background Reliable {{exposure}} data {{is a vital}} concern in medical epidemiology and intervention studies. The present study addresses {{the needs of the}} medical researcher to spend monetary resources devoted to exposure assessment with an optimal cost-efficiency, i. e. obtain the best possible statistical performance at a specified budget. A few previous studies have suggested mathematical optimization procedures based on very simple cost models; this study extends the methodology to cover even non-linear cost scenarios. Methods Statistical performance, i. e. efficiency, was assessed in terms of the precision <b>of</b> an <b>exposure</b> mean value, as determined in a hierarchical, nested measurement model with three stages. Total costs were assessed using a corresponding three-stage cost model, allowing costs at each stage to vary non-linearly with the number of measurements according to a power function. Using these models, procedures for identifying the optimally cost-efficient allocation of measurements under a constrained budget were developed, and applied on 225 scenarios combining different <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> unit costs, cost function exponents, and exposure variance components. Results Explicit mathematical rules for identifying optimal allocation could be developed when cost functions were linear, while non-linear cost functions implied that parts of or the entire optimization procedure had to be carried out using numerical methods. For many of the 225 scenarios, the optimal strategy consisted in measuring on only one occasion from each of as many subjects as allowed by the budget. Significant deviations from this principle occurred if costs for recruiting subjects were large compared to costs for setting up measurement occasions, and, at the same time, the between-subjects to within-subject variance ratio was small. In these cases, non-linearities had a profound influence on the optimal allocation and on the eventual <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exposure</b> data set. Conclusions The analysis procedures developed in the present study can be used for informed design <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> assessment strategies, provided that data are available on exposure variability and the costs of collecting and processing data. The present shortage of empirical evidence on costs and appropriate cost functions however impedes general conclusions on optimal exposure measurement strategies in different epidemiologic scenarios. </p...|$|R

These category-specific potencies are estimated in a meta-analysis that fits the expanded models to po-tencies for lung cancer (KL’s) or mesothelioma (KM’s) based on PCM that were calculated for multiple epidemiological studies in our previous paper (Berman and Crump, 2008). Epidemio-logical study-specific estimates <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> to fibers in the different fiber <b>size</b> categories <b>of</b> an <b>exposure</b> metric are estimated using distributions for fiber size based on transmission electro...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation (UVR) is an environmental stressor {{that can have}} a variety of negative effects on aquatic organisms. The ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is a highly transparent organism that has not been shown to actively avoid UVR or possess photoprotective compounds and may therefore be vulnerable to deleterious effects of UVR. Results {{of this study indicate that}} summertime UVR exposure equivalent to average UVR conditions within the top 0. 5 m of the water column of the Rhode River, Maryland, USA, can cause mortality and reduced <b>size</b> <b>of</b> M. leidyi. <b>Exposures</b> tested did not, however, affect egg production. Experiments indicated a sharp threshold for the tolerance of M. leidyi to biologically effective UVR exposure. Mnemiopsis leidyi is an important component in many ecosystems; thus, changes in its abundance have the potential to significantly affect coastal and estuarine food webs and oyster, fish and sea nettle populations in systems like Chesapeake Bay...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} if {{the type}} of exchange rate used or <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the movement in the exchange rate matters in estimating exchange-rate <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> U. S. nonfinancial multinationals. We find that switching from a broad trade-weighted exchange rate to a 2 -digit SIC industry exchange rate increases the number of significantly exposed firms in a simple Jorion (1990) regression by 60 percent. Then separating crisis from non-crisis months we find additional evidence <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> Although the value <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> does not change with the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the exchange rate movement, we find some firms have significant exposure only in crisis periods while others have significant exposure only during normal fluctuations in exchange rates. All told, we find about 1 in 4 firms' returns is significantly affected by movement in the exchange rate between 1995 and 1999. Foreign exchange rates...|$|R

Under flat bed condition, the thickness of exchange layer is almost same as the maximumgrain <b>size</b> <b>of</b> bed material regardless <b>of</b> the grain <b>size</b> <b>of</b> tracer particles.
