5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the <b>seabed.</b> The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic <b>seabed</b> community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E

5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International <b>Seabed</b> Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international <b>seabed</b> area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E
5|$|Farming and {{forestry}} {{are other}} important industries. 2008 {{plans for a}} large salmon farm holding 800,000 or more fish in Lamlash Bay have been criticised by the Community of Arran <b>Seabed</b> Trust. They feared the facility could jeopardise Scotland's first marine No Take Zone, which was announced in September 2008.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 2010, the Royal Air Force Museum London {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} a Henschel-built Dornier Do 17Z buried in the Goodwin Sands off the coast of Kent, England. On 10 June 2013, the salvage team raised the airframe from the <b>seabed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other threats include habitat alteration, {{damage and}} loss from coastal development, {{pollution}} {{and the impact}} of fisheries on the <b>seabed</b> and prey species. The 2007 documentary, Sharkwater exposed how sharks are being hunted to extinction.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species are}} benthic (living on the <b>seabed)</b> and others pelagic (living in mid-water), {{but most are}} found close to, {{crawling}} on or burrowing into the mud or sand. Most marine species are benthic by day but leave the <b>seabed</b> at night to become planktonic. Locomotion is mostly by swimming, the pleopods being used for this purpose. Some mysids live among algae and seagrasses, some are solitary while many form dense swarms. Mysids form {{an important part of}} the diet of such fish as shad and flounder. In general, they are free-living, but a few species, mostly in the subfamily Heteromysinae, are commensal and are associated with sea anemones and hermit crabs. Several taxa have also been described from different freshwater habitats and caves. Mysis relicta and its close relatives inhabit cold, deep lakes and have a diurnal cycle of vertical migrations.|$|E

5|$|The Hebridean {{archipelago}} outlier of St Kilda {{is composed}} of Paleogene igneous formations of granites and gabbro, heavily weathered by the elements. These islands represent {{the remnants of a}} long extinct ring volcano rising from a <b>seabed</b> plateau approximately 40m (130ft) below sea level.|$|E
5|$|The {{demersal}} zone supports {{many animals}} that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators. The <b>seabed</b> provides {{a range of}} habitats on or {{under the surface of}} the substrate which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. The tidal zone with its periodic exposure to dehydrating air is home to barnacles, molluscs, and crustaceans. The neritic zone has many organisms that need light to flourish. Here, sponges, echinoderms, polychaete worms, sea anemones, and other invertebrates live among algal-encrusted rocks. Corals often contain photosynthetic symbionts and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. The extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the <b>seabed.</b> These provide a diverse habitat for reef dwelling organisms. There is less sea life on the floor of deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. Close to the <b>seabed</b> live demersal fish that largely feed on pelagic organisms or benthic invertebrates. Exploration of the deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on the <b>seabed</b> that scientists had not previously expected. Some like the detritivores rely on organic material falling to the ocean floor. Others cluster round deep-sea hydrothermal vents where mineral-rich flows of water emerge, supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria and whose consumers include specialized bivalves, sea anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms, and fish. A dead whale sinking {{to the bottom of the}} ocean provides food for an assembly of organisms which similarly rely largely on the actions of sulphur-reducing bacteria. Such places support unique biomes where many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the <b>seabed.</b> This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard <b>seabed.</b> An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E

50|$|The Laptev <b>Sea</b> is a {{major source}} of arctic <b>sea</b> ice. With an average outflow of 483,000 km2 per year over the period 1979-1995, it {{contributes}} more <b>sea</b> ice than the Barents <b>Sea,</b> Kara <b>Sea,</b> East Siberian <b>Sea</b> and Chukchi <b>Sea</b> combined. Over this period, the annual outflow fluctuated between 251,000 km2 in 1984-85 and 732,000 km2 in 1988-89. The <b>sea</b> exports substantial amounts of <b>sea</b> ice in all months but July, August and September.|$|R
5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy <b>seabed</b> communities.|$|E
5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast {{areas where}} the <b>seabed</b> was being {{elevated}} were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge {{areas where the}} ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate tectonics, {{which he did not}} anticipate.|$|E
5|$|In the spring, {{the adult}} females {{of this species}} lay eggs in {{tower-shaped}} structures. The eggs hatch as veliger larvae, which can float in the plankton for up to 14 weeks before settling onto the <b>seabed</b> as tiny snails. Crabs are a predator of this sea snail. After {{the death of the}} snails, if the shells are still intact they are often used by hermit crabs.|$|E

5|$|Other sharks feed on squid or fish, {{which they}} swallow whole. The viper dogfish has teeth it can point {{outwards}} to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact.
