5000|$|It {{was at the}} {{relatively}} late age of 32 that Salinas published his first collection in 1923 - both Guillén, {{at the age of}} 35, and he were the oldest of the generation to get collections published. It seems that Juan Ramón Jiménez did the main editorial work - Salinas showed him a collection of 50 poems and it was Jiménez who organised them, placing three sonnets to form a central axis [...] as well as adding an introductory essay. [...] The title can be translated as presages, omens, prophesies and it suggests why this book is interesting. Most of the characteristics of the poet’s mature style are captured here: basically simple and colloquial language used to depict everyday things in surprising ways in order to bring out the appearance/reality duality. [...] He tended not to use traditional Spanish verse-forms in his poetry but neither did he write free verse. There is usually some kind of assonance scheme or metrical pattern underpinning the whole. His poems also tend to be short - less than 20 lines long - and playful in tone. One of the longer poems in this collection of untitled poems is 31, which deals with the apparently independent life of the poet’s shadow. [...] Eventually, the fact that he cannot control it makes him commit “fratricide” by retreating indoors, to a <b>shadow-free</b> <b>zone.</b> In such poems, the influence of the Golden Age stylistic tendency conceptismo is apparent and this becomes more marked in future collections.|$|E
