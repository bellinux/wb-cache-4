40|$|IntroductionThe use {{of social}} {{marketing}} approaches {{in public health}} practice is increasing. Using marketing concepts such as the "four Ps" (product, price, place, and promotion), social marketing borrows from the principles of commercial marketing but promotes beneficial health behaviors. Consumer research is used to segment the population and develop a strategy based on those marketing concepts. In a community-based participatory research study, 17 focus groups were used in consumer research to develop a <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>program</b> to promote walking and other moderate-intensity physical activities. MethodsTwo phases of focus groups were conducted. Phase 1 groups, which included both men and women, {{were asked to respond}} to questions that would guide the development of a <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>program</b> based on social marketing concepts. Phase 1 also determined the intervention's target audience, which was irregularly active women aged 35 to 54. Phase 2 groups, composed of members of the target audience, were asked to further define the product and discuss specific promotion strategies. ResultsPhase 1 participants determined that the program product, or target behavior, should be walking. In addition, they identified price, place, and promotion strategies. Phase 2 participants determined that moderate-intensity physical activity is best promoted using the term exercise and offered suggestions for marketing walking, or exercise, to the target audience. ConclusionThere have been few published studies of social marketing campaigns to promote physical activity. In this study, focus groups were key to understanding the target audience in a way that would not have been accomplished with quantitative data alone. The group discussions generated important insights into values and motivations that affect consumers' decisions to adopt a product or behavior. The focus group results guided the development of a <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>program</b> to promote physical activity in the target audience in Sumter County, South Carolina.

Drawing {{on the social}} marketing principles of segmentation and audience research, the current study seeks to identify segments to examine responses to a school-based alcohol <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>program.</b> METHODS: A sample of 371 year 10 students (aged: 14 - 16 years; 51. 4 % boys) participated in a prospective (pre-post) multisite alcohol <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>program.</b> Game On: Know Alcohol (GO:KA) program included 6, student-centered, and interactive lessons to teach adolescents about alcohol and strategies to abstain or moderate drinking. A repeated measures design was used. Baseline demographics, drinking attitudes, drinking intentions, and alcohol knowledge were cluster analyzed to identify segments. Change on key program outcome measures and satisfaction with program components were assessed by segment. RESULTS: Three segments were identified; (1) Skeptics, (2) Risky Males, (3) Good Females. Segments 2 and 3 showed greatest change in drinking attitudes and intentions. Good Females reported highest satisfaction with all program components and Skeptics lowest program satisfaction with all program components. CONCLUSION: Three segments, each differing on psychographic and demographic variables, exhibited different change patterns following participation in GO:KA.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programming</b> {{knowledge}} {{about the extent to}} which behavior change interventions can bolster <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> sales, this report presents case studies of two <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> programs: the Society for Family Health's condom program in Nigeria and the Commercial Market Strategies project's oral contraceptive program in India. Both programs recently adopted behavior change strategies to counter stagnating reproductive health product sales, and both collected multiple rounds of household survey data to closely monitor program outcomes. The analysis reveals that both <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> sales and method prevalence increased significantly following the behavior change campaigns in the two countries. However, a substantial time lag of up to two years transpired before measurable change occurred in some indicators of knowledge and attitudes related to method use. These findings suggest that behavior change communications can help revive <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> sales in mature <b>social</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>programs.</b> Given time, this approach appears to be effective at improving knowledge and attitudes related to reproductive health methods, which, in turn, may contribute to further increases in method prevalence in the long run...|$|R
