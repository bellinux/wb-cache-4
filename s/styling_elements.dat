25|$|The Range Rover Classic was {{a popular}} {{platform}} for conversion vehicles built by independent coachbuilders. Some examples of common modifications include ambulances, 6x4s, convertibles, police vehicles, limos, and open top hunting cars. Though some coachbuilders utilized Range Rovers simply for the chassis and drivetrain while grafting new fabricated bodies on top, most of them retained the familiar Range Rover <b>styling</b> <b>elements,</b> while upgrading the engine, transmission, suspension, or interior design. The coachbuilders include Carbodies, Carmichael, FLM Panelcraft, Glenfrome, Rapport and Wood and Pickett.|$|E
500|$|The {{sensation}} {{caused by}} the new Zephyr trainsets sparked intense competition centered on speed and styling in the region served by the CB [...] In May 1935 the Milwaukee Road introduced the Class A steam-powered high speed streamliner locomotive on its Chicago-Twin Cities Hiawatha run, in direct competition with the CB Twin Cities Zephyr. [...] The styling of the Class A was directly evocative of the Zephyr, with a [...] "shovel-nose" [...] front end featuring a high-mounted headlamp ensconced in grillework. Another early adopter of streamline styling was the New York Central railway with its Commodore Vanderbilt steam locomotive, showing <b>styling</b> <b>elements</b> borrowed from the Zephyr, unveiled in [...] December 1934. [...] A Zephyr-type trainset, the Flying Yankee, started service between Boston and Portland, Maine in April 1935, signaling new competition for steam-powered passenger service on the east coast. The Gulf, Mobile, and Northern Rebel featured styling {{similar to that of}} the Zephyr, entering service on July 10, 1935 between New Orleans and Jackson, Tennessee. [...] The race was on nationally to develop faster and more stylish locomotives for passenger service, boosting the streamliner trend.|$|E
2500|$|The single-decker ECW {{body was}} just [...] wide and used some similar <b>styling</b> <b>elements</b> to those {{built for the}} heavier Bristol MW. The bus bodies were [...] high but the coaches were a little taller at the length varied {{depending}} on the chassis and whether it was to bus or coach style (see table below). A forward entrance was provided opposite the driver's position. Seats were forward-facing in pairs, but where wheel arches protruded above {{the floor of the}} bus body, the seats were turned sideways to give sufficient leg room.|$|E

2500|$|Other long-familiar <b>styling</b> <b>elements</b> {{were the}} split grille design (from 1959 onward), pointed 'arrowhead' nose (in the 1960s and 70s), and [...] "grilled-over" [...] (in the 1960s), or multiple-striped taillights. This later feature {{originated}} with the 1963 Grand Prix, {{and although the}} '62 Grand Prix also had rear grillework, the taillight lenses were not behind it. Less longstanding but equally memorable is the 'cladding' common on the doors and fenders of Pontiacs produced in the 1980s and 90s. Rather than minimizing the side bumper, Pontiac designers put two troughs going along the length. Bumpers with this appearance were found on nearly all Pontiacs until {{the arrival of the}} G6. From 2004 onwards, new Pontiacs had cleaner, more premium styling, but retained the traditional split grille.|$|E
2500|$|Personal {{luxury cars}} are mass-produced, not coach built, and {{typically}} share {{all of their}} chassis, power train and all other major mechanical components with high volume sedans to reduce production costs, {{and to ensure that}} their per unit profitability is extremely high; to both the manufacturer and the selling dealer. [...] Typically, the per unit profit of the sale of a new personal luxury vehicle is measured in thousands of dollars to both the manufacturer and the dealer, while the sale of a new compact or intermediate sedan yields only a few hundred dollars in profit per unit. [...] However, they have additional <b>styling</b> <b>elements</b> and sometimes [...] "baroque" [...] designs. They are typically equipped with as many additional features as possible, including power accessories such as windows, locks, seats, antenna, as well as special trim packages, leather upholstery, and heated seats.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in 1989, the first-generation ES 250 {{was one of}} two {{vehicles}} in Lexus' debut lineup, the other being the flagship LS 400. The second-generation ES 300 debuted in 1991, followed by the third-generation ES 300 in 1996, and the fourth-generation ES 300/330 in 2001. The first- through fourth-generation sedans shared body <b>styling</b> <b>elements</b> with Japan-market Toyota sedans, and a domestic market equivalent, the Toyota Windom, was sold until the launch of the fifth-generation ES in 2006. The word [...] "Windom" [...] is a combination of [...] "win" [...] and the suffix [...] "dom" [...] expresses a state of perpetual victory. The fifth-generation ES, featuring Lexus' own L-finesse body styling, debuted in early 2006 as a 2007 model. The sixth-generation ES debuted {{in the first half of}} 2012 as a 2013 model, and features increased cabin dimensions due to a longer wheelbase which is shared with the full-size Toyota Avalon.|$|E

The SHO model features revised <b>styling</b> <b>elements,</b> with unchanged power ratings from its EcoBoost V6. [...] Refinements {{have been made to}} the 3.5 EcoBoost V6. Power in the 3.5L V6, standard in non-SHO models, is up to 288hp and gets 19/29 MPG in FWD models, while getting 18/26MPG in AWD models. There is a new engine option for non-SHO models, a 2.0L EcoBoost Inline 4 developing 240hp and 270lb-ft of torque while delivering a best-in-class 22/32 miles per gallon. All models received upgrades to the steering and braking systems to improve driveability. For example, Torque Vectoring and curve control has been added as standard, and controls the cars ability to glide around corners at higher speeds. Updates to the Instrument dials have been added, they are now fully digital and clearer and more colourful. MyFord Touch will also be part of Taurus's Sync system.|$|E
