During the voyage, Adelaide visited New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, the western coasts of Canada and the United States, the Panama Canal (becoming the first RAN ship to travel through), the Caribbean, and eastern Canada, before reaching Portsmouth on 28 September.

50|$|During {{his time}} in office Schmidt {{advanced}} {{the establishment of a}} foundation to care for service members negatively impacted by the side effects of radar signals encountered during their service. His time in office has seen several landmark events including the investigation into the wartime activities of World War II German flying ace Werner Mölders (2007), the reorientation of the Federal Republic’s armed forces (since 2010) and the resignation of Defence Minister zu Guttenberg {{in the wake of a}} plagiarism scandal (2011). Schmidt had defended zu Guttenberg against the accusations of plagiary. Schmidt also played an instrumental role in the establishment and financing of the “Hardship Fund” (Härtefall-Stiftung). This fund, maintained by the Soldiers’ Relief Association e.V., was founded in 2012 with the express remit of supporting soldiers seriously injured in the line of duty. The fund provides support above and beyond the <b>standard</b> <b>duty</b> of care laws in the Federal Republic, thereby serving as additional assistance for those veterans most in need.|$|E
50|$|The {{thicknesses}} of {{the water}} pipe and tube walls can vary. Pipe wall thickness is denoted by various schedules or for large bore polyethylene pipe in the UK by the Standard Dimension Ratio (SDR), defined as {{the ratio of the}} pipe diameter to its wall thickness. Pipe wall thickness increases with schedule, and is available in schedules 20, 40, 80, and higher in special cases. The schedule is largely determined by the operating pressure of the system, with higher pressures commanding greater thickness. Copper tubing is available in four wall thicknesses: type DWV (thinnest wall; only allowed as drain pipe per UPC), type 'M' (thin; typically only allowed as drain pipe by IPC code), type 'L' (thicker, <b>standard</b> <b>duty</b> for water lines and water service), and type 'K' (thickest, typically used underground between the main and the meter). Because piping and tubing are commodities, having a greater wall thickness implies higher initial cost. Thicker walled pipe generally implies greater durability and higher pressure tolerances.|$|E
50|$|The paintball-based M16 {{simulator}} is designated to the CAR 68. The CAR 68 {{has been}} used by military and law enforcement entities including the Israeli military, US Marine Corps, US Army, Secret Service, Latvian Special Forces, and Navy Seal teams. The CAR68 training weapon simulates the look, feel and performance characteristics of the <b>standard</b> <b>duty</b> weapon. The primary limitation of the CAR 68 is its effective range, which is restricted to a maximum of approximately 200 feet. The simulator is therefore mainly utilized in training scenarios in which range is not the factor such as Close Quarters Battle drills, urban combat (in which most fighting is done within structures), police encounter training (road stops, suspect take-down), and similar close-range situations. The CAR 68 was also adapted for use as a recoil simulator for marksmanship training with laser based target system such as Beamhit and others. The company has also developed weapons simulators for the Heckler & Koch MP5, M203 grenade launcher and LAWS anti-tank weapon, though none of these devices is in wide distribution.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{established}} several {{operational training}} units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' <b>standard</b> <b>duties,</b> {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No.2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958.|$|R
