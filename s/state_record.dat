5|$|SMU's resounding {{victory was}} {{considered}} an upset, and during the game, the Mustangs set a single-season record for most interceptions returned for a touchdown (8), surpassing the 2011 Southern Miss Golden Eagles football team. Margus Hunt was named the game's Most Valuable Player because of his two-forced fumble, three-sack (including one safety) performance. In total, the Mustangs achieved seven sacks, the most Fresno State had surrendered in a single game all year.

5|$|The {{number of}} Class C retail {{licenses}} for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores {{is limited by}} population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by public auction. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating {{several hundred thousand dollars}} of revenue from the highest bidder. A 2006 license auction in Cherry Hill, New Jersey set the <b>state</b> <b>record</b> at $1.5 million.|$|E

5|$|Although Gay {{tended to}} be a slow starter on the track, he worked hard to improve and broke the Lafayette High School stadium record for the 200 meters. Under the tutelage of Ken Northington, a former 100-yard dash state champion, Gay began working on his {{technique}} and rhythm. By his senior year he was a more composed athlete and he focused on the 100 meters, winning the state championship in the event and setting a new championship record of 10.60s. In spite of this, his mother noted {{that he was not}} fully applying himself and was taking his abilities for granted. Gay was also not a studious child and he failed to achieve the grades needed to enter a Division I sports college. However, the Kentucky High School State Championships in June 2001 demonstrated his abilities: he won gold in the 100m, setting a new personal best and <b>state</b> <b>record</b> with 10.46s, a record which stands to this day. In the 200m he took silver with another new personal best of 21.23s. At a 2001 track event, Gay met trainer Lance Brauman and the college coach convinced him to attend Barton County Community College. It was here that Gay first met Jamaican sprinter Veronica Campbell-Brown, and the two formed a close bond, becoming training partners.|$|E

After a fourth-place finish at the 2005 US Championships, Dix continued with his collegiate success, setting an NCAA record of 19.69 seconds in the 200m and coming within one hundredth of the 100m record. He completed a 100m, 200m, and 4×100 meter relay sweep at the 2007 NCAA Outdoor Championships, the first to do so since John Carlos in 1969. He closed his amateur career in 2008: another NCAA 200m title made him the third most decorated track athlete in NCAA history, and he won gold and silver at the 2008 US Olympic Trials.|$|E
5|$|September 16, 1999- Tropical Storm Floyd crosses {{over the}} southeastern {{portion of the}} state. The storm {{produces}} strong wind gusts of up to 64mph (103km/h) in Sussex County and heavy rainfall peaking at 10.58inches (269mm) in Greenwood, a 24-hour <b>state</b> <b>record.</b> The flooding, which exceeds the 100-year flood return period, kills two and causes record-breaking river levels across the state. Hundreds of roads, railroad lines, and bridges are closed or destroyed, trapping dozens due to flooded vehicles. The winds uproot hundreds of trees, leaving 25,000 homes and businesses without power for 3days. Floyd damages 171 homes, 44 severely, and destroys 33 in New Castle County. Damage is minimal near the ocean, and amounts to minor beach erosion and tidal flooding. Throughout the state, damage totals to $8.42million (1999USD, $10.9million 2008USD). In response to the damage, President Bill Clinton declares {{the state as a}} disaster area, which allows for federal funding to rebuild and cleanup after the storm.|$|E
