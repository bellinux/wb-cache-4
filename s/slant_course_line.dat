5000|$|At that point, Flight 610 was {{scheduled}} to make a right turn to intercept the 168 degree <b>course</b> <b>line</b> of the DEN low frequency range, and then to proceed to the WONT intersection, which was its next clearance limit. To intercept that <b>course</b> <b>line,</b> the plane turned to a heading of approximately 210 degrees, which was a proper intercept angle of almost 45 degrees. If the pilot had configured his audio selector switches properly, {{he would have been}} able to hear the aural Morse code identifier of [...] "A", for the north side of that low frequency range, and then as he neared the <b>course</b> <b>line</b> itself, he would begin to hear the [...] "N" [...] identifier. That would be the signal that it was time to turn left again, and track the 168 degree <b>course</b> <b>line</b> to the WONT intersection. But, the plane never turned left again.

He was thunderstruck at first. Now he could not go back unless he called up the Rajah's people to get a boat and rowers--and the way to Patalolo's campong led past Aissa's house! ...|$|R
500|$|Although the LFR {{system was}} used for decades as the main {{aeronautical}} navigation method during low visibility and night flying, it had some well known limitations and drawbacks. The <b>course</b> <b>lines,</b> which were {{a result of a}} balance between the radiation patterns from different transmitters, would fluctuate depending on weather conditions, vegetation or snow cover near the station, and even the airborne receiver's antenna angle. Under some conditions, the signals from the A quadrant would [...] "skip" [...] into the N quadrant (or vice versa), causing a false [...] "virtual course" [...] away from any real <b>course</b> <b>line.</b> Also, thunderstorms and other atmospheric disturbances would create electromagnetic interference to disrupt the range signals and produce crackling [...] "static" [...] in the pilots' headsets.|$|R

500|$|Each Adcock range station {{had four}} [...] antenna towers erected on {{the corners of}} a 425× 425ft square, with an {{optional}} extra tower in the center for voice transmission and homing. The stations emitted directional electromagnetic radiation at 190 to 535 kHz and 1,500watts, into four quadrants. The radiation of one opposing quadrant pair was modulated (at an audio frequency of 1,020Hz) with a Morse code for the letter A (·—), and the other pair with the letter N (—·). The intersections between the quadrants defined four <b>course</b> <b>lines</b> emanating from the transmitting station, along four compass directions, where the A and N signals were of equal intensity, with their combined Morse codes merging into a steady 1,020Hz audio tone.
