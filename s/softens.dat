40|$|Flow <b>softening</b> {{behavior}} during hot compression deformation process of near β titanium alloys was reviewed, including the influencing factors, the flow <b>softening</b> mechanism and its analysis methods, {{the development of}} the constitutive model based on <b>softening</b> mechanism. The influence of deformation parameters and initial microstructure on flow <b>softening</b> behavior was primarily analyzed. Besides, the contribution of <b>softening</b> mechanisms such as dynamic recovery, dynamic recrystallization and deformation heating to flow <b>softening</b> was discussed. The problems urgently to be solved during hot deformation process regarding to flow <b>softening</b> were proposed, and it is pointed that quantify and physical modeling will be the important directions of near β titanium alloys during hot deformation process with respect to <b>softening</b> phenomenon in the future...|$|R
40|$|In N-body {{simulations}} {{the force}} calculated between particles representing a given mass distribution is usually <b>softened,</b> {{to diminish the}} effect of graininess. In this paper we study the effect of such a smoothing, {{with the aim of}} finding an optimal value of the <b>softening</b> parameter. As already shown by Merritt (1996), for too small a <b>softening</b> the estimates of the forces will be too noisy, while for too large a <b>softening</b> the force estimates are systematically misrepresented. In between there is an optimal <b>softening,</b> for which the forces in the configuration approach best the true forces. The value of this optimal <b>softening</b> depends both on the mass distribution and on the number of particles used to represent it. For higher number of particles the optimal <b>softening</b> is smaller. More concentrated mass distributions necessitate smaller <b>softening,</b> but the <b>softened</b> forces are never as good an approximation of the true forces as for not centrally concentrated configurations. We give good estimates of the optimal <b>softening</b> for homogeneous spheres, Plummer spheres, and Dehnen spheres. We also give a rough estimate of this quantity for other mass distributions, based on the harmonic mean distance to the $k$th neighbour ($k$ = 1, [...] , 12), the mean being taken over all particles in the configuration. Comparing homogeneous Ferrers ellipsoids of different shapes we show that the axial ratios do not influence the value of the optimal <b>softening.</b> Finally we compare two different types of <b>softening,</b> a spline <b>softening</b> (Hernquist & Katz 1989) and a generalisation of the standard Plummer <b>softening</b> to higher values of the exponent. We find that the spline <b>softening</b> fares roughly as well as the higher powers of the power-law <b>softening</b> and both give a better representation of the forces than the standard Plummer <b>softening.</b> Comment: 16 pages Latex, 19 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS, corrected typos, minor changes mainly in sec. ...|$|R
40|$|Pairwise forces between {{particles}} in cosmological N-body simulations are generally <b>softened</b> to avoid hard collisions. Physically, this <b>softening</b> corresponds to treating the particles as diffuse clouds rather than point masses. For particles of unequal mass (and hence unequal <b>softening</b> length), computing the <b>softened</b> force involves a nontrivial double integral over the {{volumes of the}} two particles. We show that Plummer force <b>softening</b> is consistent with this interpretation of force <b>softening</b> while spline <b>softening</b> is not. We provide closed-form expressions and numerical implementation for pairwise gravitational potential and force laws for pairs of particles of general <b>softening</b> scales ε 1 and ε 2 assuming the commonly used cloud profiles: NGP, CIC, TSC, and PQS and relate them to gaussian, Plummer and spline force <b>softening.</b> Our expressions allow possible inclusions of pointlike objects such as stars or supermassive black holes.

5|$|Selenium forms several allotropes that interconvert with {{temperature}} changes, depending somewhat on {{the rate}} of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads. The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS2. Upon heating, it <b>softens</b> at 50°C and converts to gray selenium at 180°C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.|$|E
5|$|The host {{association}} between Myrmecia and eucharitid wasps began several million years ago; M. forficata larvae are the host to Austeucharis myrmeciae, {{being the first}} recorded eucharitid parasitoid of an ant, and Austeucharis fasciiventris is a parasitoid to M. gulosa pupae. M. pilosula is affected by a gregarines parasite that changes an ants colour from their typical black appearance to brown. This was discovered when brown workers were dissected and found to have gregarinasina spores, while black workers showed no spores. Another unidentified gregarine parasite is known to infect the larvae of M. pilosula and other Myrmecia species. This gregarine parasite also <b>softens</b> the ant's cuticle. Other parasites include Beauveria bassiana, Paecilomyces lilacinus, Chalcura affinis, Tricoryna wasps, and various mermithid nematodes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{dynamic and}} static <b>softening</b> {{behaviors}} during multistage hot deformation of aluminum alloys {{have been studied}} by double-hit compression testing in the temperature range of 300 - 400 ºC. The interrupted deformations were conducted with delay times varying between 30 and 120 seconds after achieving a strain of approximately 0. 4 in the first stage. It was indicated that the considerable dynamic <b>softening</b> and exceptional <b>softening</b> associated with a structure <b>softening</b> exist in alloy deformation at 400 ºC, leading to an initial flow stress value at the second deformation lower than that at the first deformation. For all alloys studied, the static <b>softening</b> increases with increasing deformation temperature and holding temperature and delay times.

5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored fusible plug {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy <b>softens.</b> This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E

But Mala still longs for Aba, and their relationship is a cold one. The Eskimos go hunting caribou by stampeding the animals into a lake and then hunting them with bow and arrow and spears from boats. Mala is haunted by Aba's death, and after pouring out his grief through dance and prayer he changes his name to Kripik. Kripik's attitude toward Iva <b>softens</b> dramatically, and they make love. The hunter whom Mala welcomed to the village the previous year returns to his village, and gives Kripik his wife in gratitude.

5|$|Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy {{receptacles}} {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow {{them so they}} pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings {{well away from the}} parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way. Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing <b>softens</b> with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E

40|$|Firmness is an {{important}} trait of postharvest quality in apple fruit (Malus domestica). This study characterises <b>softening</b> rates of early season cultivars before, during, and after controlled atmosphere (CA) storage. 'Royal Gala' and 'Cox's Orange Pippin' apples in CA had a triphasic <b>softening</b> curve during storage {{similar to that of}} fruit in regular air storage (RA). Fruit in CA had a longer initial slow <b>softening</b> phase, and a slower rapid <b>softening</b> phase, than fruit in RA. Firmness benefits in the market arising from CA were attained only when CA was applied to fruit before the onset of rapid <b>softening.</b> Fruit in CA also exceeded an internal ethylene concentration (IEC) of 1. 5 mu l litre(- 1) later, and had a lower maximum IEC, than fruit in air. Thus, CA may extend the initial slow <b>softening</b> phase, and reduce <b>softening</b> in the rapid <b>softening</b> phase by decreasing ethylene production in both cultivars. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that <b>softens</b> and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and <b>softens.</b> From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E
5|$|T.C. Russell is {{the patriarch}} of the Russell family. He is {{characterized}} by his violent temper and hatred of Julian Crane for supposedly injuring him in a hit-and-run attack, and destroying his chances of becoming a professional tennis player. T.C. is initially portrayed as a harsh and unforgiving parent; he pushes Whitney to train to be a tennis champion, as he once wanted to be, and disapproves of her relationship with Chad Harris-Crane, feeling it is a distraction. He is also violent with Simone when she reveals she is a lesbian. After learning about Eve's past relationship with Julian and her responsibility for the car crash that ended his tennis career, T. C. files for divorce and has a brief romance and engagement to her adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. The show humanizes T.C. and <b>softens</b> his temper during his recovery from a stroke; his final storylines focus on his attempts to rebuild {{his relationship with his}} ex-wife and children. In 2007, he moves to New Orleans to help Whitney with her pregnancy and reconnect with Simone.

40|$|Gas {{exchange}} rates and <b>softening</b> of 'Braeburn' apples were measured under {{a range of}} modified atmosphere conditions to characterise their functional relationship. Both gas exchange (measured as CO 2 production) and <b>softening</b> were maximally suppressed at around 1 - 1. 5 kPa O- 2. At these low O- 2 levels, CO 2 {{had no effect on}} the rate of <b>softening.</b> Both <b>softening</b> and gas exchange had comparable Kin values indicating a common kinetic background. The integrated approach revealed a close quantitative relationship between rate of <b>softening</b> and rate of gas exchange of 'Braeburn' apples indicating that fruit <b>softening</b> is directly metabolically linked to gas exchange.
