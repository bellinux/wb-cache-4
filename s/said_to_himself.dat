500|$|While {{defending}} the role Moldavian {{politicians in the}} 1840s had in shaping modern Romanian culture, Ibrăileanu argued that practices {{such as those of}} Heliade and Laurian carried the risk of [...] "suppressing the Romanian language", and credited Alecu Russo, more than his successors at Junimea, with providing a passionate defense of spoken Romanian. He notably cited Russo's verdict: [...] "The modern political hatred aimed at [...] has thrown us into Italianism, into Frenchism, and into other -isms, that were not and are not Romanianism, but the political perils, in respect to the enslavement of the Romanian soul, have since passed; true Romanianism ought to hold its head up high". The literary critic George Călinescu also connected Heliade's experimentation to his Russophobia, in turn reflecting his experiences as a revolutionary: [...] "Hating Slavism and the Russians, who had striven to underline , he <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that he was to serve his motherland by discarding all Slavic vestiges". Călinescu notably attributed Heliade's inconsistency to his [...] "autodidacticism", which, he contended, was responsible for [...] " [...] casual implication in all issues, the unexpected move from common sense ideas to the most insane theories".|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Usher {{revealed}} that {{for his next}} album {{he was working on}} a new type of music which he has depicted as [...] "revolutionary pop", which combines different genres to form a new sound. His seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself was released on June 8, 2012, worldwide and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by Billboard magazine, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: [...] "What he wanted to do [...] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate". In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is [...] "the most artistic of an album" [...] he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me".|$|E
2500|$|And then, Toronto {{was able}} to reel off another three {{straight}} Stanley Cup victories from 1962 to 1964, {{with the help of}} Hall of Famers Frank Mahovlich, Red Kelly, Johnny Bower, Dave Keon, Andy Bathgate and Tim Horton, and under the leadership of coach and general manager Punch Imlach. However, Bathgate claimed after 1964–65 that all the autocratic Imlach <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> and Mahovlich was insulting: ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 28, 2011, Wallenda {{visited the}} Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey {{for a pair}} of performances. [...] In the first, he walked a tightrope inside the casino's {{shopping}} center. [...] Performing with a [...] balancing pole, [...] in the air, he dropped to one knee and then onto his back during the performance. [...] He walked both forwards and backwards before completing the [...] journey. [...] Afterwards, Wallenda said he had previously noted the casino's raised ceiling painted with a sky scene and <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "I've gotta walk there!" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{about that}} time, Earhart {{and a young}} woman friend visited an air fair held in {{conjunction}} with the Canadian National Exposition in Toronto. One of the highlights of the day was a flying exhibition put on by a World War I ace. The pilot overhead spotted Earhart and her friend, who were watching from an isolated clearing, and dived at them. [...] "I am sure he <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> 'Watch me make them scamper,'" [...] she said. Earhart stood her ground as the aircraft came close. [...] "I did not understand it at the time," [...] she said, [...] "but I believe that little red airplane said something to me as it swished by." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 26 January 1983, Nilsen {{killed his}} final victim, 20-year-old Stephen Sinclair. Sinclair {{was last seen}} by acquaintances of his {{in the company of}} Nilsen, walking in the {{direction}} of a tube station. At Nilsen's flat, Sinclair fell asleep in a drug- and alcohol-induced stupor in an armchair as Nilsen sat listening to the rock opera Tommy. Nilsen approached Sinclair, knelt before him and <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "Oh Stephen, here I go again", before strangling Sinclair with a ligature constructed with a necktie and a rope. Noting crepe bandages upon each of Sinclair's wrists, Nilsen removed these to discover several deep slash marks from where Sinclair had recently tried to kill himself.|$|E

2500|$|The austere {{beauty of}} Euclidean {{geometry}} {{has been seen}} by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "You never can make a lawyer {{if you do not}} understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight". Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote in her sonnet [...] "", [...] "O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!". Einstein recalled a copy of the Elements and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the [...] "holy little geometry book".|$|E
2500|$|At the Old Trafford Roses Match in 1926, {{a record}} 78,617 spectators paid {{to watch the}} match peter out into a high scoring draw, with centuries from Lancashire's Harry Makepeace (126), Ernest Tyldesley (139) and 92 from Frank Watson being {{answered}} by Yorkshire legends Percy Holmes (143) and Herbert Sutcliffe (89) who put on 199 {{as if to make}} amends for events 2 years previously. Leonard Green, Lancashire's captain, was batting when the score stood at 499. Neville Cardus relates the story that Green <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "It's not likely that Lancashire ever again will score 500 against Yorkshire, so I'm going to get this single run if it kills me." [...] He pushed a ball from Wilfred Rhodes to the off-side and ran 'like the wind'. The ball was hurled back in anger by Yorkshire legend Emmott Robinson, striking Rhodes on the wrist while Green dived to make his ground. Picking himself up he heard Rhodes muttering to himself:"There's somebody runnin' up and down this wicket. Ah don't know who it is, but there's some-body runnin' up and down this wicket." [...] The operative words in that famous lamentation are, [...] "Ah don't know who it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|One night, Ibrahim {{went up to}} the mountain, {{leaned against}} a rock, and looked up to the sky. He saw a shining star and <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] But when it set he said: [...] "I don't like those that set." [...] The star had {{disappeared}} so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" [...] But when the sun also set he said, [...] "O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with Allah! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." [...] After this declaration, Ibrahim then heard Allah calling him, [...] "O Ibrahim!" [...] Ibrahim trembled and said, [...] "Here I am O my Lord!" [...] Allah replied, [...] "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!" [...] Ibrahim fell to the ground, crying. He said: [...] "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" [...] Ibrahim kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.|$|E
