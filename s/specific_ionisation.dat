40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{application}} of <b>specific</b> thermionic <b>ionisation</b> detection in comprehensive 2 -D GC (GC x GC) and represents the first report of GC x GC with nitrogen phosphorus detection (GC x GC-NPD). Of particular interest is {{the performance of the}} NPD with respect to peak parameters of asymmetry and sensitivity. Since GC x GC produces much narrower peaks than obtained with fast GC (e. g. 100 ms vs. < 1 s) the effect of detector response time and any lack of symmetry arising from the detection step is important if peak separation (resolution) is to be maintained. It was observed that detector gas flows {{had a significant impact on}} peak asymmetry and peak magnitude, and that optimisation of the detector was critical, particularly for complex sample analysis by GC x GC-NPD. Peak asymmetries ranging from A(s) = 1. 8 to 8. 0 were observed under different conditions of detector gas flows. Comparison of GC x GC-NPD with GC x GC-flame ionisation detection (FID) showed the former to be approximately 20 times more sensitive for the detection of nitrogen-containing methoxypyrazines analytes, and GC x GC-NPD had a larger linear detection range compared to GC x GC-FID. Furthermore, comparison of GC x GC-NPD and GC x GC-TOFMS chromatograms for the analysis of coffee head-space demonstrated the benefits of selective detection, ultimately realised in a comparatively simplified contour plot...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. A {{description}} is given {{of the principle}} followed in the experimental determination of the ionisation of egg albumin, its capacity to combine with acids and bases. Egg albumin is regarded as an ampholyte, and in accordance with J. N. Brønsted's definition of acids and bases, ampholytes are considered as substances capable of both taking up and giving off hydrogen ions. The theoretical treatment of the capacity of ampholytes to combine with acids (and bases) {{has been carried out}} on this basis. Section A. Several experimental series are noted, comprising the determination of the activity coefficient of the hydrogen ion (fH) in ammonium chloride solutions of different concentration. Section B. The general method of experimental determination of the ionisation (capacity to combine with adds and bases) of egg albumin in ammonium chloride and potassium chloride solutions is briefly described, and the results of the experiments are compared. Section C. 1). In a brief theoretical survey we have suggested that distinction should be made between isoelectric and isoionic reaction of an ampholyte, the former defined as the hydrogen ion activity (value of paH) at which the mean valency of the ampholyte is 0, the latter as the hydrogen ion activity at which the quantity of acid or base combined with the ampholyte is 0; or, as we prefer to express it, the hydrogen ion activity at which the <b>specific</b> hydrogen <b>ionisation</b> of the ampholyte is 0. If the ampholyte does not combine with other ions than the hydrogen ion, then isoelectric and isoionic reaction coincide. Isoionic reaction is determined by acid-combining experiments. The principle of this determination is briefly described. A theoretical investigation of the alteration with salt concentration of both isoelectric (isoionic) reaction and the shape and direction of the ionisation curves is made, with regard to ampholytes capable only of combining with hydrogen ions, {{on the basis of the}} Debye-Hückel formulæ and Linderstrøm-Lang's theory for the ionisation of polyvalent ampholytes of simple type. It is shown that the salt effect, in accordance with the theory, and in qualitative agreement with the experiments, consists in a turning of the ionisation curves, indicating the relation between the quantity of combined acid (<b>specific</b> hydrogen <b>ionisation)</b> and paH, and the turning of the curves, which leaves the isoelectric reaction unaltered, tends in such a direction that the quantity of combined acid at constant ampholyte concentration and constant pan increases with increasing salt concentration. The possibility of chemical combining of other ions than the hydrogen ion is discussed. 2). Following on 1), a brief survey of the experimental results is given. 3). The isoionic reaction is found from the experimental material and proved to be independent of the ammonium chloride concentration. As the mean of all determinations we have paH 0 = 4. 898 (isoionic reaction). The difference between this value and that formerly found for ammonium sulphate solutions (4. 844) is discussed. 4). Finally, on the basis of the theory in Section 1), some simple calculations of the ionisation curves for egg albumin are made, and it appears that the theory can reproduce the experimental results in a rough quantitative way when we assume that the egg albumin has a radius of 2. 21 · 10 – 7 cm. (answering to a molecular weight of 35, 000 in aqueous solution), and contains 30 acid and base groups...|$|R

40|$|This {{work has}} studied the {{particle}} composition of jets by determining the ratios p±/π± and K±/π± in Au + Au and d + Au collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC. Jets were found by measuring the angular azimuthal correlation between particles at high transverse momentum. Jets were then identified by their back-to-back correlation. A technique was developed to identify charged particles using their <b>specific</b> <b>ionisation</b> measured in the STAR Time Projection Chamber (TPC). This thesis contains {{one of the first}} implementations of using direct photons to tag jets in heavy ion collisions. An attempt was made to extract a trigger sample rich in direct photons from neutral triggers. The hadron ratios were calculated from the jet yields as a function of transverse momentum in each collision system. Although the away side yield is suppressed in central Au + Au, {{there is no evidence that}} the relative particle yields are changed. The hadron ratios for the three systems were found to be consistent with simulated p + p events generated using the Pythia Monte Carlo event generator. This reinforces the conclusion that the fragmentation process is unchanged by interactions with the medium. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} event-by-event {{fluctuations}} of identified hadrons may reveal the {{degrees of freedom}} of the strongly interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions and the underlying dynamics of the system. The observable ν_dyn, which is {{defined in terms of}} the moments of identified-particle multiplicity distributions, is used to quantify the magnitude of the dynamical fluctuations in event-by-event measurements of particle ratios. The ALICE detector at the LHC is well-suited for the study of ν_dyn, due to its excellent particle identification capabilities. Particle identification based on the measurement of the <b>specific</b> <b>ionisation</b> energy loss, dE/dx, works well on a statistical basis but suffers from ambiguities when applied on an event-by-event level. A novel experimental technique called the "Identity Method" is used to overcome such limitations. The first results on identified particle ratio fluctuations in Pb-Pb collisions at √(s_NN) = 2. 76 TeV in ALICE as a function of centrality are presented. The ALICE results for the most peripheral events indicate an increasing correlation between pions and protons which is not reproduced by the HIJING and AMPT models. On the other hand, for the most central events the ALICE results agree with the extrapolations based on the data at lower energies from CERN-SPS and RHIC.

40|$|Combinatorial {{chemistry}} {{is widely used}} within the pharmaceutical industry {{as a means of}} rapid identification of potential drugs. With the growth of combinatorial libraries, mass spectrometry (MS) became the key analytical technique because of its speed of analysis, sensitivity, accuracy and ability to be coupled with other analytical techniques. In the majority of cases, electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS) has become the default ionisation technique. However, due to the absence of fragment ions in the resulting spectra, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is required to provide structural information for the identification of an unknown analyte. This work discusses the first steps of an investigation into the fragmentation pathways taking place in electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The ultimate goal for this project is to set general fragmentation rules for non-peptidic, pharmaceutical, combinatorial compounds. As an aid, an artificial intelligence (AI) software package is used to facilitate interpretation of the spectra. This initial study has focused on determining the fragmentation rules for some classes of compound types that fit the remit as outlined above. Based on studies carried out on several combinatorial libraries of these compounds, it was established that different classes of drug molecules follow unique fragmentation pathways. In addition to these general observations, the <b>specific</b> <b>ionisation</b> processes and the fragmentation pathways involved in the electrospray mass spectra of these systems were explored. The ultimate goal will be to incorporate our findings into the computer program and allow identification of an unknown, non-peptidic compound following insertion of its ES-MS/MS spectrum into the AI package. The work herein demonstrates the potential benefit of such an approach in addressing the issue of high-throughput, automated MS/MS data interpretation...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of chemical abundances in a sub-damped Lyman alpha absorber at z= 1. 839 towards the quasar B 1101 - 26, based on a very-high-resolution (R ~ 75, 000) and high-signal-to-noise (S/N > 100) spectrum observed with the UV Visual Echelle spectrograph (UVES) installed on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). The absorption line profiles are resolved into a maximum of eleven velocity components spanning a rest-frame velocity range of 200 km/s. Detected ions include CII, CIV, NII, OI, MgI, MgII, AlII, AlIII, SiII, SiIII, SiIV, FeII, and possibly SII. The total neutral hydrogen column density is log N(HI) = 19. 48 +/- 0. 01. From measurements of column densities and Doppler parameters we estimate element abundances of the above-given elements. The overall metallicity, as traced by [OI/HI], is - 1. 56 +/- 0. 01. For the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio we derive an upper limit of [NI/OI] < - 0. 65, which suggests a chemically young absorption line system. This is supported by a supersolar alpha/Fe ratio of [SiII/FeII] ~ 0. 5. The most striking feature in the observed abundance pattern is an unusually high sulphur-to-oxygen ratio of 0. 69 < [SII/OI] < 1. 26. We calculate detailed photoionisation models for two subcomponents with Cloudy, and can rule out that ionisation effects alone are responsible for the high S/O ratio. We instead speculate that the high S/O ratio is caused by the combination of several effects, such as <b>specific</b> <b>ionisation</b> conditions in multi-phase gas, unusual relative abundances of heavy elements, and/or dust depletion in a local gas environment that is not well mixed and/or that might be related to star-formation activity in the host galaxy. We discuss the implications of our findings for the interpretation of alpha-element abundances in metal absorbers at high redshift. Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures, to be published in A&...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{introduce}} experiments that explore {{the effect of}} different combinations of femtosecond laser fields on the high harmonic generation (HHG) process and its ap- plications to probe ultrafast dynamics. Combining a fundamental driving field with a secondary field allows for control over the HHG process in several ways. The ionisation step of the process can be altered significantly by introducing a secondary field. The elec- tron trajectories in the continuum can be controlled and manipulated by the secondary field. Further, the secondary field {{can be used to}} drive a population transfer between different states of the cation. In a first experiment, we used the fundamental pulses in combination with copies of themselves (ω + ω experiment) to synthesise a field with a new temporal and spectral structure. Using this synthesised field to drive the HHG process results in a shift of the central frequency of the high-order harmonics. We demonstrated very fine control over the harmonic energy with a setup which is significantly simpler and more cost effective than more commonly used setups, and compatible with very high pulse energy sources. In a second experiment, the fundamental field is combined with its second harmonic (ω + 2 ω experiment). The addition of the second frequency results in a harmonic spec- trum consisting of odd and even harmonics, as the symmetry of the combined generating field is broken. We observed below- and above-threshold harmonics in Kr and CO 2 and investigated the effect of the secondary field on the harmonic generation {{as a function of the}} time delay between the fundamental and its second harmonic. We observed harmon- ics generated by the secondary field only, a delayed onset of some even harmonic orders depending on the delay and interesting modulations of the harmonic yield depending on the delay. This experiment served as a proof of principle for the setup used for the more demanding third experiment. The third experiment combined the fundamental with its third harmonic (ω + 3 ω exper- iment). The idea of this experiment is to drive the HHG process with the fundamental field, whilst the third harmonic drives a population transfer between two cation states in CO 2. If the population transfer is timed right, the recombination probability for the short and long trajectory contributions can be controlled separately. Since each trajectory rep- resents a <b>specific</b> <b>ionisation</b> and excursion time, any changes of the state of the system are encoded in the interferences between the contributions of the short and long trajecto- ries. This makes so-called quantum path interferences (QPI), interferences between the short and long trajectory contributions, a useful observable to probe femtosecond and attosecond dynamics.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental and}} theoretical work performed on various rhodium-holmium (Rh-Ho) and gold-prascedymium (Au-Pr) bimetallic clusters and their oxide counterparts. More specifically, structural and /or electronic properties for these clusters are ascertained from investigating how their adiabatic ionisation energies (IEs) are affected by: (a) the sequential addition of oxygen atoms onto the base bimetallic cluster within each series, or (b) {{the composition of}} the bimetallic clusters i. e. the transition:lanthanide metal atom ratio within each cluster. The clusters were experimentally generated via dual laser ablation and detected using time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) coupled with threshold laser ionisation. Upon successful formation and detection, the experimental adiabatic lEs of these clusters were determined using Photoionisation Efficiency (PIE) spectroscopy. In regards to aspect (a) of this thesis listed above, it was observed that, the sequential addition of individual oxygen atoms onto bare Rh-Ho and Au-Pr clusters either caused: (i) a significant change in or (ii) had little-to-no effect on the experimental adiabatic IE. For clusters that displayed the former behaviour, the addition of the first oxygen atom was observed to significantly decrease the adiabatic IE relative to that of the bare bimetallic cluster within that series. The addition of a second oxygen atom onto the monoxide counterpart was observed to significantly increase the adiabatic IE back to a value {{similar to that of the}} bare bimetallic cluster. In regards to aspect (b) of this thesis listed above, it was observed that: (i) the substitution of a transition metal atom for a lanthanide metal atom generally lowers the experimental adiabatic IE of each cluster, and (ii) the sequential addition of transition metal atoms onto a cluster generally increases the experimental adiabatic IE of each cluster. In order to gain more insight into the nature of the observed experimental adiabatic IE trends mentioned above, Density Functional Theory (DFT) Investigations were performed on the neutral and cationic species for the RhHo₂On [n subscript](n = 0 - 2), Rh₂Ho₂Om [m subscript](m = 0 - 2) and the Au 3 -kPrk [3 -k subscript & k subscript](k = 0 - 3) clusters. From these, the lowest energy neutral and cationic geometries (in addition to other properties such as atomic charges and normal modes of vibration) were determined and subsequently, the theoretical adiabatic IEs of each cluster were calculated. When compared within each series, the experimental and theoretical adiabatic IE trends as a function of: (i) sequential addition of oxygen atoms in the RhHo₂On [n subscript] (n = 0 - 2) and Rh₂Ho₂Om [m subscript] (m = 0 - 2) cluster series and (ii) substitution of a gold atom for a praseodymium atom in the Au 3 -kPrk [3 -k subscript & k subscript](k = 0 - 3) cluster series, both displayed similar behaviour. From this, <b>specific</b> <b>ionisation</b> transitions between neutral and cationic structures were able to be assigned and thus, structural and electronic information about each cluster was able to be inferred. In addition to the DFT investigations, Franck-Condon Factor (FCF) calculations were performed in order to simulate the Zero Electron Kinetic Energy (ZEKE) and PIE spectra for each cluster in the RhHo₂On [n subscript], (n = 0 - 2), Rh₂Ho₂Om [m subscript] (m = 0 - 2) and Au 3 -kPrk [3 -k subscript & k subscript](k = 0 - 3) series. The purposes of these additional calculations were to: (i) identify the most likely transition from two or more competing candidates that occurs upon ionisation for each cluster, and (ii) apply slight corrections to the experimental adiabatic IEs obtained from the PIE spectra in order to account for thermal tailing resulting from vibrational hot band transitions at 300 K.
