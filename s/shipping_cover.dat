40|$|Three hundred {{plankton}} {{samples were}} taken in the South Atlantic Ocean {{by means of a}} fire pump along six straight line series. Five minutes elapsed during the pumping of each sample. During this time the <b>ship</b> <b>covered</b> 0. 83 nautical miles. Intervals between the collection of adjacent samples were equal approximately to a minute, during which time the <b>ship</b> <b>covered</b> 0. 17 nautical miles. The volume of water filtered for each sample was c. 3. 220 litres, and each series covered a distance of 50 miles. Planktonic Foraminifera in the samples were picked out, studied, and counted. A well pronounced patchiness in distribution was observed for all the species composing the assemblages, especially in the areas which are rich quantitatively. The greatest sudden quantitative change was observed in series V where at two nearby stations 198. 2 and 2. 2 specimens per cubic meter of filtered water were observed. In other words, within a distance of one nautical mile the foraminiferal number decreased by a factor of 90. Such a great difference indicates that the results of studies of numerical abundance based on a few samples cannot be considered reliable. The poorest area was crossed by series H, and the differences between foraminiferal numbers observed at neighboring stations along this series were the smallest...|$|R

In mid-January, the <b>ship</b> <b>covered</b> a convoy to Greece, but bad weather foiled plans to attack Italian bases en route. After her return, her aircraft complement was reorganised to include more fighters, as Eagle now had sole responsibility for fighter cover over the fleet after the crippling of Illustrious by German dive bombers on 11 January. In order {{to make room for the}} fighters, one of the Swordfish squadrons was disembarked and used to support the ground war. When Eagle was covering another convoy to Malta in mid-February, the ship carried nine Fairey Fulmars of 805 Squadron, five Sea Gladiators and six Swordfish.|$|R

The Austrians also possessed several submarines, one of which torpedoed the dreadnought Jean Bart in December 1914. The threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic. As the war progressed, the French eventually settled on Corfu as their primary naval base in the area.

50|$|A further {{ship was}} {{authorised}} in 1914 {{and would have}} been named Agincourt (a name later applied to a dreadnought expropriated from Turkey). Although most sources and several official papers in the class's <b>Ships</b> <b>Cover</b> describe her as a further repeat of the Queen Elizabeth design, one historian has suggested that Agincourt would have been built on battlecruiser lines. This design would have kept the Queen Elizabeth armament, but substituted thinner armour to 10 in in order to gain a 28 kn top speed. Whatever the case, Agincourt was cancelled at the outbreak of war in 1914.|$|R
