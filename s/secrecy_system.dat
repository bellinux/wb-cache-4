40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} privacy leakage in biometric <b>secrecy</b> <b>systems.</b> Four {{settings are}} investigated. The {{first one is}} the standard Ahlswede–Csiszár secret-generation setting in which two terminals observe two correlated sequences. They form a common secret by interchanging a public message. This message should only contain a negligible amount {{of information about the}} secret, but here, in addition, we require it to leak as little information as possible about the biometric data. For this first case, the fundamental tradeoff between secret-key and privacy-leakage rates is determined. Also for the second setting, in which the secret is not generated but independently chosen, the fundamental secret-key versus privacy-leakage rate balance is found. Settings three and four focus on zero-leakage systems. Here the public message should only contain a negligible amount of information on both the secret and the biometric sequence. To achieve this, a private key is needed, which can only be observed by the terminals. For both the generated-secret and the chosen-secret model, the regions of achievable secret-key versus private-key rate pairs are determined. For all four settings, the fundamental balance is determined for both unconditional and conditional privacy leakage.

It is commonly accepted that this paper was the starting point for development of modern cryptography. Shannon was inspired during the war to address “the problems of cryptography because <b>secrecy</b> <b>systems</b> furnish an interesting application of communication theory”. Shannon identified the two main goals of cryptography: secrecy and authenticity. His focus was on exploring secrecy and thirty-five years later, G.J. Simmons would address the issue of authenticity.
