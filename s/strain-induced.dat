50|$|Polymers exhibiting a shape-memory effect {{have both}} a visible, current (temporary) form and a stored (permanent) form. Once {{the latter has}} been {{manufactured}} by conventional methods, the material is changed into another, temporary form by processing through heating, deformation, and finally, cooling. The polymer maintains this temporary shape until the shape change into the permanent form is activated by a predetermined external stimulus. The secret behind these materials lies in their molecular network structure, which contains at least two separate phases. The phase showing the highest thermal transition, Tperm, is the temperature that must be exceeded to establish the physical crosslinks responsible for the permanent shape. The switching segments, on the other hand, are the segments {{with the ability to}} soften past a certain transition temperature (Ttrans) and are responsible for the temporary shape. In some cases this is the glass transition temperature (Tg) and others the melting temperature (Tm). Exceeding Ttrans (while remaining below Tperm) activates the switching by softening these switching segments and thereby allowing the material to resume its original (permanent) form. Below Ttrans, flexibility of the segments is at least partly limited. If Tm is chosen for programming the SMP, <b>strain-induced</b> crystallization of the switching segment can be initiated when it is stretched above Tm and subsequently cooled below Tm. These crystallites form covalent netpoints which prevent the polymer from reforming its usual coiled structure. The hard to soft segment ratio is often between 5/95 and 95/5, but ideally this ratio is between 20/80 and 80/20. The shape-memory polymers are effectively viscoelastic and many models and analysis methods exist.|$|E

40|$|Irreversible {{growth of}} {{strained}} epitaxial nanoislands {{has been studied}} {{with the use of}} the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) technique. It has been shown that the <b>strain-inducing</b> size misfit between the substrate and the overlayer produces long range dipole-monopole (d-m) interaction between the mobile adatoms and the islands. To simplify the account of the long range interactions in the KMC simulations, use has been made of a modified square island model. Analytic formula for the interaction between the point surface monopole and the dipole forces has been derived and used to obtain a simple expression for the interaction between the mobile adatom and the rectangular island. The d-m interaction was found to be longer ranged than the conventional dipole-dipole potential. The narrowing of the island size distributions (ISDs) observed in the simulations was shown to be a consequence of a weaker repulsion of adatoms from small islands than from large ones which led to the preferential growth of the former. Furthermore, similarly to the unstrained case, the power-law behavior of the average island size and of the island density on the coverage has been found. In contrast to the unstrained case, the value of the scaling exponent was not universal but strongly dependent on the strength of the long range interactions. Qualitative agreement of the simulation results with some previously unexplained behaviors of experimental ISDs in the growth of semiconductor quantum dots was observed.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{gender differences in}} the strains associated with parenting. We hypothesize that due to the different role experiences of being a parent, mothers are more likely than fathers to experience greater role strain. Women who parent are more likely than their male counterparts to be exposed to <b>strain-inducing</b> experiences because they spend more time in child care and other household chores, because {{they are more likely to}} be doing so as a “single-parent,” because they are more likely to be juggling family responsibilities and work commitments, and because being a parent has greater role salience for women. We also hypothesize that by taking into account the different role experiences of mothers and fathers we can partially account for the expected gender differences in parental strain. These hypotheses are explored using survey data from a probability sample of Detroit parents obtained in 1982 - 83 (n = 1, 040) which assessed their parental role experiences and psychological well-being. The results confirm the hypothesized difference between mothers and fathers in reported strain, among both blacks and whites, with mothers expressing significantly greater role demands and parental strain than fathers. We find, however, that little of this difference is attributable to the differential role experiences we analyzed. We conclude that gender differences in parental strain may be linked more strongly to “gender role” than “parental role,” in that women are socialized more than men into taking responsibilities for relationships and are therefore more likely to experience the greater stresses associated with intimacy and emotional involvement with others. The greater strains of parenting felt by mothers as opposed to fathers may, thus, be due as much to the differential orientations they bring to the parental role as it is due to the objectively-assessed differences in role experience...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} changes exhibited by materials {{in response to}} their surroundings is of fundamental importance across countless disciplines in science and engineering. In the particular field of transducer technologies, <b>strain-inducing</b> phenomena – such as magnetostriction, electrostriction, and piezoelectricity – are utilised in their own right, and form the physical foundation for sensor and actuator devices. Knowledge of the origin and mechanics of such phenomena, and how they manifest themselves in different materials, underpins {{the development of new}} transducers and the optimisation of existing technologies. As such, considerable research is undertaken each year to develop an understanding of the physical processes at work. Yet this is not without its limitations. Theoretical work may study the fundamental properties of a given material, and develop models for its behaviour at an atomic scale. However, experimental observation of strain on a similarly microscopic scale, and thus verification of such models, has presented some serious technical challenges. This has essentially been due to the difficulty in detecting and quantifying atomic motion with sufficient precision. In the case of magnetostriction, inter-atomic displacements in response to an external magnetic field typically saturate at a few femtometres. Here, even commonly employed local probes, such as X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), lack the resolution to observe this motion by some two orders of magnitude. As a result, work to date has almost exclusively dealt with magnetostriction in a scaled-up form. Common experiments employ strain gauges on large, macroscopic samples, where the strain is easier to detect, but where atomic information is lost. However, by exploiting the intrinsic stability and time resolution of the dispersive XAS set-up, the recent development of Differential XAS (DiffXAS) on ID 24 at the ESRF has made such direct, atomic-scale measurements possible [1]. This talk will introduce the Differential XAS technique, and chart its development through some of the most significant results obtained to date. These include the first DiffXAS measurements, which demonstrated the technique’s sensitivity to femtometre scale motion [1]; studies of the technologically important Fe(1 -x) Gax system, where the development of DiffXAS data analysis procedures allowed chemically-selective, atomic magnetostriction coefficients to be quantified [2][3]; studies of the magneto-elastic coupling of FeCo through measurements under applied hydrostatic pressure [4]; and studies of {{structural changes}} as a function of temperature with Thermal DiffXAS [5].

40|$|Graphene, {{a single}} atomic layer of graphite, has many {{exciting}} electronic and mechanical properties. On a fundamental level, the quasi-relativistic behaviour {{of the charge}} carriers in graphene arises from the honeycomb-like atomic structure. Deforming the lattice changes the lengths of the carbon-carbon bonds, breaking the hopping symmetry between carbon sites. Mathematically, elastic strain in a graphene membrane can be described by additional terms in the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, analogous to the vector potential of an external magnetic field. Hence, certain non-uniform strain geometries produce so-called `pseudo-magnetic fields', leading to a predicted zero-field quantum Hall effect. These fictitious magnetic fields are distinct from an external magnetic field {{in that they are}} only observed by charge carriers within the membrane, and have opposing polarity for electrons in the K and K' valleys, preserving time-reversal symmetry of the lattice as a whole. Deforming graphene in the non-uniform manner required to produce a homogeneous pseudo-magnetic field {{has proven to be a}} huge technological challenge, however, restricting experimental evidence to scanning tunnelling spectroscopy measurements on, for example, highly deformed nanobubbles formed by the thermal expansion of an epitaxially grown sheet on a platinum substrate. These results stimulated a large amount of interest in strain-engineering electron transport in graphene, partly due to the extreme magnitude of the observed pseudo-magnetic field, a direct consequence of the strain components strongly varying over the space of a few nanometres, but the formation of nanobubbles is a highly stochastic process which cannot be reliably reproduced. Subsequent research found a way to fabricate nanobubbles with a high degree of consistency, but the measurements were still limited to local-probe techniques due to the nanoscale size of the devices. As such, a method to reliably induce a homogeneous pseudo-magnetic field within a micron-sized membrane would be an attractive proposition, and is the basis for the work presented within this thesis. The non-uniform strain required precludes a simple bending or elongation of the substrate, hence a more local method is required. A novel nanostructure consisting of suspended gold beams surrounding a graphene membrane will deform upon cooling to cryogenic temperatures, and crucially, the actuation mechanism can be designed to produce any configuration of strain, including uniaxial strain, triaxial strain and a fan-shaped deformation, the latter two of which are predicted to create homogeneous pseudo-magnetic fields within a membrane. Strain patterns which are predicted to produce experimentally significant pseudo-magnetic fields (1 T) may be generated with complex actuation beams that are physically achievable. Furthermore, the actuation mechanisms may be utilised as electrical contacts to the membrane, allowing its conductivity to be measured in the context of a two- or multi-terminal measurement, in conjunction with an external magnetic field. The design of the devices was developed using finite-element analysis, and the behaviour verified by low-temperature imaging of prototypes. While, after careful annealing, some conventional two-terminal suspended devices exhibited quantum Hall features at very low fields, the fabricated <b>strain-inducing</b> devices did not display pseudo-Landau quantisation, nor Landau quantisation, due to the difficulties of using current annealing to clean devices post-fabrication. The presented work, however, could pave the way towards observing signatures of pseudo-magnetic fields in a range of experimental measurements, as well as creating alternative strain geometries.

Knowledge of their origin, and how they manifest themselves in different materials, underpins {{the development of new}} transducers and the optimisation of existing technologies. Yet in spite of this, direct measurement of a material’s intrinsic magnetostriction – the strain induced between individual atoms at a microscopic level – has proven elusive. This has essentially been due to the difficulty in measuring atomic motion with sufficient precision. In most materials, magnetostrictive atomic displacements saturate at just a few femtometres. Here, even sensitive atomic probes, such as x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), lack the resolution to observe this motion by some two orders of magnitude. As a result, common experiments employ strain gauges on macroscopic samples, where the strain is easier to detect, but where atomic information is lost. However, with the recent development of differential XAS (DiffXAS) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), such atomic-scale measurements have become possible [1, 2]. Initial studies into the magnetostriction of FeCo thin films demonstrated a sensitivity to femtometre scale motion [1]. Subsequent work extended this study to investigate the magnetoelastic coupling of FeCo under applied hydrostatic pressure [3], and new experiments looked into the behaviour of FePt, and rare-earth iron alloys such as Fe 2 Tb. But the most significant study conducted to date has been that of the Fe-Ga system [4, 5]. In recent years, binary metal alloys such as Fe-Al or Fe-Ga, have attracted considerable interest [6]. It is well known that pure Fe exhibits only an extremely small magnetostriction, but when alloyed with certain nonmagnetic metallic elements, it can be enhanced by over an order of magnitude. Compositions of Fe-Ga with around 19 at% Ga have reported strains of up to 400 ppm [7]. Although this doesn’t constitute a truly ‘giant’ magnetostriction, it is of interest for device applications since Fe-Ga is devoid of expensive rare-earth components, saturates in fields of only several hundred Oersteds, and possesses more desirable mechanical properties than, say, the much studied Terfenol-D alloy. In order to identify the origin of this enhancement, we took a splat-cooled foil of Fe 81 Ga 19 and measured its Joule saturation magnetostriction with DiffXAS [4]. Unlike conventional macroscopic measurements that describe the sample as a whole, magnetostriction coefficients provided by DiffXAS describe the strain of just the first two or three atomic coordination shells surrounding a photo-excited atom. Furthermore, since it is possible to tune the x-ray energy, and so select which atom in the material is excited, it is possible to look at the strain in the local environment of each atomic species separately. Contributions from different types of bond within the structure may then be decoupled and analysed. Such fundamental information has immense value when attempting to verify theoretical models. In 2002, Wu [8] proposed a model for the magnetostriction of FexGa(1 -x) that suggested a tetragonal “B 2 -like” structure {{in the vicinity of the}} Ga atoms was responsible for the observed enhancement. More recently, Cullen et al. [9] reached a similar conclusion, and stated that such a structure could be formed by Ga pairs randomly arranged throughout the material. Conventional XAS studies have confirmed the presence of these Ga pairs [5], but it is DiffXAS that describes how they influence the magnetostriction. From our DiffXAS spectra, we extracted the strain present in different types of bond, and with a subsequent analysis, solved the magnetostriction tensor for the material. This provided two sets of magnetostriction coefficients. In the environment around Fe, (3 / 2)  100 = 40 ppm and (3 / 2)  111 = - 32 ppm, and in the environment around Ga, (3 / 2)  100 = 390 ppm and (3 / 2)  111 ~ 0 ppm. This demonstrates that the observed enhancement is dominated by strain in the vicinity of the Ga atoms. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the strain in the Ga pairs was negligible, indicating that they do not contribute directly to the enhanced magnetostriction, but rather mediate the enhancement in the surrounding Ga-Fe bonds. Further experiments are planned to examine the full range of compositions over which magnetostriction enhancement is observed in this system, and, with the use of single crystal samples, investigate how the microscopic magnetostriction scales up to that seen macroscopically.

The material model used gives an accurate prediction of the <b>strain-induced</b> martensitic transformation behavior during tensile loading. This is valuable for further implementation of the current material model in industrial forming mulations of real components. Godkänd; 2007; 20071212 (pethed...|$|E
40|$|We study {{tunneling}} {{across a}} <b>strain-induced</b> superlattice in graphene. In studying {{the effect of}} applied strain on the low-lying Dirac-like spectrum, both a shift of the Dirac points in reciprocal space, and a deformation of the Dirac cones is explicitly considered. The latter corresponds to an anisotropic, possibly non-uniform, Fermi velocity. Along with the modes with unit transmission usually found across a single barrier, we analytically find additional resonant modes when considering a periodic structure of several <b>strain-induced</b> barriers. We also study the band-like spectrum of bound states, {{as a function of}} conserved energy and transverse momentum. Such a <b>strain-induced</b> superlattice may thus effectively work as a mode filter for transport in graphene...|$|E

Recent experiments have allowed determination of the <b>strain-induced</b> crystallization (SIC) distribution around a crack tip during uninterrupted fatigue tests. The purpose of this work is to compare spatial distributions of crystallinity in a cracked sample at different elongations between one experiment and simulation results based on our model...|$|E
40|$|A model {{describing}} the kinetics {{of the evolution}} of martensite volume fraction during the <b>strain-induced</b> transformation of dispersed austenite in low-alloy TRIP steels has been developed. The model is based on the modification of the nucleation site potency distribution by the applied stress and plastic strain for the description of the stress-assisted and <b>strain-induced</b> transformation regimes respectively. The model is fitted to available experimental data regarding the evolution of martensite as a function of plastic strain for several steels containing austenitic dispersions. Besides chemical composition of retained austenite and temperature, the model takes into account the effects of austenite particle size and stress triaxiality. Austenite particle size refinement has a strong stabilizing influence by retarding the <b>strain-induced</b> transformation kinetics. Stress triaxiality becomes important in stabilized austenite dispersions (either chemically stabilized or by size refinement) by enhancing the kinetics of the <b>strain-induced</b> transformation. The kinetic model can be used {{for the development of a}} constitutive model {{describing the}} mechanical behavior of TRIP steels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The <b>strain-induced</b> {{growth and}} {{interaction}} behavior between neighboring voids located within small clusters has been experimentally modeled by determining the thinning {{behavior of the}} ligaments between the cavities formed by blind-end holes that have (initially) hemispherical ends and that are contained within uniaxial tensile specimens. The key assumption is the <b>strain-induced</b> thinning and coalescence of the ligaments between the macro-scale cavities {{is similar to that}} between neighboring spherical microvoids. Results from Cu specimens containing 2 or 3 blind-end holes indicate <b>strain-induced</b> cavity growth and coalescence behavior that is more rapid for clusters of 3 cavities. For this case, cavity coalescence also results in the characteristic 3 -fold symmetry pattern that frequently forms along the ridges on a dimpled ductile fracture surface. When compared to void growth predictions based on the <b>strain-induced</b> growth of isolated voids, these results indicate void interaction effects that are sensitive to cluster geometry such that the three-fold symmetry conditions created by 3 neighboring voids result in accelerated void growth induced by an elevated level of stress triaxiality within the inter-void ligament...|$|E

The oscillation {{is assigned to}} biexcitonic beat based on its polarization dependence and its initial phase, and the biexciton binding energy is deduced. Since <b>strain-induced</b> dots are produced by adding lateral confinement to a quantum well, direct comparison of the biexciton binding energy in 2 D and in 0 D system is possible. The beat period in quantum dots {{is found to be}} shorter than that in quantum well, and the enhancement factor by the reduced dimensionality is 1. 5. Magnetic field dependence of the biexciton binding energy is also studied. It is independent of the magnetic field up to 8 T, and exciton g-factor in the <b>strain-induced</b> dots is obtained...|$|E
40|$|<b>Strain-induced</b> {{martensitic}} {{transformation in}} AISI 321 {{austenitic stainless steel}} was studied by means of compression, tension and friction tests at room temperature. Compression and tensile tests were done in air and friction tests were realised by using a pin-on-disk apparatus in deionised water. The <b>strain-induced</b> volume fraction of -martensite determined by X-ray diffraction analysis was correlated with different imposed pressures and tensile strams. It seems evident that strain induced - martensite increases {{as a function of}} the normal force and the number of rotations after friction tests; however, the role of sliding rate was negligible. The results were completed by values of friction coefficients. The <b>strain-induced</b> martensite formation is subject to hardening mechanism, which may contribute to cumulative damage of pin-on-disk friction specimens...|$|E
