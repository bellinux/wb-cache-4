5|$|The 2011–12 season {{would inevitably}} {{be a new}} era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence {{and the loss of}} 6th-man Lorin Dixon left {{significant}} holes to fill in the roster. Geno Auriemma <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the right pieces with a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.|$|E
25|$|In a {{shortened}} 2012 season, {{due to the}} NBA Lockout, the Magic {{started the}} offseason on a rocky note, with their All-Star center, Dwight Howard, requesting a trade to either the New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles Lakers, or Dallas Mavericks. Overlooking the trade request the Magic did a sign and trade with the Boston Celtics for Glen Davis and Von Wafer in exchange for Brandon Bass. The Magic also amnestied Gilbert Arenas and signed Larry Hughes, Justin Harper, and DeAndre Liggins. The Magic started the season on Christmas Day in Oklahoma City against the Thunder. They lost the season opener 89–97. During the month of February, the Magic waived Hughes and signed Ish Smith. On February 26, Orlando hosted the 2012 All-Star Game. The Magic struggled to win games consistently, with concerns about the uncertainty of Dwight Howard's future with the franchise. However, after Dwight rescinded his trade demand and signed a one-year deal in March, the Magic <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their footing again. But then in early April, shortly after it became public that Howard requested coach Van Gundy to be replaced, the center {{was diagnosed with a}} herniated disk and forced to have back surgery, thus ending his season. The Magic clinched the sixth seed in the east with a 37–29 record. The Magic were faced with the third seeded Pacers in the first round. Despite winning {{the first game of the}} series the Magic were defeated 4–1.|$|E
25|$|Further {{advances}} in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics. In 1959, the TX-2 computer was developed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. The TX-2 integrated {{a number of}} new man-machine interfaces. A light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using Ivan Sutherland's revolutionary Sketchpad software. Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed {{in front of a computer}} screen and the screen's electron gun fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.|$|E

500|$|After relegation {{back to the}} Fourth Division in 1970–71, the Gills {{were soon}} {{promoted}} back to the Third Division in the 1973–74 season. After this the club <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> its level in Division Three, regularly mounting a challenge for promotion which ultimately fell short each time, never {{more so than in}} 1986–87 when they reached the play-offs only to lose in the final to Swindon Town. [...] During this period the club produced future stars Steve Bruce and Tony Cascarino, who was famously bought from non-league Crockenhill in exchange for a set of tracksuits.|$|E
500|$|The troops under Patton's command {{received}} the speech well. The general's strong reputation caused considerable excitement among his men, and they listened intently, in absolute silence, as he spoke. A majority indicated they enjoyed Patton's speaking style. As one officer recounted {{of the end}} of the speech, [...] "The men instinctively sensed the fact and the telling mark that they themselves would play in world history because of it, for they were being told as much right now. Deep sincerity and seriousness lay behind the General's colorful words, and the men well knew it, but they loved the way he put it as only he could do it." [...] Patton gave a humorous tone to the speech, as he intentionally sought to make his men laugh with his colorful delivery. Observers later noted the troops <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the speeches very funny. In particular, Patton's use of obscene humor was well received by the enlisted men, as it was [...] "the language of the barracks".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{its initial}} low sales, the album had a {{profound}} impact on the hip hop underground circuit, and marked a major stylistic change in hip hop music by introducing a new standard of lyricism. Before the album's release, hip-hop lyricism was mostly defined by two popular forms. One was characterized by a fast-paced ragga-flow accompanied with a whimsical, often nonsensical lyrical delivery, and had been popularized by the Brooklyn-based groups Das EFX and The Fu-Schnickens. The other was characterized by a slurred [...] "lazy drawl" [...] that sacrificed lyrical complexity for clarity and rhythmic cadence, and was exemplified by West Coast hip hop emcees including Snoop Doggy Dogg and Warren G. However, Nas' content, verbal pace, and intricate internal rhyme patterns inspired several rappers to modify their lyrical abilities. [...] Music critic Rob Marriott notes, [...] "appers like Mobb Deep, Tragedy Khadafi, Nature, Cormega, Noreaga, Capone, Raekwon, Ghostface, and even the Windy City wordsmith Common <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> new inspiration in Nas' self awareness, internal rhyme schemes, and mastery of street detail." [...] Marriott also describes the impact of Illmatics [...] "poetic approach" [...] on Jay-Z, writing: [...] "The Brooklyn MC switched his style up from his fast-talking Jaz-O days enough to produce Reasonable Doubt, an album marked by Nas-like introspection..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Naomi Jacobs {{argues that}} [...] "the {{displacement}} [...] {{is exactly the}} point of the novel, which subjects its readers to a shouldering-aside of familiar notions and comfortable perceptions of the world", and both narrations and jarring discrepancies of tone and perspective between them are essential to the purpose. In The Tenant, like in Wuthering Heights, a horrific reality of private life is obtained after passing through the voice of a framing narrator. According to Jacobs, the male narrator represents the public world, and the framed structure serves several functions that are strongly gender-related: it illustrates the process of going behind the official version of reality in order to approach the truth that the culture prefers to deny; it exemplifies the ways in which domestic reality is obscured by layers of conventional ideology; and it replicates the cultural split between male and female spheres that is shown {{to be one of the}} sources of the tragedy in the novel. Jacobs concludes that both Emily and Anne <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it necessary, in approaching subjects that were considered to be controversial, to use the voice of a male narrator, appropriating, delegitimizing and even ridiculing his power, before telling anti-patriarchal truth.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1941, the Calvinist Pastor Marc Boegner {{condemned}} the Vichy statut des Juifs {{in a public}} letter, marking {{one of the first}} times that French anti-Semitism was condemned in public during the occupation. On 5 May 1941, the first SOE agent (Georges Bégué) landed in France in order to make contact with the resistance groups (Andrée Borrel was the first female SOE agent). The SOE preferred to recruit French citizens living in Britain (like Bégué and Borrel) or who had fled to the United Kingdom as they were able to blend in more effectively, and those British citizens sent in as SOE agents were people who lived in France {{for a long period of}} time, and could speak French without an English accent. Bégué suggested that the BBC's Radio Londres send personal messages to the Resistance. At 9:15 pm every night, the BBC's French language service would broadcast the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony (which sounded like the Morse code for V as in victory), which was followed by [...] cryptic messages, which were codes for the [...] "personal messages" [...] to the resistance. The SOE provided weapons, bombs, false papers, money and radios to the resistance and the SOE agents were trained in guerrilla warfare, espionage and sabotage. By end of May 1941, the SOE had a total of two radio stations operating in France. A major reason for young Frenchmen to become résistants was resentment of Collaboration horizontale ("horizontal collaboration") as the sexual relationships between German men and Frenchwomen were euphemistically described. Because the franc had devalued by 20% against the Reichmark and the German policies of requisitioning food ensured the occupation were years of great hardship for the French, which meant from the viewpoint of a Frenchwoman taking a German lover was a rational economic choice. [...] "Horizontal collaboration" [...] was very widespread with 85,000 Frenchwomen having bore children fathered by their German lovers by October 1943. [...] Many young Frenchmen deeply disliked the fact that Frenchwomen <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> German men more attractive than them and wanted to strike back at the hated boches who took all of the local girls for themselves.|$|E
2500|$|The San Francisco Chronicles Peter Hartlaub {{felt the}} remake {{departed}} from the traditional template used by more recent remakes—"include twice as many kills, [...] boring young actors from TV shows, rewrite the script so you lose everything interesting about the original, [...] make up an excuse to add cell phones"—which ultimately made it far more effective. Hartlaub cited the script, which he felt devoted as much time to character development as [...] "carnage", and the [...] "good acting", particularly Tony Goldwyn, as reasons why this remake succeeds. Kyle Smith, of the New York Post, agreed that the film succeeded where other remakes had failed. For Smith, it was {{the replacement of the}} [...] "quick-cutting, loud noises and camera tricks" [...] clichés with [...] "long takes, genuinely disturbing violence and stretches with no dialogue to pin you to the story", which made this film more effective. Smith also commended Dillahunt's acting, as well as Iliadis's [...] "casual, matter-of-fact approach that multiplies the horror to an almost unbearable level". In contrast, USA Today's Claudia Puig stated that director Dennis Iliadis failed at trying to keep the film from becoming another [...] "torture porn". Puig felt that the killing scenes were too drawn out, noting the technique was down to heighten the effect, but actually comes across more as [...] "repugnant and fetishized violence". She also noted that the parents <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> enjoyment in exacting their revenge, even when their daughter lay dying in the next room. Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News was in agreement with Puig when he referred to the film as [...] "stomach-churningly anti-human" [...] because of its violence, and questioned why Goldwyn and Potter even signed on to the film. Neumaier suggests that the film's violence fails to create the sense of [...] "theatricality of the Saw or Hostel films", or even provide audiences with [...] "the unkillable-monster nostalgia of [...] Friday the 13th re-do". Neumaier also states that the 2009 film lacks the reasoning to exist that Craven's 1972 original had, which was to push the [...] "boundaries of cinema's new permissiveness".|$|E
