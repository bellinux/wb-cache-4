50|$|Settlement Date is a {{securities}} industry term {{describing the}} date on which a trade (bonds, equities, foreign exchange, commodities, etc.) settles. That is, the actual day on which transfer of cash or assets is completed and is usually {{a few days after}} the trade was done. The number of days between trade date and settlement date depends on the security and the convention in the market it was traded.

5000|$|An {{electronic}} communication network (ECN) {{is a type}} of computerized forum or network that facilitates the trading of financial products outside traditional stock exchanges. An ECN is generally an electronic system that widely disseminates orders entered by market makers to third parties and permits the orders to be executed against in whole or in part. The primary products that are traded on ECNs are stocks and currencies. ECNs are generally passive computer-driven networks that internally match limit orders and charge a very small per <b>share</b> <b>transaction</b> fee (often a fraction of a cent per share). [...] The first ECN, Instinet, was created in 1969. ECNs increase competition among trading firms by lowering transaction costs, giving clients full access to their order books, and offering order matching outside of traditional exchange hours. ECNs are sometimes also referred to as alternative trading systems or alternative trading networks.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a low-level performance modelling formalism, <b>Shared</b> <b>Transaction</b> Markov Chains (STMCs), {{specifically designed for}} the capture and analysis of massively parallel stochastic systems through fluid techniques.

We demonstrate the new modelling formalism on four distinct models and show how fluid analysis may be performed, with results, where appropriate. Our contribution is {{that this is the first}} such system tailored to the fluid performance analysis of transaction-based systems as found in computing applications such as peer-to-peer networks, web architectures and Publish-Subscribe networks.

40|$|This Article {{discusses}} the often subtle tasks {{faced by the}} courts in construing close corporations law, which is state law. The judiciary in individual states has skillfully managed the invention, continuing development and ongoing evolution of lack of marketability and minority discounts as it strives to honor its constitutional mandate to resolve controversies between minority and majority shareholders in close corporations relating to valuing close corporations stock. These controversies arise {{in the context of}} share transactions in such corporations. Close corporations are traditionally not listed on stock exchanges, and the legislatures in some states have, in some instances, helped to facilitate the judiciary 2 ̆ 7 s ongoing inventive ingenuity in its continuing efforts to resolve these disputes in a context where there is usually no marketplace for the stockholders in close corporations to readily leave by selling their shares and moving on. This Article analyzes the approaches of the judiciary in individual states as the judiciaries in the states collectively pursue almost in synchrony the elusive judicial goal of a fair and equitable resolution of close corporation valuation problems that arise in a plethora of factual <b>share</b> <b>transaction</b> settings, which demand individually tailored solutions...|$|E

40|$|MBA thesis - WBSThis {{research}} report seeks {{to provide some}} quantifiable evidence {{on the effects of}} share trades by directors of companies listed on the JSE Securities Exchange’s J 257 industrial index. The event study methodology was used to investigate the share price changes related to directors’ <b>share</b> <b>transactions</b> around announcement day for the period June 2004 to June 2006. This study found no significant price reaction to directors’ <b>share</b> <b>transactions</b> during the 5 - day event window centred on announcement day. This is consistent with most previous international findings that concluded that the market ignores directors’ share trades when they are announced. Small sized firms that were expected to outperform their larger sized counterparts following their directors’ share trades were found to have small positive abnormal returns that were insignificant. This inconsistent with most previous local and international studies that found that small firms outperform their large counterparts following directors’ share trades. The stock market’s reaction to directors’ share dealings depends on whether a director has sold or bought shares. The 5 -day event window Average Cumulative Abnormal Returns for both purchases and sales were positive but not significantly different from zero confirming findings in Australia but contrary to most previous international studies. Although both directors’ purchases and sales did not send strong signals to the market, there was evidence of short-term market timing, as directors tend to purchase shares following price declines and sell shares following a run up in share prices. The findings on short-term market timing are consistent with previous international finding...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{studies of}} call option early {{exercise}} either ignore personal taxes or simplify {{the impact of}} taxation. When making an early exercise decision, the option holder should compare the after-tax cash flows from exercise with the after-tax cash flows from selling the option. Due to the differential taxation of option and <b>share</b> <b>transactions,</b> {{it is possible for}} exercise to be wealth-maximizing after tax even when it would not be the rational decision on a before-tax basis. By incorporating personal taxes on the option, underlying share and dividend this paper shows that tax can potentially explain a large portion of early exercise events classified as 'irrational' in previous studies.
