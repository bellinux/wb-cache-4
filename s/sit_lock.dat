5000|$|Sonequa Martin-Green's {{performance}} was praised. Josh Jackson felt unlike Masterson, [...] "Sonequa Martin-Green, {{on the other}} hand, did a great job. I love the way she responded when Negan’s asked if Rick had put her up to the assassination attempt: “Rick? Your bitch? No.”" [...] Noel Murray for Rolling Stone said, [...] "The often-underutilized and soon-to-be-Trekkie-fan-favorite Sonequa Martin-Green has been taking full advantage of her increased screen-time {{over the past two}} weeks; she does some of her best TWD work to date when Sasha - who didn't die in her suicide raid - <b>sits</b> <b>locked</b> in a Sanctuary cell, pondering her next move." [...] He went further on the Sasha storyline saying, [...] "What's so remarkable about these interactions are the layers of emotions and motivations that Sasha cycles through, from fear and despair to a sense of hope when she realizes she can manipulate the mulleted gent into slipping her a weapon to [...] "kill herself" [...] - which she hopes to use on the big man in charge." [...] Blair Marnell for CraveOnline felt that while it was likely it would be her final appearances on the show, they [...] "have also been a gift to Martin-Green, as she’s never been more important to the series than she is now. In last week’s episode, Sasha had the really terrific bonding scene with Rosita. This week, Martin-Green carried most of her scenes with Negan and Eugene. She brought the life and fire to this episode, and the series will be poorer for her absence… whenever it eventually comes.|$|R

5000|$|Students at the University of Witwatersrand started protesting on 14 October 2015 in {{response}} to an announcement by the university that fees would be raised by 10.5%.

2500|$|There {{are eight}} locks on the Welland Canal. From {{the north to}} the south, there is the Lake Ontario level control lock at Port Weller, {{followed}} by Lock 2 and then Lock 3, a site with a visitors' information centre and museum in St. Catharines, Ontario. [...] There are four locks in Thorold, Ontario, including twin flight locks 4, 5 and 6, with Lock 7 {{leading up to the}} main channel. The Lake Erie level control <b>lock</b> <b>sits</b> in Port Colborne, Ontario.|$|R
500|$|There {{are several}} notable {{features}} along the canal, including Prestolee Aqueduct and Clifton Aqueduct, {{both of which}} are Grade II listed structures. Nob End Locks (sometimes referred to as Prestolee <b>Locks)</b> <b>sit</b> at the junction of the three arms of the canal at Nob End. They comprise two sets of three staircase locks, separated by a passing basin. These locks served to lower the level of the canal by [...] over a distance of [...] The upper staircase is still visible, but most of the lower staircase was filled in {{at some point in the}} 1950s, and much of the stonework was removed.|$|R
500|$|The route {{continues}} through a wooded valley, past {{the site of}} the Sprotborough Flash Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), with the towpath forming part of the Trans Pennine Trail. Sprotborough lock and weir are situated just before Sprotborough. Just below the lock on the north bank [...] are the remains of an engine house, built in the 1690s for Sir Godfrey Copley of Sprotborough Hall. A water wheel pumped river water some [...] upwards to supply a fountain in the grounds of the hall, a swimming pool, and also provided a water supply for the village. The pump was powered by a water wheel which was removed in the 1970s. Soon the edge of Doncaster is reached, where amongst the railway marshalling yards, the River Don leaves the navigation for the final time, as does the towpath. The two weir streams flow either side of Doncaster prison, effectively forming an island on which the building <b>sits.</b> Doncaster Town <b>Lock</b> is situated close to Doncaster railway station, and between here and Long Sandall Lock, some of the changes which have occurred over the years can be visualised, with the river on the left and ox-bow lakes on the right, severed by the course of the Wheatley Cut. The final section to Bramwith is usually called the River Dun Navigation. At Bramwith, the waterway splits, with the New Junction Canal heading north-east for the Aire and Calder Navigation and Goole, and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal heading east to the River Trent at Keadby. The River Don heads northwards too, turning to the east where the Dutch River starts at Newbridge. The original course to the River Aire can be traced across the fields, now little more than a drainage ditch crossed by an oversized Grade II listed bridge on the A1041 at East Cowick, and Vermuyden's embankments are closely followed by the A614 road after it has crossed the M18 motorway.|$|R
