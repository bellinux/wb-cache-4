40|$|The 2. 65 to 2. 05 Ga Transvaal Supergroup {{comprises}} {{one of the}} best-preserved {{and largely}} continuous successions {{in the world of}} Banded Iron-Formation (BIF), a chemical sedimentary rock composed of fine (mm to cm scale) interbanded iron-rich and iron-poor bands, developed atop the Archaean Kaapvaal Craton of southern Africa. The Transvaal BIF sequence contains at its upper <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>part,</b> an intriguing interlayered BIF-Mn association, namely the Hotazel Formation in the Kalahari Manganese Field, which constitutes the largest land-based manganese deposit on record. The genesis of the Hotazel deposits, and their exact significance in terms of atmosphere-hydrosphere-biosphere evolution, remain as elusive as they are challenging. In this thesis, an attempt is made to illuminate the origin and diagenesis of the Hotazel Formation and its post-depositional hydrothermal modification, through a highresolution geochemical study of the narrowest of the three BIF-Mn sedimentary cycles present in the Hotazel stratigraphy. This approach is coupled with a preliminary geochemical study of the distribution of Mn in older BIF of the Transvaal Supergroup as well (Kuruman and Griquatown Formations), so as to test recent models that causally link all BIFs in the Transvaal Supergroup under a common and evolving palaeo-environment of deposition. The results indicate that the cyclic deposition of the Hotazel BIF and enveloped Mn-rich sediments would have taken place in a stratified basin with a well-developed chemocline in terms of the vertical distributions of Mn and Fe, much like recent anoxic stratified basins such as the Orca Basin in the Gulf of Mexico. The increased Mn abundances as Mn-bearing ferrous carbonates in {{the upper part of the}} Griquatown BIF predating the Hotazel strata, also seems to lend support to the notion that the two BIFs are temporally interlinked as part of a broader sedimentary continuum. Finally, the largely conservative behaviour of Mn and associated elements during hydrothermal alteration of the Hotazel rocks is re-assessed, and renewed emphasis is placed on the possibility that brine metasomatism may have been a key factor in Mn redistribution and residual enrichment...|$|E
40|$|The Horn Graben is a {{relatively}} under explored part of the Danish North Sea. Although extensive exploration in the adjacent Central Graben was very successful only three exploration wells have been drilled in the Danish part of the Horn Graben. Data obtained from two of the wells were used for calibration of 1 D and 2 D basin modelling studies conducted within {{the first part of}} this thesis. As the exploration wells did not find petroleum it was subject of the investigation to clarify why the wells were “dry” and where possible hydrocarbons are potentially trapped. Basin models in 2 D or 3 D were not yet carried out for the area investigated and only very few data exist from the subsurface in the Horn Graben. Especially the unproved Paleozoic source rock gives reason for numerous speculations. Basic information on the high probability of source rock deposits from this time are given by Nielsen et al. (1998) who showed Paleozoic sediments on top of crystalline basement on seismic images. Based on this work a deeply buried source rock was implemented in the 2 D basin model. Properties of this sedimentary layer were interpolated from similar hydrocarbon sources in the adjacent German sector of the North Sea (Neunzert 1996). Remnants of the Upper Jurassic were assumed to contain source rock potential since comparable sediments in the Central Graben generated hydrocarbons during the past. However, the basin model showed that insufficient thermal stress on the Jurassic source prevented hydrocarbon transformation from kerogen. A different situation is observed for the Paleozoic source. Early to late maturity levels were calculated for this <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>part</b> of the graben. If the sediments are present, hydrocarbons must have been generated from this source since the Jurassic. Extensive salt deposits from the Permian most likely prevented secondary migration of hydrocarbons from the source rock to the reservoir rock. This is one possible explanation derived from the 2 D basin model. A possible migration path perpendicular to the section strike can not be denied due to the 2 D limitation of the model. The PetroMod modelling software still assumes that salt has complete sealing properties and prevents any kind of fluid from migrating into higher stratigraphic positions within the basin. Recently published work from Schoenherr et al. (2007) suggests that the sealing capacity of salt is limited and there are strong indications that the theory of salt acting as a complete seal needs to be revised. It is also very probable that thinning of the salt occurred in the area leading to “sweet spots” for vertical migration through the salt layer there. During the calibration process of the Horn Graben wells questions arose regarding various limitations of the commonly used calibration method based on the EASY%Ro algorithm from Sweeney and Burnham (1990). By applying the pseudo-inverse method introduced by Thomsen and Noeth (2001) the models have been investigated regarding their resolution of the predicted maturity in the actual measured data points. Aiming at finding the simplest model that best matches the observed data led to revisions of heat flow histories initially applied and suggested for the 1 D and 2 D models in {{the first part of this}} thesis. Calculations for both wells led to different results for the “best fit” heat flow histories. The present day amount of heat flow was very similar in both wells whereas heat flow values calculated for the model start showed a greater difference. This can be explained with the purely mathematical approach of solving the problem. The introduction of an “Instant Sensitivity Analysis Tool” in the third part of this work allows a very quick calibration of basin models to measured vitrinite data in the area investigated. Only a few model runs in the basin modelling software are necessary to obtain a “best fit” constant heat flow that best matches the observations. Additional to the “best fit” the tool allows finding uncertainty ranges very quickly. The quality of the predicted maturity trend compared to the measured data is expressed mathematically by the Mean Squared Residual (MSR), a unit-less expression of the goodness of fit. Results are reproducible and independent from individual and subjective basin modellers “best visual” outcome. For exploration purposes the precise quantification of “best fit” and “lower” and “upper” limits and its associated MSR help assessing risks and uncertainties...|$|E

Chronostratigraphic data (including foraminifera-based eco-biostratigraphy and d 18 O records, tephrochronological markers and 14 C AMS radiometric datings) {{was derived from the}} shallow-shelf drill sites GeoB 14403 (54. 6 m recovery) and GeoB 14414 (27. 5 m), collected with both gravity and drilled MeBo cores in 193 m and 146 m water depth, respectively. The recovered intervals record Marine Isotope Stages and Substages (MIS) from MIS 5 to MIS 1, thus comprising major <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>parts</b> of the progradational deposits that form the last 100 -ka depositional sequence. Calibration of shelf sedimentary units with borehole stratigraphies indicates the impact of higher-frequency (20 -ka) sea level cycles punctuating this 100 -ka cycle. This becomes most evident in the alternation of thick interstadial highstand (HST) wedges and thinner glacial forced-regression (FSST) units mirroring seaward shifts in coastal progradation. Albeit their relatively short-lived depositional phase, these subordinate HST units form the bulk of the 100 -ka depositional sequence. Two mechanisms are proposed that likely account for enhanced sediment accumulation ratios (SAR) of up to 200 cm/ka during these intervals: (1) intensified activity of deep and intermediate Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) associated to the drowning of Mediterranean shelves, and (2) amplified sediment flux along the flooded shelf in response to hyperpycnal plumes that generate through extreme precipitation events during overall arid conditions. Equally, the latter mechanism is thought to be at the origin of undulated features resolved in the acoustic records of MIS 5 Interstadials, which bear a striking resemblance to modern equivalents forming on late-Holocene prodeltas of other Mediterranean shallow-shelf settings...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 104 surface samples were {{selected}} from the measured <b>stratigraphic</b> column (upper <b>part</b> of Padeha, Khoshyeilagh and Lower part of Mobarak formations) in the Mighan village. The samples were analyzed in the palynological Laboratory for palynomorph entities {{in order to determine}} the age relationships of the upper part of Padeha Formation and the whole Khoshyeilagh Formation as well as the lower part of Mobarak Formation. In addition to palynomorphs, brachiopod and foraminiferal taxa were investigated in this study. A total of 103 fauna and micro floral species was identified, belonging to 72 palynomorph species (46 genera). Out of 72 palynomorph taxa 32 species belong to miospore group, 38 species related to acritarch group, one chitinozoan and one scolecodont. Moreover, 5 micro faunal genera (10 species) and 21 macro faunal spcies (15 genera) were encountered. Based on stratigraphic distributions of palynomorphs, foraminifers and brachiopods taxa eight assemblage zones were established. The zone I occurs in the upper part of the Padeha Formation and suggests the early Frasnian. The zones of II to VII are present within the Khoshyeilagh Formation and reveals the Middle Frasnian to late Famennian. The zone VIII occurs in the basal part of Mobarak Formation and suggests Early Carboniferous (Tournaisian) for this part of Mobarak Formation. The presence of miospore species of Archaeoperisaccus opiparus in the upper part of Padeha Formation and miospore spcies of Vallatisporites pusillites, Retispora lepidophyta, Retusotriletes phillipsii and Hymenozonotriletes perplexa in the Khoshyeilagh Formation suggest a tropical latitude during the Late Devonian in the study area. On the other hand, based upon the continental elements vs. the marine elements(K=C. E. /M. K.) is 1. 587, suggesting a shallow marine environment, which is consistent with the sedimentological data.

40|$|The Upper Ordovician (Katian, Richmondian) {{strata of}} Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, long noted for their {{abundant}} fossils and excellent exposures, have been subdivided {{into a series}} of three 3 rd order depositional sequences by Holland and Patzkowsky (1996). Recent detailed field studies in southern Indiana and northern Kentucky suggests a major, regionally angular unconformity within their sequence C 5. Evidence for this subtle disconformity includes the progressive southward loss of marker beds and intervals in the middle part of the Waynesville Formation in southern Indiana. This regional truncation has escaped notice despite a century of <b>stratigraphic</b> work, in <b>part</b> because of similarity of facies above and below the erosion surface. However, it appears to be equivalent to a Mid-Richmondian Unconformity recognized Ross and Ross (2002) in central Kentucky. Recent work confirms the significance of this surface. The Mid-Richmondian Unconformity in southern indiana is situated below a thin condensed interval containing a brachiopod epibole, the “lower Glyptorthis insculpta zone”, the base of which marks the traditional boundary between the Clarksville and Blanchester Members of the Waynesville Formation. In down-ramp locations, the surface is characterized by the presence of small crusts of pyrite. Further upramp (to the south), this surface is marked by a change from limestone and shale of the Bull Fork Formation to dolostone and dolomitic shales referred to by previous workers as the Rowland Member of the Drakes Formation. Approximately 15 – 16 meters of strata, present in northern distal section, are absent in the proximal sections {{on the west side of}} the Cincinnati Arch. This is explained by both erosional down-cutting beneath the unconformity, and depositional thinning of the shales in the proximal setting. Future correlation work will test the idea that this surface continues further south, eventually removing all of the lowest Waynesville and part of the Arnhem Formation below. This significant unconformity represents a third-order sequence boundary that splits Holland’s C 5 sequence into two parts. Accordingly, we propose that the Blanchester, the uppermost member of the Waynesville, be elevated to a formation...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present and justify the reasons for the worldwide recognition of Portuguese Marbles as Stone Heritage. These marbles are also known as “Estremoz Marble” since was the first county were exploited. In the Estremoz Anticline marbles occupy an intermediate <b>stratigraphic</b> position being <b>part</b> of a volcano-sedimentary sequence of Cambrian age. The anticlinal structure has a Precambrian core and the younger rocks aged Devonian Period. This sequence has deformed by the Variscan Orogeny, which performed twice with different intensities both in ductile and brittle tension fields. The early Alpine Cycle also acts in the region and cause more fracturing of the marble. Practically in all the quarries is possible to perceive the spatial-temporal continuity of the deformation where one can describe a complete Wilson Cycle. Together all these geological features imprint the marbles beautiful aesthetic patterns that can be highlighted when used as dimension stone. Nowadays most of the quarries are placed in the counties of Borba and mainly in Vila Viçosa. This last city claims for itself the “Capital of the Marble” title and named the marble as “White Gold”. In fact, according to the historical record, the marbles were quarried in Portuguese Alentejo’s Province since the fourth century BC. Locally these geological materials are available easily accessible.

40|$|Fluvial {{systems and}} their {{preserved}} stratigraphic expression as the fill of evolving basins {{are controlled by}} multiple factors, which can vary both spatially and temporally, including prevailing climate, sediment provenance, localized changes in the rates of creation and infill of accommodation in response to subsidence, and diversion by surface topographic features. In basins that develop in response to halokinesis, mobilized salt tends to be displaced by sediment loading to create a series of rapidly subsiding mini-basins, each separated by growing salt walls. The style and pattern of fluvial sedimentation governs {{the rate at which}} accommodation becomes filled, whereas the rate of growth of basin-bounding salt walls governs whether an emergent surface topography will develop that has the potential to divert and modify fluvial drainage pathways and thereby dictate the resultant fluvial stratigraphic architecture. Discerning the relative roles played by halokinesis and other factors, such as climate-driven variations in the rate and style of sediment supply, is far from straightforward. Diverse stratigraphic architectures present in temporally equivalent, neighbouring salt-walled mini-basins demonstrate the effectiveness of topographically elevated salt walls as agents that partition and guide fluvial pathways, and thereby control the loci of accumulation of fluvial successions in evolving mini-basins: drainage pathways can be focused into a single mini-basin to preserve a sand-prone fill style, whilst leaving adjoining basins relatively sand-starved. By contrast, over the evolutionary history of a suite of salt-walled mini-basins, region-wide changes in fluvial style can be shown to have been driven by changes in palaeoclimate and sediment-delivery style. The Triassic Moenkopi Formation of the south-western USA represents the preserved expression of a dryland fluvial system that accumulated across a broad, low-relief alluvial plain, in a regressive continental to paralic setting. Within south-eastern Utah, the Moenkopi Formation accumulated in a series of actively subsiding salt-walled mini-basins, ongoing evolution of which exerted a significant control on the style of drainage and resultant pattern of stratigraphic accumulation. Drainage pathways developed axial (parallel) to salt walls, resulting in compartmentalized accumulation of strata whereby neighbouring mini-basins record significant variations in sedimentary style at the same stratigraphic level. Despite the complexities created by halokinetic controls, the signature of climate-driven sediment delivery can be deciphered from the preserved succession by comparison with the <b>stratigraphic</b> expression of <b>part</b> of the system that accumulated beyond the influence of halokinesis, and this approach can be used to demonstrate regional variations in climate-controlled styles of sediment delivery...|$|R
40|$|A {{metamorphic}} {{event in}} the Vammala Migmatite Belt (VMB) at ~ 1. 92 Ga, revealed by SHRIMP U-Pb analyses of both zircon overgrowths and monazite, is interpreted as post-depositional and is correlated {{with the development of}} the early high-grade schistosity. Neither this Early Svecofennian deformation and metamorphism, nor the associatedcomplex folding, is present in the overlying Tampere Schist Belt (TSB) sequence, consistent with the VMB being part of a pre- 1. 91 Ga basement complex. The ~ 1. 92 Ga event provides a maximum deposition age for the TSB, confirming earlier age estimates. Earlier <b>stratigraphic</b> correlations between <b>parts</b> of the VMB and TSB, and associated tectonic interpretations, can no longer be sustained. The crustal thickening seen in the VMB, and previously attributed to arc accretion at ~ 1. 89 Ga, is now attributed to accretion of a large Svionian marginal basin during the ‘Early Svecofennian’ orogenicphase at ~ 1. 92 Ga. This is of similar age to the deformation and metamorphism associated with collision in the Lapland-Kola Orogen {{to the north of the}} Karelian Province. The well-known post-TSB orogenic phase was also identified in the VMB by a monazite age of 1881 ± 6 Ma. A granitoid intrusion gave an emplacement age of 1888 ± 5 Ma,comparable to the age of granitoid clasts in the upper part of the TSB succession. The detrital zircon data are interpreted to suggest that deposition of the precursor VMB sediments probably took place soon after an earlier pre-depositional metamorphism at ~ 1. 98 Ga, which affected igneous source complexes dated at ~ 1. 99 Ga and ~ 2. 01 Ga. Mafic rocks in the southern part of the VMB, and probably also the Haveri basalts, represent a renewed episode of extensional magmatism, which might correlate with the 1. 96 – 1. 95 Ga Jormua and Outokumpu ophiolites. A pre- 1. 96 Ga older stage basin has an expression in Sweden and complexes of similar age occur in theconcealed Palaeoproterozoic basement south of the Gulf of Finland. Similar rocks, deformed and metamorphosed before ~ 1. 96 Ga, might be present beneath the Central Finland granitoid complex and the late Svecofennian granite-migmatite zone, and were possibly more local sources for both the younger stage Svionian basin sediments andthe post- 1. 91 Ga Bothnian Basin sediments. The TSB and other post-accretionary volcanic sequences, and the associated plutonism,are interpreted to reflect a ~ 40 m. y. extensional period, inboard of the contemporaneous active margin, between orogenic phases at ~ 1. 92 Ga and ~ 1. 88 Ga. This interpretation provides a more satisfactory explanation of the major heat input to the crust over a very wide area than does the arc accretion hypothesis. The tectonic evolutionof the Svecofennian Province has strong similarities to that of the Palaeozoic Lachlan Fold Belt in eastern Australia...|$|R

A história geológica do grupo remete ao limite Cretáceo/Terciário. O estudo teve como objetivo central demonstrar que a análise das feições morfológicas internas e externas de conchas fósseis e atuais de braquiópodes possibilita a realização de estudos cladísticos. Para atingir esse objetivo foram avaliadas as relações de parentesco e a sistemática dos Bouchardiinae (Família Terebratellidae), bem como o escopo de seus gêneros. A análise envolveu os gêneros Bouchardia, Bouchardiella, Neobouchardia e Malleia, tendo como grupo externo Adnatida, Aliquantula, Anakinetica, Australiarcula, Elderra, Magadina, Magadinella, Parakinetica, Pilkena, Pirothyris e Rhizothyris. A análise contou com 22 táxons (grupo interno e externo) e 43 caracteres. O cladograma (CI= 0, 714; RI= 0889; RC= 0, 635) escolhido como proposta de trabalho apresentou topologia bem resolvida, com dois clados bem distintos. Um deles, reúne todos os Bouchardiinae, tendo Malleia portlandica como táxon basal, o outro agrupa os Anakineticinae, incluindo Australiarcula artesiana. Entre os Bouchardiinae, a única indefinição ficou por conta das espécies Bouchardia rosea e Bouchardia transplatina, o que reforça a suspeita de serem sinônimos.

These brachiopods {{are common in}} the Cenozoic fossil record of Argentina, Uruguay, Antarctica, New Zealand, Australia, {{as well as in}} the Brazilian shelf. The geological history of the group can be tracked back until de Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. The main goal of present study was to verify the hypothesis that morphological analysis on internal/external features of extinct/extant brachiopod shells allow us to proceed a cladistics analysis for the group. In order to achieve this goal, the relationships and systematic of the Bouchardiinae (Family Terebratellidae) were evaluated, as well as the scope of their genera. The cladistics analysis involved the in-group taxa Bouchardia, Bouchardiella, Beobouchardia, Malleia, having Adnatida, Aliquantula, Anakinetica, Australiarcula, elderra, Magadina, Magadinella, Parakinetica, Pilkena, Pirothyris, Rhizothyris, as the out-group. A total of 22 taxa and 43 characters were evaluated. The cladogram used as work hypothesis (CI= 0, 714; RI= 0, 889; RC= 0, 635) presented a well resolved topology with 2 distinct clades; one with all Bouchardiinae, being Malleia portlandica the basal taxon; the other presented all Anakineticinae, including Australiarcula artesiana. The only unresolved relationship was between Bouchardia rosea and Bouchardia transplatina, suggesting that both taxa are synonymous. Among the out-group taxa the basal position of Australiarcula artesiana is worthy to mention. The results allow us to consider that: a) the morphological analysis of internal/external features of extinct/extant brachiopod shells supply important morphological data for cladistics analysis; b) there are 2 distinct clades that are representative of the Bouchardiinae and Anakineticinae, the later including Australiarcula artersiana, bringing some new evidences on their systematic position; c) the status of the genera, while valid and distinct taxa was re-evaluated, and resulted on the proposition of the synonymy between Bouchardiella and Neobouchardia, favoring the former; d) Bouchardia rosea and Bouchardia transplatina did not share significant morphological differences to keep them as distinct taxa. Thus the synonymy in favor of Bouchardia rosea (Mawe), 1823 is proposed; e) the monophyletic status of Bouchardiinae was corroborated; f) 3 synapomorphies ever suggested by the literature were confirmed, as follow: posterior thickening of the shell, V̈s̈happed cardinal process, and incomplete brachidia; g) based on the topology the condition of Bouchardia rosea and Anakinetica cumingi as distinct taxa is reinforced. Thus, their morphological similarities are much more due to similar ecological pressures (or mode of life) than to their close relationships; h) the classification of bouchardiid brachiopods seems to combine the suggestions of RICHARDSON (1994) and BRUNTON (1996), validating the Subfamily Bouchardiinae, with Bouchardia, Bouchardiella, and Malleia; i) despite of the lack of <b>stratigraphic</b> record of <b>part</b> of bouchardiid history, the parallel evolution of 2 groups was identified; one presenting a short interval, restricted to Australia e New Zealand, and corresponding to Bouchardiella cretacea, Bouchardiella (Neobouchardia) minima e Malleia portlandica, and the other group corresponding to Bouchardiella patagonica, Bouchardiella jorgensis, and species of Bouchardia, with an almost continuous record since the Cretaceous. This group evolved around the Antarctic Peninsula and east coast of southern South America; j) in spite the general north migration pattern presented by species of Bouchardia, some intermediate steps could be recognized, specially the migration of Bouchardia towards the Tierra del Fuego coast (Argentina) and Antarctic Peninsula. Consequently, the previous pattern of continuous northward migration of bouchardiid species without the retention of previous locations is only partially supported by the current data...|$|R
