40|$|With {{escalating}} {{demand for}} improvement of construction project performance, alternative project delivery methods and innovative project contracting methods are implemented depending on various work types and project sizes. Contingency generally refers to initial contingency amount estimated before bidding and {{will be included in}} original contract. Premium cost also will be issued to pay non-value additional works. As a result, additional works, which also refers to change orders, are paid mainly by initial contingency, <b>supplemental</b> <b>agreements</b> and premium cost. This paper mainly aims to compare initial amount of contingency to later investment paid for change orders by means of <b>supplemental</b> <b>agreements</b> or premium cost. If estimation of initial contingency is rather precise, even the initial contingency is high and will increases the original contract amount, it might still be beneficial to projects because it eliminates the cost-related influence caused by unforeseen additional works paid by fund prepared as contingency in advance. This paper is designed to testify correlation between initial contingency and cost overrun, moreover, to compare this correlation to the ones between <b>supplemental</b> <b>agreement</b> amount, premium cost and cost overrun, with which it could demonstrates whether initial contingency is less costly than amount issued by <b>supplemental</b> <b>agreements</b> or premium cost. Based on the results of correlation analysis, initial contingency is proved to be less expensive than paying change orders by <b>supplemental</b> <b>agreements</b> and premium cost...|$|R

40|$|Conducted under USDA Agreement No. 58 - 3159 - 7 - 11 Guayule Natural Rubber ProgramIntroduction: The United States imports 100 {{percent of}} its natural rubber. Ninety-two percent of our natural rubber {{production}} is concentrated in Southeast Asia, which is subject to interruptions through political action or direct military intervention. Natural rubber, a critical and strategic material, is necessary in such articles as aircraft and ground vehicle tires, medical supplies, resilient mounts, and certain acoustical applications. Synthetic elastomers cannot meet performance requirements in these areas. A domestic source of natural rubber will assist in assuring a supply of this critical material for industry and defense. The U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) signed a Master Memorandum of Understanding in 1982 that calls for cooperation with respect to food, agriculture, forestry, nutrition, and other research of mutual interest. With this MOU both agencies adopted a <b>supplemental</b> <b>agreement</b> in 1986 that initiated the Joint Guayule Domestic Rubber Program, whose {{ultimate goal is to}} promote an economically viable domestic guayule rubber industry. To accomplish this goal, both agencies have provided funding to plant and cultivate guayule shrubs, construct a 150 -long- ton -per -year prototype plant to extract rubber from the shrubs, and conduct evaluations to establish the performance capability of military products fabricated with domestic guayule rubber. A critical component of the <b>supplemental</b> <b>agreement</b> calls for the USDA to assess the feasibility of a commercial guayule rubber processing facility of 50, 000 -long-ton-per-year nameplace capacity. This report, based on the best available data (1990) and on assumptions of future advancements in technology (for 1996), is designed to address the commercial prospects {{for the establishment of a}} domestic guayule rubber industry. It also examines the feasibility and factors involved in meeting either 20 percent or 100 percent of the natural rubber needs of the U. S.

40|$|Mycobacterium bovis infects {{multiple}} wildlife {{species and}} domesticated cattle across South Africa, and negatively impacts on livestock trade and movement of wildlife for conservation purposes. M. bovis infection was first {{reported in the}} Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa during the 1990 s, and has since spread to infect numerous animal host species throughout the park and across South Africa. Whole genome sequencing data of 17 M. bovis isolates were analyzed to investigate the genomic diversity among M. bovis isolates causing disease in different animal host species from various locations in South Africa. M. bovis strains analyzed {{in this study are}} geographic rather than host species-specific. The clonal expansion of M. bovis in the KNP highlights the effect of an introduction of a transmissible infectious disease leading to a rising epidemic in wildlife, and emphasizes the importance of disease control and movement restriction of species that serve as disease reservoirs. In conclusion, the point source introduction of a single M. bovis strain type in the KNP ecosystem lead to an M. bovis outbreak in this area that affects various host species and poses an infection risk in neighboring rural communities where HIV prevalence is high. <b>Supplementary</b> data: <b>Supplemental</b> Methods; Supplemental Data 1, Table S 1; Supplemental Data 2, Table S 2 The South African Medical Research Council, the National Research Foundation, and faculty baseline funding from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia) awarded to A Pain.
