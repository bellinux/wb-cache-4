5000|$|Metal {{injection}} molding [...] (MIM) is a metalworking {{process by which}} finely-powdered metal is mixed with a measured amount of binder material to comprise a [...] "feedstock" [...] capable of being handled by plastic processing equipment through {{a process known as}} {{injection molding}}. The molding process allows dilated (oversized due to binder) complex parts to be shaped in a single step and in high volume. After molding, the powder-binder mixture is subjected to steps that remove the binder (debinding) and sinter densify the powders. End products are small components used in various industries and applications. The nature of MIM feedstock flow is defined by a physics called rheology. [...] Current equipment capability requires processing to <b>stay</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> products that can be molded using typical volumes of 100 grams or less per [...] "shot" [...] into the mold. Rheology does allow this [...] "shot" [...] to be distributed into multiple cavities, thus becoming cost-effective for small, intricate, high-volume products which would otherwise be quite expensive to produce by alternate or classic methods. The variety of metals capable of implementation within MIM feedstock are broad, but mostly stainless steels, as common in powder metallurgy; they contain the same alloying constituents found in industry standards. However, oxygen is often a difficulty and is often not specified, but can be a problem for corrosion resistance. Subsequent conditioning operations are performed on the molded shape, where the binder material is removed and the metal particles are diffusion bonded and densified into the desired state with typically 15% shrinkage in each dimension.|$|E

40|$|Object: Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) is the stereotactic neurosurgical {{treatment of}} choice for patients with severe movement disorders refractory to pharmacological treatments. During the DBS procedure a predetermined target (VIM,ZI,STN,Gpi&PPN), part of the basal nuclei associated with control of movement, receives electrical stimulation. The more accurate a target is localized on the MR-image the more accurate the implantation of the leads and extension will be. To ensure accurate targeting on MRI {{it is important to}} clearly define the target area on the MRI-scans. The quality of an MR image is determined by the spatial resolution, the image contrast, (movement) artifacts and the signal to noise ratio. To assess the future of the MRI 7 -Tesla in stereotactic surgery, DBS targets above mentioned are compared on a 1. 5 -, 3 - and 7 -Tesla scanner with 5 participants The object {{of this study is to}} determine the value of the MRI 7 -Tesla scanner in comparison to the 1. 5 - and 3 -Tesla scanners to visualize target nuclei in DBS. Methods: This study compared MR images made by a 1. 5 -, 3 - and a 7 -Tesla scanner, on image contrast and the signal to noise ratio. Results: Images obtained with the ultra-high-field-strength MRI-scanner showed a better delineation of the targets in comparison to the other tissue than the other MRI-scanners. The image shows that the signal intensity of the 7 -Tesla image is nearly 60 % better than the 3 -Tesla’s and 160 % better compared to images made by a 1. 5 -Tesla scanner. Furthermore imaging with a ultra-high-field strength MR-scanner shows a 23 % improvement in signal to noise ratio compared to the 3 -, and a 50 % improvement compared to the 1. 5 -Tesla scanner. Conclusions: Scanning with a ultra-high field strength scanner, facilitates a significant improvement in the imaging of DBS targets. However more studies will have to be performed to assess the question whether ultra-high-field-strength will one day receive its place in everyday patient care or if the use will <b>stay</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a specific need as with DBS. ...|$|E
30|$|Few works like: Andronico et al. [20], Hou et al. [21] and De Meo et al. [22] {{take into}} account {{openness}} features in clouds federation. In [20] work authors include in the federation different cloud middleware, providing a concrete model that looks at heterogeneous cloud systems. In this work, the described model is able to consider all implications in accomplishing and managing dynamic cloud federations. The model targets small cloud operators allowing them to easily join and leave the federation. In [21] they present a self-management approach for the cloud services with an autonomous and context-aware management of the resources by employing a number of service agents in the cloud environment. Based on this approach, they present a cloud-oriented services self-management framework with suitable mechanisms for service aggregations and service provisions. Two supporting algorithms are designed to implement the proposed services self-organization process and the service provision process. Several types of agents {{are involved in the}} cloud services self-management such as a service manager agent, a manager center agent, and a service broker agent. Connection of computational nodes enlarges classical grid architecture. De Meo et al. [22] proposed a model supporting open grid federations based on a multi agent architecture, a distributed approach {{to improve the quality of}} service in dynamic grid federations where each grid composing the federation is able to accept or refuse node’s request for leaving or joining a virtual organization at any moment. Intelligent software agents reorganize the virtual organization according to two integrated parameters: (i) the nodes (past) behaviors, in terms of costs of the resources requested/offered and (ii) the trustworthiness of nodes, which is based on data automatically collected by software agents assisting grid nodes. In order to enhance the rate of requests satisfaction and reduce unallocated resources situations, the grid formation algorithm ensures a balance function between offer and demand of resources. Although approaches [21, 22] provided good results, they <b>stay</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a fixed number of criteria: in [21] the service manager considers an optimization and a balance method and in [22], reorganization depends on the result of the combination between trust and historical behaviors into a unified convenience measure. It stays insufficient for a large coverage of all the system’s sides such as: the quality of service “time response”, computing the load balance “workload parameter”, the geographical location or distance “network delay” between the costumer and provider…etc. However, the adaptive mechanism in AMACE takes into consideration optimization of no fixed number of various ranges and conflicting criteria and the list is not limited, it stays open and stretchable.|$|E
40|$|This report {{looks at}} the origins and {{development}} of the ISIS support network in Indonesia. Introduction Support for the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as ISIS) in Indonesia raises the risk of violence there even though the capacity of violent extremist groups remains low. This could change with the eventual return home of Indonesians now fighting in Syria and Iraq who will have the training, combat experience, and leadership potential now lacking in Indonesia’s extremist community. The 22 September 2014 exhortation by IS spokesman Al-Adnani to kill foreigners linked to the U. S. -led coalition could also provide an incentive to Indonesian ISIS supporters to target Westerners as a way of earning approval from leaders of the self-declared caliphate. The Indonesian translation of that exhortation includes this passage: If you do not have bombs or bullets, and a kafir (infidel) from America or France or one of their allies comes out, hit him {{in the head with a}} rock, carve him up with a knife, hit him with your car, throw him off a high building or poison him! Would-be terrorists in Indonesia for the last four years have focused exclusively on domestic targets, mostly the police, and they continued to do so even after the caliphate was announced. The instruction from Al-Adnani, however, could be taken seriously by those who have both pledged allegiance to IS and have already used or attempted to use violence. This report examines the ISIS support network in Indonesia, how it emerged, who joined it and how it has evolved. It also {{looks at the}} Indonesian government’s response. While that response has been forceful, the government still needs to translate decrees into action. It has instructed prison officials to step up monitoring of convicted terrorists, for example, yet Al-Adnani’s grim message was translated by one of those prisoners and posted on radical websites within 24 hours of its issuance. President Yudhoyono’s government announced a ban on ISIS on 4 August after the appearance on YouTube of a video called “Joining the Ranks”, in which an Indonesian calling himself “Abu Muhammad al Indunisi” urges others to follow his example and join the jihad in Syria. Abu Muhammad turned out to be an activist named Bahrum Syah with links to an extremist organisation once known as Al Muhajiroun. Al Muhajiroun’s founders, Omar Bakri Muhammad and Anjem Choudary, have gone on to establish a global network of advocacy groups supporting the establishment of Islamic law, if necessary by violent means. The first branch, in the UK where Choudary is based, was called Islam 4 UK, later Sharia 4 UK. Each national branch had “Sharia 4 ” in its title; Sharia 4 Indonesia was established in 2010. A small group of Indonesians inspired by Bakri and Choudary became the engine of the pro-ISIS network in Indonesia. The group runs the website www. al-mustaqbal. net, hereafter referred to as Al-Mustaqbal. It has links to most of the terrorist groups still operating in Indonesia, including the Mujahidin of Eastern Indonesia (Mujahidin Indonesia Timur, MIT) and the Mujahidin of Western Indonesia (Mujahidin Indonesian Barat, MIB). It sponsored most of the ceremonies across Indonesia pledging loyalty to IS after the latter on 29 June 2014 announced the establishment of a caliphate. And its fighters in Syria, including Bahrum Syah, have formed an Indonesian-Malaysian unit of ISIS in Syria that reportedly aims at eventually establishing an archipelagic Islamic State in Southeast Asia, to be called Daulah Islamiyah Nusantara. The report also examines how the announcement of the caliphate has split the Indonesian jihadi community, leading to deep divisions among convicted terrorist prisoners and the splintering of a leading jihadi organisation, Jamaah Anshorul Tauhid (JAT). The individual who has emerged as the most important ideological promoter of ISIS is Aman Abdurrahman, a cleric imprisoned in the maximum security complex on the island of Nusakambangan, off the south coast of Java. It is he who became the mentor of the Sharia 4 Indonesia group and whose followers constitute the glue that binds disparate elements of the Indonesian ISIS network together. The appearance of ISIS may be a rare example of international developments becoming a direct driver of jihadi recruitment in Indonesia. In the past, the drivers have been overwhelmingly local. When Indonesians went to Afghanistan to train in the mid- 1980 s and early 1990 s, they were spurred by repression at home and the desire to develop the capacity to fight Soeharto. The bombing campaign of Jemaah Islamiyah between 1999 and 2002 was sparked by communal conflict at home, in Ambon and Poso. Despite all the rhetoric about support for Palestine, very few Indonesians have ever gone to fight there. The appeal of ISIS is different, a combination of religious prophecies involving Sham (greater Syria); the string of victories in Iraq in June that gave a sense of backing a winner; the resonance of the concept of the caliphate; and sophisticated use by ISIS of social media. At the same time, ISIS has triggered a bigger backlash than ever seen before in the Indonesian Muslim community, suggesting that support will <b>stay</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a fringe of the radical fringe. The individuals involved are nonetheless dangerous, and it is cause for concern that inmates of high security prisons continue to be among the most active propagators of ISIS views and teachings. Indonesian prison management has improved in recent years, but there is a long way to go. The incoming Jokowi government will have to decide whether to continue the counter-terrorism policies of the Yudhoyono government or ramp them up, including by pressing for strengthened legal tools. Either way, it is critical that leadership of the counter-terrorism effort be left in the hands of the police, who over the last decade have accumulated all the institutional knowledge of radical networks...|$|E

However solving the TSR problem is difficult as the underlying optimization problem is NP-hard,but it is also crucial for vendors interested in reducing the time to market of new software releases. In this paper, we address regression testing and TSR with Constraint Programming (CP). More specifically, we propose new CP models to solve TSR that exploit global constraints, namely NValue and GCC. We reuse a set of preprocessing rules to reduce a priori each instance,and we introduce a structure-aware search heuristic. We evaluated our CP models and proposed improvements against existing approaches, including a simple greedy approach and MINTS,the state-of-the-art tool of the software engineering community. Our experiments show that CP outperforms both the greedy approach and MINTS when it is interfaced with MiniSAT, in terms of percentage of reduction and execution time.

For wearable robotic systems, which are subject <b>to</b> joint <b>limits,</b> it is desirable to relate the joint <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> the redundantly of the system. A brief review of the arm model, redundant space and kinematics is presented. Following this review a closed form method is developed calculate the interval of the swivel angle (which characterizes the redundancy) that produces arm configurations that <b>stay</b> within joint <b>limits.</b> I...|$|R
