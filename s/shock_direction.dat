We predict that, for mechanical shocks {{between 3 and 7}} GPa, RDX is most sensitive to shocks perpendicular to the (100) and (210) planes, whereas it is insensitive for shocks perpendicular to the (120), (111), and (110) planes. These results are all consistent with available experimental information, further validating the CS-RD model for distinguishing between sensitive and insensitive <b>shock</b> <b>directions.</b> We find that, for sensitive <b>directions,</b> the <b>shock</b> impact triggers a slip system that leads to large shear stresses arising from steric hindrance, causing increased energy inputs that increase the temperature, leading to dramatically increased chemical reactions. Thus, our simulations demonstrate that the molecular origin of anisotropic shock sensitivity results from steric hindrance toward shearing of adjacent slip planes during shear deformation. Thus, strain energy density, temperature rise, and molecule decomposition are effective measures to distinguish anisotropic sensitivities. We should emphasize that CS-RD has been developed as a tool to distinguish rapidly (within a few picoseconds) between sensitive and insensitive <b>shock</b> <b>directions</b> of energetic materials.

Analysis of resolved shear stress induced by uniaxial compression along three shock directions normal to (110), (011), and (010) planes leads to identify eight slip systems as candidates for shear deformation. For {{each of the}} eight slip systems, non-equilibrium reactive dynamics simulations were carried out to determine thermal, mechanical, and chemical responses to shear deformation. <b>Shock</b> <b>direction</b> normal to (010) plane exhibits large shear stress barriers arising from steric hindrance between molecules of adjacent layers leading to local dramatic energy and temperature increases under shear flow that in turn accelerate chemical bond breaking and initial product formation processes, promoting further molecular decomposition and eventually transition to detonation. This suggests that single crystal β-HMX is sensitive to shocks in direction normal to (010) plane. Shock directions normal to (110) and (011) planes reveal significantly less steric hindrance, leading to more modest energy and temperature increases followed by slower chemical reaction initiation. Thus, shock directions normal to (110) and (011) planes are less sensitive than <b>shock</b> <b>direction</b> normal to (010) plane, which agree with interpretations from currently available plate impact experiments on HMX.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to characterize the evolution of plastic deformation mechanisms in single crystal and nanocrystalline Cu models during shock by atomistic simulations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed {{for a range of}} particle velocities from 0. 5 to 1. 7 km/s and initial temperatures of 5, 300 and 600 K for single crystal models as well as particle velocities from 1. 5 to 3. 4 km/s for nanocrystalline models with grain diameters of 6, 11, 16 and 26 nm. For single crystal models, four different <b>shock</b> <b>directions</b> are selected, 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e, 3 ̆c 1103 ̆e, 3 ̆c 1113 ̆e and 3 ̆c 3213 ̆e, and dislocation density behind the shock wave front generally increases with increasing particle velocity for all shock orientations. Plastic relaxation for shock in the 3 ̆c 1103 ̆e, 3 ̆c 1113 ̆e and 3 ̆c 3213 ̆e directions is primarily due to a reduction in the Shockley partial dislocation density. In contrast, plastic relaxation is limited for shock in the 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e orientation. This is partially due to the emergence of sessile stair-rod dislocations with Burgers vectors of 1 / 33 ̆c 1003 ̆e and 1 / 63 ̆c 1103 ̆e due to the reaction of Shockley partial dislocations with twin boundaries and stacking fault intersections. For 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e shock, FCC Cu is uniaxially compressed towards the BCC structure behind the shock wave front; this process is more favorable at higher shock pressures and temperatures. For particle velocities above 0. 9 km/s, regions of HCP crystal structure nucleate from uniaxially compressed Cu. Free energy calculations proves that the nucleation and growth of these HCP clusters are an artifact of the embedded-atom interatomic potential. In addition, simulated x-ray diffraction line profiles are created for 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e shock models of single crystal Cu at the Hugoniot state. Generally, peak broadening in the x-ray diffraction line profiles increases with increasing particle velocity. For nanocrystalline models, the compression of the FCC lattice towards the BCC structure is more apparent at particle velocity of 2. 4 km/s, and at this particle velocity, the atomic percentage of BCC structure increases with increasing grain size. The observation of BCC structure strongly depends on grain orientation; grains with 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e directions closely aligned with the <b>shock</b> loading <b>direction</b> show a higher percentage of BCC structure...|$|R

Shocks with a damping ratio of 0. 4 were presented with both polarities. Each type of shock was presented at five unweighted vibration dose values (0. 35 – 2. 89 m s? 1. 75). The magnitude estimates of 15 subjects to all 400 shocks showed that the rate of growth in discomfort (the exponent in Stevens’ power law) decreased with increasing shock frequency from 0. 5 to 4 Hz. Equivalent comfort contours showed greatest sensitivity from 4 to 12. 5 Hz. At lower magnitudes, variations in discomfort with frequency were similar to weighting Wb in British Standard 6841.

40|$|We report {{experimental}} determinations of {{the elastic}} {{component of the}} transverse strain during passage of a shockwave. A 1 ns laser pulse drove an 60 kbar shock into an aluminum coated, radiation hardened, pure LiF single crystal. By diffracting a 0. 25 ns pulse of x rays from a nearby high brightness, time-synchronized laser plasma, we measured the simultaneous compression of the lattice both parallel and transverse to the <b>shock</b> propagation <b>direction</b> with subnanosecond resolution. Definite compression was recorded in the inertially confined transverse direction, indicating the onset of plastic lattice response. Peak strains were of comparable magnitude in the orthogonal directions, but were not equal. © 1995 The American Physical Society...|$|R
