50|$|The {{focal point}} of the synagogue is the {{clam-shell}} topped arch {{at the center of the}} building. This was the location of the Torah Ark. In many synagogues found throughout the Jewish Diaspora and what is now Israel, the clam shell is a marker for the place where the ark should be placed.

The designers anticipated a 500-year flood of 120,000 cusecs (3398 m3/s). As a result, the spillway was designed with a capacity of 150,000 cusecs (4247 m3/s).|$|E
5000|$|The main use of {{the unit}} is to flatten out {{deformed}} press belts whilst simultaneously stress-relieving the belt material. The small size and low weight makes the unit flexible to use and easy to bring into and operate in field situations. All of the equipment needed (excluding the carriage frame and the air compressor) can be packed into a box with dimensions of about: 350mm L * 350mm W * 320mm. Total weight including blaster, valve, air hose and miscellaneous components is around 25kg and the blasting machine itself weights only 9kg. One pair of universal channel (38mm * 76mm [...] ) must be provided on site - the length usually being 500mm longer than the belt width. The channels are welded together so that the blaster can easily run through the frame {{across the face of}} the belt. The total installation time, including the manufacture of the carriage frame, is limited to just a few hours after which the peening process can begin. On the inlet air hose an electric shut-off valve is mounted to protect the belt from over-blasting should the belt suddenly stop during the blasting operation. To be effective the valve solenoid must be connected / interlocked to the press machine's power supply (240 V). For best blasting results an air supply of 4200 litre per min is required at a pressure of 6 bar. A flexible air hose is supplied with the unit which is to be connected between the blasting unit and the local air supply. All local supply pipes should have a minimum bore diameter of 1". The recommended shot blasting medium is tungsten shot (beads) with diameter ranging from 0.2-0.4 mm having a hardness exceeding 40 HRC. The machine operates by drawing a quantity of tungsten shot {{from the bottom of the}} <b>scroll</b> <b>case</b> into the high velocity nozzles. The shot is blasted onto the surface of the belt and most of the shot bounces back into the <b>scroll</b> <b>case.</b> The air is vented through the filter socks and any shot carried with the air is filtered out and drops back into the <b>scroll</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

50|$|Terry {{envisioned a}} new kind of clock, {{intended}} for mass production from machine-made parts that would come from water-powered machines ready to go into clocks without any additional hand cutting by skilled workmen. This would be a shelf clock, costing less than a tall clock. It would be made quickly and be easily repaired. Terry's further innovations included the design of an escapement with removable verge. This later became a standard design feature of American clocks for the following century.The mass-produced wooden clocks manufactured from interchangeable parts that poured from Terry's factory beginning in 1814 were the world's first mass-produced machines made of interchangeable parts. As such he would mass market an affordable, complete cased-clock to American consumers. Terry's first clocks were offered in plain wooden box cases. Terry is also credited with the design of the pillar and <b>scroll</b> <b>case.</b> In his autobiography, History of the American Clock Business for the Past Sixty Years and Life of Chauncey Jerome, Terry's employee and assistant Chauncey Jerome, later a great clockmaker and owner of the world's largest clock factory, mentions building the first pillar and scroll in Terry's workshop with the master's design and under his direction. The pillar and <b>scroll</b> <b>case</b> provided a large, clear dial in a wooden case about thirty inches tall and six inches deep. The upper part was the clock face, the lower part was either a mirror or a picture back-painted on glass. Despite the small size of the clocks compared with traditional long case clocks, Terry was able to provide sufficient power through gearing for the clock to run a full thirty hours before it needed to be rewound. Anticipating a successful product Terry had the foresight to patent his arrangement of clockworks. At least five patents were issued to him through the years up to 1825 in order to protect his invention.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ruins of}} Fossoway Abbey are {{supposed}} to conceal the legendary treasure of the Chelford family, sought by Harry Chelford, last of his line, with fanatical zeal. Due to a hereditary disease, he is liable to fall victim to insanity at any time. His fiancee, Leslie Gine, is more attracted to Dick Alford, Harry's cousin and steward at Chelford Manor. Meanwhile, her brother Arthur, a London lawyer is being blackmailed by his chief clerk Gilder, who wants Leslie for himself. Gilder has purchased some bills of exchange on which Arthur forged the signature of Lord Chelford {{to pay for his}} own gambling debts. There is also the 'Black Abbot', a mysterious figure who is seen moving about in the old ruin and supposedly guards the treasure. Inspector Puddler of Scotland Yard and his assistant Horatio are called in when a man is found stabbed to death and they try to solve the mystery. Among the suspects is the butler Fortuna who Puddler recognizes as a former inmate of Dartmoor prison. Mary Wenner, who used to be secretary of Lord Chelford (and an aspirant to become his wife), joins forces with Gilder to find the treasure. They manage to discover some <b>scroll</b> <b>cases</b> containing maps of the abbey but are driven off by the Black Abbot. They later return to find the maps gone. Wenner is shot and killed by Arthur Gine, who himself is later killed in a confrontation with Gilder. Leslie Gine calls off the wedding with Lord Chelford. Lord Chelford, plagued by his deteriorating sanity completely loses his grip on reality when he encounters his mother (whom he believes to be dead) in the grounds of the manor. Lord Chelford shoots his mother and the Black Abbot, takes Leslie as a hostage and hides with her in the tunnels beneath the abbey after also killing Gilder. It turns out there have been two Black Abbots: one was the butler working as an agent for Gilder, the other was Alford, working with the family doctor Loxon to care for the insane Lady Chelford whom they had kept hidden from her son. There is a shoot-out with the police and Lord Chelford is killed by a cave-in. Among the stones falling on the last Lord Chelford are some chests that contain the treasure.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{objective}} of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility fiber-reinforced turbine components through a design and manufacturing study. The motivation for using composites is to reduce weight and simplify manufacturing especially at high production volumes. In addition, natural fiber composites are implemented for applicable components to reduce environmental impact. Existing steel designs provided by major manufacturers are used as models. These are re-designed using composite materials, maintaining original geometry as much as possible. The components selected for composite design are the turbine penstock, <b>scroll</b> <b>case,</b> guide vanes, runner (impeller) and draft tube. In addition, {{the design of a}} composite fish ladder is presented to show the application of composites to other elements of hydroelectric power. Once the structural and mechanical design was complete, material and manufacturing costs were analyzed. The choice of materials was based upon loading requirements, the runner required a high strength random reinforcement carbon fiber sheet molding compound (SMC) while a glass fabric and rovings provided adequate strength for the guide vanes, <b>scroll</b> <b>case,</b> penstock and outer walls of the fish ladder while minimizing the cost. A flax fabric was selected for the design of the draft tube additionally using a bio-based PLA resin. The inner sections of the fish ladder use a flax fabric and polypropylene pultrusion. Manufacturing methods for each were selected based on geometry and cost. The complex shape of the runner was most easily formed using compression molding, which also reduced the cost as compared to hand lay up. A comparison between hand lay up and vacuum infusion was completed for the guide vanes and <b>scroll</b> <b>case.</b> Hand lay up was chosen for the draft tube as it is the most commercially proven method for the manufacture of components using natural fibers. Filament winding, the method used for the penstock would be the ideal method of manufacture but it has yet to be completed in a commercial setting with natural fibers. Results show the cost of most parts is dominated by tooling (molds) for the components as the research focused on a small run of ten parts, assumed to be for research and testing purposes. However, the contribution of tooling can be cut in half if the run size is doubled. The design and manufacturing analysis does support the use of composite materials in hydroelectric turbines and the costs associated with their manufacture are within reasonable parameters for industry...|$|E

The following paper covers the four years of condition monitoring, defect analysis and risk studies that were carried out on the rotor spider prior to the complex physical works of replacing a rotor spider arm. The paper will also cover, in brief, the physical works carried out during the rotor arm replacement.

Meridian Energy Assets Meridian Energy is the largest state owned electricity generator in New Zealand. It owns and operates nine hydro stations in the South Island, New Zealand's largest wind farm in the North Island, and a wind turbine in Wellington. The hydro assets are broken up in to the Waitaki Valley and Manapouri. The Waitaki scheme consists of eight power stations containing 32 generating units ranging in size from 15 MW to 90 MW. The Manapouri scheme consists of one station and seven 135 MVA units. Hydro units generate electricity by harnessing the gravitational potential energy available from the water.

The {{shape of}} a hydro-electric (hydel) power station {{particularly}} the concrete around spiral case and generator foundation is so complex that the determination of actual stresses is very complicated and time-consuming process since it is essentially a three-dimensional problem. The stress variations in the structure have been studied using three-dimensional photoelastic method in few small scale models only. In the present study, finite element and boundary element analyses of spiral (<b>scroll)</b> <b>case</b> and generator foundation of a large hydel power station considering generator loads {{have been carried out}}. A simple and efficient method of slices for the geometric representation of the structure has been developed. Linear elastic analyses have been carried out using well established existing finite element and boundary element computer programs and two pre-processing computer programs have also been developed to support the 3 -D finite element program. Almost all of the present analyses show the same pattern of stresses and only their values differ, while most of the existing photoelastic study results indicate stresses with different pattern. In conclusion, a suitable, efficient and appropriate numerical method for the approximate analysis of the structure has been proposed...|$|E
