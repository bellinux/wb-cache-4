5|$|The {{concept for}} the music video {{is based on the}} lyrics and {{presented}} as a typical Friday for Black. She wakes up and goes to school, meeting her friends on the way. In the evening, after debating whether to sit in the front or back of a convertible, Black and her friends ride the car to a party at 7:45 pm. Patrice Wilson appears {{near the end of the}} song to deliver a short rap. The video was shot on January 6, 2011 at Black's father's house with friends and family as extras, and requiring multiple takes over 12 hours. Some of those extras became stars in their own right; her friends Benni Cinkle, Amanda Cooper and Hayley Grodt. Ark Music, according to Black's parents, cautioned them and her that they <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> her to become famous. Black hoped that her friends and family would enjoy watching the video on YouTube and that it would perhaps help her to later begin a singing career.|$|E

25|$|All {{models are}} {{simplified}} abstractions of the real-life situation. There exists a basic tradeoff between model precision and parameter precision. A fixed {{amount of information}} collected, will, if split amongst the many parameters of an overly precise model, result {{in at least some}} of the parameters being represented by inadequate sample sizes. Because of the often limited quantities and limited precision of data from which to calculate parameters values in non-human behavior studies, such models should generally be kept simple. Therefore, we generally <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> models for social insect task allocation or task partitioning to be as elaborate as human workflow ones, for example.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} on 11 March, Gilbert Bawara, the Minister of Cooperation, criticized Fabre. He said that Fabre <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> the Togolese people to trust him {{when he did not}} trust others, and he argued that Fabre's claims of victory were ridiculous, noting that Fabre initially claimed a score of 7580% but later claimed a lesser figure of 5560%. According to Bawara, Gnassingbé would consider the fact that Fabre had received a respectable number of votes; Bawara observed that Fabre's score of 34% was particularly impressive because he had not been envisioned as a presidential candidate before January 2010. However, he also said that Fabre lacked experience and did not do serious work in the National Assembly.|$|E

Proudfoot’s immediate influence on programming was to drop a plan to broadcast a mixture of light music and lifestyle material in favour of a simple Top 40 format. A 30-year-old, 150 tonne fishing vessel named Oceaan 7 was acquired and fitted out with a 10kW radio transmitter for a total cost of £75,000. The radio station was named Radio 270 and it was run from Proudfoot’s business headquarters in Scalby Road, Scarborough. Oceaan 7 was registered in Honduras in the name of Radio 270's programme director Noel Miller (an Australian national).|$|E

25|$|Normally, {{the face}} is in the water during front crawl with eyes looking at {{the lower part of}} the wall in front of the pool, with the {{waterline}} between the brow line and the hairline. Breaths are taken through the mouth by turning the head to the side of a recovering arm at the beginning of the recovery, and breathing in the triangle between the upper arm, lower arm, and the waterline. The swimmer's forward movement will cause a bow wave with a trough in the water surface near the ears. After turning the head, a breath can be taken in this trough without the need to move the mouth above the average water surface. A thin film of water running down the head can be blown away just before the intake. The head is rotated back at the end of the recovery and points down and forward again when the recovered hand enters the water. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose until the next breath. Breathing out through the nose may help to prevent water from entering the nose. Swimmers with allergies exacerbated by time in the pool <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> exhaling through the nose to completely prevent intranasal irritation.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

Following the film's US release in 1934, The New York Times commented that it [...] "carr most of the comedy of the original" [...] but was [...] "rather weak on the musical side", {{despite the presence of}} stars such as Novotná. Opera-lovers, the review suggested, <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> too much, but the work nevertheless gave an attractive portrait of Bohemian village life in the mid-19th century. The reviewer found most of the acting first-rate, but commented that [...] "the photography and sound reproduction are none too clear at times." [...] Other film adaptations of the opera were made in 1922 directed by Oldrich Kminek (Atropos), in 1933, directed by Jaroslav Kvapil, Svatopluk Innemann and Emil Pollert (Espofilm), and in 1976, directed by Václav Kašlík (Barrandov).

The singer continued to state that [...] "the industry isn't 'Parent's 'R Us and that singers [...] "have the freedom to create art". In an interview for BET, Rihanna further explain why rape {{was used as the}} vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying [...] "Making that into a mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened. Obviously she's not a cold-blooded killer. It had to be something so offensive.

2500|$|Some Christians {{assert that}} the Bible is free from error only in {{religious}} and moral matters, and that, where scientific or historic questions are concerned, the Bible should not be read literally. This position is held {{by a number of}} major denominations. For instance, in a publication entitled The Gift of Scripture, the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales comments that, [...] "We <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to find in Scripture full scientific accuracy or complete historical precision". The Bible is held to be true in passages relating to human salvation, but, [...] "We <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> total accuracy from the Bible in other, secular matters". While the Catholic Church teaches that the Bible's message is without error, it does not consider it always to be literal. By contrast, young Earth creationists contend that moral and spiritual matters in the Bible are intimately connected with its historical accuracy; in their view, the Bible stands or falls as a single indivisible block of knowledge.|$|E

[...] The Court states, [...] "If all that was required to overcome the right {{to keep and bear arms}} was a rational basis, the Second Amendment would be redundant with the separate constitutional prohibitions on irrational laws, and would have no effect."

2500|$|It was Serling's {{decision}} {{to sell his}} share of the series back to the network that eventually allowed for a Twilight Zone revival. As an in-house production, CBS stood to earn more money producing The Twilight Zone than it could by purchasing a new series produced by an outside company. Even so, the network was slow to consider a revival, shooting down offers from the original production team of Rod Serling and Buck Houghton and later from American filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Their hesitation stemmed from concerns familiar to the original series: The Twilight Zone had never been the breakaway hit CBS wanted, so they <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> it to do better in a second run. [...] "We were looking at the success of the original series in syndication and the enormous popularity of the Steven Spielberg films," [...] said CBS program chief Harvey Shepard.

But in the evening of that hopeful day, Thursday, July 30, with Berlin's strenuous efforts to persuade Vienna to some form of negotiation, and with Bethmann Hollweg still awaiting a response from Berchtold, Russia gave the order for full mobilization. When the German Emperor learned that, were Germany to attack France and Russia, Britain would in all likelihood not remain neutral, he launched a vehement rant, denouncing Britain as [...] "that filthy nation of grocers."

[...] The series was reviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Afternoon Edition, where TV critic Emma Bullimore from TV Times said that it was [...] "enjoyable" [...] but more [...] "soapy" [...] and less [...] "complex" [...] than Broadchurch, and said that viewers <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> it to be like EastEnders or Broadchurch but should [...] "accept it as a new thing", adding that it had good production values and deemed it a [...] "worthy experiment". Sinéad Garvan from Newsbeat, speaking at the same time, said that she found it [...] "weird" [...] seeing Kat and Alfie in a different setting and was more intrigued by the new characters but said that that Kat and Alfie still had the same chemistry that they have in EastEnders.|$|E
