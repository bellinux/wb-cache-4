40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns the behaviour of isolated piles subjected to repeated loading and placed at various depths in a medium dense sand upon which either static or cyclic surcharge acted. The piles, which were of laboratory scale, were instrumented by strain gauged load cells located along the inner surfaces of the pile shafts. The behaviour of tension as well as compression piles was examined. It {{was found that the}} behaviour of the pile was governed to a large extent by the repeated load level, the number of load cycles and the initial boundary stress conditions existing along the pile shaft. In compression, the pile life-span decreased when the embedment depth increased while the reverse trend was observed,for tension piles. The movement of both tension and compression piles decreased when the surcharge pressure was increased or was cycled, and it was of a minimum value when the upper repeated load acted in-phase with the higher surcharge pressure. For tests performed with static surcharge pressure, repeated loading was found to decrease the bearing capacity and the pulling resistance of the pile. The higher percentage of reduction was recorded for the tension pile. In contrast, after cyclic surcharge tests the pile capacity always increased. At any depth of embedment or surcharge pressure,' as the nun-her of load cycles was increased the <b>shaft</b> <b>load</b> of a compression pile increased up to a peak value then decreased gradually until it reached a limiting value.

40|$|An {{unsteady}} {{and strong}} vortical propeller wake can have significant interaction {{with a body}} in its race. Since the pod and strut is located downstream an operation propeller for a tractor-type podded propeller, it faces risks of earlier cavitation on the strut, severe vibration of the pod unit, and noise of the propulsor. The aim of this work {{is to develop a}} prediction method for the pressure fluctuation {{on the surface of the}} pod and strut. [...] The study consists of two parts, experimental and numerical. In the experimental study, a podded propeller was tested in a cavitation tunnel. The tip-vortex interacting with the strut was visually investigated, and the strut surface pressure and the propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>loads</b> were measured. By using a data processing procedure, the load and pressure measurements were broken down into time-averaged and phase-averaged components. These components were then linked to the steady and dynamic performance of the propulsor. Pressure measurements showed that the low time-averaged pressure was concentrated in the area around the leading edge of the strut. The lowest pressure was located on the strut suction side near the junction of the strut and pod. However, the largest amplitude of the phase-averaged pressure occurred on the strut leading edge where the tip-vortex impacts the strut. Based on measurement of the propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>loads,</b> the wake impingement effect on the propeller performance was evaluated. The evaluation was made by comparing the <b>shaft</b> <b>loads</b> measured in two tests with and without the installation of the pod and the strut. These showed that wake impingement had no significant effect on the propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>loads,</b> neither on the steady component nor the dynamic components. [...] In the numerical study, a Wake Impingement Model (WIM) was developed and inserted into a panel code, PROPELLA. Simulations of the pressure variation on the strut surface were then conducted using the software. The WIM starts from the relaxed and aligned propeller wake. The motion of the wake sheet was traced step by step. For each time step, every wake panel moved from its previous location to a new position. The new position was determined by the product of the time interval and the local induced velocity. When the wake approached the strut, a scheme was applied to keep the wake from penetrating the body surface. To avoid the large numerical disturbance resulting when two dipole panels get too close, the two dipole panels were merged before the calculation of influence coefficients. Numerical simulations on the same tractor-type podded propeller as that in the experimental study were conducted. Although the amplitude of the pressure fluctuation in the tip-vortex/strut interaction zone was under-predicted, comparisons of the numerical results with the experimental data indicated that the simulated pressure was in good agreement over most of the impingement area. Both experimental and numerical studies with the WIM show that WI has insignificant (around 2 %) effects on the propeller thrust and torque...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel methodology {{for evaluation of}} in service loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions. It also {{presents a}} novel methodology of data reduction for <b>shaft</b> <b>load</b> signals {{as an alternative to}} the cycle counting methods. Current durability testing of automatic transmission output shafts uses 50 000 stall torque cycles from zero to wide open throttle. In the majority of cases, these requirements lead to an over design that can result in an unnecessarily bulky transmission system. As a solution to this problem a novel methodology for evaluation of loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions was developed. The methodology is based on real world loading conditions and therefore leads to a more realistic estimation of the fatigue life of shafts. The methodology can be used as a tool for shaft optimisation in different drive conditions. Using the developed methodology the effects of different road conditions on the fatigue life of a transmission output shaft were compared. Four routes having differing driving conditions were investigated and of those routes, the route with most stop-start events resulted in the greatest reduction in fatigue life. A novel methodology of data reduction for <b>shaft</b> <b>load</b> signals was also developed. The methodology is based on knowledge of the bandwidth and dynamic range of the expected in-service load signal. This novel methodology allows significant reduction of the volume of data to be acquired. It preserves the time sequence of peaks and valleys of the signal, which is vital in the case of fatigue analysis. This is in contrast to current methods based on cycle counting. Cycle counting methods achieve high data reduction but do not preserve the time sequence of the signal. The developed novel methodology has been validated on the newly developed data acquisition system capable of real time data acquisition and compression of shaft torque signal. The performed tests show that the proposed one-channel low cost system equipped with 1 GB compact flash card can store well over 10 000 hrs of load history...|$|E

In the turbofan mode with the VIGV open fuel consumption was comparable to that of a conventional turbofan engine. In the turboshaft mode with the VIGV closed fuel consumption was higher than that of present turboshaft engines because power was wasted in churning fan-tip airflow.

The analyses, specifically developed for load resistance factor design (LRFD) designed drilled shaft foundations, were designed to compare the fiscal impacts of the drilling and sampling, in-field and laboratory testing, full-scale load testing, and concrete mixing techniques utilized by the University of Arkansas (UofA), the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD), and the Missouri Department of Transportation (MODOT). The methodologies were compared at three test site locations within the state of Arkansas: Siloam Springs, AR, Turrell, AR, and Monticello, AR. These sites were selected to represent the predominant geological deposits within the state. Three drilled shaft foundations (two four-foot diameter drilled shafts and one six-foot diameter drilled shaft) were each constructed at the Siloam Springs Arkansas Test Site (SSATS) and the Turrell Arkansas Test Site (TATS). A drilled shaft database was developed containing soil properties, and predicted and measured results of the full-scale load tests performed upon each drilled shaft. Cost-benefit analyses for each methodology were compared by means of predicted and measured static axial capacity. Values of predicted axial capacity were generated for each methodology using the Bridge Software Institute FB-Deep, Ensoft SHAFTv 2012, and Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet programs.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on {{developing}} control and system integration solutions to achieve rapid and reliable load following operation of solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine (SOFC/GT) systems for mobile applications. Both the traditional recuperating-SOFC/GT system and the newly proposed sprinter-SOFC/GT system are studied through model-based methodologies. It is shown that solutions developed in this research could enhance system performance and meet operating objectives. For the recuperating system, the generator/motor (G/M) dual mode operation and its implications are investigated. Active <b>shaft</b> <b>load</b> control is used to manage transients by: (a) pre-conditioning of G/M power for load step-up transients; and (b) absorbing the excessive power through motoring operation for load step-down transients. Feedback and optimization algorithms are developed. By {{taking advantage of the}} dual operating G/M, better trade-offs between power tracking and thermal safety can be achieved, the battery requirements can be reduced and system performance can be enhanced. The sprinter-SOFC/GT system, which has far superior load following capability than traditional systems, is proposed in this research. In the system, the SOFC operated at constant temperature provides only the baseline power with high efficiency while the GT-generator’s transient capability will be fully explored for fast dynamic load following. System design and control framework suited for the proposed system are investigated. An SOFC operational strategy is derived to keep fairly constant SOFC power and temperature over the entire load range. A design procedure is also developed to determine various component sizes. The “actual” operational envelope is determined by integrating the SOFC power/temperature constraints with safety factors. An optimization problem is proposed to determine the optimal feed-forward operation map. Control analysis and feedback design are presented for the sprinter system.
