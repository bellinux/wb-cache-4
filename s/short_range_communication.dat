40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis reports the design, performance evaluation {{and construction of}} a transmitting antenna for an HF communications probe system. A <b>short</b> <b>range</b> ionospheric <b>communication</b> link between Monterey, CA, (transmit site) and San Diego, CA, (receive site) was established to test the software and hardware of this probe system. The Multiband Dipole Antenna {{was selected as the}} more practical antenna for this link, using less real estate and support structure than other alternatives. The antenna was constructed and installed at the NPS beach site where the ground constants were measured accurately. Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC) analysis and measurements show that the antenna operates with low input VSWR (< 1. 5), is insensitive to electrical ground characteristics and has excellent radiation patterns for <b>short</b> <b>range</b> ionospheric <b>communication</b> links. Based on the observed signal strengths at San Diego, the antenna appears to be performing very well. [URL] Hellenic Nav...|$|R

Some airborne units were associated with the strategic reconnaissance units of Strategic Air Command, and flew aboard SAC (and non-SAC) reconnaissance flights to collect data from <b>shorter</b> <b>range</b> <b>communication</b> systems and other types of signals.

IEEE 802. 11 p is a new real-time <b>short</b> <b>range</b> wireless <b>communication</b> standard for vehicles, so a new method is proposed to estimate the time delay or ranges between vehicles based on the IEEE 802. 11 p standard which includes three main steps: cross-correlation between the received signal and the short preamble, summing up the correlated results in groups, and finding the maximum peak using a dynamic threshold based on the skewness analysis. With the range between each vehicle or road-side infrastructure, the position of neighboring vehicles can be estimated correctly.
