40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that Stu 2 p is a microtubule-binding protein and {{a component of}} the Saccharomyces cerevisiae spindle pole body (SPB). Here we report the identification of Spc 72 p, a protein that interacts with Stu 2 p. Stu 2 p and Spc 72 p associate in the two-hybrid system and can be coimmunoprecipitated from yeast extracts. Stu 2 p and Spc 72 p also interact with themselves, suggesting the possibility of a multimeric Stu 2 p-Spc 72 p complex. Spc 72 p is an essential component of the SPB and is able to associate with a preexisting SPB, indicating that there is a dynamic exchange between soluble and SPB forms of Spc 72 p. Unlike Stu 2 p, Spc 72 p does not bind microtubules in vitro, and was not observed to localize along microtubules in vivo. A temperature-sensitive spc 72 mutation causes defects in SPB morphology. In addition, most spc 72 mutant cells lack cytoplasmic microtubules; the few cytoplasmic microtubules that are observed are excessively long, and some of these are unattached to the SPB. spc 72 cells are able to duplicate and separate their SPBs to form a bipolar spindle, but spindle elongation and chromosome segregation rarely occur. The chromosome <b>segregation</b> <b>block</b> does not arrest the cell cycle; instead, spc 72 cells undergo cytokinesis, producing aploid cells and polyploid cells that contain multiple SPBs...|$|E

Two other bisdioxopiperazine derivatives, probimane (Pro) and MST- 16, were synthesized at the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. Cytotoxic activities and mechanisms of Raz (+) -steroisomer (ICRF- 187, dexrazoxane), Pro and MST- 16 against tumor cells were evaluated by MTT colorimetry, flow cytometry and karyotyping. Results Pro was cytotoxic to human tumor cell lines in vitro (IC 50 50 values 50 against HeLa cell line of vincristine (VCR, 4. 56 μM), doxorubicin (Dox, 1. 12 μM) and 5 -fluoruouracil (5 -Fu, 0. 232 μM) are lower than Pro (5. 12 μM), ICRF- 187 (129 μM) and MST- 16 (26. 4 μM), VCR, Dox and 5 -Fu shows a low dose-related – high cytotoxic activity. Time-response studies showed that the cytotoxic effects of Pro are increased for 3 days in human tumor cells, whereas VCR, Dox and 5 -Fu showed decreased cytotoxic action after 24 h. Cell cycle G 2 /M phase arrest and chromosome <b>segregation</b> <b>blocking</b> by Pro and MST- 16 were noted. Although there was similar effects of Pro and MST- 16 on chromosome <b>segregation</b> <b>blocking</b> action and cell cycle G 2 /M phase arrest at 1 - 4 μM, cytotoxicity of Pro against tumor cells was {{higher than that of}} MST- 16 in vitro by a factor of 3 - 10 folds. Our data show that Pro may be more effective against lung cancer and leukemia while ICRF- 187 and MST- 16 shows similar IC 50 values only against leukemia. Conclusion It suggests that Pro has a wider spectrum of cytotoxic effects against human tumor cells than other bisdioxopiperazines, especially against solid tumors, and with a single cytotoxic pathway of Pro and MST- 16 affecting chromosome segregation and leading also to cell G 2 / M phase arrests, which finally reduces cell division rates. Pro may be more potent than MST- 16 in cytotoxicity. High dose- and time- responses of Pro, when compared with VCR, 5 -Fu and Dox, were seen that suggest a selectivity of Pro against tumor growth. Compounds of bisdioxopiperazines family may keep up their cytotoxic effects longer than many other anticancer drugs. </p...|$|R

Furthermore at sufficiently high concentration, micelles are found to form clusters due to their mutual attraction.

40|$|Sexually {{reproducing}} organisms {{employ a}} specialized cell division called meiosis to form unique, haploid gametes from a diploid precursor cell. Upon fertilization, two opposite-sex gametes fuse {{to create a}} zygote that will develop into the offspring. Fundamental to meiosis is the formation and repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during prophase. These DSBs are repaired using the homologous chromosome (homolog) as a template for homologous recombination, which creates linkages between the homologs that are essential for faithful segregation. Following prophase, two successive rounds of chromosome segregation ensue. The first, meiosis I (MI), segregates homologs and the second, meiosis II (MII), segregates sister chromatids. Recombination is dependent on chromosome structure, and events that alter the DNA landscape will impact meiotic fidelity and, in turn, genomic integrity in gametes and future offspring. Thus understanding the relationship between chromosome structure and meiosis can help gain insight into human fertility and underlying causes of genetic disorders. It was {{the goal of this}} thesis to investigate factors known to regulate chromosome structure and determine their influence on meiosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mice. In addition, we tested a novel method to search for new mammalian meiotic factors that may impact fertility. In Paper I, we identified a role for the conserved Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) 5 / 6 complex during meiotic recombination in budding yeast. smc 5 / 6 complex mutants experienced a DSB-dependent <b>segregation</b> <b>block,</b> suggesting that the defect was caused by recombination. Consistent with this notion, Smc 6 -deficient cells accumulated high levels of recombination intermediates, particularly between sister chromatids, which is normally not seen in the wild type. Return-to-function studies indicated that the Smc 5 / 6 complex was most crucial during resolution of recombination intermediates. These results suggest that the Smc 5 / 6 complex works primarily in the resolution of recombination structures formed outside of homolog-directed pathways during meiosis. We characterized a role for DNA topoisomerases Top 2 and Top 3 during meiosis in S. cerevisiae by using meiosis-specific mutants in Paper II. Cells deficient for either Top 2 or Top 3 experienced a <b>segregation</b> <b>block.</b> While top 3 cells were rescued completely by removing recombination, the top 2 mutant was only partially rescued. This suggests that Top 3 mainly functions during meiotic recombination. In contrast, the data indicates that Top 2 has a role outside of recombination. In line with this idea, some of the segregation defects in cells lacking Top 2 seemed to arise from break-independent sister entanglements. Since Top 2 is known to be important in resolving sister chromatid intertwinings during mitosis to facilitate proper segregation, it is likely that it plays a similar role during meiosis. The CCCTC-binding factor (CCTF) is an architectural protein essential for proper genome structure and function in higher eukaryotes. In Paper III, we created a testes- specific ctcf mouse mutant strain (cctf-cKO) in order to study the function of CTCF during gamete (sperm in males) formation in mice. CTCF-deficient mice completed meiosis and sperm specialization without any major abnormalities, though mice were infertile and had low sperm counts. Sperm from the ctcf-cKO had chromatin compaction defects, most likely due to lack of sperm-specific compaction factors. These findings indicate that CTCF is essential for proper chromatin organization during spermiogenesis and suggest that infertility in ctcf-cKO mice was a result of the chromatin defects in the sperm. Using a method called phylogenetic profiling in Paper IV, we showed that new meiotic factors can be discovered by clustering proteins according to their function...|$|E
40|$|Meiosis is a {{specialized}} cell division used by diploid organisms to form haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. Central to this reductive division is repair of endogenous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{induced by the}} meiosis-specific enzyme Spo 11. These DSBs are repaired in a process called homologous recombination using the sister chromatid or the homologous chromosome as a repair template, with the homolog being the preferred substrate during meiosis. Specific products of inter-homolog recombination, called crossovers, are essential for proper homolog segregation at the first meiotic nuclear division in budding yeast and mice. This study identifies an essential role for the conserved Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) 5 / 6 protein complex during meiotic recombination in budding yeast. Meiosis-specific smc 5 / 6 mutants experience a block in DNA segregation without hindering meiotic progression. Establishment and removal of meiotic sister chromatid cohesin are independent of functional Smc 6 protein. smc 6 mutants also have normal levels of DSB formation and repair. Eliminating DSBs rescues the <b>segregation</b> <b>block</b> in smc 5 / 6 mutants, suggesting that the complex has a function during meiotic recombination. Accordingly, smc 6 mutants accumulate high levels of recombination intermediates {{in the form of}} joint molecules. Many of these joint molecules are formed between sister chromatids, which is not normally observed in wild-type cells. The normal formation of crossovers in smc 6 mutants supports the notion that mainly inter-sister joint molecule resolution is impaired. In addition, return-to-function studies indicate that the Smc 5 / 6 complex performs its most important functions during joint molecule resolution without influencing crossover formation. These results suggest that the Smc 5 / 6 complex aids primarily in the resolution of joint molecules formed outside of canonical inter-homolog pathways...|$|E

40|$|Active layer nanomorphology is a {{major factor}} that determines the {{efficiency}} of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs). Synthesizing diblock copolymers in which acceptor and donor materials are the constituent blocks is the most recent method to control the structure of the active layer. In the current work, a computational method is proposed to predict the nanomorphology of the active layer consisting of a diblock copolymer. Diblock copolymers have a tendency to self-organize and form well-defined nanostructures. The shape of the structure depends on the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (i. e., 3 ̆c 7), the total degree of polymerization (N) and volume fractions of the constituent blocks (3 ̆c 6 i). In this work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to calculate 3 ̆c 7 parameters for two different block copolymers used in PSCs: P 3 HT-b-poly(S 8 A 2) -C 60 and P 3 HT-b-poly(n-butyl acrylate-stat-acrylate perylene) also known as P 3 HT-b-PPerAcr.

Using sub-millisecond lateral gradient laser spike annealing and microbeam grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering, the ordering and disordering kinetics of cylinder forming poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) were determined for peak annealing temperatures up to 550 °C for dwells (anneal durations) ranging from 250 μs to 10 ms. These temperatures, far {{in excess of the}} normal thermal decomposition limit, are enabled by the short time scales of laser annealing. From initially microphase-segregated films, disordering was observed near the equilibrium order–disorder transition temperature (TODT) for dwell times above 10 ms but was kinetically delayed by diffusion for shorter time scales, resulting in suppression of observed disordering by over 70 °C. The onset of ordering from initially disordered films was also kinetically limited for short dwells.

40|$|Objective: We {{examined}} {{the distribution of}} heat risk–related land cover (HRRLC) characteristics across racial/ethnic groups and degrees of residential <b>segregation.</b> Methods: <b>Block</b> group–level tree canopy and impervious surface estimates were derived from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset for densely populated urban areas of the United States and Puerto Rico, and linked to demographic characteristics from the 2000 Census. Racial/ethnic groups in a given block group were considered to live in HRRLC if at least half their population experienced the absence of tree canopy and {{at least half of}} the ground was covered by impervious surface (roofs, driveways, sidewalks, roads). Residential segregation was characterized for metropolitan areas in the United States and Puerto Rico using the multigroup dissimilarity index. Results: After adjustment for ecoregion and precipitation, holding segregation level constant, non- Hispanic blacks were 52 % more likely (95 % CI: 37 %, 69 %), non-Hispanic Asians 32 % more likely (95 % CI: 18 %, 47 %), and Hispanics 21 % more likely (95 % CI: 8 %, 35 %) to live in HRRLC conditions compared with non-Hispanic whites. Within each racial/ethnic group, HRRLC conditions increased with increasing degrees of metropolitan area-level segregation. Further adjustment for home ownership and poverty did not substantially alter these results, but adjustment for population density and metropolitan area population attenuated the segregation effects, suggesting a mediating or confounding role. Conclusions: Land cover was associated with segregation within each racial/ethnic group, which may be explained partly by the concentration of racial/ethnic minorities into densely populated neighborhoods within larger, more segregated cities. In anticipation of greater frequency and duration of extreme heat events, climate change adaptation strategies, such as planting trees in urban areas, should explicitly incorporate an environmental justice framework that addresses racial/ethnic disparities in HRRLC...|$|R
5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of <b>block</b> by <b>block</b> <b>segregation.</b> New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. In the postwar period, veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} poly(diethylhexyloxy-p-phenylenevinylene-b-methyl methacrylate) (DEH-PPV-b-PMMA) {{polymers}} with narrow polydispersity (PDI < 1. 1) were synthesized using Siegrist polycondensa-tion and anionic polymerizations followed by “click ” chemistry. Alkyne-terminated DEH-PPV and azido-terminated PMMA were synthesized first, {{and then the}} two functionalized polymers underwent 1, 3 -cycloaddition reaction to obtain copolymers. Both {{the conversion of the}} end-functionalization of the homopolymers and the yield of the “click ” reaction were higher than 98 % as determined by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Transmission electron micro-scopy (TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies reveal the details of copolymer morphology. TheDEH-PPV-b-PMMA system presented here has higher <b>block</b> <b>segregation</b> strength thanmany previously studied rod-coil block copolymers yet still shows experimentally accessible phase transitions with respect to temperature. As a result, thismolecule offers new insight into the competition between rod-rod and rod-coil interactions that occurs in the system. The DEH-PPV rods are organized as a monolayer that is inclined with the lamellar normal (smectic C) for the copolymers containing low volume fraction of PMMA coil (< 54 %). However, as the coil fraction increases, the strips containing DEH-PPV pack into hexagonal lattice. In contrast to previous work which demonstrated similar morphologies, the sequence of reversible liqui...|$|R
40|$|Herein, a facile water-assisted {{templating}} approach, {{the so-called}} breath figures method, has been employed to prepare multifunctional and hierarchically structured porous patterned films with order at different length scales (nano- and micrometer). Tetrahydrofuran solutions of ternary blends consisting on {{high molecular weight}} polystyrene, an amphiphilic block copolymer, polystyrene-b-poly[poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (PS(40) -b-P(PEGMA 300) (48)), and a fluorinated copolymer, polystyrene-b-poly(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorostyrene) (P 5 FS(21) -b-PS(31)), {{have been used to}} obtain films varying the proportion of the three components. Confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy demonstrated the preferential location of the different functionalities in the films. Because of the breath figures mechanism, the amphiphilic copolymer yield pores enriched in hydrophilic functionality while the fluorinated copolymer remained mixed with the PS matrix and eventually also forming self-assembled nanostructures at the surface. As a consequence, two levels of order can be observed, i. e., micrometer size pores with nanostructured domains due to the block copolymer self-assembly. In addition, the distribution of the amphiphilic copolymer within the holes is not regular being located principally on the edges of the cavities. This {{can be attributed to the}} coffee stain phenomenon occurring in the water droplets as a consequence of the <b>segregation</b> of the <b>block</b> copolymers to the droplets and their self-assembly...|$|R
40|$|All-conjugated block {{copolymers}} are {{an emerging}} class of polymeric materials promising for organic electronic applications, but further progress requires {{a better understanding}} of their microstructure including crystallinity and self-assembly through micro-phase segregation. Here, we demonstrate remarkable changes in the thin film structure of a model series of all-conjugated block copolymers with varying processing conditions. Under thermal annealing, poly(3 -hexylthiophene) -b-poly(90, 90 -dioctylfluorene) (P 3 HT-b-PF) all-conjugated block copolymers exhibit crystalline features of P 3 HT or PF, depending on the block ratio, and poor π- π stacking. Under chloroform solvent annealing, the block copolymers exhibit lamellar ordering, as evidenced by multiple reflections in grazing incidence wide and small-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS and GISAXS), including an in-plane reflection indicative of order along the π- π stacking direction for both P 3 HT and PF blocks. The lamellae have a characteristic domain size of 4. 2 nm, and this domain size is found to be independent of block copolymer molecular weight and block ratio. This suggests that lamellar self-assembly arises due to a combination of polymer <b>block</b> <b>segregation</b> and π- π stacking of both P 3 HT and PF polymer blocks. Strategies for predicting the microstructure of all-conjugated block copolymers must take into account intermolecular π- π stacking and liquid crystalline interactions not typically found in flexible coil block copolymers...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} cell {{division}} {{is fundamental to}} all life. From bacteria to man, any new cell can only arise by division of a preexisting cell. The adult human body {{is a product of}} trillions of cell division events and cell division remains essential in most organs to replenish cells during life. All cells except those that give rise to spermatocytes and oocytes must divide {{in such a way that}} the two arising daughter cells inherit identical copies of the genetic material encoded in the DNA. This most basic function of cell division is achieved by first accurately duplicating the DNA of the individual chromosomes and then equally segregating the copies over the two arising daughter cells. This sequence of events can be repeated as necessary and is known as the cell cycle. Damage to the DNA endangers the faithful transmission of genetic material to daughter cells, as damaged DNA cannot be correctly copied and broken fragments of chromosomes cannot be segregated. The initiation of DNA duplication and chromosome <b>segregation</b> are therefore <b>blocked</b> by the presence of damaged DNA and this block must be relieved once the DNA has been repaired. The resumnption of the cell cycle after a DNA damage-induced arrest and the molecular signals that control this process are the subject of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} the surface <b>segregation</b> of polypeptide-based <b>block</b> copolymer micelles to produce stimuli-responsive nanostructures at the polymer blend/air interface. Such structures {{were obtained by}} simultaneous surface migration and self assembly at the surface of diblock copolymer/homopolymer blends. We employed blends composed of homopolymer (PS) and an amphiphilic block copolymer polystyrene-b-poly(L-glutamic acid) (PS-b-PGA). The surface was functionalized based on the preferential segregation to the polymer blend/air interface of the hydrophilic PGA block of the diblock copolymer upon annealing to water vapor. The surface migration of the diblock copolymer to the interface was demonstrated both by XPS and contact angle measurements. As a consequence, the PGA interfacial attraction leads to a large surface excess on diblock copolymer which in turn, through macrophase and microphase separation, produced separated domains at the surface with regions composed either of homo or block copolymer. Herein we demonstrate {{that the use of}} asymmetric diblock copolymers with a higher content in PS lead to spherical micellar assemblies randomly distributed at the surface. As observed by AFM imaging the blend composition, i. e. the amount of block copolymer within the blend influences the density of micelles at the surface. Finally, when exposed to water, the pH affects the surface morphology. The PGA segments are collapsed at low pH values and extended at pH values above 4. 8, thus inducing variations on the topography of the films at the nanometer scale...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{summarize}} {{our recent}} studies employing the cyclic starches called cyclodextrins (CDs) to both nanostructure and functionalize polymers. Two important structural characteristics of CDs are taken as advantages {{to achieve these}} goals. First the ability of CDs to form non-covalent inclusion complexes (ICs) {{with a variety of}} guest molecules, including many polymers, by threading and inclusion into their relatively hydrophobic interior cavities, which are roughly cylindrical with diameters of ∼ 0. 5 to 1. 0 nm for α-, β-, and γ-CD containing 6, 7, and 8 α- 1, 4 -linked glucose units, respectively. When guest polymers are coalesced from the CD-ICs by removing their host CDs, they are observed to solidify with structures, morphologies, and even conformations that are distinct from bulk samples made from their solutions and melts. Molecularly mixed, intimate blends of two or more polymers that are normally immiscible can be obtained from their common CD-ICs, and the phase <b>segregation</b> of incompatible <b>blocks</b> can be controlled (suppressed or increased) in CD-IC coalesced block copolymers. In addition, additives may be more effectively delivered to polymers in the form of their soluble or crystalline CD-ICs or rotaxanes. Secondly, many –OH groups attached to the exterior rims of CDs, in addition to conferring water solubility, provide an opportunity to covalently bond them to polymers either during their syntheses or via post-polymerization reactions. Polymers containing CDs in their backbones or attached to their side chains are observed to more readily accept and retain additives, such as dyes, fragrances, etc. They may also be further reacted or treated through their CDs to cross-link and form networks or to form blends with other polymers having a propensity to thread through their attached CD cavities...|$|R
