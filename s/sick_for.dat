Perhaps, {{since you}} have not heard {{anything}} about them lately, you have been afraid, dear readers, that something bad had happened to them? Nothing of the sort!

5|$|At age fifty-eight, Baldwin {{desired to}} satisfy his nature {{of being a}} pioneer again by moving to Kansas, which {{was at that time}} a territory. He arrived as the brunt of the {{fighting}} in the territory was ending. Upon his arrival, he founded Baldwin City and built the first college building in the territory, which became the foundation for Baker University. He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck. On August 30, 1858, John's son Milton died unexpectedly after having been <b>sick</b> <b>for</b> only three days. Within a couple years, he laid out a town, built a grist mill and a saw mill, and he turned over the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to Berea, although he continued to finance it.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between health behavior and general health status. MethodsWe used data from the 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Mental health was measured by stress recognition and depression. Dietary habit was measured by mixed grain diet. Life pattern was measured by sleeping time and working pattern. Physical activity was measured by walking and exercise. We defined general health status as Euro Quality of Life- 5 Dimension (EQ- 5 Dindex), Euro Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale (EQ- 5 Dvas), number of people experienced lying in a <b>sickbed</b> <b>for</b> the last one month, number of days lying in a <b>sickbed</b> <b>for</b> the last one month, and activity limitations. ResultsMental health, dietary habit, life pattern, and physical activity have seven factors. Most of the factors have a significant correlation with EQ- 5 Dindex, EQ- 5 Dvas, number of people experienced lying in a <b>sickbed</b> <b>for</b> the last one month, number of days lying in a <b>sickbed</b> <b>for</b> the last one month, and activity limitations. ConclusionHealth behavior and general health status have a positive correlation...|$|R

5|$|Augustin de Candolle was {{the first}} of four generations of botanists in the de Candolle dynasty. His son, Alphonse de Candolle, whom he fathered with his wife, Mademoiselle Torras, {{eventually}} succeeded to his father's chair in botany and continued the Prodromus. Casimir Pyrame de Candolle, Augustin de Candolle's grandson, also contributed to the Prodromus through his detailed, extensive research and characterization of the Piperaceae family of plants. Augustin de Candolle's great-grandson, Richard Émile Augustin de Candolle, was also a botanist. Augustin de Candolle died on 9 September 1841 in Geneva, after being <b>sick</b> <b>for</b> many years.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, {{she came}} to Singapore {{to live with her}} older sister, Ursula, late {{principal}} of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in Bukit Timah. On seeing her dedication and commitment in helping the poor and sick, Ursula bought her a 0.6-hectare piece of land at Jalan Payoh Lai in 1965, so that Hsu could open the first home for the aged sick in Singapore. The two sisters ran the Home for the Aged <b>Sick</b> <b>for</b> five years. Ursula financed its operations with her pay, while Hsu managed it and made some extra cash by selling the harvest of 10 coconut trees and a dozen banana trees in the backyard.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan and Dio grow up {{and become}} friendlier, but Jonathan {{suspects}} ulterior motives when Dio acts very caring for George, who has been <b>sick</b> <b>for</b> an extended time. Learning that Dario had the same symptoms before he died, Jonathan suspects that Dio poisoned both of them; Dio plans to stop Jonathan from exposing this by killing him with the stone mask. When he tests the mask on a beggar beforehand, it instead turns the beggar into a vampire, who dies due to exposure to sunlight. While investigating the poison, Jonathan befriends the street thug Robert E. O. Speedwagon and learns that Dio acquired it from Wang Chan, a black market merchant. Jonathan confronts Dio, who uses George's blood and the mask to become a vampire. The Joestar estate burns to the ground during the ensuing battle, but Jonathan and Dio survive.|$|E

5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would be singing in tongues. There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of tongues. There was prayer in tongues for the <b>sick,</b> <b>for</b> missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E

25|$|Diamond rebutted Acemoglu and Robinson's response, {{reinforcing}} {{his claim}} of the book's errors. Diamond insists geographical factors dominate why countries are {{rich and poor}} today. For example, he mentions that the tropical diseases in Zambia keep male workers <b>sick</b> <b>for</b> a big portion of their lifetime, thus reducing their labor productivity significantly. He reinforces his point that geography determines local plantations and gave rise to ancient agrarian practices. Agricultural practice further shapes a sedentary lifestyle {{as well as social}} interaction, both of which shape social institutions that result in different economic performances across countries.|$|E

Although a sore throat prevented him seeing Murray off, French wrote to him (29 January) saying he hoped to see him back as an army commander before long. Haig wrote (diary 26 January) that “Murray was a kindly fellow but not a practical man in the field”.|$|E
