500|$|Aeronautical {{satellite}} communication (SATCOM) systems {{are used to}} transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit, as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may {{also be used to}} transmit FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, fax and data links using other protocols. The aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) is used to send and receive signals with the {{satellite communication}}s network; it operates independently from other aircraft equipment that communicate through the SATCOM system, many using the ACARS protocol. Signals from the SDU are relayed by a satellite, which simply changes the signal's frequency, and then received by a ground station, which processes the signal and, if applicable, routes it to its destination (e.g., Malaysia Airlines' operations centre); signals to the aircraft are sent in reverse order. When the SDU is powered on and attempts to connect with the Inmarsat network, it transmits a log-on request, which the ground station acknowledges.

Bell attorney’s were compelled to reverse their position and ultimately agreed to allow the answering bureau to continue, without the long distance service, provided Ottensmeyer promised not to enter the business premises.

30|$|In [33], an Improved time {{sliding window}} Three Colour Marker (ItswTCM) {{algorithm}} was proposed {{for the treatment of}} unfair sharing of bandwidth aggregates, with the main idea being to inject more yellow traffic in proportion to the CIR. This worked on the basis that a large <b>service</b> <b>subscriber</b> would have more yellow traffic markers than a small <b>service</b> <b>subscriber.</b> The marking of traffic through the classification of red, yellow and green in the ItswTCM was dependent on a comparison of the average_rate with parameters of the CIR and a constant value of C, with the condition that C was greater than one. The main variation between ItswTCM and tswTCM was when average_rate was greater than the CIR and when a constant value C was used for C and cases were marked green, which was different from tswTCM.|$|E
