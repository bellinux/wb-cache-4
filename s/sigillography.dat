5000|$|In <b>sigillography,</b> a pendent seal is {{one that}} hangs loose from its {{associated}} document by cords, ribbons, or a parchment tag or tail: it is thus distinguished from an applied seal, which is applied directly to {{the face of the}} paper or parchment on which the document is written.|$|E
50|$|The claim, which {{provides}} no references or argumentation, apparently {{serves as a}} way to trace the ancestry of the Doukas and Komnenos families to the Macedonian dynasty. There is however no proof for any such relationship of Eudokia in primary sources or contemporary <b>sigillography</b> and modern historical and prosopographical authorities remain equally silent on the matter, making the asserted descent appear entirely unlikely.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sigillography</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to under its Greek name, sphragistics) {{is one of}} the auxiliary sciences of history. It refers to the study of seals attached to documents as a source of historical information. It concentrates on the legal and social meaning of seals, as well as the evolution of their design. It has links to diplomatics, heraldry, social history, and the history of art.|$|E

Huitfeldt-Kaas published several works on Norwegian history, including several volumes of Diplomatarium Norvegicum. He was also interested in genealogy (particularly noble genealogy), heraldry, <b>sigillography</b> and biographical history. He started the work Norske Sigiller fra Middelalderen (1899-1950).|$|E
50|$|Antiquaries {{began to}} record {{historic}} seals in the 15th century, {{and in the}} 16th and 17th centuries their study became a fairly widespread antiquarian activity. The term <b>sigillography</b> is first found {{in the works of}} Jean Mabillon in the late 17th century, and in those of Johann Michael Heineccius soon afterwards. Initially thought of as a branch of diplomatics, the discipline gradually became an independent branch of historical studies.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sigillography</b> {{is also an}} {{important}} subdiscipline of Byzantine studies, involving the study of Byzantine lead seal impressions and the text and images thereon. Its importance derives from both the scarcity of surviving Byzantine documents themselves, and from the large number (over 40,000) of extant seals. One of the largest compendiums of Byzantine seals {{can be found in the}} large-volume by Gustave Schlumberger, [...] "Sigillographie de l'empire Byzantin," [...] published in 1904.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{studied at}} the {{university}} to gain doctorates in philology and history, Nazarenko revived the tenet of 19th-century Russian historiography {{that it is impossible}} to research early East Slavic history without detailed knowledge of ancient languages. Considered a disciple of Vladimir Pashuto, Nazarenko advocates tighter integration of historiography with the auxiliary disciplines of genealogy, numismatics, and <b>sigillography.</b> This approach allowed him to identify and publish a number of new (mostly foreign) sources on the history of Kievan Rus.|$|E
50|$|By now, the École des chartes {{had become}} a point of {{reference}} in Europe. Its historical research methodology had been greatly modernized, as had its teaching methods, thanks to the copies of ancient documents to which it had access. The students were taught paleography, <b>sigillography,</b> numismatics, philology, filing for archives and libraries, historical geography, currencies, systems of weights and measures, the history of political institutions in France, archeology, civil law, canonic law and feudal law. The teaching had both a scientific and a professional aim.|$|E
5000|$|The Centre {{has most}} {{recently}} issued a Call for Papers in the bid {{to establish a}} scholarly journal. The CCED Journal is set to be an open-access, peer-reviewed publication relating to epigraphic studies. Epigraphic studies is listed to include: historical or philological aspects of inscriptions; art historical aspects of inscriptions and their surrounding decorative motifs; digital humanities or information/library studies approaches relating to inscriptions; numismatics and <b>sigillography.</b> The CCED Journal especially welcomes articles on inscriptions from the CCED online collection and editions of unpublished inscriptions.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, antiquarianism had diverged into {{a number}} of more {{specialized}} academic disciplines including archaeology, art history, numismatics, <b>sigillography,</b> philology, literary studies and diplomatics. Antiquaries had always attracted a degree of ridicule (see below), and since the mid-19th century the term has tended to be used most commonly in negative or derogatory contexts. Nevertheless, many practising antiquaries continue to claim the title with pride. In recent years, in a scholarly environment in which interdisciplinarity is increasingly encouraged, many of the established antiquarian societies (see below) have found new roles as facilitators for collaboration between specialists.|$|E
50|$|The project {{aimed to}} cover all named {{individuals}} in the Byzantine world in the period from 641, where The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire ends, to 1265. The geographical scope has since been extended to cover Jerusalem. As of 2006 the PBW itself covers the period 1025 to 1180, a total of some 10000 individuals. The data is drawn from textual sources and also from <b>sigillography</b> which constitutes an important resource in Byzantine prosopography. Around 7500 seals are recorded. The project team estimate that, in printed form, the database would amount to some 1400 pages.|$|E

50|$|Properly speaking, and as usually {{understood}} by present-day scholars, diplomatics is concerned essentially with {{the analysis and}} interpretation of the linguistic elements of a document. It is, however, closely associated with several parallel disciplines, including palaeography, <b>sigillography,</b> codicology, and provenance studies, {{all of which are}} concerned with a document's physical characteristics and history, and which will often be carried out in conjunction with a diplomatic analysis. The term diplomatics is therefore sometimes used in a slightly wider sense, to encompass some of these other areas (as it was in Mabillon's original work, and as is implied in the definitions of both Webster and Beal quoted above). The recent development of the science in non-English Europe is expanding its scope to a cultural history of documentation including aspects of pragmatic literacy or symbolic communication.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Shridhar Vasudev Sohoni (1914-2002) was an eminent {{scholar of}} Sanskrit, and a noted {{antiquarian}} and numismatist. He was {{an officer in}} the Indian Civil Service (British India), and later in his career served as the Chief Secretary of Bihar, Lokayukta of Bihar, and the Vice-Chancellor of Lalit Narayan Mithila University and Tilak Maharashtra University. As a scholar, he published extensively and authored and edited several books and essays on a variety of subjects, including archaeology, architecture, Buddhism, literature, music, Sanskrit, sculpture, and administration. Dr. S.V. Sohoni was honored with many awards and a festscrift recognized him as {{one of the founders of}} the Academy of Indian Numismatics and <b>Sigillography.</b> A festschrift celebrating his Sanskrit scholarship had already been published a decade earlier. He was conferred D.Litt. degrees by four institutions, University of Delhi, Vikram University, Lalit Narayan Mithila University, and Nalanda University.|$|E
50|$|He {{studied in}} the University of Athens from 1951 to 1956, {{under the tutelage of}} Byzantinist Dionysios Zakythinos. After obtaining his degree, in 1958 he went to Paris to pursue {{doctoral}} studies under Paul Lemerle. His studies in Paris also introduced him to <b>sigillography,</b> and led to the discovery of the so-called Escorial Taktikon or Taktikon Oikonomides. The outcome of his work on Escorial Taktikon and the other Taktika (seating lists in Byzantine imperial banquets) was published in 1972, as the Les listes de préséance byzantines des IXe et Xe siècle, containing a translation and commentary on the Taktika. Oikonomides returned to Greece, but the establishment of the dictatorial Regime of the Colonels in 1967 forced him to go to exile in Canada along with his wife, the Ottomanist Elizabeth Zachariadou. In July 1969, he accepted the chair of Byzantine history at Montreal University, a post he kept until 1989, when he returned to Athens. He died on 31 May 2000, and {{is survived by his wife}} and two daughters.|$|E
50|$|Each chapter {{introduces}} the published, excavated, artifactual, and archival sources from earliest {{times to the}} late twentieth century and not only examines the context in which they were produced, preserved, and received, but also suggests and comments on the best secondary scholarship in Chinese, Japanese, and Western languages. The present fourth edition (green-cover) updates, expands, and corrects the third edition. Some 9,800 primary, secondary, reference works, journals, and databases are introduced {{in the course of the}} discussion (compared to 8,800 in the third edition; 4,000 in the yellow-cover edition of 2000; and 2,900 in the blue-cover edition of 1998). In addition to the greatly extended scope of the New Manual, new features are introductions to hundreds of digital resources (including 225 of the latest databases) and a wide selection of up-to-date secondary works (including citations of over 1,500 journal articles and book chapters). Interspersed throughout are short essays introducing the ancillary disciplines required for Chinese historical studies—archeology, astronomy, chronology and calendrics, codicology, diplomatics, epigraphy, genealogy, historical geography, historical linguistics, numismatics, onomastics, paleography, prosopography, <b>sigillography,</b> statistics, textual criticism, topology, and special branches of study such as oracle-bone script, bamboo and silk books, Dunhuang, Qingshuijiang, and Huizhou documents or the Ming-Qing archives. Other short essays address the uses of history and how to avoid errors in thought and analysis. There are chapters on translation into and out of Chinese. Throughout the New Manual lists of basic terms give standard translations.|$|E

40|$|Sponsorship: AHRC RONO: AH/G 010994 / 1 Seals {{and their}} Context in the Middle Ages offers an {{extensive}} overview of approaches to {{and the potential}} of <b>sigillography,</b> as well as introducing a wider readership to the range, interest and artistry of medieval seals. Seals were used throughout medieval society {{in a wide range}} of contexts: royal, governmental, ecclesiastical, legal, in trade and commerce and on an individual and personal level. The fourteen papers presented here, which originate from a conference held in Aberystwyth in April 2012, focus primarily on British material but there is also useful reference to continental Europe. The volume is divided into three sections looking at the history and use of seals as symbols and representations of power and prestige in a variety of institutional, dynastic and individual contexts, their role in law and legal practice, and aspects of their manufacture, sources and artistic attributes. Importantly and distinctively, the volume moves beyond the study of high status seals to consider such themes as the social and economic status of seal-makers, the nature and meaning including reflections of deliberate wit and boastfulness of specific motifs employed at various levels of society, and the distribution of seals in relation to the location of, for instance, religious institutions and along major routeways. In so doing, it sets out ways in which <b>sigillography</b> can open new pathways into the study of non-elites and their cultures in medieval society...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper aims {{to explore}} the visual and epigraphic {{properties}} of medieval writing as well as considering writing medium, technique, and com-municative status. The boundaries between different auxiliary disciplines in Medieval Studies (paleography, epigraphy, numismatics, <b>sigillography)</b> have created separate categories of writings and scripts within the writing culture of the Middle Ages, even if the letterforms, functions, and types of writing actually do not differ from one medium to another. A strong case for removing the disciplinary boundaries rests on the facts that writing was executed by scribes sharing training, tools and know-how, and that the iconic value of script and its visual aspects were activated primarily in the display of letters regardless of the variations {{in the content of}} the text, in its location, or its lin-guistic form. “Epigraphic” forms are used in manuscript tituli; “manuscript” abbreviations are found in stone inscriptions; seals show “epigraphic” mise en page; calamus-like features are inscribed on coins… Beyond the obvious inaccuracy of terminology, what do those commonalities between written objects show? How could we address the porosity of medieval literacy...|$|E
40|$|N. Alekseienko. The Family of Akapnenoi in the Prosopography of Byzantine Provincial Aristocracy (Through Sygillography) The data {{preserved}} by molybdoboulloi with family names make valuable source for Byzantine prosopography {{in general and}} for genealogy of individual aristocratic families or to determine {{their place in the}} hierarchy of imperial nobility. The private seal of Theodore Akapnenes is analysed {{as an example of the}} above. Despite of the silence of the written sources, monuments of <b>sigillography</b> draw the portrait of this Byzantine aristocratic family, almost not known in Byzantine historical annals, rather definitely and clearly. Representatives of this family were mostly civil officials of high ranks who did not leave in the capital but were related to provincial centres in the Balkans and Asia Minor. A few of them had connections with thematic institutions in Hellas, Cyprus, Tarsos, and Seleukia, as well as to the management of emperor’s property. Evidently, their family raised in the late tenth and first half of the eleventh century. The absence of any data concerning members of this family from ca. the reign of Alexios Komnenos (1081 – 1118) evidences that the role and importance of this family declined most likely in the turbulent events of the late eleventh and early twelfth century, so its representatives disappeared from the stage of history...|$|E
