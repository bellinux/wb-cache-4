5|$|By this time, the {{collision}} of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies should be underway. Although this {{could result in the}} Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> planets.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's {{existence}} the orbits of comets are unstable and eventually dynamics dictate that a comet must either collide with the <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> a planet or else be ejected from the Solar System by planetary perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Apart from meteors {{within the}} {{atmosphere}} and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west {{at a rate of}} 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.|$|E

5|$|Persoonia lanceolata {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, mainly due to {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have proven difficult to strike. Nevertheless, its bright green hue {{is considered an}} attractive horticultural feature. Well drained sandy soils in <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> part shade are needed for this plant in a garden setting. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells, and grows fairly readily in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, {{mainly because of}} {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have been nearly impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E

5|$|Preservation of {{the outer}} {{parts of the body}} was {{normally}} achieved through a combination of resins and animal skin wrappings. The resins were prepared with a mixture of minerals, plants, and fats. These were spread across the body prior to allowing it to dry, either in the <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> through smoking. Finally, the deceased was wrapped in animal skins and laid to rest. The number of animal skins used in wrapping corresponded with the individual’s social status, with kings being wrapped with up to 15 skins.|$|E
5|$|Solar and lunar eclipses were {{considered}} to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe upon the world. In the Dresden Codex, a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the k'in ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were interpreted as the <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster.|$|E
5|$|Some comets meet a more {{spectacular}} end – either {{falling into the}} <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> smashing into a planet or other body. Collisions between comets and planets or moons were common in the early Solar System: {{some of the many}} craters on the Moon, for example, may have been caused by comets. A recent collision of a comet with a planet occurred in July 1994 when Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 broke up into pieces and collided with Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|When both {{rates of}} {{movement}} are known, the space {{velocity of the}} star relative to the <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, {{it has been found}} that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy. A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds, and are referred to as stellar associations.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but will grow in full <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E
5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E

5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, {{they can move}} into the <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> the stars were visible.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{the only}} planet whose {{barycenter}} with the Sun lies outside {{the volume of the}} Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius. The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 millionkm (about 5.2 times the average distance between Earth and the <b>Sun,</b> <b>or</b> 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the Solar System. The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1.31° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter's distance from the Sun varies by 75 millionkm between its nearest approach (perihelion) and furthest distance (aphelion).|$|E

5|$|Kepler-6 {{was named}} for the Kepler Mission, a NASA and {{accomplishment}} project launched in 2009 that aims to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their home stars with respect to Earth. Unlike stars like the <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> Sirius, Kepler-6 {{does not have a}} common and colloquial name. The discovery of Kepler-6b was announced by the Kepler team on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. It was the third planet to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets to be verified by data from Kepler had been previously discovered. These three planets were used to test the accuracy of Kepler's measurements.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's {{writings}} combined {{religious and}} scientific objections and were fueled by political events. Scientific opposition came from Tycho Brahe and others and {{arose from the}} fact that, if heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was. Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if the stars were that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, the stars were a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.|$|E
5|$|The oligarch {{theory of}} planet {{formation}} states {{that there were}} hundreds of planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free-floating planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000AU from the <b>Sun,</b> <b>or</b> between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud.|$|E
