6000|$|Peter, when he {{left the}} magistrate, was still tossed about by an {{infinity}} of doubts. If he should once take the girl as his wife, he could never unmarry himself again. He could not do so at least without trouble, disgrace, and ruinous expense. As for revenge, he thought that he might still have a certain amount of that pleasure in repudiating his promised spouse for her bad conduct, and in declaring to her aunt that he could not bring himself to make a wife of a woman who had first disgraced herself, and then absolutely taken glory in her disgrace. As he went along from Herr Molk's house towards the island, taking a somewhat long path by the Rothe Ross where he refreshed himself, and down the Carls Strasse, and by the Church of St. Lawrence, round which he walked twice, looking up to the tower for inspiration,--he told himself that circumstances had been most cruel to him. He complained bitterly of his misfortune. If he refused to marry Linda he must leave the red house altogether, and would, of course, be ridiculed for his attempt at matrimony; and if he did marry her-- Then, {{as far as he could}} see, there would be the very mischief. He pitied himself with an exceedingly <b>strong</b> <b>compassion,</b> because of the unmerited hardness of his position. It was very dark when he got to the narrow passage leading to the house along the river, and when there, in the narrowest and darkest part of the passage, whom should he meet coming from Madame Staubach's house,--coming from Linda's house, for the passage led from the red house only,--but Ludovic Valcarm his cousin? ...|$|E
60|$|Here Lanty {{was called}} on to assist Hebert in {{identifying}} his lady's bales of goods, when all those of the unfortunate Genoese were put on board the corsair's vessel. A sail-cloth partition was extended across the deck by {{the care of the}} Dutchman, 'who'--as Lanty said--'for a haythen apostate was a very dacent man.' He evidently had a <b>strong</b> <b>compassion</b> and fellow- feeling for the Christian lady, and assured her that she might safely take the air and sit on deck as much as she pleased behind its shelter; and he likewise carefully selected the seven of his crew whom he sent on board to work the ship, the chief being a heavy-looking old Turk, with a chocolate-coloured visage between a huge white beard and eyebrows, and the others mere lads, except one, who, from an indefinable European air about him, was evidently a renegade, and could speak a sort of French, so as to hold communication with the captives, especially Lanty, who was much quicker than any of the rest in picking up languages, perhaps from having from his infancy talked French and English (or rather Irish), and likewise learnt Latin with his foster-brother. This man was the only one permitted to go astern of the partition, in case of need, to attend to the helm; but the vessel was taken in tow by the corsair, and needed little management. The old Turk seemed to regard the Frankish women like so many basilisks, and avoided turning a glance in their direction, roaring at his crew if he only saw them approaching the sail-cloth, and keeping a close watch upon the lithe black-eyed youths, whose brown limbs carried them up the mast with the agility of monkeys. There was one in especial--a slight, well-made fellow about twenty, with a white turban cleaner than the rest--who contrived to cast wonderful glances from the masthead over the barrier at Rosette, who actually smiled in return at ce pauvre garcon, and smiled the more for Mademoiselle Julienne's indignation. Suddenly, however, a shrill shout made him descend hastily, and the old Turk's voice might be heard in its highest key, no doubt shrieking out maledictions on all the ancestry of the son of a dog who durst defile his eyes with gazing at the shameless daughters of the Frank. Little Ulysse was, however, allowed to disport himself wherever he pleased; and after once, under Arthur's protection, going forward, he found himself made very welcome, and offered various curiosities, such as shells, corals, and a curious dried little hippocampus or seahorse.|$|E

50|$|According to some Tibetan authorities, the {{physical}} practice of sexual yoga is necessary {{at the highest}} level for the attainment of Buddhahood. The use of sexual yoga is highly regulated. It is only permitted after years of training. The physical practice of sexual yoga is and has historically been extremely rare. A great majority of Tibetans believe that the only proper practice of tantric texts is metaphorically, not physically, in rituals and during meditative visualizations. The dominant Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism holds that sexual yoga as an actual physical practice {{is the only way to}} attain Buddhahood in one lifetime. The founder of the sect Tsongkhapa did not, according to tradition, engage in this practice, but instead attained complete enlightenment at the moment of death, that being according to this school the nearest possible without sexual yoga. The school also taught that they are only appropriate for the most elite practitioners, who had directly realized emptiness and who had unusually <b>strong</b> <b>compassion.</b> The next largest school in Tibet, the Nyingma, holds that this is not necessary to achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime. The fourteenth Dalai Lama of the Gelug sect, holds that the practice should only be done as a visualization.|$|E

It improves on previous rules in that the premises of the new rule are all first order. We prove that the rule is sound, and present a constructive completeness proof for the case of finite-state systems. For the general case, we present a sketch of a relative completeness proof. We report about {{the implementation of the}} rule in PVS and illustrate its application on some simple but non-trivial examples. ...|$|R
40|$|One of the puzzling {{phenomena}} in philanthropy {{is that people}} can show <b>strong</b> <b>compassion</b> for identified individual victims but remain unmoved by catastrophes that affect large numbers of victims. Two prominent findings in research on charitable giving reflect this idiosyncrasy: The (1) identified victim and (2) victim number effects. The first of these suggests that identifying victims increases donations and the second refers to the finding that peoples willingness to donate often decreases {{as the number of}} victims increases. While these effects have been documented in the literature, their underlying psychological processes need further study. We propose a model in which identified victim and victim number effects operate through different cognitive and affective mechanisms. In two experiments we present empirical evidence for such a model and show that different affective motivations (donor-focused vs. victim-focused feelings) are related to the cognitive processes of impact judgments and mental imagery. Moreover, we argue that different mediation pathways exist for identifiability and victim number effects.

Key to this exploration is an examination of how bohemian hobby inspectors are propelled by novel scientific inventions towards an unprecedented rational thinking, which brings their specific attention to bear upon the minutiae of the crime scene. It also traces these 19 th century detectives back to the modern figure, which Walter Benjamin describes as the flaneur amidst the newly arisen crowds of the metropolis. The last chapter contrasts Sherlock Holmes with Wachtmeister Studer, a more Columbo-like figure of the early 20 th century, created by the Swiss author Friedrich Glauser.

Compassion for social pain in others was associated with strong activation in the interoceptive, inferior/posterior portion of this region, while compassion for physical pain in others involved heightened activity in the exteroceptive, superior/anterior portion. Compassion for social pain activated this superior/anterior section, to a lesser extent.

40|$|Objectives - Mental {{health workers}} are {{constantly}} exposed to their clients’ stories of distress and trauma. While listening to these stories can be emotionally draining, professionals {{in this field}} still derive pleasure from their work. This study examined the role of personality and workplace belongingness in predicting compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout in mental health professionals. Methods - Mental health staff (N = 156) working in a counselling service completed a questionnaire that included measures relating to professional quality of life, the Five-Factor Model of personality, workplace belongingness, as well as questions relating to the participants’ demographic profile, work roles and trauma history. Results - The results indicated that, high levels of emotional stability (low neuroticism), extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and being connected at work, are essential factors that promote the professional {{quality of life of}} mental health workers. Specifically, workplace belongingness was the <b>strongest</b> predictor of <b>compassion</b> satisfaction and low levels of burnout, while neuroticism was the strongest predictor of secondary traumatic stress.
