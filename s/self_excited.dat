50|$|Nonlinear effects {{like the}} I-V {{characteristic}} of the boundary sheath are utilized for Langmuir probe measurements but they are usually neglected for modelling of RF discharges due to their very inconvenient mathematical treatment. The <b>Self</b> <b>Excited</b> Electron Plasma Resonance Spectroscopy (SEERS) utilizes exactly these nonlinear effects and known resonance effects in RF discharges. The nonlinear elements, in particular the sheaths, provide harmonics in the discharge current and excite the plasma and the sheath at their series resonance characterized by the so-called geometric resonance frequency.|$|E

A direct current (DC) generator, not using a permanent magnet, requires a DC field current for excitation. The field may be separately excited by a source of DC, such as a battery, or <b>self</b> <b>excited</b> by being connected to the armature of the generator so that the generator also provides the energy required for the field current.|$|E

The <b>self</b> <b>exciting</b> aerodynamic force exerted on a T-shape cantilever causes periodic vibration, which can be converted into electric power through an electromagnetic transducer. Due to the complexities inherent in the fluid-structure interaction between the cantilever harvester and wind flow, analyzing the structural response of the cantilever and estimating the power output from the flutter based energy harvester is challenging. Here, a CFD code based on the Vortex Particle Method is employed to simulate the wind induced responses of a T-shape cantilever beam and to estimate the power output extracted from the flutter vibration. The estimated aerodynamic damping parameter, together with the mechanical and electrical damping parameters in the harvester are then used to find the critical wind speed of flutter onset as well as the optimum load resistance. Results are supported by wind tunnel tests conducted. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: – Induction {{generators}} in <b>self</b> <b>excited</b> mode {{are found}} to be suitable for remote and windy locations. Prior to installation {{there is a need to}} predict the behaviour of machine under all possible operating conditions. This is possible through steady state modeling of such generators. Steady state analysis of <b>self</b> <b>excited</b> induction generator (SEIG) needs an estimation of generated frequency and magnetizing reactance under all possible operating conditions. So far most of the researchers have used loop impedance, nodal admittance or iterative techniques to determine the steady state performance of such machines. In this paper a new model based upon phasor diagram of induction generator has been proposed to analyze the behaviour of <b>self</b> <b>excited</b> induction generator. Modeling results in a third order equation in generated frequency and a simple expression for magnetizing reactance.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{a method for}} control of wind turbine generator power coefficient by variation of load with wind speed changes. Steady state characteristics of horizontal axis propeller type wind turbines are shown {{and development of the}} tip speed ratio power coefficient curve is given. Taking account of the theory of the horizontal axis propeller turbine, a three bladed windmill of six metres diameter with fixed pitch was designed and constructed. <b>Self</b> <b>excited</b> induction generators are described in detail in terms of the steady state characteristics. It is shown that the currently used induction machine equivalent circuit model, employed for determination of the steady state characteristics) inadequately describes the observed operation of the machine. This is shown using phasor diagrams. An alternative equivalent circuit model is suggested. A controllable rectifier was designed and used in conjunction with the <b>self</b> <b>excited</b> induction generator. The rectifier is capable of operating over a wide frequency range with large amounts of harmonic present at the input. Use of the <b>self</b> <b>excited</b> induction generator in conjunction with the controllable rectifier in the wind turbine generator is described and shown to provide a practical form of turbine load control. Control of the turbine power coefficient is obtained by controlled variation of rectifier delay angle. A microprocessor is used to determine power available in the wind and subsequently estimates the required load power to obtain the desired power coefficient. Results of the turbine operating in windy conditions show that such a system can operate satisfactorily. Suggestions are also made for further research to be carried out on the wind turbine generator...|$|E
