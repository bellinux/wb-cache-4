40|$|ABSTRACT. As {{a part of}} a {{study and}} {{analysis}} on the effects of process para-meters on <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> volume in sub-merged arc welding (SAW) of pipes, mathematical models were developed to relate the process parameters and the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> quality parameters. Further, the optimization of <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> volume was carried out using the optimization module available in the MATLAB version 4. 2 b software package. The mathemati-cal models thus developed for optimiza-tion are also helpful in predicting the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> quality parameters and in set-ting process parameters at optimum val-ues to achieve the desirable <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> quality at a relatively low cost {{with a high degree of}} repeatability and increased production rate.

40|$|Purpose: Show the {{relationship}} between geometric characteristics of the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> and the optical-acoustic emissions from electric arc during welding in the GMAW-S process. Design/methodology/approach: <b>Bead</b> on plate <b>welding</b> experiments was carried out setting different process parameters. Every welding parameter group was set aiming to reach a high stability level what guarantee a geometrical uniformity in the <b>weld</b> <b>beads.</b> In each experiment was simultaneously acquired arc voltage, welding current, infrared and acoustic emissions; from them were computed parameters as arc power, acoustic peaks rate and infrared radiation rate. It was used a tri-dimensional LASER scanner for to acquire geometrical information from the <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> surface as width and height of the bead. Depth penetration was measured from sectional cross cutting of <b>weld</b> <b>beads.</b> Findings: Previous analysis showed that the arc emission parameters reach a stationary state with different characteristic for each experiment group which {{means that there is}} some correlation level between them. Posterior analysis showed that from infrared parameter is possible to monitoring external <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry and principally its penetration depth. From acoustic parameter is possible to monitoring principally the external <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry. Therefore is concluded that there is a close relation between the arc emissions and the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry and that them could be used to measuring the welding geometrical parameters. Research limitations/implications: After analysis it was noticed that the infrared sensing has a better performance than acoustic sensing in the depth penetration monitoring. Infrared sensing also sources some information about external geometric parameters that in conjunction with the acoustic sensing is possible to have reliable information about <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry. This method of sensing geometric parameters could be applied in other welding processes, but is necessary to have visibility of the arc, it means that for example this method cannot be used in the submerged arc welding - SAW process. Originality/value: The using two or more sensors for monitoring welding parameters increases the performance and reliability of the measurements. In this case, the monitoring of the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometric parameters could be possible from sensing arc emission and potentially it could be used as an on-line monitor, avoiding any complex electric connections of sensors into the welding process...|$|R

This paper focuses on investigation of the development of the simple and accurate model for {{prediction of}} <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> width of butt joint of SMAW process. Artificial neural networks technique was used to train a program in C++ with the help of sufficient number of welding data sets having input variables current, voltage, speed of welding and external magnetic field and output variable <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> width.

In reality the length of typical manual metal arc (MMA) repair welds often necessitates {{the use of multiple}} <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> for any individual pass. To investigate the modelling assumptions associated with this approximation a series of results are presented that simulate the deposition of a multi-bead, single MMA weld pass on a stainless steel flat plate. The simulations make use of a fabricated single <b>bead</b> <b>weld</b> test specimen to define the welding conditions. A number of different heat source models and bead sequencing scenarios have been investigated. These include moving heat source simulations, simultaneous bead laying methods (also called "block-dumped" methods) and combinations of the two. The work provides a useful insight into how certain modelling approximations affect weld residual stress distributions. It is concluded that moving heat source end effects are not sensitive to modelling assumptions made in <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> remote from the stop end. However, residual stress predictions at the mid-length of a multi-bead weld pass on a flat plate are sensitive to the modelling assumptions. In particular, modelling each bead of a multi-bead weld pass can increase the stresses at mid-length relative to a simulation that deposits the whole pass in one go. One further observation made is that modelling the central bead of a multi-bead weld pass using a block-dumped technique (allowing a symmetry boundary condition to be used perpendicular to the <b>weld</b> <b>bead)</b> can result in inaccurate or misleading results...|$|R

40|$|Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW) {{process is}} often {{employed}} in industry where multiple welding sequences {{are used to}} produce stronger fastening between mating parts. Post Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT) is almost always recommended for relieving residual stresses and tempering the microstructural properties in order to prolong the fatigue and fracture life; however, it is often done away with due to the high costs involved, time constraints, infeasibility or sometime deleterious effects of the tempering process. This paper investigates whether the sequence of the initial deposition of the weld material itself can temper the microstructural properties and {{reduce the size of}} the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) in the weld and parent metal. Four <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> are deposited on a mild steel plate, with each being tempered by an overlapping bead using the Temper <b>Bead</b> <b>Welding</b> (TBW) technique. Numerical simulation is performed using FEA software VrWeld to evaluate the microstructure, hardness and size of the HAZ. It is concluded that there are significant improvements in the microstructure, hardness and size of the HAZ {{as a result of the}} deposition of the overlapping, tempering beads...|$|R
