He then taught at the University of Alabama. He lost his position there after pursuing a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> a male student; his religious education was likely not supportive of same-sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires. He separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in 1965, and they divorced three years later.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt's {{appointment}} was initially {{expected to meet}} with little opposition. Several state senators, however, voiced concerns about Goldschmidt's involvement with SAIF and possible improprieties in the dealings {{he and his wife}} had with Texas Pacific. Senator Vicki Walker, in particular, emerged as an outspoken critic of Goldschmidt. The increased scrutiny on Goldschmidt's career, including reporters' difficulties accessing records from his time as governor, ultimately led to the revelation of an illegal <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> a minor girl, which had occurred decades before, during his time as Mayor of Portland. These revelations ended Goldschmidt's extensive career at the center of Oregon politics and policymaking.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, Hemings, aged 14, {{accompanied}} Jefferson's {{youngest daughter}} Mary ("Polly") to London {{and then to}} Paris, where the widowed Jefferson, aged 44 at the time, was serving as the United States Minister to France. Hemings spent two years there. It is believed by most historians that Jefferson began a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Hemings in France or soon after their return to Monticello. Hemings remained enslaved in Jefferson's house until his death.|$|E

5|$|Neil Edward Goldschmidt (born June 16, 1940) is a Jewish-American {{businessman}} and Democratic politician {{from the state}} of Oregon who held local, state and federal offices over three decades. After serving as the governor of Oregon, Goldschmidt was once considered the most influential figure in the state's politics. His legacy and career were severely damaged by revelations that he had a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> a young teenage girl during his first term as mayor of Portland.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, she {{was working}} on her third novel, Beauty's Hour, and it is likely that Yeats read the manuscript, {{suggested}} revisions, and {{may have contributed to the}} characterisations. Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the occult. For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> a woman, something he had not then experienced.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, under {{pressure}} from Willamette Week, Goldschmidt publicly {{announced that he had}} engaged in a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> a 14-year-old girl (the victim later indicated she was 13) for an extended period during his first term as Mayor of Portland. Sex with a person under 16 years of age constitutes third degree rape under Oregon law, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. By the time the relationship had become public, however, the statute of limitations had expired, making Goldschmidt immune from any prosecution over the matter.|$|E

5|$|These {{investigators}} were overseen by two commanding officers {{more concerned with}} politics and their own careers than the case, Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison) and Major William Rawls (John Doman). Assistant state's attorney Rhonda Pearlman (Deirdre Lovejoy) acted as the legal liaison between the detail and the courthouse and also had a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> McNulty. In the homicide division, Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce) was a gifted, dry-witted, hard-drinking detective partnered with McNulty under Sergeant Jay Landsman (Delaney Williams), the sarcastic, sharp-tongued squad supervisor. Peter Gerety had a recurring role as Judge Phelan, the official who started the case moving.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{homosexual}} {{activities from}} time to time {{came to the attention of}} the authorities, and were investigated by the police; information was added to his MI5 file, but in no case was action taken against him.

Scott maintained that in the early 1960s he had been in a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Thorpe, who had subsequently mistreated him. The inquiry dismissed the allegations.|$|E

Proceedings began about the estate and will, which Mike Nevelson claimed did not mention MacKown. There was talk of a potential palimony case, but despite public speculation that the two women were lovers, MacKown maintained {{that she had never}} had a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Nevelson, as did Mike Nevelson.|$|E

Chad's later storylines focus on his confusion over his sexual identity, and his <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson. Chad attempts to reconcile with Whitney, after his affair with Vincent is revealed, before being killed by his father Alistair while trying to protect his best friend, Ethan Winthrop.|$|E
5|$|Despite his popularity, Goldschmidt {{left office}} after only one term, {{becoming}} an influential and controversial lobbyist. Over the next dozen years or so, he was criticized by editorial boards and Oregonians for {{several of the}} causes he supported, including backing the forestry corporation, Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Oregon's Willamette Industries and his advocacy for a private investment firm {{in its attempt to}} take over Portland General Electric, a local utility company. In 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski appointed him to the Oregon Board of Higher Education, a position he resigned after admitting he had a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> a minor girl 30 years earlier.|$|E

Gabrielle tricks Juanita into exercising by driving away and making Juanita chase after her car.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Zeffirelli, whose Hamlet was heavily cut, Kenneth Branagh adapted, directed, {{and starred in}} a 1996 version containing every word of Shakespeare's play, combining the material from the F1 and Q2 texts. Branagh's Hamlet runs for just over four hours. Branagh set the film with late 19th-century costuming and furnishings, a production in many ways reminiscent of a Russian novel of the time; and Blenheim Palace, built in the early 18th century, became Elsinore Castle in the external scenes. The film is structured as an epic and makes frequent use of flashbacks to highlight elements not made explicit in the play: Hamlet's <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Kate Winslet's Ophelia, for example, or his childhood affection for Yorick (played by Ken Dodd).|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that Edward had a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Gaveston or his later favourites {{has been extensively}} discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain {{the details of their}} relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with heresy, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity {{in the same way that}} it might in the 21st century. Edward and Gaveston both had sexual relationships with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, Eleanor de Clare.|$|E
