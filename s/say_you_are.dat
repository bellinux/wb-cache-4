The rights for the English language version of the novel was acquired by Penguin Books, and there was interest in turning the work into a film. In 2015, German graphic novelist Reinhard Kleist published his graphic novel Der Traum von Olympia – Die Geschichte von Samia Yusuf Omar ("An Olympic Dream – The Story of Samia Yusuf Omar") at Carlsen Verlag. It was named the Luchs book {{of the year for}} 2015. The graphic novel was translated into English and published by SelfMadeHero in 2016.|$|E
25|$|It is such {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, to have made all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. It was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E
500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; if you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing {{down a couple of}} hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E

Pointing to the target to show grandfather , he said: 'After you can perform like this, you can <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> an archer'. Grandfather, thanked him and asked to be allowed to try. He drew his bow, let fly his arrow and struck the end of T'ung's arrow. He shot again and again hit the mark. T'ung was greatly amazed and subsequently presented to grandfather his two favorite bows. Thereafter grandfather practiced still more [...] he was able to shoot to the left and right, accurately letting fly the arrow as he moved. When he became a general he taught this to his officers and men so that his whole army became skilled at shooting to the left and right and frequently used this technique to crush the enemy's spirit".|$|E
500|$|Although Parliamentary leaders, Vane among them, {{had promised}} Cromwell on 19 April 1653 to delay {{action on the}} {{election}} bill, Vane was likely one of the ringleaders that sought to have the bill enacted the next day before Cromwell could react. [...] Cromwell was however alerted by a supporter, and interrupted the proceedings that would otherwise have passed the bill. [...] Bringing troops into the chamber, he {{put an end to}} the debate, saying [...] "You are no Parliament. [...] I <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> no Parliament. [...] I will put an end to your sitting." [...] Vane protested, [...] "This is not honest; yea, it is against morality and common honesty", to which Cromwell shouted in response, [...] "O Sir Henry Vane, Sir Henry Vane; the Lord deliver me from Sir Henry Vane!" [...] This ended the commonwealth, and Cromwell began to rule as Lord Protector. [...] Vane, [...] "daily missed and courted for his assistance", was invited to sit on Cromwell's council, but refused.|$|E
500|$|In early July 1778, the Prussian General Johann Jakob von Wunsch (1717–1788) {{crossed into}} Bohemia near the {{fortified}} town of Náchod, {{in the opening}} action of the War of the Bavarian Succession. Nauendorf had only 50 Hussars, but they sallied from their garrison to engage the larger Prussian force. Encountering Wunsch, Nauendorf greeted the old Prussian general and his men as friends; {{by the time the}} Prussians realized the allegiance of the Hussars, Nauendorf and his small force had acquired the strategic advantage. Following a brief skirmish, Wunsch withdrew. The next day Nauendorf was promoted to major. In a letter to her son, Joseph, the Empress Maria Theresa wrote: [...] "They <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> so pleased with the rookie Nauendorf, the Carlstätter or Hungarian who killed seven men, that you gave him 12ducats." [...] Enamored with the possibility of acquiring Bavaria, Joseph encouraged successful raids against the Prussian troops. On 7August 1778, with two squadrons of his regiment, Nauendorf led a raid against a Prussian convoy at Biebersdorf in the County of Kladsko. The surprised convoy surrendered, and Nauendorf captured its officers, 110men, 476horses, 240wagons of flour, and 13transport wagons.|$|E

He had also stated in the e-mail that Speaker of Parliament Maxime Carlot Korman would be [...] "buried" [...] if he attempted {{to stand in the}} 2012 general election.

2500|$|There was {{a severe}} famine {{in the land}} of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, {{travelled}} south to Egypt. On the journey to Egypt, Abram instructed Sarai to identify herself only as his sister, fearing that the Egyptians would kill him in order to take his wife, saying, [...] "I know what a beautiful woman you are. When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'this is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live. <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you." [...] When brought before Pharaoh, Sarai said that Abram was her brother, and the king thereupon took her into his palace and bestowed upon the latter many presents and marks of distinction. It is possible that Sarai acquired her Egyptian handmaid Hagar during this stay. However, God afflicted Pharaoh's household with great plagues. Pharaoh then realized that Sarai was Abram's wife and demanded that they leave Egypt immediately.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the middle}} of 1649 until 1651 Cromwell was away on campaign. In the meantime, with the king gone (and with him their common cause), the various factions in Parliament began to engage in infighting. On his return, Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and {{to put in place}} a broad-brush, {{tolerant}} national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, and although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, in April 1653 Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government of 40 members (drawn both from the Rump and the army) and then abdicate. However, the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government. Cromwell was so angered by this that on 20 April 1653, supported by about forty musketeers, he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force. Several accounts exist of this incident: in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said [...] "you are no Parliament, I <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting". At least two accounts agree that Cromwell snatched up the mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the [...] "bauble" [...] be taken away. Cromwell's troops were commanded by Charles Worsley, later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace.|$|E
