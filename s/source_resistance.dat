Other instruments—essentially similar, but with higher sensitivity—are used for accurate measurements of very small or very large quantities. These include nanovoltmeters, electrometers (for very low currents, and voltages with very high <b>source</b> <b>resistance,</b> such as one teraohm) and picoammeters.

50|$|The theorem states how {{to choose}} (so as to {{maximize}} power transfer) the load resistance, once the <b>source</b> <b>resistance</b> is given. It is a common misconception to apply the theorem in the opposite scenario. It does not say {{how to choose}} the <b>source</b> <b>resistance</b> for a given load resistance. In fact, the <b>source</b> <b>resistance</b> that maximizes power transfer is always zero, regardless {{of the value of}} the load resistance.|$|E

40|$|Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} plant viruses in the world. Two <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance</b> to BYDV derived from Thinopyrum intermedium were compared in wheat backgrounds. A <b>source</b> of <b>resistance</b> was confirmed in the partial amphiploid TAF 46, the group 7 addition line L 1, and translocation TC 14. The other <b>source</b> of <b>resistance</b> derives from the partial amphiploid Zhong 5 and is present in the group 2 addition line Z 6. Six ditelosomic addition lines have been derived from Z 6. The resistance of genotypes derived from Zhong 5 is more effective at reducing virus multiplication throughout plant growth than that of genotypes derived from TAF 46. The translocation line TC 14, derived from TAF 46 showed 30 % plants escaping virus infection whereas all plants derived from Zhong 5 were infected. This suggests that the two <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance</b> are associated with differing mechanisms of resistance. Methods to better understand the genetic control and the mechanisms of these two resistances are suggested.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of genetic diversity of North American spring wheat varieties differing in resistance to pre-harvest sprouting was carried out. For identification of <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance</b> the genealogical profiles of 148 red-grained and 63 white-grained North-American spring wheat varieties with full pedigrees were calculated and estimates {{were made of}} pre-harvest sprouting. The cluster structure of the populations of red-grained and white-grained varieties was estimated. Analysis of variance revealed {{significant differences between the}} average contributions of landraces in the groups of resistant and susceptible varieties. Distribution of the putative <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance</b> in the clusters indicated that varieties having different genetic basis may have different <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance.</b> For red-grained varieties the genetic <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance</b> to pre-harvest sprouting are landraces Crimean, Hard Red Calcutta, and Iumillo, or Button, Kenya 9 M- 1 A- 3, and Kenya-U, or Red Egyptian and Kenya BF 4 - 3 B- 10 V 1. Tracking of pedigrees showed these landraces contributed to the pedigrees, respectively, via Thatcher, Kenya-Farmer, and Kenya- 58, which were likely donors of resistance for red-grained varieties. For white-grained varieties the <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance</b> were landraces Crimean, Hard Red Calcutta, Ostka Galicyjska, Iumillo, Akakomugi, Turco, Hybrid English, Rough Chaff White and Red King, and putative donors of resistance — Thatcher, RL 2265, and Frontana.

40|$|The soybean cyst {{nematode}} (SCN) Heterodera glycines is {{a major threat to}} soybean production, made more challenging by the current limitations of natural resistance for managing this pathogen. The use of resistant host cultivars is effective, but, over time, results in the generation of virulent nematode populations able to robustly parasitize the resistant host. In order to understand how virulence develops in SCN, we utilized a single backcross BC 1 F 2 strategy to mate a highly virulent inbred population (TN 20), capable of reproducing on all current <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance,</b> with an avirulent one (PA 3), unable to reproduce on any of the resistant soybean lines. The offspring were then investigated to determine how virulence is inherited on the main <b>sources</b> of SCN <b>resistance,</b> derived from soybean lines Peking, PI 88788, PI 90763, and the broad spectrum <b>resistance</b> <b>source</b> PI 437654. Significantly, our results suggest virulence on PI 437654 is a multigenic recessive trait that allows the nematode to reproduce on all current <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance.</b> In addition, we examined how virulence on different <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance</b> interact by placing virulent SCN populations under secondary selection, and identified a strong counter-selection between virulence on PI 88788 - and PI 90763 -derived resistances, while no such counter-selection existed between virulence on Peking and PI 88788 <b>resistance</b> <b>sources.</b> Our results suggest that the genes responsible for virulence on PI 88788 and PI 90763 may be different alleles at a common locus.

40|$|The {{wheat curl mite}} (WCM), Aceria tosichella Keifer (Trombidiformes: Eriophyidae), is a major pest in {{cropping}} {{regions of}} the world and is recognised as the primary vector of several yield-reducing pathogens, primarily affecting wheat. Management of WCM is complicated due to several aspects of the mite 2 ̆ 7 s biology and ecology; however, commercially viable mite resistant wheat varieties may offer practical long-term management options. Unfortunately, mite populations have adapted to previously identified <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance,</b> highlighting the need for further <b>sources</b> of <b>resistance</b> and the value of stacking different resistances to give greater degrees and longevity of control.
