40|$|Parton {{distribution}} functions {{give the}} probability to find partons (quarks and gluons) in a hadron {{as a function}} of the fraction x of the proton's momentum carried by the parton. They are conventionally defined in terms of matrix elements of certain operators. They are determined from experimental results on <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>scattering</b> of the partons. Integrals of these functions weighted with x^n are calculable using lattice QCD. Some simple models for their behavior have implications that could also be tested in lattice QCD.

40|$|The infrared-ultraviolet {{properties}} of quantum gravity suggest on very general grounds that hard <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>scattering</b> processes are highly suppressed for {{center of mass}} scattering energies beyond the fundamental Planck scale. If this scale is not too far above the electroweak scale, these non-perturbative quantum gravity effects could be manifest as an extinction of high transverse momentum jets at the LHC. To model these effects we implement an Extinction Monte Carlo modification of the Pythia event generator based on a large damping Veneziano form factor modification of hard QCD scattering processes. Using this we illustrate the leading effects of extinction on the inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum at the LHC. We estimate that an extinction mass scale of up to roughly half the center of mass beam collision energy could be probed with high statistics data.

40|$|In quasi-one- or quasi-two-dimensional traps {{with strong}} {{transverse}} confinements, quantum gases behave like strictly one- or two-dimensional systems at large length scales. However, at <b>short</b> <b>distance,</b> the two-body <b>scattering</b> intrinsically has three-dimensional characteristics such that an exact description of any universal thermodynamic relation requires three-dimensional contacts, {{no matter how}} strong the confinement is. A fundamental question arises as to whether one- or two-dimensional contacts, which were originally defined for strictly one or two dimensions, are capable of describing quantum gases in quasi-one- or quasi-two-dimensional traps. Here, we point out an exact relation between the three- and low-dimensional contacts in these highly anisotropic traps. Such relation allows us to directly connect physical quantities at different length scales, and to characterise the quasi-one- or quasi-two-dimensional traps using universal thermodynamic relations that were derived for strict one or two dimensions...|$|R
40|$|The early {{observation}} at HERA of {{an excess}} of events compared to the expectation from the Standard Model in very <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> $e^+p$ deep-inelastic <b>scattering</b> processes has renewed the interest {{in the search for}} new physics which could manifest in electroweak-like interactions. New preliminary results from the H 1 and ZEUS experiments making use of all available $e^+p$ data are reviewed here, with an emphasis on the search for new bosons possessing Yukawa couplings to lepton-quark pairs. The sensitivity of HERA to leptoquarks, and to squarks of R-parity violating supersymmetry, is confronted to existing indirect constraints from rare and forbidden semi-leptonic decays, atomic parity violation and neutrinoless double-beta decay, as well as to direct constraints from LEP and Tevatron colliders. The HERA and Tevatron colliders are found to offer exciting prospects for new physics, accessing yet unexplored domains of the mass-coupling plane. Possible striking manifestation of explicit lepton flavour violation is also discussed. Comment: 27 pages, 16 figures. Proceedings of the WEIN' 98 Symposium (June 1998...|$|R

40|$|A linear, {{barotropic}} {{numerical model}} that features realistic bathymetry of the Scotian Shelf provides solutions forced by steady and periodic wind stress that are generally incoherent on spatial {{scales of the}} shelf width. Closed circulation cells occur in d a t i o n with, and on the scales of, major bathymetric features. Bathymetrically steered now is prevalenf and more evident at lower frequencies. Model transport forced by a coastally trapped wave propagating across the backward boundary is not sensitive to the modal structure of the incident wave; bathymetry rapidly modifies the wave form as it propagates in the free diredon. Higher modes and reflected waves are probably dissipated over <b>short</b> <b>distances</b> by <b>scattering</b> and strong bottom stress. Patterns seen in the model solutions are consistent with resulu from more fundamental models, and are readily explained by relatively simple vorticity balances. Model results generally reproduce the diverse local and n o n l d velocity responses obmved on the Scotian Shelf during winter. The model is more effective in accounting for the remote contribution to circulation. Wmd-forced results generally reflect the observed dinctional variability, and an similar in magnitude to obswvations inside the 1 Wm &bath but underestimate the actual c m n t response at deeper stations. It is speculated that spatial variability in wind stress, an effect not addressed in this work, {{may be responsible for}} some of this difference. The significance of baroclinic effects in deeper water, which cannot be discounted, is also {{beyond the scope of this}} model. Nevertheless, the fairly good agreement between the model and observed cumcat responses to local and n o n l d forcing confirms the importance of bathymetric modifications to Scotian Shelf circulation at subtidal frequencies. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Shortest</b> <b>distance</b> {{queries are}} {{essential}} {{not only in}} graph analysis and graph mining tasks but also in database applications, when a large graph needs to be dealt with. Such <b>shortest</b> <b>distance</b> queries are frequently issued by end-users or requested as a subroutine in real applications. For intensive queries on large graphs, it is impractical to compute <b>shortest</b> <b>distances</b> on-line from scratch, and impractical to materialize all-pairs <b>shortest</b> <b>distances.</b> In the literature, 2 -hop distance labeling is proposed to index the all-pairs <b>shortest</b> <b>distances.</b> It assigns distance labels to vertices in a large graph in a pre-computing step off-line and then answers <b>shortest</b> <b>distance</b> queries on-line by making use of such distance labels, which avoids exhaustively traversing the large graph when answer-ing queries. However, the existing algorithms to generate 2 -hop distance labels are not scalable to large graphs. Finding an optimal 2 -hop distance labeling is NP-hard, and heuris-tic algorithms may generate large size distance labels while still needing to pre-compute all-pairs shortest paths. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop distance labeling approach, which generates {{a subset of the}} 2 -hop distance labels as index off-line. We can compute the multi-hop distance labels effi-ciently by avoiding pre-computing all-pairs shortest paths. In addition, our multi-hop distance labeling is small in size to b...|$|R
