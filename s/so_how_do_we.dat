In Nature Communications today, we, along with Richard Evans from CSIRO, show how we developed a new technique to enable the data capacity of a single DVD to increase from 4. 7 gigabytes up to one petabyte (1, 000 terabytes).

Editors of international scientific journals find it {{more and more difficult}} to locate reviewers that are willing to evaluate manuscripts prior to publication (called ‘peer-review’). The most experienced researchers, best qualified to undertake these evaluations, increasingly decline peer-review requests, either because they do not have time or because they have reviewed so many manuscripts that they have become weary of the task.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{combinations}} of consumer utility, production mixes, and factor input combinations consistent with efficiency. In fact, {{there are an}} infinity of consumption and production equilibria that yield Pareto optimal results. There are as many optima as there are points on the aggregate production-possibility frontier. Hence, Pareto efficiency is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for social welfare. Each Pareto optimum corresponds to a different income distribution in the economy. Some may involve great inequalities of income. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> decide which Pareto optimum is most desirable? This decision is made, either tacitly or overtly, when we specify the social welfare function. This function embodies value judgements about interpersonal utility.

He illuminates the fluid boundaries between external and internal reality. How do we move from the experience of an enemy we must destroy to one we believe we might talk with? How does the commitment to something larger than the self contribute to the creation of terrorists? These are not trivial questions.

Academics, courts, and the public appear skeptical of current consent search practices; <b>so,</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> get here? Step back to 1969 when President Nixon appointed Warren Burger to replace Earl Warren as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. At that time, many believed Burger’s “law and order” background foretold Miranda’s overruling. That never happened; a handful of commentators and historians therefore view the Burger Court’s criminal procedure decisions as anticlimactic. That view overlooks the Burger Court’s crowning anti-Miranda achievement: Schneckloth v. Bustamonte. Schneckloth made clear that warning citizens of their constitutional rights had no place outside the context of custodial interrogation. No article has asked an important and fundamental question about the Schneckloth opinion: what set of circumstances led the Court to conclude that the Fourth Amendment does not require that citizens be informed of their right to refuse consent? This Article argues that Schneckloth {{is the product of a}} truly unique confluence of social, political, and judicial circumstances. By properly understanding Schneckloth in its broader historical context, the Article reveals its truly anomalous nature and similarly reveals why the Court should reconsider whether the Fourth Amendment requires officers to inform citizens of their right to refuse consent...|$|R
