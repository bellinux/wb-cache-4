5|$|Four {{days after}} the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace, Wells <b>Spicer.</b> Morgan and Virgil were still {{recovering}} at home. Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $10,000 bail, which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch, local mine owner E.B. Gage, Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge, and other business owners appreciative of the Earps' efforts to maintain order. Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending {{the outcome of the}} trial. Justice <b>Spicer</b> convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial.|$|E

5|$|Much of what {{is known}} of the event is based on a month-long {{preliminary}} hearing held afterward, generally known as the <b>Spicer</b> hearings.

5000|$|The {{flavor of}} a <b>spice</b> is derived {{in part from}} {{compounds}} (volatile oils) that oxidize or evaporate when exposed to air. Grinding a <b>spice</b> greatly increases its surface area and so increases the rates of oxidation and evaporation. Thus, flavor is maximized by storing a <b>spice</b> whole and grinding when needed. The shelf life of a whole dry <b>spice</b> is roughly two years; of a ground <b>spice</b> roughly six months. The [...] "flavor life" [...] of a ground <b>spice</b> can be much shorter. Ground <b>spices</b> are better stored away from light.|$|R
5|$|On October 30, as {{permitted}} by territorial law, Ike Clanton filed murder {{charges against the}} Earps and Holliday.

5|$|<b>Spicer</b> took {{written and}} oral {{testimony}} {{from a number}} of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory.

5|$|After {{extensive}} testimony, Justice <b>Spicer</b> {{ruled on}} November 30 {{that there was}} not enough evidence to indict the men. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been deputized temporarily by Virgil. Though the Earps and Holliday were free, their reputations had been tarnished. The Cowboys in Tombstone looked upon the Earps as robbers and murderers and plotted revenge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of weaner rabbits fed diets containing Monodora nyristica <b>Spice,</b> Zingiber official (ginger <b>spice)</b> and Cocos nucifera (coconut <b>spice)</b> respectively was {{compared with that}} of weaner rabbits fed diet that did not contain any of the <b>spices</b> to ascertain the influence of <b>spices</b> on the utilization of cassava peel meal. Four diets 1, 2, 3 and 4 were formulated with diet 1 (control) containing no <b>spice</b> while diets 2, 3 and 4 contained Monodora myrsitica, Zingiber ans Cocos nucifera soices respectively. The experiment was a completely Randomized Design with four treatments and two replicates each. Thirty-two weaner rabbits (New Zealand White X Chinchilla) were used with four rabbits per replicate and eight per treatment in the experiment which lasted eight weeks. The final body weight, and weight gain of rabbits fed Zingiber officinal <b>spice</b> diets were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than the other diets (1, 2 and 4). The feed intake of the diets containing the <b>spices</b> (diets 2, 3 and 4) was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than diet 1 (control) which had no <b>spice.</b> This shows that the <b>spices</b> made the diets more palatable than the diet without <b>spice.</b> The feed conversion ratio of rabbits fed the diet containing Zingiber officinal <b>spice</b> was significantly better (p< 0. 05) than others. The hemoglobin and packed cell volume content of the blood of rabbits fed Zingiber officinal <b>spice</b> were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in the percentage dressed weight and erum cholesterol contents of the rabbits fed all the treatment diets. For economics of production, the diet containing Monodora myristica recorded the highest cost per kg feed whereas the containing Zingiber officinal had the highest cost per kg weight gain. <b>Spices</b> especially ginger <b>spice</b> enhanced the utilization of cassava peel meal. Key words: Monodora myristica <b>spice,</b> Zingiber officinal <b>spices,</b> cocos nucifera <b>spice...</b>|$|R

5|$|Formal singing {{schools were}} the first {{well-documented}} musical institution in Baltimore. They were common in colonial North America prior to the Revolutionary War, but were not established in Baltimore until afterwards, in 1789. These singing schools were taught by instructors known as masters, or singing masters, and were often itinerant; they taught vocal performance and techniques for use in Christian psalmody. The first singing school in Baltimore was founded in the courthouse, in 1789, by Ishmael <b>Spicer,</b> whose students would include the future John Cole.|$|E
5|$|Frank Stilwell {{had just}} arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup.

40|$|Since {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the Modelica development ambitions for electronic simulation exist. The electronic simulator <b>SPICE,</b> the <b>SPICE</b> models and the <b>SPICE</b> netlists grew to a quasi standard in electronics simulation for the last 30 years.

This paper deals with modeling the <b>SPICE</b> 3 models in Modelica directly extracted from the original <b>SPICE</b> 3 source code. This courses the problem of transforming the sequential simulator-internal model descriptions of <b>SPICE</b> to the declarative description from Modelica. To solve this problem a way was developed and tested for some <b>SPICE</b> 3 semiconductor models. The actual library is presented and further plans are shown...|$|R

5|$|As {{the series}} began filming in Vancouver, the University of British Columbia campus {{served as a}} {{substitute}} for Harvard University. Because of its heritage buildings and antique storefronts, many of the scenes set in the alternate universe were shot in New Westminster, an area outside Vancouver. Consulting producer and previous Fringe director Akiva Goldsman returned to direct several episodes, as did producer Brad Anderson, executive producer Joe Chappelle, and producer Paul Edwards. One time guest directors for the season included Bryan <b>Spicer,</b> Jon Cassar, Dennis Smith, Paul Holahan, Jeannot Szwarc, Frederick E. O.

5|$|Behan {{testified that}} when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom {{might have had a}} pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's {{testimony}} was significant, since he was a prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the <b>Spicer</b> hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E
5|$|From Conakry, Penfold also {{assisted}} Kabbah {{in negotiations}} with Sandline International—a private military company led by Tim <b>Spicer,</b> a former British Army officer—whom Kabbah intended to hire to lead a counter-coup. Sandline had been contracted to provide assistance to the Nigerian-led forces in Sierra Leone {{at a time when}} relations between the UK and Nigeria were poor, so Penfold used Sandline personnel to liaise with the Nigerians to provide intelligence for Kabbah and the British High Commission. In February 1998, a coalition of Nigerian troops and local militia—assisted by Sandline—restored Kabbah to power, and Penfold was transported back to Freetown by a British warship. The role of Sandline, however, sparked a political controversy in the United Kingdom, as the company was accused of violating an international arms embargo on Sierra Leone. Penfold was ordered back to the UK, where he was investigated by HM Customs and Excise for allegedly assisting <b>Spicer</b> in violating the embargo. Customs dropped their investigation after deciding it was not in the public interest to prosecute anybody, but Foreign Secretary Robin Cook ordered a parliamentary inquiry into what the FCO knew about Sandline's contract with Kabbah. Penfold received a reprimand for failing to report adequately on his dealings with Sandline, and the inquiry—led by Sir Thomas Legg—recommended better communication between the FCO and the high commissioner.|$|E
50|$|Pumpkin pie <b>spice</b> is an American <b>spice</b> mix {{commonly}} {{used as an}} ingredient in pumpkin pie {{since at least the}} 1890s. Pumpkin pie <b>spice</b> (sometimes also referred to as Pumpkin <b>spice)</b> is similar to the British and Commonwealth mixed <b>spice.</b> It is generally a blend of ground cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and sometimes allspice.

50|$|A <b>spice</b> is a seed, fruit, root, bark, {{or other}} plant {{substance}} primarily used for flavoring, coloring or preserving food. <b>Spices</b> are distinguished from herbs, {{which are the}} leaves, flowers, or stems from plants used for flavoring or as a garnish. Sometimes, <b>spices</b> may be ground into a powder for convenience. Many <b>spices</b> have antimicrobial properties. This may explain why <b>spices</b> are more commonly used in warmer climates, which have more infectious diseases, and why the use of <b>spices</b> is prominent in meat, which is particularly susceptible to spoiling. <b>Spices</b> are sometimes used in medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics or perfume production, or as a vegetable.|$|R

5|$|Cullompton United Charities {{provides}} {{a number of}} charitable services to residents of Cullompton. The majority of the funds come from bequests made to the parish from the seventeenth century onwards. Thirteen separate charities were combined in 1921 and then in 1953 further amalgamation went on with the Trott's almshouses, John Lanes Charity and the Charity of George <b>Spicer</b> combining to form the current United Charities. There are nine local almshouses which are available to local residents {{over the age of}} 55. They also offer Alpha Piperline emergency call services for the elderly, can refund up to £100 to school leavers under 25 who have spent money equipping themselves with tools, books, vocational training or further education and offer financial help needy individuals resident in the parish to help them purchase specific items. They also own a building called Community House in the town centre, where local organisations can hire meeting rooms.|$|E
5|$|Relinquishing his {{position}} with the Navy Office in 1962, Becher {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London. In January 1964 he returned to Australia, and was made Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. During his time in this role Becher became embroiled in the controversy that followed the collision of HMA Ships Voyager and Melbourne, which took place in February that year. Prior to giving evidence before the Royal Commission that had been established to investigate the incident, Becher had discussed events with Melbournes Commanding Officer, Commander Ronald Robertson. The discussion became public knowledge, and led to suggestions of conspiracy. Becher stated to the commission that Melbourne should have questioned Voyagers final movements; his evidence is alleged to have influenced the Royal Commissioner, Sir John <b>Spicer,</b> to place a degree of blame on Robertson. In 1965, Becher assumed his final command as Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area, before retiring from the Royal Australian Navy on 6 March 1966.|$|E
5|$|Spence and Stilwell were arraigned on {{the robbery}} charges before Justice Wells <b>Spicer,</b> who set their bail at $7,000 each.
