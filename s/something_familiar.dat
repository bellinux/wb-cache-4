25|$|Klein {{made much}} more {{explicit}} {{the idea that}} each geometrical language had its own, appropriate concepts, thus for example projective geometry rightly talked about conic sections, but not about circles or angles because those notions were not invariant under projective transformations (<b>something</b> <b>familiar</b> in geometrical perspective). The way the multiple languages of geometry then came back together {{could be explained by}} the way subgroups of a symmetry group related to each other.|$|E
500|$|Alan Wake was {{influenced}} by and often alludes to certain films, TV shows, and books, as well as paying homage {{to a number of}} artists and works. Remedy has explained the shared themes and ideas between the game and other existing works of popular culture as [...] "taking <b>something</b> <b>familiar</b> to people as an element, and building something of your own, and hopefully something [...] unique in games, but still familiar from other forms of entertainment." ...|$|E
500|$|Alex da Kid {{was also}} interviewed by Rap-Up, {{and when asked}} about the {{commercial}} flop of the song and he said, [...] "My whole thing [...] I don’t want to do anything that’s the same as what’s out there, I think 'Massive Attack' may have been too different. If we would've put a big feature on it, like a Kanye or Rihanna or someone, I think it might've done a bit better. It needed <b>something</b> <b>familiar</b> about it." ...|$|E

500|$|New Zealand singer Hayley Westenra covered [...] "I'm Kissing You" [...] for her 2007 album Prayer. [...] "Kissing You" [...] {{was covered}} by Taylor Dayne, whose version appears as the eighth track on her fifth studio album, Satisfied (2008). Her {{recording}} contains slow jam drums and backing singers. Australian Idol winner Stan Walker recorded his rendition of the song as the twelfth track on his second studio album, From the Inside Out (2010). Allmusic's Jon O'Brien called it [...] "a faithful rendition". The New Zealand Heralds Kara Scott noted that his cover was [...] "a little over-wrought and soppy, [...] it shows the true range and quality of Walker's voice." [...] Cameron Adams of The Daily Telegraph noted that [...] "for {{those who want to}} hear that voice sing <b>something</b> <b>familiar,</b> the lush but simple cover of Des'ree's 'Kissing You' will cause jaws to drop." ...|$|E
500|$|Maintaining {{the bright}} and danceable feel from Com Truise's 2011 debut studio album Galactic Melt and garnering {{more of a}} melodic {{approach}} than previous releases of the project, Wave 1 {{is a combination of}} synth soul, drum and bass, synth funk, electro, and, {{in the words of a}} Pitchfork Media reviewer, [...] "fussy 80s computer-pop". Seth Haley has described the character of Com Truise as the first ever [...] "Synthetic Astronaut", and each release under the name shows the next part in this voyage to a planet. Wave 1 is a part of the story where he lands on a sort-of replica of Earth, and Haley thought there was [...] "something eerie about it, <b>something</b> <b>familiar</b> but something peculiar as well." [...] Because this was also meant to be a part of the story where the music starts changing, he had taken inspiration from several acts including New Order and Prince to have a much broader range of tempos and styles in each track.|$|E
500|$|Modern Vampires of the City was {{an attempt}} Vampire Weekend to {{distance}} themselves from the sounds featured on their debut record and Contra. [...] "Whenever we came up with <b>something</b> <b>familiar</b> sounding, it was rejected", said Rechtshaid. Pitch shifting was a major component of recording the album. For tracks such as [...] "Step", drums were recorded on a Varispeed Tape deck set to a lower speed so that they would play back faster and more high pitched. Drummer Chris Tomson would then re-record the drums playing to the sped-up recording to get an uptempo live take. This second recording was then slowed back down to original speed to create an [...] "underwater" [...] effect. The effect is featured prominently on vocals as well. Ezra Koenig's vocals were run through Eventide H949 and 910 on tracks such as [...] "Diane Young", with both the pitch and formant shifted changed to manipulate the sound of recorded vocals. Bass guitar was also recorded straight to tape [...] "with a fairly ambient miking approach where the mic was three feet away from the cabinet". Vocals were recorded with Soundelux U99 Microphones, in combination with 1176 Classic limiter plug-in, Fairchild 670 Compressor and Elektro-Mess-Technik 140 Plate Reverb, giving the vocals a quality Batmanglij described as [...] "buttery". For guitar sounds, Batmanglij chose not to mic his guitar and instead plugged his Les Paul direct-in to ProTools through a SansAmp Amp Emulation Pedal, a technique used by Jimmy Page.|$|E

6000|$|So {{there were}} nightjars here in India, too!

6000|$|Sweet as {{this voice}} was, it irritated him, for {{he could not}} {{disassociate}} his mother from it. Indeed, it had <b>something</b> subtly <b>familiar</b> in its utterance, and yet he could not accuse her of deceit. He only roughly said: [...] "Don't do that! I don't like that!" ...|$|R
60|$|Cecily did not {{recognize}} him, yet there was <b>something</b> vaguely <b>familiar</b> about him. She walked rapidly up to the house.

60|$|He {{was smiling}} {{and the girl}} smiled back at him. There was a {{slightly}} puzzled expression on her face--there was <b>something</b> tantalizingly <b>familiar</b> about that smile of his.
