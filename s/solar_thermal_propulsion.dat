40|$|Several {{advanced}} propulsion {{options for}} a split-mission piloted Mars exploration scenario are presented. The primary study {{focus is on}} identifying concepts that can reduce total initial mass in low earth orbit (IMLEO) for the cargo delivery portion of the mission; in addition, concepts that can reduce the trip time of the piloted option are assessed. The propulsion options considered are nuclear <b>thermal</b> <b>propulsion,</b> <b>solar</b> sails, multimegawatt-class nuclear electric propulsion, solar electric propulsion, magnetic sails, mass drivers, rail guns, <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> rockets, beamed-energy <b>propulsion</b> systems, and tethers.

40|$|Recently, {{refractive}} secondary {{solar concentrator}} systems were developed for <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power and <b>propulsion</b> (ref. 1). Single-crystal oxides-such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2), yttrium aluminum garnet (Y 3 Al 5 O 12, or YAG), magnesium oxide (MgO), and sapphire (Al 2 O 3) -are candidate refractive secondary concentrator materials. However, the refractive concentrator system will experience high-temperature thermal cycling in the <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> engine during the sun/shade transition {{of a space}} mission. The thermal mechanical reliability of these components in severe thermal environments is of great concern. Simulated mission tests are important for evaluating these candidate oxide materials {{under a variety of}} transient and steady-state heat flux conditions. In this research at the NASA Lewis Research Center, a controlled heat flux test approach was developed for investigating the thermal mechanical stability of the candidate oxide. This approach used a 3. 0 -kW continuous-wave (wavelength, 10. 6 mm) carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser (ref. 2). The CO 2 laser is especially well-suited for single-crystal thermal shock tests because it can directly deliver well-characterized heat energy to the oxide surfaces. Since the oxides are opaque at the 10. 6 -mm wavelength of the laser beam, the light energy is absorbed at the surfaces rather than transmitting into the crystals, and thus generates the required temperature gradients within the specimens. The following figure is a schematic diagram of the test rig...|$|R
50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> {{is a form}} of {{spacecraft}} propulsion {{that makes}} use of solar power to directly heat reaction mass, and therefore does not require an electrical generator as most other forms of solar-powered propulsion do. A solar thermal rocket only has to carry the means of capturing solar energy, such as concentrators and mirrors. The heated propellant is fed through a conventional rocket nozzle to produce thrust. The engine thrust {{is directly related to the}} surface area of the solar collector and to the local intensity of the solar radiation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{laser thermal}} rocket is a thermal rocket {{in which the}} {{propellant}} is heated by energy provided by an external laser beam. [...] The beam heats a solid heat exchanger, which in turn heats an inert liquid propellant, converting it to hot gas which is exhausted through a conventional nozzle. This is similar in principle to nuclear thermal and <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>propulsion.</b> Using a large flat heat exchanger allows the laser beam to shine directly on the heat exchanger without focusing optics on the vehicle. The HX thruster {{has the advantage of}} working equally well with any laser wavelength and both CW and pulsed lasers, and of having an efficiency approaching 100%. The HX thruster is limited by the heat exchanger material and by radiative losses to relatively low gas temperatures, typically 1000 - 2000 C. For a given temperature, the specific impulse is maximized with the minimum molecular weight reaction mass, and with hydrogen propellant, that provides sufficient specific impulse as high as 600 - 800 seconds, high enough in principle to allow single stage vehicles to reach low Earth orbit. The HX laser thruster concept was developed by Jordin Kare in 1991; a similar microwave thermal propulsion concept was developed independently by Kevin L. Parkin at Caltech in 2001.|$|E

40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>thermal</b> {{upper stage}} <b>propulsion</b> systems {{currently}} under development utilize small low chamber pressure/high area ratio nozzles. Consequently, the resulting {{flow in the}} nozzle is highly viscous, with the boundary layer flow comprising a significant {{fraction of the total}} nozzle flow area. Conventional uncoupled flow methods which treat the nozzle boundary layer and inviscid flowfield separately by combining the two calculations via the influence of the boundary layer displacement thickness on the inviscid flowfield are not accurate enough to adequately treat highly viscous nozzles. Navier Stokes models such as VNAP 2 can treat these flowfields but cannot perform a vacuum plume expansion for applications where the exhaust plume produces induced environments on adjacent structures. This study is built upon recently developed artificial intelligence methods and user interface methodologies to couple the VNAP 2 model for treating viscous nozzle flowfields with a vacuum plume flowfield model (RAMP 2) that is currently a part of the Plume Environment Prediction (PEP) Model.

Mission performance models were created based on this information in order to estimate performance and mass characteristics of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems. Mission analysis was performed for a set of reference missions to assess the capabilities and benefits of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> in comparison with alternative in-space propulsion systems such as chemical and electric propulsion. Mission analysis included estimation of delta V requirements as well as payload capabilities for a range of missions. Launch requirements and costs, and integration into launch vehicles, were also considered. The mission set included representative robotic scientific missions, and potential future NASA human missions beyond low Earth orbit. Commercial communications satellite delivery missions were also included, because if STP technology were selected for that application, frequent use is implied and this would help amortize costs for technology advancement and systems development. A C 3 Topper mission was defined, calling for a relatively small STP. The application is to augment the launch energy (C 3) available from launch vehicles with their built-in upper stages. Payload masses were obtained from references where available. The communications satellite masses represent the range of payload capabilities for the Delta IV Medium and/or Atlas launch vehicle family. Results indicated that STP could improve payload capability over current systems, but that this advantage cannot be realized except in a few cases because of payload fairing volume limitations on current launch vehicles. It was also found that acquiring a more capable (existing) launch vehicle, rather than adding an STP stage, is the most economical in most cases...|$|E

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2001, the author {{embarked}} on an investigation of small (3 ̆c 100 kg) satellites augmented with high-performance <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> (STP). Small satellites have historically been confined to low earth orbits, with only a very limited capability to alter orbital parameters. A <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> system, properly downsized, could enable microsatellites to perform missions to high earth orbit, as well as lunar, near earth asteroid, and interplanetary intercepts, {{without the aid of}} expensive upper stages. Specific impulses of up to 400 seconds (s) are theoretically achievable, with storable monopropellants; velocity changes of up to 3, 000 m/s may therefore be attained. This paper will briefly review a selection of benchmark missions and their requirements, and the preliminary and detailed design choices including specific ground rules. However, the focus of the paper is on recent component test results in three key areas: (1) novel ceramic gasketing and metal-to-ceramic bonding methods, a necessity for hermetically sealing the solar thermal cavity receiver; (2) optical performance measurements of a lightweight metal solar concentrating mirror; and (3) thermal performance measurements of the insulated cavity receiver in a series of electrical heating tests in vacuum. A comparison of test data will be made to the results of the author’s optical and thermal models, demonstrating strong agreement between predicted and actual results.

Upper stage space transfer vehicles needed to accomplish this task should ideally be simple, robust, and highly efficient. In this regard, <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> is particularly well suited to those missions where high thrust is not a requirement. The Marshall Space Flight Center is, therefore, currently engaged in defining a transfer vehicle employing <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>propulsion</b> capable of transferring a 1000 lb. payload from low Earth orbit (LEO) to a geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) using a Lockheed launch vehicle (LLV 3) with three Castors and a large shroud.

40|$|AbstractSolar {{electricity}} generation using concentrating <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> collectors faces {{the challenge of}} strongly decreased levelized electricity costs by photovoltaic power plants. One of the selling points favouring <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power is the possibility to generate dispatchable power. Concepts discussed here are solar hybridization of conventional or biomass thermal power plants. Another option {{is the use of}} thermal energy storage (TES) charged with solar heat which allow to drive the generation of electricity by steam turbines also during hours with no or low solar irradiation. Usually the solar fields of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power plants utilizing storage with several hours capacity will be much larger than those of plants without storage. This contributes to much higher cost per installed capacity in the case of storage utilization. In this paper the question shall be tackled in a rather fundamental way whether the combination of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power with cheaper photovoltaic systems plus minimum <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power with storage may give lower levelized electricity cost plus dispatchability than either photovoltaics alone or <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power alone. For the investigation of a combined PV-enhanced <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power plant no specifically developed software was available. Therefore the simulation of the photovoltaic plant and the <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power plant including TES was done individually. For the <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power plant TES storage capacity and solar field area were varied. Solar field area ranged between solar multiple of two and below one. The latter choice would have been senseless without PV-enhancement. Hourly power generations profiles over a complete year were combined and matched in order to generate electricity according to a prescribed demand curve. Using dispatch prescriptions the scheduling of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power was controlled. With typical generic cost data and variations of those in a sensitivity study the combined levelized electricity cost were determined and analysed. Photovoltaic generation and <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power generation via thermal energy storage may produce high annual capacity factors above 50 % due to dispatchable solar power from the thermal storage. Depending on the climatic conditions and on seasonal and daily load profiles the combinations of photovoltaic and <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power may change. Many open questions have to be solved in order to proceed with the basic idea of PV-enhanced <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power generation. Real cost data and optimization requires a specific project case.
