40|$|The worst {{scenario}} of drilling operation is blowout which is uncontrolled flow of formation fluid into the wellbore. Blowouts result in environmental damage with potential risk of injuries and fatalities. Although not all blowouts result in disaster, outcomes of blowouts are unknown {{and should be}} studied before starting an operation. Plans {{should be available to}} prevent blowouts or provide safe and secure ways of controlling the well before the drilling operation starts. The plan should include procedures in case of any blowout incident as a proactive measure. A few commercial softwares are available in the industry for dynamic kill and transient modeling. All models are proprietary and very complex which reduces the flexibility of the program for specific cases. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a pseudo transient hydraulic simulator for dynamic kill operations. The idea and concept is to consider the flow of each phase as a single phase flow. The summation of hydrostatic and frictional pressure of each phase determines the bottomhole pressure during the dynamic kill operation. The simulator should be versatile and capable of handling special cases that may encounter during blowouts. Some of the main features of the proposed dynamic kill simulator include; quick and robust simulation, fluid properties are corrected for pressure and temperature, sensitivity analysis can be performed through <b>slide</b> <b>bars,</b> and capable of handling variety of wellbore trajectories. The results from the proposed simulator were compared to the result of commercial software, OLGA ABC. The results were in agreement with each other.

O {{principal}} objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a evoluÃƒÃƒo os processos controladores da morfologia e hidrologia da Lagoa das AlmÃƒcegas visando gerar informaÃƒÃƒes Ãƒteis ao uso e gestÃƒo desse recurso hÃƒdrico costeiro. A origem da lagoa das AlmÃƒcegas estÃƒ subordinada ao comportamento climÃƒtico-natural da Ãƒrea, bastante influenciado pela dinÃƒmica litorÃƒnea. Com a gÃƒnese relacionada aos processos transgressivos e regressivos do mar, e barramento do riacho pelo sistema de dunas (transporte eÃƒlico) e processos associado (descarga fluvial), sendo posteriormente com a construÃƒÃƒo da barragem. A metodologia utilizada para realizaÃƒÃƒo desta pesquisa baseia-se na compreensÃƒo da organizaÃƒÃƒo da natureza dentro do espaÃƒo, e a relaÃƒÃƒo que ocorre entre seus componentes. Para tanto foram realizadas analises dos parÃƒmetros fÃƒsicos e quÃƒmicos da Ãƒgua: temperatura, condutividade elÃƒtrica, turbidez, pH e transparÃƒncia. Ademais, foram coletadas amostras de subsuperfÃƒcie e fundo para a investigaÃƒÃƒo de material em suspensÃƒo. TambÃƒm, realizou-se a caracterizaÃƒÃƒo sedimentolÃƒgica, analise de matÃƒria orgÃƒnica e metaisÃ¢traÃƒo (cobre, cÃƒdmio e zinco) no sedimento, e o estudo morfomÃƒtrico e levantamento batimÃƒtrico da lagoa. Os resultados demonstram que o sistema estudado apresentou variaÃƒÃƒo sazonal relacionada aos dois perÃƒodos hidrolÃƒgicos distintos. O perÃƒodo chuvoso se caracterizou por precipitaÃƒÃƒes mais intensas e menor insolaÃƒÃƒo, enquanto que o seco apresentou maior insolaÃƒÃƒo e maiores velocidades dos ventos, trazendo conseqÃƒÃƒncias diretas sobre o nÃƒvel dÃ¢Ãƒgua da lagoa. A coluna dÃ¢Ãƒgua apresentou estratificaÃƒÃƒo (tÃƒrmica) significativa devido principalmente Ãƒ profundidade do sistema, Ãƒ atuaÃƒÃƒo dos ventos e transparÃƒncia da coluna dÃ¢Ãƒgua. A composiÃƒÃƒo granulomÃƒtrica dos sedimentos de fundo da Lagoa das AlmÃƒcegas resultaram em seis classes principais: areia com cascalho esparso (43, 8 %), areia (25 %), areia fina (6, 3 %), areia siltosa (6, 3 %), areia lamosa (6, 3 %), silte (6, 3 %) e silte arenoso (6, 3 %). Observa-se que as fraÃƒÃƒes grossas do sedimento, maiores que 0, 063 mm, ocorrem na grande maioria das amostras, o que pode estÃƒ relacionado ao processo de assoreamento. A distribuiÃƒÃƒo da matÃƒria orgÃƒnica indica os diferentes graus de aeraÃƒÃƒo das diversas Ãƒreas do ambiente de sedimentaÃƒÃƒo. Quanto Ãƒ morfologia a lagoa apresentando uma Ãƒrea de 1, 3 km 2, perÃƒmetro de 9, 935 Km, largura mÃƒxima de 684 m e comprimento de 3, 5 km, volume de 6. 688. 000 mÃ‚, profundidade mÃƒxima de 5, 85 m, profundidade mÃƒdia de 2, 55 m. A relevÃƒncia do volume classifica este reservatÃƒrio como de capacidade de armazenamento satisfatÃƒrio. Em termos de ocupaÃƒÃƒo, a lagoa encontra-se com baixa ocupaÃƒÃƒo imobiliÃƒria, devido principalmente a pouca especulaÃƒÃƒo. Mas, as ocupaÃƒÃƒes que jÃƒ ocorrem na regiÃƒo ultrapassam os limites impostos pela lei (Ãƒreas de PreservaÃƒÃƒo Permanente), jÃƒ a ocupaÃƒÃƒo associada Ãƒ retirada da cobertura vegetal Ãƒ possÃƒvel de ser vista, e este problema pode gerar uma instabilidade das margens e conseqÃƒente alteraÃƒÃƒo das caracterÃƒsticas morfomÃƒtricas e fÃƒsicoquÃƒmicas da lagoa, podendo ocasionar impactos negativos, como aumento do escoamento superficial, erosÃƒo das margens, maior aporte de sedimentos na lagoa, assoreamento, diminuiÃƒÃƒo do volume de Ãƒgua, e maior concentraÃƒÃƒo de poluentes na lagoa, podendo vir a comprometer tambÃƒm a vida da populaÃƒÃƒo local. The coastal lagoon, AlmÃƒcegas, {{are located}} in the coastal West of the State of the CearÃƒ in the verge of the cities of Trairi and Paraipaba. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the evolution the controlling processes of the morphology and hidrology of the Lagoon of the AlmÃƒcegas being aimed at to generate useful information to the use and management of this coastal hÃƒdrico resource. The origin of the lagoon of the AlmÃƒcegas is subordinated to the climatic-natural behavior of the area, sufficiently influenced for the littoral dynamics.

The methodology used for accomplishment of this research is based inside on the understanding of the organization {{of the nature of the}} space, and the relation that occurs between its components. For they had been in such a way carried through you analyze of the physical and chemical parameters of the water: temperature, electric condutividade, turbidez, pH and transparency. Furthermore, had been collected samples of deep subsurface and for the inquiry of material in suspension. Also, it was become fullfilled sedimentation characterization, analyzes of organic substance and metal-traces (it has covered, cadmium and zinc) in the sediment, and the morfomÃƒtrico study and batimÃƒtrico survey of the lagoon. The results demonstrate that the studied system presented related sazonal variation to the two distinct hidrolÃƒgicos periods. The rainy period if characterized for more intense precipitations and lesser insolation, whereas the dry one presented greater insolation and greaters speeds of the winds, bringing direct consequences on the water level of the lagoon. The water column presented stratification (thermal) significant had mainly to the depth of the system, to the performance of the winds and transparency of the water column. The grain sized composition of the sediments of deep of the Lagoon of the AlmÃƒcegas had resulted in six main classrooms: slightly gravelly sand (43. 8 %), sand (25 %), fine sand (6. 3 %), muddy sand (6. 3 %), slightly gravelly muddy sand (6. 3 %), silt (6. 3 %) and sandy silt (6. 3 %). It is observed that the thick fractions of the sediment, greaters that 0, 063 mm, occur in the great majority of the samples, what it can is related to the silting. The distribution of the organic substance indicates the different degrees of aeration of the diverse areas of the sedimentation environment. How much to the morphology the lagoon presenting an area of 1, 3 km 2, perimeter of 9, 935 Km, maximum width of 684 m and length of 3, 5 km, Volume of 6. 688. 000 m Ã‚, maximum depth of 5, 85 m, average depth of 2, 55 m. The relevance of the volume classifies this reservoir as of capacity of satisfactory storage. In occupation terms, the lagoon meets with low real estate occupation, had mainly to little speculation. But, the occupations that already occur in the region exceed the limits taxes for the law (Areas of Permanent Preservation) already the occupation associated with the withdrawal of the vegetal covering are possible of being seen, and this problem can generate an instability of the edges and consequence the alteration of the morfomÃƒtricas characteristics and physicistchemistries of the lagoon, being able to cause negative impacts, as increase of the superficial draining, erosion of the edges, greater arrives in port of sediments in the lagoon, assoreamento, reduction of the volume of water, and greater concentration of pollutants in the lagoon, being able to come also compromising the life of the population place...|$|E
