40|$|The worst {{scenario}} of drilling operation is blowout which is uncontrolled flow of formation fluid into the wellbore. Blowouts result in environmental damage with potential risk of injuries and fatalities. Although not all blowouts result in disaster, outcomes of blowouts are unknown {{and should be}} studied before starting an operation. Plans {{should be available to}} prevent blowouts or provide safe and secure ways of controlling the well before the drilling operation starts. The plan should include procedures in case of any blowout incident as a proactive measure. A few commercial softwares are available in the industry for dynamic kill and transient modeling. All models are proprietary and very complex which reduces the flexibility of the program for specific cases. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a pseudo transient hydraulic simulator for dynamic kill operations. The idea and concept is to consider the flow of each phase as a single phase flow. The summation of hydrostatic and frictional pressure of each phase determines the bottomhole pressure during the dynamic kill operation.

Some of the main features of the proposed dynamic kill simulator include; quick and robust simulation, fluid properties are corrected for pressure and temperature, sensitivity analysis can be performed through <b>slide</b> <b>bars,</b> and capable of handling variety of wellbore trajectories. The results from the proposed simulator were compared to the result of commercial software, OLGA ABC. The results were in agreement with each other.

40|$|A lagoa costeira, AlmÃcegas, estÃ localizada no litoral Oeste do Estado do CearÃ na divisa dos municÃpios de Trairi e Paraipaba. O {{principal}} objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a evoluÃÃo os processos controladores da morfologia e hidrologia da Lagoa das AlmÃcegas visando gerar informaÃÃes Ãteis ao uso e gestÃo desse recurso hÃdrico costeiro. A origem da lagoa das AlmÃcegas estÃ subordinada ao comportamento climÃtico-natural da Ãrea, bastante influenciado pela dinÃmica litorÃnea. Com a gÃnese relacionada aos processos transgressivos e regressivos do mar, e barramento do riacho pelo sistema de dunas (transporte eÃlico) e processos associado (descarga fluvial), sendo posteriormente com a construÃÃo da barragem. A metodologia utilizada para realizaÃÃo desta pesquisa baseia-se na compreensÃo da organizaÃÃo da natureza dentro do espaÃo, e a relaÃÃo que ocorre entre seus componentes. Para tanto foram realizadas analises dos parÃmetros fÃsicos e quÃmicos da Ãgua: temperatura, condutividade elÃtrica, turbidez, pH e transparÃncia. Ademais, foram coletadas amostras de subsuperfÃcie e fundo para a investigaÃÃo de material em suspensÃo. TambÃm, realizou-se a caracterizaÃÃo sedimentolÃgica, analise de matÃria orgÃnica e metaisâtraÃo (cobre, cÃdmio e zinco) no sedimento, e o estudo morfomÃtrico e levantamento batimÃtrico da lagoa. Os resultados demonstram que o sistema estudado apresentou variaÃÃo sazonal relacionada aos dois perÃodos hidrolÃgicos distintos. O perÃodo chuvoso se caracterizou por precipitaÃÃes mais intensas e menor insolaÃÃo, enquanto que o seco apresentou maior insolaÃÃo e maiores velocidades dos ventos, trazendo conseqÃÃncias diretas sobre o nÃvel dâÃgua da lagoa. A coluna dâÃgua apresentou estratificaÃÃo (tÃrmica) significativa devido principalmente Ã profundidade do sistema, Ã atuaÃÃo dos ventos e transparÃncia da coluna dâÃgua. A composiÃÃo granulomÃtrica dos sedimentos de fundo da Lagoa das AlmÃcegas resultaram em seis classes principais: areia com cascalho esparso (43, 8 %), areia (25 %), areia fina (6, 3 %), areia siltosa (6, 3 %), areia lamosa (6, 3 %), silte (6, 3 %) e silte arenoso (6, 3 %). Observa-se que as fraÃÃes grossas do sedimento, maiores que 0, 063 mm, ocorrem na grande maioria das amostras, o que pode estÃ relacionado ao processo de assoreamento. A distribuiÃÃo da matÃria orgÃnica indica os diferentes graus de aeraÃÃo das diversas Ãreas do ambiente de sedimentaÃÃo. Quanto Ã morfologia a lagoa apresentando uma Ãrea de 1, 3 km 2, perÃmetro de 9, 935 Km, largura mÃxima de 684 m e comprimento de 3, 5 km, volume de 6. 688. 000 mÂ, profundidade mÃxima de 5, 85 m, profundidade mÃdia de 2, 55 m. A relevÃncia do volume classifica este reservatÃrio como de capacidade de armazenamento satisfatÃrio. Em termos de ocupaÃÃo, a lagoa encontra-se com baixa ocupaÃÃo imobiliÃria, devido principalmente a pouca especulaÃÃo. Mas, as ocupaÃÃes que jÃ ocorrem na regiÃo ultrapassam os limites impostos pela lei (Ãreas de PreservaÃÃo Permanente), jÃ a ocupaÃÃo associada Ã retirada da cobertura vegetal Ã possÃvel de ser vista, e este problema pode gerar uma instabilidade das margens e conseqÃente alteraÃÃo das caracterÃsticas morfomÃtricas e fÃsicoquÃmicas da lagoa, podendo ocasionar impactos negativos, como aumento do escoamento superficial, erosÃo das margens, maior aporte de sedimentos na lagoa, assoreamento, diminuiÃÃo do volume de Ãgua, e maior concentraÃÃo de poluentes na lagoa, podendo vir a comprometer tambÃm a vida da populaÃÃo local. The coastal lagoon, AlmÃcegas, {{are located}} in the coastal West of the State of the CearÃ in the verge of the cities of Trairi and Paraipaba. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the evolution the controlling processes of the morphology and hidrology of the Lagoon of the AlmÃcegas being aimed at to generate useful information to the use and management of this coastal hÃdrico resource. The origin of the lagoon of the AlmÃcegas is subordinated to the climatic-natural behavior of the area, sufficiently influenced for the littoral dynamics. With genesis related to the transgression and regression processes of the sea, and <b>slide</b> <b>bars</b> of the extended river for the dune system (aeolian transport) and processes associated (fluvial discharge), being later with the construction of the barrage. The methodology used for accomplishment of this research is based inside on the understanding of the organization {{of the nature of the}} space, and the relation that occurs between its components. For they had been in such a way carried through you analyze of the physical and chemical parameters of the water: temperature, electric condutividade, turbidez, pH and transparency. Furthermore, had been collected samples of deep subsurface and for the inquiry of material in suspension. Also, it was become fullfilled sedimentation characterization, analyzes of organic substance and metal-traces (it has covered, cadmium and zinc) in the sediment, and the morfomÃtrico study and batimÃtrico survey of the lagoon. The results demonstrate that the studied system presented related sazonal variation to the two distinct hidrolÃgicos periods. The rainy period if characterized for more intense precipitations and lesser insolation, whereas the dry one presented greater insolation and greaters speeds of the winds, bringing direct consequences on the water level of the lagoon. The water column presented stratification (thermal) significant had mainly to the depth of the system, to the performance of the winds and transparency of the water column. The grain sized composition of the sediments of deep of the Lagoon of the AlmÃcegas had resulted in six main classrooms: slightly gravelly sand (43. 8 %), sand (25 %), fine sand (6. 3 %), muddy sand (6. 3 %), slightly gravelly muddy sand (6. 3 %), silt (6. 3 %) and sandy silt (6. 3 %). It is observed that the thick fractions of the sediment, greaters that 0, 063 mm, occur in the great majority of the samples, what it can is related to the silting. The distribution of the organic substance indicates the different degrees of aeration of the diverse areas of the sedimentation environment. How much to the morphology the lagoon presenting an area of 1, 3 km 2, perimeter of 9, 935 Km, maximum width of 684 m and length of 3, 5 km, Volume of 6. 688. 000 m Â, maximum depth of 5, 85 m, average depth of 2, 55 m. The relevance of the volume classifies this reservoir as of capacity of satisfactory storage. In occupation terms, the lagoon meets with low real estate occupation, had mainly to little speculation. But, the occupations that already occur in the region exceed the limits taxes for the law (Areas of Permanent Preservation) already the occupation associated with the withdrawal of the vegetal covering are possible of being seen, and this problem can generate an instability of the edges and consequence the alteration of the morfomÃtricas characteristics and physicistchemistries of the lagoon, being able to cause negative impacts, as increase of the superficial draining, erosion of the edges, greater arrives in port of sediments in the lagoon, assoreamento, reduction of the volume of water, and greater concentration of pollutants in the lagoon, being able to come also compromising the life of the population place...|$|E
