The reduced functionality varies based on whether {{the operating system}} is <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> grace or has undergone a failed activation. In the former case, built-in games and premium features like Windows Aero are disabled, and the system is rebooted every hour; in the latter case, certain premium features are disabled and some content is not available from Windows Update.|$|E
25|$|Before {{declining to}} return to active service, Sassoon had thrown his Military Cross into the River Mersey at Formby beach. According to his {{description}} of this incident in Memoirs of an Infantry Officer {{he did not do}} this as a symbolic rejection of militaristic values, but <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the need to perform some destructive act in catharsis of the black mood which was afflicting him; his account states that one of his pre-war sporting trophies, had he had one to hand, would have served his purpose equally well.|$|E
25|$|The metaphysical and cosmological {{significance}} of marriage within Islam – particularly within Sufism or Islamic mysticism – {{is difficult to}} overstate. The relationship and interplay {{between male and female}} is viewed as nothing less than that between heaven (represented by the husband) and earth (symbolised by the wife). Because of her beauty and virtue, the earth is eminently lovable: heaven marries her not <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> duty, but for pleasure and joy. Marriage and sexual intercourse are not merely human phenomena, but the universal power of productivity found within every level of existence: sex within marriage is the supreme instance of witnessing God in the full splendour of His self-disclosure.|$|E

25|$|In response, the Republicans {{appealed to}} {{democratic}} principles. Samuel Smith of Maryland {{argued that the}} presidency ought to be as closely accountable to the people as possible. As such, having three candidates in a contingency election is far better than having five, because {{it is possible to}} have the fifth best candidate become President otherwise. Also, designation itself would drastically cut down the number of elections that would reach the house, and the President is then {{much more likely to be}} the people’s choice. Another of Smith’s arguments was simply the election of 1800. William Cocke of Tennessee took a different approach when he argued that the entire small state argument of the Federalists was <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> self-interest.|$|E
25|$|Stephenson and {{the other}} {{salesmen}} and office seekers who maneuvered for control of Indiana's Invisible Empire lacked both the ability {{and the desire to}} use the political system to carry out the Klan's stated goals. They were uninterested in, or perhaps even unaware of, grass roots concerns within the movement. For them, the Klan had been nothing more than a means for gaining wealth and power. These marginal men had risen {{to the top of the}} hooded order because, until it became a political force, the Klan had never required strong, dedicated leadership. More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan, or who pursued some of the interests of their Klan constituents, also accomplished little. Factionalism created one barrier, but many politicians had supported the Klan <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> expedience. When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement, those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan's behalf.|$|E
25|$|The {{executive}} magistrates of the Roman Kingdom {{were elected}} {{officials of the}} ancient Roman Kingdom. During {{the period of the}} Roman Kingdom, the Roman King was the principal executive magistrate. He was the chief executive, chief priest, chief lawgiver, chief judge, and the sole commander-in-chief of the army. His powers rested on law and legal precedent, and he could only receive these powers through the political process of an election. In practice, he had no real restrictions on his power. When war broke out, he had the sole power to organize and levy troops, to select leaders for the army, and to conduct the campaign as he saw fit. He controlled all property held by the state, had the sole power to divide land and war spoils, was the chief representative of the city during dealings with either the Gods or leaders of other communities, and could unilaterally decree any new law. Sometimes he submitted his decrees to either the popular assembly or to the senate for a ceremonial ratification, but a rejection did not prevent the enactment of a decree. The king chose several officers to assist him, and unilaterally granted them their powers. When the king left the city, an Urban Prefect presided over the city in place of the absent king. The king also had two Quaestors as general assistants, while several other officers assisted the king during treason cases. In war, the king occasionally commanded only the infantry, and delegated command over the cavalry to the commander of his personal bodyguards, the Tribune of the Celeres. The king sometimes deferred to precedent, often <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> practical necessity. While the king could unilaterally declare war, for example, he typically wanted to have such declarations ratified by the popular assembly.|$|E

500|$|Zobel used {{a design}} {{technique}} {{based on his}} theoretical discovery that the impedance looking into {{the end of a}} filter chain was practically the same (within the limits of component tolerances) as the theoretical impedance of an infinite chain after {{only a small number of}} sections had been added to the chain. These [...] "image" [...] impedances have a mathematical characterization impossible to construct <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> discrete components, and can only ever be approximated. Zobel found that using these impedances constructed out of small filter chains as components in a greater network allowed him to build realistic line simulators. These were not in any sense intended as practical filters in the field, but rather the intention was to construct good controllable line simulators without having the inconvenience of miles of cable to contend with.|$|E
500|$|Square {{released}} the game December 1989 in Japan as Makai Toushi Sa·Ga and included a map {{for the four}} major worlds in the game; a revised version followed shortly after. Square translated it to English in March 1990, and planned to release it in North America with new artwork as The Great Warrior Saga. Square retitled it The Final Fantasy Legend before releasing it on September 30, 1990 to tie into {{the popularity of the}} Final Fantasy video game. Developers made slight modifications for this version, such as removing the game's credits and adjusting the longevity of certain weapons. Changes to the text were also made, including the omission of some of Ryu-O's riddles, removal of mention about self-sacrifice and a hint of the Tower's true purpose. Notably, the exchange between the player's party and the Creator, where the latter reveals that he created Asura <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> boredom, is altered. In 1998, Sunsoft acquired the license to the Game Boy [...] "Final Fantasy" [...] games, re-releasing them in North America the same year. Despite advertising compatibility with Nintendo's Game Boy Color handheld, the re-released version featured no enhancements.|$|E
500|$|Stewart said, due to Max's {{past events}} with his family, what Abi might say when Max objects to her {{relationship}} with Jay, [...] "It won't be her setting a gerbil on him", calling her a [...] "goody-two-shoes". A writer from the Western Mail said that the Branning/Mitchell Feud makes Abi and Jay feel like [...] "Walford's answer to Romeo and Juliet". Two writers from the Daily Mirror mocked the storyline where Abi turns down the trip to Costa Rica. One said, [...] "An extreme case of soap agoraphobia as brilliant Abi sensibly turns down the chance to spend eight weeks in the tropical paradise of Costa Rica. But in the tiny micro-world of EastEnders, even the three-mile odyssey from Walford to the West End is considered an epic journey. So Central America is <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the question" [...] with another saying, [...] "Abi {{was a little girl}} arranging tearful funerals for her pets. But now she's a young teenager, secretly engaged to boyfriend Jay and planning to run away together. He then gives Abi an ultimatum: him or her trip to Costa Rica. Best pass her the suncream, then". However, Abi, along with the younger members of the cast were thought to be the blame of declining ratings for the show; [...] "In the last two months, viewers have seen lots of Lauren, Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), Ben Jay, Abi and Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas) - but not nearly so much of the classic characters". Inside Soap noted that Abi and Jay's relationship was popular with viewers.|$|E

2500|$|Like most {{fifteenth century}} sovereigns, the Kings of France sought to possess {{standing}} armies of professionals to fight their incessant wars, most notable {{of which was}} the Hundred Years War. [...] By that period, the old form of feudal levy had long proven inadequate and had been replaced by various ad hoc methods of paying vassal troops serving for money rather than <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> feudal obligation, a method that was heavily supplemented by hiring large numbers of out-and-out mercenaries.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{historic}} confusion {{arose in}} the early 1920s when the Automobile Club de France attempted {{to pull off a}} retrospective political [...] trick by numbering and renaming the major races held in France before the 1906 French Grand Prix as being Grands Prix de l'Automobile Club de France, despite their running pre-dating the formation of the Club. Hence, the 1895 Paris–Bordeaux–Paris Trail was renamed I Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France; and the true first Grand Prix in 1906 race was renamed the IX Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France (9th). The ACF used this numbering in 1933, although some members of the Club dismissed it, [...] "concerned the name of the Club was lent to the fiction <b>simply</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a childish desire to establish their Grand Prix as the oldest race in the world." ...|$|E
