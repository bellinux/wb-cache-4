25|$|ABC {{executives}} {{intended to}} promote the episode's broadcast by hiring skywriters to create giant 'V's above twenty-six US landmarks from October 23, 2009, until the premiere on November 3, 2009. The campaign would have targeted 15 cities across the US. Lisa de Moraes for The Washington Post criticized the idea, noting that ABC's parent company Disney had previously announced its intention to cut carbon emissions from fuels by half by 2012 {{as part of its}} commitment to environmental affairs. Aviation authorities estimated that ABC's marketing stunt would use around 400 gallons of fuel, containing 800 grams of lead, releasing three tons of CO2 and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Following de Moraes' complaint, the <b>skywriting</b> plans were subsequently cancelled, with an ABC representative commenting that the network had decided to spend its money on alternate initiatives.|$|E
