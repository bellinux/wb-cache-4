5000|$|The Brodiaeoideae {{subfamily}} of the Asparagaceae {{sensu lato}} is treated in some systems {{as a separate}} family, under the name Themidaceae. It comprises about a dozen genera which are native to western North America. Plants are superficially {{similar to those of}} the allium subfamily, being perennial herbs with an umbellate inflorescence made up of quite small flowers. The tepals are more or less joined at the base, sometimes with a corona (a structure like the trumpet of a daffodil). The ovary is <b>superior.</b> <b>Plants</b> lack the [...] "garlic odor" [...] typical of the allium subfamily, and have a fibrous corm rather than a bulb.

5000|$|The {{more common}} {{opposite}} of cleistogamy, or [...] "closed marriage," [...] is called chasmogamy, or [...] "open marriage." [...] Virtually all plants that produce cleistogamous flowers also produce chasmogamous ones. [...] The principal advantage of cleistogamy {{is that it}} requires less plant resources to produce seeds than does chasmogamy because development of petals, nectar and large amounts of pollen are not required. This efficiency makes cleistogamy particularly useful for seed production on unfavorable sites or adverse conditions. Impatiens capensis, for example, has been observed to produce only cleistogamous flowers after being severely damaged by grazing and to maintain populations on unfavorable sites with only cleistogamous flowers. The obvious disadvantage of cleistogamy is that self-fertilization occurs, which may suppress the creation of genetically <b>superior</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
5000|$|All of {{the members}} of a {{specific}} grex may be loosely thought of as [...] "sister plants", and just like the brothers and sisters of any family, may share many traits or look quite different from one another. This is due to the randomization of genes passed on to progeny during sexual reproduction. The hybridizer who created a new grex normally chooses to register the grex with a registration authority, thus creating a new grex name, but there is no requirement to do this. Individual plants may be given cultivar names to distinguish them from siblings in their grex. Cultivar names are usually given to <b>superior</b> <b>plants</b> with the expectation of propagating that plant; all genetically identical copies of a plant, regardless of method of propagation (divisions or clones) share a cultivar name.|$|E
50|$|The {{agapanthus}} subfamily of the Amaryllidaceae {{sensu lato}} is treated in some systems {{as a separate}} family, the Agapanthaceae. Agapanthus, native to South Africa, is the sole genus of the subfamily. They are relatively robust herbaceous perennials with short rhizomes and leaves forming a rosette, individually linear-oblong, flat, rather fleshy. The flowers are quite large, blue or white, forming an umbel {{at the end of}} a stem (scape) which is longer than the leaves. The inflorescences are protected by bracts joined together along one side. The ovary is <b>superior.</b> <b>Plants</b> do not have the characteristic garlic odor of the allium subfamily (Allioideae). They are set apart from the amaryllis subfamily (Amaryllidoideae) by their superior ovary, the presence of saponins and the absence of the alkaloids typical of amaryllids.

40|$|Background and Objective:  The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{endophytic}} microbial flora of different wheat varieties to check whether a better yielding variety also harbours <b>superior</b> <b>plant</b> growth promoting bacteria. Such bacteria are helpful in food biotechnology as their application can enhance the yield of the crop. Material and Methods:  Three wheat varieties (Seher, Faisalabad and Lasani) were selected, Seher being the most superior variety. endophytic bacteria were isolated from the histosphere of the leaves and roots at different growth phases of the plants. The isolates were analyzed for plant growth promoting activities. Isolates giving best results were identified through 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Statistical analysis was done using Microsoft Excel 2013. All the experiments were conducted in triplicates. Results and Conclusion:  The endophytes of Seher variety showed maximum plant growth promoting abilities. Among the shoot endophytes, the highest auxin production was shown by Seher isolate SHHP 1 - 3 up to 51. 9 μg ml- 1, whereas in the case of root endophytes, the highest auxin was produced by SHHR 1 - 5 up to 36 μg ml- 1. The bacteria showing significant plant growth promoting abilities were identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing. Bacillus, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria species were the dominant bacteria showing all the traits of plant growth promotion. It can be concluded that Seher variety harbours <b>superior</b> <b>plant</b> growth promoting endophytes that must be one of the reasons for its better growth and yield as compared to the other two varieties. The investigated results support possible utilization of the selected isolates in wheat growth promotion with respect to increase in agro-productivity. The application of such bacteria could be useful to enhance wheat yield and can help in food biotechnology. Conflict of interest:   The authors declare no conflict of interest. </p...|$|R

Here we demonstrate that a substantial component of the coding sequences in monocots is localized proximally in regions of very low and even negligible recombination frequencies.
