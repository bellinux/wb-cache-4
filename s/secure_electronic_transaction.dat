5000|$|The sudden {{growth of}} the Internet, and {{especially}} the World Wide Web, in the mid-1990s created a demand for secure online financial transaction applications. Verifone has {{taken the lead in}} designing applications conforming to the <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (SET) standards developed by Visa Inc. and MasterCard. With the $28 million 1995 acquisition of Enterprise Integration Technologies, the company that developed the Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol(S-HTTP), and a $4 million equity investment in CyberCash, Inc., led by Verifone founder William Melton, and with 1996 partnership agreements with Internet browser leaders Netscape, Oracle Corporation, and Microsoft, Verifone has rolled out a suite of software products targeted at consumers, merchants, and financial institutions allowing secure purchases and other transactions online. Purchases over the Internet, which still produced as little as $10 million in 1995, are expected to reach into the billions {{by the turn of the}} century. Verifone has also been working to marry the smart card to the Internet; in 1996, the company introduced the Personal ATM (P-ATM), a small smart card reader designed to be attached to the consumer's home computer, which will enable the consumer not only to make purchases over the Internet, but also to [...] "recharge" [...] the value on the card. Verifone has also partnered with Key Tronic to incorporate a P-ATM interface directly into that company's computer keyboards.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a protocol design process, and illustrate its use by creating ATSPECT, an Authentication Test-based Secure Protocol for Electronic Commerce Transactions. The design process is {{organized around the}} authentication tests, a method for protocol verification based on the strand space theory. The authentication tests dictate how randomly generated values such as nonces may be combined with encryption to achieve authentication and freshness. ATSPECT offers functionality and security guarantees akin to the purchase request, payment authorization, and payment capture phases of SET, the <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> standard created by the major credit card firms. In previous work [10, 12, 8], we have developed a method—called the “authentication test ” method—that {{can be used by}} hand to verify cryptographic protocols. We also pointed out that the same ideas can be used to guide the protocol development process, quickly leading to new protocols; proofs of correctness for these protocols then follow from the development process. In [10, 12] we illustrated the point by “reinventing ” preexisting protocols. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to use it to create a completely new protocol with highly non-trivial functionality. We call our new protocol ATSPECT, an Authentication Test-based Secure Protocol for Electronic Commerce Transactions. It is intended to achieve the essential security goals of the existing <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (SET) purchase request, payment authorization, and payment capture phases, as we understand them. The <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> protocol [15] was a major effort undertaken by a consortium of credit card companies and banks in the mid- 90 s.

40|$|Credit cards {{have been}} the {{dominant}} payment method in e-commerce during the past years {{and it is not}} expected {{that this is going to}} change soon. However, credit card payments as used today are not suited for anonymous or pseudonymous payments. Credit card payments disclose the identity of a customer to the merchant and the issuer of the credit card knows exactly where the customer makes payments. The <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (SET) protocol makes credit card payments over the Internet more secure, but it does not much to protect the privacy of the customer. In this report, we present the Pseudonymous <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Transaction</b> (PSET) protocol. PSET is an extension of SET and enables pseudonymous credit card payments over the Internet. Pseudonymous payments mean that none of the involved parties in the payment process can learn the identities of both the customer and the merchant at the same time. This is achieved by distributing the knowledge of the whole transaction among the involved parties. On the other hand, PSET guarantees that it is not possible for any of the involved parties to cheat and that it is possible to unambiguously resolve the identity of a pseudonymous customer in case of a dispute...|$|E
