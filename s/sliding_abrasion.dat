40|$|The {{multiplicity}} of harsh environments in mining, processing and transporting ore and related waste, cause severe wear, extremely high maintenance costs and lost production. Elevated temperature processing {{is one of}} the conditions that influence the performance of possible materials of construction. This takes the forms of reduced hardness and strength, deleterious changes in the structure and properties of materials during protracted exposure and increased oxidation and corrosion. Drag chain conveying of hot solids e. g. in smelting, typically results in three-body <b>sliding</b> <b>abrasion</b> and adhesive wear of connecting pins and hole surfaces in link assemblies and of moving paddles that impel the particulates in enclosed channels. Selected materials have been assessed for this type of service under reciprocating <b>sliding</b> <b>abrasion</b> contact conditions using an adapted Cameron-Plint TE 77 wear rig at 20 0 C and 350 0 C. These include the current carburised low alloy steel, other steels, Cr white irons and Co-based alloys in bulk, overlay and surface treated forms. Examination of wear scars, using scanning electron microscopy, identified the main wear mechanisms affecting the highly resistant powder metallurgical (PM) tool steels and HVOF coating as micro-scratching and as indentation leading to micro-fracture. Materials with lowest resistance displayed evidence of significant material removal by micro-ploughing. The formation of oxide layers on some samples during testing appeared to be beneficial.

40|$|A {{detailed}} characterization {{project was}} undertaken by Velan, an international industrial valve designer and manufacturer, {{in collaboration with}} the National Research Council of Canada, Boucherville, and Polytechnique Montr 9 al. The purpose was to assess the mechanical and tribological resistances of promising ceramic coatings for hydrometallurgy applications, including a novel n-TiO 2 ̆ 082 -Cr 2 ̆ 082 O 2 ̆ 083 blend. Hardness and shear strength were determined using microhardness indentation testers and universal tensile testing equipment. Wear resistance of the coatings under <b>sliding</b> wear, <b>abrasion,</b> and galling conditions were measured by standard pin-on-disk tests, abrasion tests, and custom-designed galling tests. The main result is that the synergy between Cr 2 ̆ 082 O 2 ̆ 083 and n-TiO 2 ̆ 082 produced abrasion performance exceeding that of these materials alone. Also, an optimized balance between the hard and brittle Cr 2 ̆ 082 O 2 ̆ 083 phases and the soft and ductile n-TiO 2 ̆ 082 phases resulted in higher <b>abrasion,</b> <b>sliding,</b> and galling resistance.

To better understand this abrasion and particle generation, I have completed two independent tests using a custom in-house, designed and built, testing system. One test of <b>sliding</b> <b>abrasion</b> and one test of spinning abrasion was conducted, both in a low relative humidity air environment. I have used both a commercial non-nuclear grade graphite denoted, GM- 101, and a nuclear grade, MLRF 1, from SGL Carbon for these tests. For spinning abrasion, GM- 101 and MLRF 1 were used. For <b>sliding</b> <b>abrasion,</b> only GM- 101 was used. I have obtained size distributions for the abraded particles, fit lognormal functions to those size distributions (for use in computer codes), determined particle shapes, measured temperature and humidity during the tests, measured surface temperatures at the contact point of the samples, calculated wear rates, measured the surface roughness of both pre-test and post-test samples, measured particle surface areas, measured pore volumes, and pore volume distributions of particles produced during abrasion of graphite surfaces under different loadings and sliding speeds, or rotational speeds, for both experiments. The experiments showed that as loading (analogous to pebble depth in the reactor) and rotation speeds or sliding speeds increase, so do wear rates, concentration of particles and particle surface area. The shape of the dust particles was in every case non-spherical. In all, our research shows that pebble abrasion is a complex process that is not constant during operation and thus should be considered for future work.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the effects of the shot-peening process on the fatigue characteristics of austempered ductile iron (ADI). Experiments mainly involve surface durability tests using cylindrical roller specimens and bending fatigue tests, as well as X-ray stress measurements. The elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) theory was used in the determination of surface durability. It was found that the surface durability of the shot-peened ADI was slightly lower than the of the non-shot-peened ADI, and this difference was attributed to the difference in surface roughness. Moreover, it was found that residual stress does not affect the surface durability of the shot-peened ADI. Results also showed that the shot-peening of the ADI is useful for improving the bending fatigue strength. Consequently, from the viewpoint of fatigue strength of ADI, surface roughness, especially as related to the surface durability, should be strongly considered in the case of application of shot-peened ADI to machine elements subjected to bending and/or <b>sliding</b> <b>abrasion.</b> 歯車材の表面改質の研究の一環...|$|E

Experimental results showed that the sliding friction coefficients declined more dramatically than the fretting friction coefficients when the normal load increased. The fretting wear rate was lower than the sliding wear rate, which was partly due to the solid lubrication effect of the wear debris and strain hardening of the worn surfaces.

To resolve wear and corrosion issues, the hard iron boride-based coatings on steels obtained through the thermal diffusion process can be applied on the entire working surfaces of large size and complex shape products. The behavior of these coatings obtained at Endurance Technologies Inc. has been studied in the friction-abrasion, friction-corrosion and friction-abrasion-corrosion conditions simulating oil production service conditions. Tribological {{studies have been conducted}} using the "rod-on-flat" reciprocating sliding method in the conditions simulating actual application conditions. The synergistic actions of harsh conditions results in a higher rate of materials destruction. The obtained iron boride coatings demonstrated significantly lower wear losses with no delamination and spalling than untreated steels and Ni- and Cr-based coatings. The encouraging tribo-corrosion test results for boride coatings are explained by their high hardness and chemical inertness, specific structure obtained through the thermal diffusion process with reduced micro-crack propagation and the thin "tribofilm" formed during a friction mode. Successful application of the products with the boride protective coatings is reported. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

The typically broad particle size distribution (PSD) found in industrial slurries is viewed in terms of a discrete number of size classes, each with a representative diameter.

The hard boride based coatings on steels and alloys obtained through the thermal diffusion process have a high potential for these severe application conditions over many other types of coatings as they can be obtained on the entire working surfaces of large size and complex shape products. Intensive tribological studies of the iron boride based coatings on carbon steel obtained at Endurance Technologies Inc. have been conducted using the Cameron-Plint testing unit (reciprocating sliding of the metallic rod under the load over a flat surface of the coated samples). The friction wear loss, friction coefficient and structural changes of the coatings have been studied in dry and lubricating (water-oil) friction conditions, which simulate actual application conditions. It was demonstrated that the obtained boride coatings have the friction loss significantly smaller than untreated steel (e. g. 2 ̆ 23 c 10 - 30 times in the dry conditions and at least 5 times in the lubricating conditions) with no peeling and flaking-off. The friction coefficients of the boride coatings are steady over the test duration. The influence of the thickness on the boride coatings performance is demonstrated.

Rotating steel balls on CVD boron carbide and tungsten carbide balls on CVD diamond were loaded {{in the presence of}} 4. 5 – 6. 0 ?m SiC abrasive slurry with varying solid concentrations of 0. 35 – 0. 7 g/ml (vol. fraction: 0. 112 – 0. 24). The applied normal loads were between 0. 25 and 2. 0 N with sliding speeds between 30 and 150 rpm (0. 04 – 0. 2 m/s). The optimum conditions to obtain uniform three-body rolling abrasion for both coatings was established to be at 0. 3 N normal load, 75 rpm (0. 1 m/s) ball rotation speed and at a SiC slurry concentration of 0. 5 g/ml. Under the optimum test condition, abrasion in both CVD coatings occurs predominantly through brittle micro-chipping of the CVD grains resulting in near perfect hemispherical wear scars. Significant grooving and scratch marks are observed at higher loads and ball rotation speeds which suggests a transition to <b>sliding</b> <b>abrasion</b> under these conditions caused by the abrasive and/or wear debris becoming embedded in the ball.

A concrete specimen is mounted and an ice cylinder is slid on top of the concrete with applied pressure. Pressure, speed and temperature are all fully controllable to create different test scenarios. A custom made National Instruments LabView program is used to control, monitor and log the activities in the abrasion laboratory. Ice abrasion testing has been done at the NTNU Ice Abrasion Laboratory, investigating a possible difference in abrasion rate for identical concrete with unlike initial treatment. A total of four concretes sample were tested. All four of them were saturated after this saturation period 2 of them was abrasion tested directly and 2 of them were dried, resaturated and then abrasion tested. Abrasion results were distorted by cracking of the concrete samples. No conclusive data on the abrasion rate were obtained. Two possible reasons for cracking of the concrete samples were found. The concrete samples have not been stored in best possible way before testing, which may have caused them to weaken. Secondly the ice abrasion machine has a weakness somewhere under the concrete sample.

The model was able to predict 69. 44 %, 68. 06 % and 42. 90 % of the variation in the data for both the flank wear side 1 and 2 and aerosol mass concentration, respectively. An adequate signal-to-noise precision ratio more than 4 was obtained for the models, indicating adequate signal to use the model as a predictor for both the flank wear sides and aerosol mass concentration. The highest average mass concentration of 8. 32 mg/m 3 was realized using cutting speed of 80 Surface feet per minute (SFM) and a feed rate of 0. 003 Inches per tooth (IPT). The lowest average mass concentration of 5. 91 mg/m 3 was realized using treatment 120 SFM and 0. 005 IPT. The cutting performance under microlubrication is five times better in terms of tool life and two times better in terms of materials removal volume under low cutting speed and feed rate combination as compared to high cutting speed and feed rate combination. Abrasion was the dominant wear mechanism for all the cutting tools under consideration. Other than <b>abrasion,</b> <b>sliding</b> adhesive wear of the workpiece materials was also observed. The scanning electron microscope investigation of the used cutting tools revealed micro-fatigue cracks, welded micro-chips and unusual built-up edges on the cutting tools flank and rake side. Higher tool life was observed in the lowest cutting speed and feed rate combination. Transmission electron microscopy analysis at failure for the treatment 120 SFM and 0. 005 IPT helped to quantify the dislocation densities. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) identified 4 to 8 µm grain size growth on the machined surface due to residual stresses that are the driving force for the grain boundaries motion to reduce its overall energy resulting in the slight grain growth. EBSD also showed that (001) textured ferrite grains before machining exhibited randomly orientated grains after machining. The study shows that with a proper selection of the cutting parameters, it is possible to obtain higher tool life in end milling under microlubrication. But more scientific studies are needed to lower the mass concentration of the aerosol particles, below the recommended value of 5 mg/m 3 established by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ...|$|R
40|$|The basal ice of sliding glaciers {{contains}} rock {{debris that}} {{is held in}} contact with the rock bed, resulting in abrasion that erodes the bed and friction that slows <b>sliding.</b> <b>Abrasion</b> rates and the magnitude of this friction are controlled by contact forces that clasts exert normal to the bed surface. These contact forces are dependant on the drag exerted on clasts by ice as it flows toward the bed. Recent subglacial measurements indicate that debris-bed friction has been underestimated by at least an order of magnitude. This underestimate {{may be the result of}} enhanced drag on particles and associated contact forces, due to the proximity of the bed as a boundary condition that perturbs ice flow. To test this hypothesis, laboratory experiments were performed to measure drag forces exerted by moving temperate ice on an idealized clast (50 mm sphere) both isolated from and resting on the bed. A stress of 1000 kPa was applied to the top of a confined cylinder of ice 0. 2 m in diameter. The ice cylinder was brought to the melting temperature and then melted preferentially at its base, so that ice moved toward the underlying flat bed. The resultant drag force on the sphere (577 - 2112 N) was measured in experiments in which the ice velocity (0. 38 - 2. 3 mm d- 1) was incremented or decremented after a steady drag force was attained. The drag enhancement caused by the proximity of the bed, in contrast to the results of numerical models, is small: the drag force on a sphere on the bed is only 1. 23 - 1. 28 times larger than that on an isolated sphere. This small drag enhancement is due to a water-pressurized cavity that develops beneath the sphere. This cavity prevents low ice pressures from developing there, which are required to achieve a large drag enhancement. These results indicate that theory describing the drag on idealized, isolated clasts provides a reasonable estimate of contact forces. The rheological parameters of the synthetic ice used in these experiments [...] derived from the measured drag forces and ice velocities for the case of the isolated sphere [...] were n = 1. 3 and B = 9. 64 y 1010 Pa- 1. 3 s- 1, where n is the stress exponent and B is the fluidity parameter in the ice flow rule, as expressed by Lliboutry (1979). If the ice rheology is approximated as being linear (n = 1), then B = 5. 35 y 10 - 12 Pa- 1 s- 1...|$|E
