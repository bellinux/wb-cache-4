50|$|Like sour oil, {{there is}} some natural gas {{naturally}} high in sulfur, called sour gas (natural gas {{with little or no}} sulfur is called <b>sweet</b> <b>gas).</b> The sulfur is present in the form of hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas that must be removed for safety reasons. Most natural gas has less than 1 percent hydrogen sulfide, but deposits have been discovered with more than 80 percent hydrogen sulfide. Sour gas is most often associated with carbonate rocks, and especially with anhydrite. Hydrogen sulfide is also corrosive, so that gas high in hydrogen sulfide requires special corrosion-resistant production equipment,as well as extra safety precautions. The requirement that gas processors remove the sulfur causes sour gas to receive a lower producer price than <b>sweet</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E

40|$|Underground Gas Storage (UGS) {{involves}} {{storage of}} {{large quantities of}} natural gas to support the natural gas demand in domestic, commercial and industrial areas. Storage of sour gas can be advantageous from economic standpoint, as it reduces treatment costs and increases the potential of production from shared reservoirs. This paper investigates feasibility of UGS in one of Iranian depleted fractured gas condensate reservoirs. Compositional simulation was employed to build dynamic reservoir model, develop the history matching phase of the reservoir and construct Injection/Withdrawal (I/W) cycles. One <b>sweet</b> <b>gas</b> stream and three sour gas streams with different compositions were tested for storage into reservoir during summer season. 				Results of simulation showed that presence of H 2 S and CO 2 in the injected gas stream improves condensate production. Condensate Production Enhancement (CPE), defined {{as the percentage of}} condensate recovery increase due to sour gas injection relative to the <b>sweet</b> <b>gas</b> injection, was calculated for different compositions of storage gas. Also, Condensate Holding Ratio (CHR), defined as the ratio of condensate in the withdrawn sour gas to that in the withdrawn CH 4, was estimated for different storage gas compositions. Results showed that CPE has a higher rate in earlier cycles and declines at later cycles. CHR is higher for sour gas storage compared to <b>sweet</b> <b>gas.</b> Furthermore, heating value of produced gas was calculated in all I/W cycles and compared with heating value of injected gas. It was indicated that difference between heating value of produced and injected gas increases with increase of H 2 S and CO 2 content of the injected gas. Also, {{it was found that the}} reservoir has lower pressure rise at the end of I/W cycles in the case of underground sour gas storage compared to <b>sweet</b> <b>gas</b> storage.

Firstly, the effect of trays types and then, the effect of various packing {{and the effect of}} the packing size were considered on the flow rate of CO 2 and H 2 S in the main streams. Results show that with considering the different trays types in the regenerator tower, the flow rate of CO 2 in the <b>sweet</b> <b>gas</b> stream with bubble cap tray is lower than other trays types. Also, with considering the different trays types in the absorber tower, the flow rate of CO 2 in the <b>sweet</b> <b>gas</b> stream with bubble cap tray is lower than other trays types in the absorber tower. In considering with different types of packing, results show that the flow rate of CO 2 with ballast ring packing and the flow rate of H 2 S with Raschig ring packing are lower than other types of packing. However, in some types such as cascade miniring, Intalox Saddles and pall ring, there is no difference for the flow rate of CO 2 or H 2 S.

In this paper, the evaluations on shale <b>gas</b> <b>sweet</b> spots conducted in Zhaotong demonstration zone {{in the past six}} years and the construction of 500  million m 3 shale gas productivity in Huangjinba region were discussed, and the results of shale gas reservoir evaluations in China and abroad were investigated. Accordingly, it is proposed that another two key indicators be taken into consideration in the evaluation on shale <b>gas</b> <b>sweet</b> spots in marine mountains in South China, i. e. shale gas preservation conditions and pore pressure, and the research on ground stress and natural microfracture systems should be strengthened. Then, systematic analysis was conducted by integrating shale gas multidisciplinary data and geological and engineering integration study was carried out. Finally, a 3 D model, which was composed of “geophysics, reservoir geology, fracture system and rock geomechanics”, was established for shale gas reservoirs. Application practice shows that the geological engineering integration and the 3 D reservoir modeling are effective methods for evaluating the shale <b>gas</b> <b>sweet</b> spots in complex marine mountains in South China.

40|$|Density is an {{important}} property of natural gas required {{for the design of}} gas processing and reservoir simulation. Due to expensive measurement of density, industry tends to predict gas density through an EOS. However, all EOS are associated with uncertainties, especially at high-pressure conditions. Also, using sophisticated EOS in commercial software renders simulation highly time-consuming. This work aims to evaluate performance of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as a widely-accepted intelligent model for prediction of P-Ï-T behavior of natural gas. Using experimental data reported in the literature, our inference system was trained with 95 data of natural gas densities in the temperature range of (250 â 450) K and pressures up to 150 Â MPa. Additionally, prediction by ANFIS was compared with those of AGA 8 and GERG 04 which both are leading industrial EOS for calculation of natural gas density. It was observed that ANFIS predicts natural gas density with AARD% of 1. 704; and is able to estimate gas density as accurate as sophisticated EOS.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the experience of}} the new design of using impinging jet spray columns for scrubbing hydrogen sulfide from biogas that has been developed by Indian Institute of Science and patented. The process uses a chelated polyvalent metal ion which oxidizes the hydrogen sulfide to sulfur as a precipitate. The sulfur generated is filtered and the scrubbing liquid recycled after oxidation. The process involves in bringing contact the sour gas with chelated liquid in the spray columns where H 2 S reacts with chelated Fe 3 + and precipitates as sulfur, whereas Fe 3 + gets reduced to Fe 2 +. Fe 2 + is regenerated to Fe 3 + by reaction of oxygen in air in a separate packed column. The regenerated liquid is recirculated. Sulfur is filtered and separated as a byproduct. The paper {{presents the}} experience in using the spray towers for hydrogen sulfide removal and further use of the clean gas for generating power using gas engines. The maximum allowable limit of H 2 S for the gas engine is 200 ppm (v/v) in order to prevent any corrosion of engine parts and fouling of the lubricating oil.

40|$|Removal {{of water}} (H 2 O) and acid gas contaminants, like {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H 2 S) {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2), are essential in natural gas purification. Due to gas quality specifications and protection of installed equipment including subsea pipelines, impurities need to be removed efficiently. Well designed gas treatment processes have been developed, where fine removal of water and acid gas typically are performed by absorption utilizing glycols and alkanolamines. Inhibition of gas hydrates in pipelines is crucial upstream a processing facility, because pipeline blockages have the possibility of causing complete process shutdown. Research towards complete subsea processing is now conducted, where {{the aim is to}} develop new process technology that can enhance and increase the production efficiency of reservoirs already in operation. Hydrate inhibition, acid gas removal and fine removal of water are traditionally performed in three different processing units. Designing a process where these systems can be combined, may give more efficient and compact processing equipment. In this thesis, the main goal was to conduct a simulation of combined H 2 S and water removal from natural gas by absorption in methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and monoethylene glycol (MEG). Simulations were performed in Aspen plus version 8. 6 and the template ElecNRTL_Rate_Based_MDEA_model was used. The aim was to examine the absorption performance predicted by Aspen Plus of the combined process. A vapor liquid validation (VLE) was performed where H 2 S, CO 2, methane (CH 4) and H 2 O solubility in aqueous MDEA and pure MEG were compared to literature data. In total, 500 experimental data points were compared to the solubility curves predicted by Aspen Plus, which gave average absolute deviations ranging from 3. 5 % to 218. 6 % for temperatures from 25 oC to 130 oC. Validation of H 2 S and CO 2 mixtures in a MDEA-MEG-H 2 O solvent with low water content, revealed high partial pressures of the acid gas components compared to literature data. It was found that absorption of H 2 S and CO 2 required use of aqueous MDEA, because of how the chemical reactions were defined in the template. The absorption simulations were performed for three different natural gas compositions, which were defined to be CH 4 saturated with water, having H 2 S and CO 2 contents ranging from 49. 8 ppm and 5. 6 % to 4. 5 % and 8 %, respectively. The absorption performance using a mixed MDEA-MEG solvent in one contactor, where various solvent concentrations were examined, was found to be insufficient with respect to water removal. Absorption of H 2 S and CO 2 in MDEA, and H 2 O in MEG, including regeneration of the solvents were simulated separately. No recommendations for optimal operating conditions were made, due to lack of operational data {{that could be used for}} comparison. However, some operational areas which were considered as energy efficient for the different composition cases, where chosen for further analysis. Molar liquid-gas ratios, for obtaining 4 ppm H 2 S in the <b>sweet</b> <b>gas</b> utilizing a 45 wt% MDEA solvent at 100 bar, ranged from 0. 75 to 1. 7 at these operational areas. Specific reboiler duties ranged from 3. 79 MJ/kg acid gas to 4. 96 MJ/kg acid gas. H 2 S and CO 2 recoveries were up to 99. 3 % and 99. 5 %. Because equilibrium based calculations were defined in the absorber, the amount of absorbed CO 2 were high for all simulations and results revealed less than 1 % CO 2 in the <b>sweet</b> <b>gas</b> for the same cases. For water removal, it was found that MEG concentrations above 99 % should be used depending on the water content and temperature of the wet gas. Conventional regeneration of MEG in a distillation column to this level of purity, resulted in reboiler temperatures above 190 oC, and were found to exceed the recommended limits with respect to thermal degradation, which are around 165 oC...|$|E
40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas {{production}} operations, hydrates deposition leads to serious problems including over pressuring, irreparable damages to production equipment, pipeline blockage, and finally resulting in production facilities shut down and even human life and the environment dangers. Hence, it is of great importance to forecast the hydrate formation conditions in order to overcome problems associated with deposition of hydrate. In this article, an effective, mathematical and predictive strategy, known as the least squares support vector machine, is employed to determine the hydrate forming conditions of <b>sweet</b> natural <b>gases</b> as well as the monoethylene glycol (MEG) flow-rate and desired depression of the gas hydrate formation temperature (DHFT). The outcome of this study reveals that the developed technique offers high predictive potential in precise estimation of this important characteristic in the gas industry. Beside the accuracy and reliability, the proposed model includes lower number of coefficients in contrast with conventional correlations/methods, implying an interesting feature {{to be added to the}} modeling simulation software packages in gas engineering...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{extensive}} {{review of}} {{acid gas removal units}} covering 5 decades {{and more than}} 120 amine units showed that units treating <b>sweet</b> <b>gases</b> (i. e. with CO 2 only) presented the worst risks of corrosion. In some extreme cases, a quite uniform corrosion in an active mode was observed on stainless steel grades such as AISI 410 and 304 L, despite apparently mild corrosive conditions. Strong scaling of the heat exchangers by corrosion products was also observed. A detailed analytical survey of those corrosive DEA units was then performed over more than two years. Immediately after fresh solvent swap, dissolved iron concentration increased until stabilization at several hundreds of mg/L after a few months. Good correlation was found between dissolved iron, amine degradation, and the amount of scaling products that was recovered in the heat exchangers. Comparisons with similar units using activated MDEA revealed dissolved iron levels several orders of magnitude below those in DEA. In order to understand more precisely the driving forces for steel corrosion and for the precipitation of corrosion products, a laboratory program was launched. Comparisons between different amines in rich and lean conditions were performed in autoclave. A specific protocol was developed which aimed at degrading the amine solutions and at providing dissolved iron before corrosion tests to image the degradation of industrial solvent in actual life of plant. The laboratory degraded DEA was successfully compared to an industrial DEA solution sampled in a gas sweetening unit experiencing corrosion problems. Active corrosion of carbon steel (CS), AISI 410 and even AISI 304 L was reproduced in laboratory conditions with hot rich DEA and with industrial DEA solution as well. Industrial trends of strong precipitation of iron carbonate in the amine - amine exchangers could be explained. Iron solubility was found to depend on amine loading, with a lower solubility in rich conditions, thus a strong tendency to precipitate. Based on a the same protocol to obtain degraded MDEA and energizedMDEA, the study further looked at the behavior of those commonly used amines made of on the shelf and generic amine molecules. The experience and know-how gathered from the feed-back, inspection and laboratory experiments is applied to understand the performance of existing units, for which carbon steel has been used extensively. When improvements are welcome, the key corrosion mitigating issues are exposed in term of appropriate amine selection for <b>sweet</b> or sour <b>gases,</b> flow velocities and procedures for solvent preservation. The article also discusses about material selection and replacement of carbon steel by appropriate corrosion resistant alloy (CRA) when needed and only on selected areas, as normal maintenance operations following periodic inspections. This considerably extends the service life, while also enabling operation above the initial specifications. For newly built compact units, the design criteria focus on application of AISI 316 L, now preferred instead of lower grades like 304 L or AISI 410, to areas potentially prone to corrosion. With appropriate use of CRA's, acid gas loadings of 0. 85 or even higher can be considered in design, without velocity limitations on the rich amine lines or stringent material selection. Furthermore, the amine units based on the AdvamineTM technologies remain fully versatile and flexible to encompass the widest range of amines, including MDEA and energizedMDEA...|$|R
40|$|An {{inherent}} {{problem with}} natural gas production or transmission is {{the formation of}} gas hydrates, {{which can lead to}} safety hazards to production/transportation systems and to substantial economic risks. Therefore, an understanding of conditions where hydrates form is necessary to overcome hydrate related issues. Over the years, several models requiring more complicated and longer computations have been proposed for the prediction of hydrate formation conditions of natural gases. For these reasons, it is essential to develop a reliable and simple-to-use method for oil and gas practitioners. The {{purpose of this study is}} to formulate a novel empirical correlation for rapid estimation of hydrate formation condition of <b>sweet</b> natural <b>gases.</b> The developed correlation holds for wide range of temperatures (265 – 298 K), pressures (1200 to 40000 kPa) and molecular weights (16 – 29). New proposed correlation shows consistently accurate results across proposed pressure, temperature and molecular weight ranges. This consistency could not be matched by any of the widely accepted existing correlations within the investigated range. For all conditions, new correlation showed average absolute deviation to be less than 0. 2 % and provided much better results than the widely accepted existing correlations...|$|R
