25|$|A new style, {{the sack}} coat, loosely fitted and {{reaching}} to mid-thigh, was fashionable for leisure activities; it would gradually replace the frock coat {{over the next}} forty years and become the modern <b>suit</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tonga {{has evolved}} {{its own version}} of Western-style clothing, {{consisting}} of a long tupenu, or sarong, for women, and a short tupenu for men. Women cover the tupenu with a kofu, or Western-style dress; men top the tupenu either with a T-shirt, a Western casual shirt, or on formal occasions, a dress shirt and a <b>suit</b> <b>coat.</b> Preachers in some Methodist sects still wear long frock coats, a style that has not been current in the West for more than a hundred years. These coats must be tailored locally.|$|E
50|$|Men's {{fashion is}} {{continued}} {{to a more}} youthful vibe as they started wearing polos and pants, replacing the <b>suit</b> and <b>coats.</b> <b>Suits</b> and <b>coats,</b> {{as well as the}} Barong Tagalog, were only worn during events and by the older men.|$|R

25|$|With emotion {{still in}} his voice and eyes watering, Cronkite once again {{recapped}} the events after collecting himself, incorporating some wire photos of the visit and explaining {{the significance of the}} pictures now that Kennedy was dead. He reminded the viewers that Vice President Johnson was now the President and was to be sworn in, that Governor Connally's condition was still unknown, {{and that there was no}} report of whether the assassin had been captured. He then handed the anchor position to Charles Collingwood, who had just entered the newsroom, took his <b>suit</b> <b>coat,</b> and left the room for a while.|$|E
25|$|On February 14th, Roger Craig, a Dallas deputy sheriff, {{testified that}} during the {{assassination}} {{he was standing on}} the far side of Dealey Plaza across from the Texas School Book Depository. Craig said that immediately afterwards he ran to where the shooting occurred and saw a man that he later identified as Oswald run down the slope away from the building and get into a green station wagon driven by a man with dark complexion. That same day, Carolyn Walther, a Dallas resident, testified that she observed within an open window of the School Book Depository a man in a white shirt holding a gun accompanied by another man wearing a brown <b>suit</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Within {{twenty seconds}} of the announcement, every CBS {{affiliate}} except Dallas' KRLD (which was providing local coverage) was airing the network's feed. The camera was finally operational by this time and enabled the audience to see Cronkite, who was clad in shirt and tie but without his <b>suit</b> <b>coat,</b> given the urgent nature of the story. Cronkite reminded the audience, again, of the attempt made {{on the life of}} the President and tossed to KRLD news director Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart, where Kennedy was supposed to be making a speech before he was shot. Barker relayed information that Kennedy's condition was extremely critical. Then, after a prayer for Kennedy, Barker quoted an unofficial report that the President was dead but stressed it was not confirmed.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the term}} {{dates to the}} thirteenth century, tailor took on its modern sense {{in the late eighteenth}} century, and now refers to makers of men's and women's <b>suits,</b> <b>coats,</b> trousers, and similar garments, usually of wool, linen, or silk.|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{full-time}} LDS missionaries {{were required}} to adhere to a dress code: for men, conservative, dark trousers and <b>suit</b> <b>coats,</b> white dress shirts, and conservative ties. For women, modest and professional dresses or blouses and mid-calf length skirts were worn.|$|R
25|$|Single-breasted <b>suit</b> <b>coats</b> may {{be either}} {{fastened}} or unfastened. In two-button suits the bottom button is traditionally left unfastened except with certain unusual cuts of jacket, e.g. the paddock. Legend {{has it that}} King Edward VII started the trend of leaving the bottom button of a suit as well as waistcoat undone.|$|R
25|$|The Service Dress Blue (SDB) uniform {{consists}} of a navy blue <b>suit</b> <b>coat</b> and trousers (or the optional skirt for women) that are nearly black in color, a white shirt, and a four-in-hand necktie for men or a neck tab for women. The material is generally wool or a wool blend, depending on the vendor. The men's jacket is double breasted with six gold-colored buttons, and the women's jacket has a single row of four gold-colored buttons. Rank insignia is the gold sleeve stripes for commissioned officers, while rating badges and service stripes are worn on the left sleeve by Chief Petty Officers (CPOs). The prescribed headgear is the white combination cap, although a navy blue garrison cap is optional, unless stated otherwise by the prescribing authority in some situations when the jacket is not worn. Beginning in 2016, the Navy began phasing out the female combination cap and now prescribes a cover similar to the male version for female officers and CPOs. Commissioned and warrant officers wear a cap badge of the American shield and eagle in silver upon gold crossed anchors; CPOs wear a single fouled anchor. The combination cover's chinstrap is gold for commissioned and warrant officers, narrower gold for midshipmen, and black for CPOs. Female officers and chief petty officers wear beltless slacks with the SDB, although since January 2017, belted slacks can be worn as an alternative.|$|E

500|$|During Pelinka's {{freshman}} season, Michigan {{was picked}} {{by many to}} win the Big Ten Conference and was ranked {{number one in the}} nation, according to some preseason polls. [...] He was the only true freshman to play in either of the first two games of the season. [...] Pelinka's only start of the season came in the December 12, 1988 game against Holy Cross. [...] This game followed the team's first loss of the season, which had come against Division II Alaska–Anchorage, after an 11–0 start and after which coach Bill Frieder benched three starters. [...] Pelinka posted his season highs in points (8), rebounds (5) and minutes (18) in this game. [...] During a practice, Pelinka was knocked unconscious and lost two teeth. [...] As the team entered the March stretch run, Pelinka and Calip were the only reserve guards backing up Robinson and Higgins. [...] The team {{went on to win the}} 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against Seton Hall at the Kingdome in Seattle, Washington. [...] When the team visited the White House, Pelinka held Rumeal Robinson's <b>suit</b> <b>coat,</b> while Robinson and United States President George H. W. Bush reenacted Robinson's game winning free throws. [...] When tendinitis afflicted his knees, he redshirted the 1989–90 season.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 1940s and 1950s {{the trend}} was to simplify and {{modernize}} the suit {{as much as}} possible. For example, by the 1960s {{the size of the}} lapel had shrunk to a very small size. <b>Suit</b> <b>coats</b> were also cut as straight as possible without any indication of a waistline. Cloth rationing changed styles significantly, contributing to a large reduction in the popularity of many cuts, such as the double-breasted suit.|$|R
