40|$|The {{contribution}} of scattered {{light to the}} total nebular emission is determined {{on the basis of}} linear polarization measurements at 1. 25, 1. 65, and 2. 2 microns of the visual reflection nebulae NGC 7023 and NGC 2023. The percentage polarization of NGC 7023 slowly increases from 0. 3 to 1 micron, with peak polarizations of up to 26 percent at 1. 25 micron, then rapidly decreases, with values of 4 - 7 percent at 2. 2 microns. This is interpreted as implying that scattered starlight contributes most to the <b>SW</b> <b>emission,</b> while unpolarized emission from small grains or large molecules dominates at longer wavelengths. IR polarization and surface brightness measurements are combined to derive the intensity of scattered light, which is then compared with scattering models. While the near-IR emission of both NGC 2023 and NGC 7023 is dominated by small-grain or large-molecule emission, IR scattered light plays a larger role in NGC 2023 than in NGC 7023...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{analysis}} of a ROSAT/PSPC observation of the galaxy cluster A 2634 is presented. The cluster has a luminosity of 7. 9 ± 0. 1 × 1043 erg/s in the ROSAT band (0. 1 - 2. 4 keV). The temperature profile decreases from about 3 keV in the outer parts to 1. 2 keV in the centre. Within a radius of 1. 5 Mpc the gas mass of the cluster is 0. 51 × 1014 M ⊙ and the total mass amounts to 4. 1 + 2. 6 − 1. 8 × 1014 M⊙. The X-ray morphology shows two peculiar features – a strongly peaked emission in the centre and an excess emission in the south-west. The central emission probably originates from a weak cooling flow, the <b>SW</b> <b>emission</b> is possibly associated with higher density regions in pressure equilibrium with the intra-cluster medium. This region of excess emission is somewhat embraced by the wide-angle radio tails associated with 3 C 465 suggesting that the overpressure of the relativistic particles has displaced the thermal gas...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} VLT/UVES to {{spatially}} resolve the gas disk of beta Pictoris. 88 extended emission lines are observed, with the brightest coming from Fe I, Na I and Ca II. The {{extent of the}} gas disk is much larger than previously anticipated; we trace Na I radially from 13 AU out to 323 AU and Ca II to heights of 77 AU above the disk plane, both {{to the limits of}} our observations. The degree of flaring is significantly larger for the gas disk than the dust disk. A strong NE/SW brightness asymmetry is observed, with the <b>SW</b> <b>emission</b> being abruptly truncated at 150 - 200 AU. The inner gas disk is tilted about 5 degrees with respect to the outer disk, similar to the appearance of the disk in light scattered from dust. We show that most, perhaps all, of the Na I column density seen in the 'stable' component of absorption, comes from the extended disk. Finally, we discuss the effects of radiation pressure in the extended gas disk and show that the assumption of hydrogen, in whatever form, as a braking agent is inconsistent with observations.

40|$|Abstract. Heliospheric (HSP) radio {{emission}} detected by the Voyager spacecraft between 1. 8 kHz and 3. 6 kHz from the distant heliosphere is interpreted as emission generated close to {{and at the}} heliopause (HP), the interface between the ionised very local interstellar (LIC) gas and the supersonic solar wind (<b>SW)</b> stream. Radio <b>emission</b> {{is assumed to be}} triggered by secondary charge exchange ionisation of interstellar neutrals and subsequent generation of lower hybrid (LH) waves. These waves nonlinearly accelerate electrons into beams along the spiral compressed heliosheath (HS) magnetic field B. Langmuir waves locally generated by these beams may be responsible for the observed emission. Under quiet conditions the emission is at marginally high frequency for observation. Under disturbed conditions the plasma density may be high enough to explain the Voyager observations. In this mechanism B plays a crucial role.

40|$|Wood pellet storage {{safety is}} an {{important}} aspect for implementing woody biomass as a renewable energy source. When wood pellets are stored indoors in large quantities (tons) in poorly ventilated spaces in buildings, such as in basements, off-gassing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can significantly affect indoor air quality. To determine the emission rates and potential impact of VOC emissions, a series of laboratory and field measurements were conducted using softwood, hardwood, and blended wood pellets manufactured in New York. Evacuated canisters were used to collect air samples from the headspace of drums containing pellets and then in basements and pellet storage areas of homes and small businesses. Multiple peaks were identified during GC/MS and GC/FID analysis, and four primary VOCs were characterized and quantified: methanol, pentane, pentanal, and hexanal. Laboratory results show that total VOCs (TVOCs) concentrations for softwood (SW) were statistically (p < 0. 02) higher than blended or hardwood (HW) (SW: 412 21 25; blended: 203 21 4; HW: 99 21 8, ppb). The emission rate from HW was the fastest, followed by blended and <b>SW,</b> respectively. <b>Emissions</b> rates were found to range from 10 (- 1) to 10 (- 5) units, depending upon environmental factors. Field measurements resulted in airborne concentrations ranging from 67 21 8 to 5000 21 3000 ppb of TVOCs and 12 to 1500 ppb of aldehydes, with higher concentrations found in a basement with a large fabric bag storage unit after fresh pellet delivery and lower concentrations for aged pellets. These results suggest that large fabric bag storage units resulted in a substantial release of VOCs into the building air. Occupants of the buildings tested discussed concerns about odor and sensory irritation when new pellets were delivered. The sensory response was likely due to the aldehydes.

40|$|Optical {{tools are}} of great promise for {{generation}} of spin waves {{due to the}} possibility to manipulate on ultrashort time scales and to provide local excitation. However, a single laser pulse can inject spin waves only with a broad frequency spectrum, resulting in a short propagation distance and low amplitude. Here we excite a magnetic garnet film by a train of fs-laser pulses with 1 GHz repetition rate so that pulse separation is smaller than decay time of the magnetic modes which allows to achieve collective photonic impact on magnetization. It establishes a quasi-stationary source of SWs, namely a coherent magnon accumulation ("magnon cloud"). This approach has several appealing features: (i) the source is tunable; (ii) the SW amplitude can be significantly enhanced; (iii) the spectrum of the generated SWs is quite narrow that provides longer propagation distance; (iv) the periodic pumping results in almost constant in time SW amplitude up to 100 um away from the source; and (v) the <b>SW</b> <b>emission</b> shows a pronounced directionality. These results expand the capabilities of ultrafast coherent optical control of magnetization and pave a way for applications in data processing, including the quantum regime.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} range {{of gas and}} particle phase pollutants were sampled at 1 -hour time resolution in urban background Milan during summer 2012. Measurements include several soluble inorganic aerosols (Cl−,NO 2 −,NO 3 −,SO 42 −,Ca 2 +,K+,Mg 2 +,Na+,NH 4 +) and gases (HCl, HNO 2,HNO 3, NH 3, NO, NO 2,O 3, SO 2), organic, elemental and black carbon and meteorological parameters. Analysis methods used include mean diurnal pattern on weekdays and Sundays, pollution roses, bivariate polar plots and statistical models using backtrajectories. Results show how nitrous acid (HONO) was mainly formed heterogeneously at nighttime, with a dependence of its formation rate on NO 2 consistent with observations during the last HONO campaign in Milan in summer 1998, although since 1998 a drop in HONO levels occurred following to the decrease of its precursors. Nitrate showed two main formation mechanisms: one occurring through N 2 O 5 at nighttime and leading to nitrate formation onto existing particles; another occurring both daytime and nighttime following the homogeneous reaction of ammonia gas with nitric acid gas. Air masses reaching Milan influenced nitrate formation depending on their content in ammonia and the timing of arrival. Notwithstanding {{the low level of}} SO 2 in Milan, its peaks were associated to point source emissions in the Po valley or shipping and power plant <b>emissions</b> <b>SW</b> of Milan, beyond the Apennines.

Black carbon was highly correlated to elemental carbon and the average mass absorption coefficient resulted MAC = 13. 8 ± 0. 2 m 2 g− 1.

40|$|Crucial {{information}} on the mass accretion-ejection in young stars {{can be obtained from}} high spatial resolution images of jets in sources with recurrent accretion outbursts. Using the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument, we observed the young binary Z CMa that is composed of a Herbig Be star and a FUor object, both driving a jet. We analyse the structure of the two jets in relation with previous accretion events observed in this target. We obtained optical images in the Halpha and OI 6300 A lines at the unprecedented angular resolution of ~ 0. 03 arcsec, on which we have performed both continuum subtraction and deconvolution, thereby deriving results that are consistent with each other. Our images reveal extended emission from both sources: a fairly compact and poorly collimated <b>emission</b> <b>SW</b> of the Herbig component and an extended collimated and precessing jet from the FUor component. The compact emission from the Herbig star is compatible with a wide-angle wind and is possibly connected to the recent outburst events shown by this component. The FUor jet is traced down to 70 mas (80 AU) from the source and is highly collimated with a width of 26 - 48 AU at distances 100 - 200 AU, which is similar to the width of jets from T Tauri stars. This strongly suggests that the same magneto-centrifugal jet-launching mechanism also operates in FUors. The observed jet wiggle can be modelled as originating from an orbital motion with a period of 4. 2 yr around an unseen companion with mass between 0. 48 and 1 Msun. The jet mass loss rate Mloss was derived from the OI luminosity and is in the range 1 E- 8 and 1 E- 6 Msun/yr. This is the first direct Mloss measurement from a jet in a FUor. If we assume previous Macc estimates obtained through modelling of the accretion disk, the derived range of Mloss would imply a very low mass-ejection efficiency (Mloss/Macc < 0. 02), which is lower than that typical of T Tauri stars.

40|$|The Extreme-Ultraviolet Normal-Incidence Spectrograph sounding-rocket payload {{was flown}} on 2006 April 12 (EUNIS- 06), {{carrying}} two independent imaging spectrographs covering wave bands of 300 - 370 A in first order and 170 - 205 A in second order, respectively. The absolute radiometric {{response of the}} EUNIS- 06 long-wavelength (LW) channel was directly measured in the same facility used to calibrate CDS prior to the SOHO launch. Because the absolute calibration of the short-wavelength (SW) channel {{could not be obtained}} from the same lab configuration, we here present a technique to derive it using a combination of solar LW spectra and density- and temperature-insensitive line intensity ratios. The first step in this procedure is to use the coordinated, cospatial EUNIS and SOHO/CDS spectra to carry out an intensity calibration update for the CDS NIS- 1 waveband, which shows that its efficiency has decreased by a factor about 1. 7 compared to that of the previously implemented calibration. Then, theoretical insensitive line ratios obtained from CHIANTI allow us to determine absolute intensities of emission lines within the EUNIS SW bandpass from those of cospatial CDS/NIS- 1 spectra after the EUNIS LW calibration correction. A total of 12 ratios derived from intensities of 5 CDS and 12 <b>SW</b> <b>emission</b> lines from Fe Fe X - Fe XIII yield an instrumental response curve for the EUNIS- 06 SW channel that matches well to a relative calibration which relied on combining measurements of individual optical components. Taking into account all potential sources of error, we estimate that the EUNIS- 06 SW absolute calibration is accurate to about 20 %. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables. 2010, ApJ Suppl.

40|$|By {{means of}} a joint {{experimental}} and theoretical investigation, we propose an alternative way of describing band properties of collective spin waves (SWs) when considering their propagation direction across a magnonic crystal (in our case, a square antidot lattice, ADL) : to build up an angular band diagram, in which frequency is plotted {{as a function of}} the angle of SW propagation. Similarly to conventional band diagrams, even in this case different dispersions of different modes give origin to allowed/forbidden bands, related not only to the specific in-plane angle at which they are considered, but also to the SW wavevector magnitude and the ADL constant. We performed Brilluoin light scattering (BLS) measurements on a Permalloy ADL (with a lattice constant of 440 nm), mounted on a two-axis goniometer, which allows us to choose a specific angle of incidence of light as well as to rotate the sample around the surface normal (azimuthal rotation). By changing these angles, it is possible to change the magnitude and/or the in-plane direction of the wavevector of light (and, as a consequence, of the detected SW) [1]. In Fig. 1, we show an example of angular band diagram for a SW with k= 1. 06 × 2 π/a (corresponding to a light incidence angle of 40 degrees) : full circles are the experimental data, lines are the dispersions calculated by means of the dynamical matrix method (DMM) [2]. As apparent in Fig. 1, a minimum gap between the most intense SW modes occurs close to φG= 28 degrees: however, this value is critically dependent on the wavevector magnitude (and the lattice constant, if different ADLs are compared). We derive and prove this functional dependence with analitical considerations. We believe that this results are of interest for magnon-spintronic applications where a straight antenna on an ADL is used to emit SWs in any direction (omnidirectional <b>SW</b> <b>emission).</b> References: [1] G.
