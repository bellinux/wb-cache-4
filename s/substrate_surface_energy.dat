40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} <b>substrate</b> <b>surface</b> <b>energy</b> on transcrystalline growth at the {{interface}} of a semicrystalline polymer {{and its effect}} on interfacial adhesion were investigated for substrates treated with various silane coupling agents. A thin film of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) crystallized on a high surface energy substrate (treated with ç-(aminopropyl) triethoxysilane) was composed entirely of trans-crystallites. On the other hand, when the iPP film was crystallized on a low surface energy substrate (treated with perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane), the interface was dominated by spherulites, and only a very thin transcrystalline region (thickness 1 ím) was observed. The <b>substrate</b> <b>surface</b> <b>energy</b> was found to exert a significant influence on the crystallinity, density of nuclei, crystal microstructure (e. g., lamellar thickness and crystal orientation), and thickness of the transcrystalline region near the interface. The adhesion energy measured by the asymmetric double cantilever beam (ADCB) test increased strongly (from 1 to 100 J/m 2) with surface energy. Examination of the fractured specimens using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy revealed fibrillation of the iPP induced by the strong interfacial adhesion; this was found {{to be associated with the}} breakdown of the fibrils, which is the characteristic fracture mechanism of transcrystallites at the interface in high surface energy samples. At lower surface energies, however, cracking occurs at the boundary between the transcrystallites and the spherulites because of the weak boundary layer near the interface...|$|E

40|$|The factors {{influencing}} the adherence of starch were examined {{to improve the}} understanding of the mechanisms affecting soiling and cleanability. Therefore an aqueous suspension of starch granules was sprayed on four model substrates (glass, stainless steel, polystyrene and PTFE) and dried, and the substrates were cleaned using a radial-flow cell. The morphology of the soiled surfaces and the substrate chemical composition were also characterized. By influencing droplet spreading and competition between granule-substrate and granule-granule interfaces regarding the action of capillary forces, substrate wettability affected the shape and compactness of the adhering aggregates, the efficiency of shear forces upon cleaning, and finally the adherence of soiling particles. The rate of drying had an influence explained by the duration left to capillary forces for acting. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated the presence of macromolecules, mainly polysaccharides, which were adsorbed from the liquid phase, or carried by the retracting water film and deposited at the granule-substrate interface. These macromolecules acted as an adhesive joint, the properties of which seemed to be influenced by the detailed history of drying and subsequent exposure to humidity.

The following work presents the deposition of few nanometer scale polymer layers on metallic and non-metal substrates by electrospray ionization.

The coverage and the morphology of the produced layers were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The residual amount of solvent within the deposited layers was identified by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy. Optimisation of the layer deposition was performed by varying the process parameters, e. g. distance to the sample, deposition time or deposition temperature. Based on the knowledge acquired in the experiments it was realized that the deposition parameters have to be found individually for each single polymer.

Moisture resistance of the substrates was evaluated using the C-mode scanning acoustic microscopy (C-SAM) analysis and the lead pull test.

The surface hardening process reduced the total thickness of black oxide coating, but the coating thickness was rather insensitive to the shot peening condition. The interfacial bond strength was in general higher for the as-grown coating than the surface-hardened coating.

40|$|Flight {{tests have}} shown that residue from insect strikes on {{aircraft}} wing leading edge surfaces may induce localized transition of laminar to turbulent flow. The highest density of insect populations have been observed between ground level and 153 m during light winds (2. 6 [...] 5. 1 m/s), high humidity, and temperatures from 21 [...] 29 C. At a critical residue height, dependent on the airfoil and Reynolds number, boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent results in increased drag and fuel consumption. Although this represents a minimal increase in fuel burn for conventional transport aircraft, future aircraft designs will rely on maintaining laminar flow across a larger portion of wing surfaces to reduce fuel burn during cruise. Thus, insect residue adhesion mitigation is most critical during takeoff and initial climb to maintain laminar flow in fuel-efficient aircraft configurations. Several exterior treatments investigated to mitigate insect residue buildup (e. g., paper, scrapers, surfactants, flexible surfaces) have shown potential; however, implementation {{has proven to be}} impractical.
