40|$|The {{emergence}} of MNAzymes (Multi-component nucleic acid enzymes) provides {{a new approach}} for detection of target analytes in various applications. In this thesis, three novel MNAzyme-based methodologies were developed to expand {{the range of the}} applications of MNAzymes. MNAzymes can be coupled with DNA or RNA ligands called aptamers to generate an apta-MNAzyme system, which can be used for the detection of non-nucleic target analytes such as small molecules and proteins. Direct detection using apta-MNAzyme system is performed in a format, which was isothermal, fluorescent, rapid, and requires no protein enzymes. Apta-MNAzymes can be coupled with a signal amplification cascade to increase the sensitivity of the reaction. Another MNAzyme-based methodology termed truncated MNAzyme arm system was developed to discriminate the presence of a single base mismatch of two closely related sequences. The system employs a partzyme with a truncated <b>sensor</b> <b>arm</b> and a stabiliser oligonucleotide that binds adjacently to the truncated <b>sensor</b> <b>arm</b> to stabilise the active MNAzyme structure. Truncated MNAzyme real-time PCR system is capable of discriminating the presence of a single base mismatch in a target DNA with high specificity and sensitivity (down to approximately 10 gene copies). The generic nature of the system enables simultaneous detection of three SNP targets in a multiplex format. MNAzymes was also investigated with various strategies to discriminate DNA sequences that are either methylated or unmethylated. In this thesis, bisulphite-treated DNA samples present in as low as 0. 032 % of methylated DNA in a background of unmethylated DNA were discriminated using MNAzyme real-time methylation specific PCR (MSP) system. Furthermore, the presence of 5 -methylcytosines in a target sequence increases the melting temperature of the duplex DNA. This was exploited further to directly discriminate DNA methylation status of target sequences using the truncated MNAzyme arm system without the need for bisulphite modification. Findings in this thesis have broadened the scope of MNAzymes as versatile tools for many possible applications and flexible alternative to the current technologies...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and fabrication of a thermo-electro-optic sensor using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and a resistive micro-heater placed {{in one of}} the device`s arms is presented. The Mach-Zehnder structure was fabricated on a single crystal silicon substrate using silicon oxynitride and amorphous hydrogenated silicon carbide films to form an anti-resonant reflective optical waveguide. The materials were deposited by Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique at low temperatures (similar to 320 degrees C). To optimize the heat transfer and increase the device response with current variation, part of the Mach-Zehnder <b>sensor</b> <b>arm</b> was suspended through front-side bulk micromachining of the silicon substrate in a KOH solution. With the temperature variation caused by the micro-heater, the refractive index of the core layer of the optical waveguide changes due to the thermo-optic effect. Since this variation occurs only {{in one of the}} Mach-Zehnder`s arm, a phase difference between the arms is produced, leading to electromagnetic interference. In this way, the current applied to the micro-resistor can control the device output optical power. Further, reactive ion etching technique was used in this work to define the device`s geometry, and a study of SF 6 based etching rates on different composition of silicon oxynitride films is also presented.

We tested the hypothesis that omega- 3 supplementation reduces inflammation that is induced by eccentric arm curl exercise. Healthy adult men and women (n= 11; 35 ± 10 y) performed eccentric biceps curls on two occasions, once after 14 d of dietary omega- 3 restriction (control trial) and again after 7 d of 3, 000 mg/d omega- 3 supplementation (omega- 3 trial). Before and 48 h after eccentric exercise, signs of inflammation was assessed by measuring soreness ratings, swelling (arm circumference and arm volume), and temperature (infrared skin <b>sensor).</b> <b>Arm</b> soreness increased (p < 0. 0001) in response to eccentric exercise; the magnitude of increase in soreness was 15 % less in the omega- 3 trial (p = 0. 004). Arm circumference increased after eccentric exercise in the control trial (p = 0. 01) but not in the omega- 3 trial (p = 0. 15). However, {{there was no difference between}} trials (p = 0. 45). Arm volume and skin temperature did not change in response to eccentric exercise in either trial. These findings suggest that omega- 3 supplementation decreases soreness, as a marker of inflammation, after eccentric exercise. Based on these findings, omega- 3 supplementation could provide benefits by minimizing post-exercise soreness and thereby facilitate exercise training in individuals ranging from athletes undergoing heavy conditioning to sedentary subjects or patients who are starting exercise programs or medical treatments such as physical therapy or cardiac rehabilitatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mechanically {{efficient}} and innovatively designed robots equipped with reliable detection techniques {{can not only}} help in greatly reducing {{the time needed to}} clear an area inflicted with land-mines but also reduce the life threats to indi-vidual deminers. However, prohibitive costs and reliability issues have thus far been hindering the wide scale deployment of robotic technologies in this area, especially in poorer countries of the world. Recently, we have demonstrated the deployment of an extremely low cost yet robust robot landmine detector that can achieve autonomous affordable mine detection by smaller government and pri-vate organizations. We have produced a design which is extreme in simplicity, {{in the sense that it}} can be indigenously produced, deployed and maintained in a de-veloping world country by small budget organizations using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Taking advantage of the slow nature of mine detection tasks, we have been able to achieve performance levels at par with sophisticated robotic solutions by an emphasis on mechanical simplicity (double Ackermann steering with a 5 DOF <b>sensor</b> <b>arm),</b> adaptation of off-the-shelf sensors for map building and navigation (RGB-D sensors and custom-built stereo vision), open source software architectures (Robot Operating System (ROS) on standard PC) and modular rapid-prototyping hardware for electronics and control (NI’s single-board RIO controllers under LabView). We outline some main components of the robot design in this paper including mechanical design, coverage and scanning strategies, visual servoing of the mechanical arm and mapping & localization al-gorithms to enable navigation in rough outdoor terrains. Finally, we comment on how this effort provides insights into developing field robotics application in and for developing world scenarios. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{have been conducted}} on several different batches of Vaisala RS 80 radiosondes to understand and develop methods to correct six humidity measurement errors, including chemical contamination, temperature dependence, basic calibration model, ground check, sensor aging, and <b>sensor</b> <b>arm</b> heating. The contam-ination and temperature-dependence (TD) errors dominate total errors. The chemical contamination error produces a dry bias, and {{is due to the}} occupation of binding sites in the sensor polymer by nonwater molecules emitted from the sonde packaging material. The magnitude of the dry bias depends on sensor polymer type (RS 80 -A and RS 80 -H), age of the sonde, relative humidity (RH), and temperature, and it exists throughout the troposphere. The contam-ination error generally increases with age and RH, and is larger for the RS 80 -H than the RS 80 -A. It is; 2 % and; 10 % at saturation for 1 -yr-old RS 80 -A and RS 80 -H sondes, respectively. The TD error for the RS 80 -A results from an approximation of a linear function of temperature to the actual nonlinear temperature dependence of the sensor, and also introduces a dry bias. The TD error mainly exists at temperatures below 2208 C, increases substantially with decreasing temperatures below 2308 C, and is much larger for the RS 80 -A than the RS 80 -H. The RS 80 -A’s TD correction (CTA) dominates the total correction at temperatures below 2408 C and has a correction factor [CTA 5 (RH) (CTApfactor) ] of 0. 15, 0. 75, and 2. 3 at 2408, 2608, and 2808 C, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A fiber-optic sensor {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the modal response of a highly-flexible graphite/bismaleimide lattice structure. The natural frequencies and modal amplitudes were determined based on strain readings taken from the structurally-integrated fiber-optic sensor. The advanced composite lattice structure to which the sensor was attached is a half-scale model of the aluminum grid currently being used for active control studies at the Air Force Astronautics Laboratory. The dynamically-scaled compos-ite lattice structure, which employs 2. 604 -cm (1. 025 -inches) wide strips to form a five-by-five grid, is 76. 52 -cm (30. 125 -inches) square overall with a nominal thickness of 0. 094 cm (0. 037 inches). The longitudinal and transverse members employ the same seven-ply [O 3 / 90]s stacking sequence with reference to their local coordinate system, except at the intersections, where the layers are alternated. The scaled lattice structure was fabricated from G 40 - 600 / 5245 C graphite/bismaleimide prepreg tape. The first seven modes from an ANSYS finite element model based on eight-node quadrilateral shell elements were used to optimize {{the path of the}} integral fiber-optic sensor. To form this sensor, an optical fiber was bonded to the surface along an "L"-shaped path and spliced into the <b>sensor</b> <b>arm</b> of a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which provides a voltage proportional to sensor elongation to supply real-time integrated strain data. The structure was cantilevered verti-cally from a specially-designed vise, and the natural frequencies and modal amplitudes of the lattice structure were measured using the integral fiber-optic strain sensor. The ex-perimental results were confirmed with noncontact proximity sensors.

40|$|Visibility in the {{atmosphere}} is of great interest for road and sea traffic and in aviation. The MIRA Visibility Sensor 3544 is designed to fulfill the demand for a small, low power unit to be operated with Aanderaa Measuring Stations. Visibility is often limited by fog and haze and the sensor is designed to detect these factors. The sensor consist of an aluminum body containing all necessary solid state electronics and two vertical legs. It is furnished with a standard Aanderaa meteorological sensor foot. It is a rugged, watertight, corrosion free and solid state sensor with minimum maintenance requirements. In one leg of the body, an infrared (IR) light emitting diode is installed at an angle of 25 degrees. The opposite leg contains an IR photo detector. The diode and the photo-detector are protected against clogging by a cover. The sensor has two operating modes, Normal and Fast sampling Modes, which can be selected by the Mode Switch. In Normal Mode, used when the sensor is solar-cell or battery powered, the sensor transmits an infrared light beam every minute. If fog or haze are present, forward scattered light from the particles will be detected by the photocell thus giving a signal with good correlation to the visibility in the ambient air. The photo current which {{is proportional to the}} scattered light, is amplified, averaged, converted to visibility and stored in the sensor as a 10 bit digital signal ready to be read by the Sensor Scanning Unit or Datalogger. If the sensor is powered from Mains, fast sampling mode can be used {{to increase the number of}} samples taken in a measurement cycle. This will improve the accuracy of the sensor. In this mode the light beam is transmitted every 6 seconds. To avoid false scattering from surrounding objects, the sensor must have free horizontal distance of at least 15 cm and a free vertical distance of more than 1 meters. This is taken into consideration when installing the sensor on the <b>sensor</b> <b>arm</b> of a Road Weather Station 4030 or Automati...|$|E

40|$|Successful {{operation}} of the FAA’s Low-Level Windshear Alert System (LLWAS) depends largely on birds not perching on the wind-sensing units which are installed atop poles 40 - 45 m tall. Because new LLWAS units will be erected at airports throughout North America, anti- perching devices must deter numerous avian species ranging widely in body size and behavioral pattern. To determine the most promising devices, we conducted pen trials with brown-headed cowbirds, fish crows, barred owls, great horned-owls and black vultures. Birds were given free access to an unmodified sensor unit mounted on a tripod for 24 hours, during which the only alternative perch was a tree branch at ground level. This was followed by 24 h with a perching deterrent installed on the sensor unit. Trials were video-taped 10 hours daily and the sensors were connected to a computer so that failures in acquisition of wind data due to perching activity were continuously recorded. Smaller birds (cowbirds, crows) tended to perch on the 3 <b>arms</b> of the <b>sensor</b> units and were mostly deterred by “Bird Spinners”, metal bushings slipped onto the <b>sensor</b> <b>arms</b> that turned freely and prevented the birds from obtaining a stable perch. Owls and vultures were not affected by “Bird Spinners”, but “AgSpikes” (sharp, stout spikes emanating from a central base) reduced perching 95 - 98 %. With the “AgSpikes” or “AgCone” (a smooth, solid aluminum cone) installed, owls and vultures attempted to perch but departed {{when they were not}} able to obtain a comfortable, stable grip. Commercial bird spikes and a monofilament web attached to the <b>sensor</b> <b>arms</b> were each ineffective regardless of species. It appears that a single perch deterrent device will not suffice for all birds, but a combination of “Bird Spinners” with “AgSpikes” or “AgCone” should be appropriate for most situations.

No device was totally successful against every species. Of the 5 original test devices, the most effective perching deterrent was a set of 17 stout spikes (“AgSpikes”) secured to the central portion of the sensor unit that point up 0 o to 30 o from the vertical. The central spikes were subsequently redesigned and combined with 9 metal bushings (3 for each <b>arm</b> of the <b>sensor</b> unit) that fit loosely on the <b>sensor</b> <b>arms</b> and that were armed with 5 sharp spikes each.

The framework shows the assembly of multiple <b>sensors,</b> mechanical <b>arm,</b> live video streaming and high range remote control and so on in a single robot. The planning problem is one of five fundamental challenges {{to the development of a}} real robotic system able to serve both purposes related to military and civil like live surveillance(both auto and manual), rescuing under natural disaster aftermath, firefighting, object picking, hazard like ignition, volatile gas detection, exploring underground mine or even terrestrial exploration. Each of the four other areas – hardware design, programming, controlling and artificial intelligence are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{compensation}} {{method for}} the sensitivity drift of a magnetoresistive (MR) Wheatstone bridge current sensor is proposed. The technique {{was carried out}} by placing a ruthenium temperature sensor and the MR sensor to be compensated inside a generalized impedance converter circuit (GIC). No internal modification of the <b>sensor</b> bridge <b>arms</b> is required so that the circuit is capable of compensating practical industrial sensors. The method is based on the temperature modulation of the current supplied to the bridge, which improves previous solutions based on constant current compensation. Experimental results are shown using a microfabricated spin-valve MR current sensor. The temperature compensation has been solved in the interval from 0 °C to 70 °C measuring currents from − 10 A to + 10 A...|$|R
40|$|The {{first light}} {{instrument}} on the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) {{project will be}} the InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). IRIS will be mounted on a bottom port of the facility AO instrument NFIRAOS. IRIS will report guiding information to the NFIRAOS through the On-Instrument Wavefront Sensor (OIWFS) {{that is part of}} IRIS. This will be in a self-contained compartment of IRIS and will provide three deployable wavefront <b>sensor</b> probe <b>arms.</b> This entire unit will be rotated to provide field de-rotation. Currently in our preliminary design stage our efforts have included: prototyping of the probe arm to determine the accuracy of this critical component, handling cart design and reviewing different types of glass for the atmospheric dispersion.

50|$|The ships {{had their}} torpedo tubes {{moved to the}} middle of the hull and angled outboard. This made {{available}} the required large space in the bow for the BQQ-2 (BQQ-5 as modernized from the late 1970s) sonar sphere, a new and powerful low-frequency detection <b>sensor.</b> Initially <b>armed</b> with Mark 37 torpedoes, by the late 1960s they carried the improved Mark 48 and the nuclear UUM-44 SUBROC short-range anti-submarine missile, replacing up to six Mk-48s. The Threshers were the first class fitted with the Mark 113 fire control system that enabled the use of SUBROC; they were later upgraded with the Mark 117 system. In the late 1970s the UGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile was introduced; typically four were carried in place of Mk-48s.|$|R
