5|$|Geastrum triplex may be {{confused}} with G.saccatum or G.fimbriatum, as the rays do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the <b>spore</b> <b>case.</b> However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G.triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris adhering to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the <b>spore</b> <b>case</b> is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it {{from the rest of}} the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.|$|E
5|$|Astraeus hygrometricus, {{commonly}} known as the hygroscopic earthstar, the barometer earthstar, or the false earthstar, is a species of fungus in the family Diplocystaceae. Young specimens resemble a puffball when unopened. In maturity, the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that {{is a result of the}} outer layer of fruit body tissue splitting open in a star-like manner. The false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various trees, especially in sandy soils. A.hygrometricus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and is common in temperate and tropical regions. Its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic (water-absorbing), and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity, and close them up again in drier conditions. The rays have an irregularly cracked surface, while the <b>spore</b> <b>case</b> is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top. The gleba is white initially, but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature. The spores are reddish-brown, roughly spherical with minute warts, measuring 7.5–11 micrometers in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Bovista pila {{is found}} in corrals, stables, roadsides, {{pastures}} and open woods. The puffballs fruit singly, scattered, or in groups on the ground.

5000|$|They grow {{in loose}} tufts 14-20 cm long, {{occasionally}} up to 1 m long. The leaves are 7-11 mm long (shorter, 3-6 mm, at annual nodes), narrow, lance-shaped, shiny, and evergreen. The edges are irregularly toothed. The sporangia (<b>spore</b> <b>cases)</b> are {{nestled in the}} bases of the upper leaves.|$|R
50|$|Salvinia natans has two nickel-sized leaves lying {{flat against}} {{the surface of the}} water, and a third {{submerged}} leaf which functions as a root. Flotation is made possible by pouches of air within the leaves.

The rhizomorphs are fragile, and often break off after maturity.|$|E
500|$|The small, tough, fruit {{bodies are}} grayish-brown balls that are {{initially}} enclosed by a skin, or peridium, {{made up of}} four distinct layers of tissue. The outer tissue layer splits to form star-like rays and expose a circular <b>spore</b> <b>case.</b> Inside the <b>spore</b> <b>case</b> is the gleba—fertile spore-producing tissue that is white and firm when young, but becomes brown and powdery in age. The grayish-brown <b>spore</b> <b>case</b> is set on a short, slender stalk, and has a well-defined narrow pore at the top where mature spores may escape. Fully expanded, the fruit body reaches dimensions up to [...] wide and up to about [...] tall. The outer skin is purplish-brown, with four or five cream or yellowish-brown colored rays that have their tips stuck in the substrate. There is a flat mat of interwoven mycelia between ray tips. The spores are spherical, warty, and have a diameter of up to 6µm. Geastrum quadrifidum {{is one of a}} number of earthstars whose rays arch downward as they mature, lifting the spore sac upward, high enough to catch air currents that disseminate the spores into new habitats. The species is easily confused with Geastrum fornicatum, a larger earthstar without a well-defined pore mouth.|$|E
500|$|The fruit body, {{initially}} {{shaped like}} a puffball, is encased within an outer covering that splits open from the top to form rays.

500|$|One study {{reported}} a specimen found in Mexico with {{a length of}} [...] Typically, the <b>spore</b> <b>case</b> is [...] broad by [...] tall. The hollow stalk is pale brown to brown, woody, and has a fibrous, scaly, or even woolly surface. The mature gleba, which is eventually exposed when the peridial cap is shed, has a rust-brown color. The cap may persist after the spore mass is dispersed and form a disc-like unit that slides down the stalk like a ring. The fragile sac-shaped volva is up to [...] broad, unattached to the stalk, and formed by two distinct, separated tissue layers. The inner layer resembles the scales of the stem, consisting of hyphae that are 3–18µm in diameter, closely arranged (nearly parallel), septate, sparsely branched, yellowish ochre, with clamps at some septa. The outer layer of fungal tissue is thicker, membranous, sometimes with a corky texture when dry, and dirty white. It consists of pale yellow intertwined hyphae {{that are difficult to}} distinguish individually, and without remains of a gelatinous matrix. Fruit bodies may persist for several months after they have dried.|$|E
500|$|Young {{specimens}} of A.hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that typically start their development partially {{embedded in the}} substrate. A smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body, and may be partially encrusted with debris. As the fruit body matures, the mycelial layer tears away, and the outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, breaks open in a star-shaped (...) pattern to form 4–20 irregular [...] "rays". This simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round <b>spore</b> <b>case</b> enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium. The rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment, opening up in high humidity, and closing when the air is dry. This is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue; the innermost, fibrous layer is hygroscopic, and curls or uncurls the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings. This adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of optimum moisture, and reduce evaporation during dry periods. Further, dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind, allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll.|$|E

Sporonts are {{free in the}} cytoplasm and divide by multiple exogenous budding. In sporogenesis the polar sac is formed from golgi vesicles, the manubrium form a dense golgi body and the coiled polar filament form a spiral cisterna linked with the perinuclear membrane system and golgi reticulum. This was also implicated {{in the formation of}} the endospore. The polaroplast developed from expanded sacs derived from the manubrium. Uninucleate spores (4. 2 x 2. 4 µm) possessed 7 - 9 filament coils and lamellar polaroplast. Foci of infection were associated with liver connective tissue, and histopathological effects limited to adjacent cell necrosis due to pressure atrophy in restricted sites. Host responses result in granuloma formation, with gradual resolution of the lesion. In vitro investigations into spore hatching and viability showed exsporulation was stimulated by oxidising agents and following pretreatment with media of low pH or high osmolarity.

Methods Muscle tissues from suspected cases of blackleg were analysed both by the standard culture method followed by biochemical identification and by PCR, with and without preculture. To investigate whether muscle tissue samples are necessary, samples taken by swabs were also investigated. Samples from a biogas plant and manure and soil from farms were analysed by culture followed by PCR. The farms had proven cases of blackleg. For detection of C. chauvoei in the samples, a specific PCR primer pair complementary to the spacer region of the 16 S- 23 S rRNA gene was used. Results Clostridium chauvoei was detected in 32 % of muscle samples analysed by culture with identification by biochemical methods and in 56 % of cases by culture in combination with PCR. Clostridium chauvoei was detected in 3 (out of 11) samples from the biogas plants collected before pasteurisation, but samples taken after pasteurisation and after digestion all tested negative. Clostridium chauvoei was not detected in any soil or silage samples and only one manure samples tested positive. Conclusion The diagnostic method used for C. chauvoei was not applicable in estimating the risk of blackleg on particular pastures from manure or soil samples, but found to be highly useful for clinical samples. </p...|$|R

Lateral and distal subungual onychomycosis (OSD-L) was detected in 20 cases (62. 5 %). The microscopic examination with KOH showed filaments in 19 cases (59. 4 %), dermatophytoma in 9 cases (28. 1 %), <b>spores</b> in 2 <b>cases</b> (6. 25 %), and filaments and <b>spores</b> in 2 <b>cases</b> (6. 25 %). Etiologic agents: Aspergillus sp., 11 cases (34. 4 %); Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, 8 cases (25. 0 %); Cladosporium sp., 3 cases (9. 4 %); Acremonium sp., 2 cases (6. 25 %); Paecilomyces sp., 2 cases (6. 25 %); Tritirachium oryzae, 2 cases (6. 25 %); Fusarium sp., Phialophora sp., Rhizopus sp. and Alternaria alternate, 1 case (3. 1 %) each. CONCLUSIONS: We found onychomycosis by opportunistic molds in 0. 76 % of the cases and DLSO was present in 62. 5 %. The most frequent isolated etiological agents were: Aspergillus sp. and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis...|$|R
30|$|A {{critical}} phase {{during the}} life cycle of sessile marine organisms is the planktonic dispersal stage, (larvae in the case of invertebrates such as barnacles and hydroids; motile <b>spores</b> in the <b>case</b> of many seaweeds), during which they settle and attach to a surface. Settlement is a selective process involving reversible contact with the substratum through exploratory behavior in response to a range of surface-associated signals. Having selected a suitable surface the attached larvae/spores then undergo metamorphosis to generate the adult organisms. When the immersed surface is man-made, the resulting colonization is a nuisance phenomenon generally referred to as ‘biofouling’, which causes major financial and environmental problems in various industries. Ships and leisure vessels, membrane filters, heat exchangers, underwater sensors and aquaculture systems are all subject to biofouling, with the consequence for ships of higher fuel consumption (and hence greenhouse gas and soot emissions) and demand for frequent cleaning [1].|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} study, fifth larval instars of Spodoptera littoralis were {{injected}} by spores of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae {{to find their}} effects on cellular immunity and enzymes involved in intermediary metabolism. The highest numbers of plasmatocytes were observed 6 hours post-injection for both entomopathogenic fungi although there were the slight significant differences between time intervals of 3 - 12 hours. The highest numbers of granulocytes were observed 6 hours post-injection for both fungi although slight statistical differences were found by injecting spores of B. bassiana after 3 - 6 hours. Injection of larvae by B. bassiana spores caused {{the highest number of}} nodules 12 hours post-injection but spores of M. anisopliae caused the highest number of nodules after 1 - 6 hours of post-injection. The highest activity of phenoloxidase was obtained 6 - 12 hours post-injection by B. bassiana spores while the highest enzymatic activity was found 12 hours after injection by M. anisopliae <b>spores.</b> In <b>case</b> of assayed enzymes including, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, δ-glutamyl transferase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase, the highest activities were observed 6 - 12 hours post-injection by fungal spores. The results demonstrated that the highest physiological phenomena like immune responses and intermediary metabolisms were occurred 12 hours post-injection by entomopathogenic fungi. Determination of these processes could be helpful to improve quality of entomopathogenic fungi and their efficiency to decrease population outbreaks of pest...|$|R
