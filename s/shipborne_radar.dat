To be independent upon environmental measurements, which are generally not as precise and reliable as they have to be for a proper input to simulation programs, usually based upon parabolic equation models, a method to retrieve the refractive index gradients in the low troposphere is the Refractivity from Clutter (RFC) algorithm. The propagation factor is computed from the received clutter power and is iteratively processed in order to retrieve the refractive index profiles. Under a respective French-German technical agreement a measurement program concerning radar propagation in the maritime boundary layer has been initiated, with contributions from ONERA-CERT, DGA MI/TN, Fraunhofer-FHR and the German Technical Center for Ships and Naval Weapons (WTD 71).

Often strong gradients of humidity and temperature {{can be observed}} close to the air-water interface leading to abnormal propagation effects such as ducting. For <b>shipborne</b> <b>radars</b> operating at frequencies above L-band, the evaporation duct is the dominant propagation mechanism affecting the maximum detection range of horizon-search radars. Ducting can also increase sea clutter return within and beyond the normal horizon, and surface-based ducts can enhance land clutter return from extended ranges. During sea trials in the Skagerrak and the Baltic Sea in 2003 and 2004, FWG was responsible for environmental characterization of the boundary layer. In-situ measurements included recordings of atmospheric and sea surface parameters. Investigations with multi-sensor buoys and with radiosondes were performed on board the German research vessel PLANET respectively on FGS HELMSAND. The drift buoys developed by FWG provided unperturbed, time resolved information on air-sea interaction processes. In addition to meteorological parameters sea state, sea surface roughness, and sea surface temperature were measured. Refractivity profiles were determined based on data sets gathered by measurements of pressure, humidity and temperature from the sea surface up to 1 km altitude. Simultaneously to atmospheric measurements radar propagation investigations were performed by FGAN-FHR (Research Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques). PLANET, FGS STOLLERGRUND were illuminated by a radar operating at X-, Ka- and W-band.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 41 - 42) In airborne or <b>shipborne</b> doppler <b>radar,</b> discrimination {{of moving}} target echos from stationary clutter echo {{is complicated by}} the doppler frequency shift of the stationary clutter echo due to the radar's own motion. When a severe clutter interference is expected, a specially designed doppler filter is needed to reject as much of the clutter as possible while enhancing the echo signal from a moving target. For this purpose, the optimum Moving Target Indication filter is described and a FORTRAN program to calculate the filter weights is presented. The frequency response of certain calculated filters is also analyzed. To implement these filters in a radar system, the optimum weights must be truncated to fit the finite word length of the radar's computer. The effect of truncation is analyzed for various degrees of truncation and various filter bandwidths. The filter's truncation errors are found to be within a tolerable limit for a typical level of truncation (sic.). If more than one set of filter weights can be stored in the radar's computer, the computer may be able to choose a set of weights based on information about the radar's own motion.

This joint effort is referred as Joint-FACET (Fusion Algorithms & Concepts Exploration Testbed), a highly modular and flexible series of applications that is capable of processing both real and synthetic input data. The question raised here is how realistic should the sensor simulations be to trust the MSDF performance assessment?

Following this philosophy, the MFR model, presented here, takes into account sensor's design parameters and external environmental effects such as clutter, propagation and jamming. Previous radar simulations capture most of these dominant effects.

This study uses a unique combination of satellite and shipborne Doppler radar data including both {{horizontal and vertical}} cross sections through drizzle cells. Stratocumulus cloud structure was classified as closed cellular, open cellular, or unclassifiable using infrared satellite images. Distributions of drizzle cell structure, size, and intensity are similar among the cloud-structure categories, though the open-cellular distributions are shifted toward higher values. Stronger and larger drizzle cells preferentially occur when the cloud field is broken (open-cellular and unclassifiable categories). Satellite observations of cloud structure {{may be useful to}} indicate the most likely distribution of rain rates associated with a set of scenes, but infrared data alone are not sufficient to develop routine precipitation retrievals for marine stratocumulus. Individual drizzle cells about 2 – 20 km across usually showed precipitation growth within the cloud layer and evaporation below, divergence near echo top, and convergence below cloud base. Diverging flow near the surface was also observed beneath heavily precipi-tating drizzle cells.

Almost transversing vessels (98 %) are inter-island car-cariers. ii) Passing speeds of oil-tankers or cargo-ships are estimated at about 10 knots mean. Cruising speeds of fishing boats around 5 G/T are relatively high at 11 knots mean and 24 knots at maximum. iii) A regular lane for passing vessels is ranged within 0. 4 ～ 1. 2 n. m. southward of Setsumezaki and 0. 2 ～ 1. 2 n. m. northward of Gotsashb iv) The number of fishing boats in operation is greater in daytime than at night in this passage and they are particularly concentrated around the slack water time. However, these fishing boats do not disturb sea traffic, because they are scattered in small groups and are not so dense. 1) 早崎瀬戸の通航船舶量は昼間に多く夜間は著しく少ない. とくに 5000 総トン以上の大型船は原則的に昼間通過する. 2) 種類別にみると,早崎瀬戸の通過船舶はタンカーおよび貨物船が 80 %を占め,次いで砂利運搬が 8 %にも達している. この砂利運搬船が多いのが大きな特徴であろう. また,当瀬戸を横切る南北航路では,カーフェリーが 98 %を占めている. 3) 通航船舶の平均対地速力は,タンカーおよび貨物船では約 10 ノットで,漁船は約 11 ノットと高速で最高 24 ノットの船速も観測された. 4) 主たる通峡航路は,瀬詰埼の南 0. 4 ～ 1. 2 マイルおよび五通礁の北 0. 2 ～ 1. 2 マイルの幅であるが,東航の場合西航船よりやや南寄りを航行する傾向がある. 5) 島原湾南部海域に関連する登録漁船数は約 6000 隻の多きに達するが,その稼働率は 2 ～ 5 %と考えられるから,実際の出漁漁船数は実数に比べて著しく少ない. 6) 漁船は一般に塊状に分布し,夜間は昼間に比し著しく少ない. 一方,この海域の漁獲は年々減少の傾向にあるから,早崎瀬戸通航船舶に支障を来すほど多数の漁船団は今後当分の間出現しないと考えられる...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigations}} {{carried out}} between 2002 and 2004 during six field experiments within the Operational Radar and Optical Mapping in monitoring hydrodynamic, morphodynamic and environmental parameters for coastal management (OROMA) project aimed {{to improve the}} effectiveness of new remote sensing monitoring technologies such as <b>shipborne</b> imaging <b>radars</b> in coastal waters. The coastal monitoring radar of the GKSS Research Center, Geesthacht, Germany, {{is based on a}} Kelvin Hughes RSR 1000 X band (9. 42 GHz) vertical (VV) polarized river radar and was mounted on board the research vessel Ludwig Prandtl during the experiments in the Lister Tief, a tidal inlet of the German Bight in the North Sea. The important progress realized in this investigation is the availability of calibrated X band radar data. Another central point of the study is to demonstrate the applicability of the quasi-specular scattering theory in combination with the weak hydrodynamic interaction theory for the radar imaging mechanism of the seabed. Radar data have been taken at very low grazing angles ≤ 2. 6 ° of flood and ebb tide–oriented sand wave signatures at the sea surface during ebb tidal current phases. Current speeds perpendicular to the sand wave crest ≤ 0. 6 m s− 1 have been measured at wind speeds ≤ 4. 5 m s− 1 and water depths ≤ 25 m. The difference between the maximum measured and simulated normalized radar cross section (NRCS) modulation of the ebb tide–oriented sand wave is 27 %. For the flood tide–oriented sand wave, a difference of 21 % has been calculated. The difference between the minimum measured and simulated NRCS modulation of the ebb tide–oriented sand wave is 10 %, and for the flood tide–oriented sand wave, a value of 43 % has been derived. Phases of measured and simulated NRCS modulations correspond to asymmetric sand wave slopes. The results of the simulated NRCS modulation show the qualitative trend but do not always quantitatively match the measured NRCS modulation profiles because the quasi-specular scattering theory at very low grazing angle is a first-order theory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{curve-fitting}} and intensity-level-selection (ILS) -based algorithms {{for wind}} parameter extraction from <b>shipborne</b> X-band nautical <b>radar</b> images are investigated. First, {{to exclude the}} rain cases and low-backscatter images, a data quality control process is designed for both algorithms. An additional process is then introduced for the ILS-based method to improve the accuracy of wind measurements, including the recognition of blockages and islands in the temporally integrated radar images. For the low sea states, a dual-curve-fitting is pro-posed. These wind algorithms are tested using <b>radar</b> images and <b>shipborne</b> anemometer data collected {{on the east coast}} of Canada. It is shown that the dual-curve-fitting algorithm pro-duces improvements in the mean differences between the radar and the anemometer results for wind direction and speed of about 5. 7 ◦ and 0. 3 m/s, respectively, under sea states with significant wave height lower than 2. 30 m. Also, a harmonic function that is least-squares fitted to the selected range distances vector as a function of antenna look direction is applied. Compared with the original ILS-based algorithm, the modified procedure reduces the standard deviation for wind direction and speed by about 4 ◦ and 0. 2 m/s, respectively. Finally, the performance of these two modified methods are compared. Index Terms—Shipborne nautical radar, wind speed and direc-tion, X-band. I...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The {{focus of this}} thesis is the examination of a method to supplement current combatant ship synthesis tools with combat system equipment and warfighting capability parameters. Current conceptual ship design tools lack an early integration of the naval architecture and the combat system aspects of a ship. Although the U. S. Navy's vision and the current JCIDS process involve designing ships based on warfighting capability using measures of effectiveness, the current ship synthesis tools lack the appropriate combat system parameters that will allow design for capability. This study specifically investigates a link between a combat system capability and a ship design by conducting research and analysis on an existing combat system, a <b>shipborne</b> air search <b>radar.</b> A mathematical relationship was obtained between the radars detection ranges and their respective system weights. This equation describing {{the relationship between a}} combat system capability (radar detection range) and a naval architecture parameter (weight) was used to supplement an existing Excel-based ship synthesis tool. By inserting this into the model, the ships synthesized were able to change based on a desired combat system capability input from the user. Additionally, by modeling the radar detection range in a warfighting scenario in ExtendSim, the impacts of the radar detection range on warfighting effectiveness were computed. Therefore, it was demonstrated that a ship synthesis model could produce designs based on a user's input of a stakeholder-desired combat capability. Using a single combat system and its corresponding measure of effectiveness in a single warfare area, this thesis shows as a proof of concept that combat system capability can be integrated into ship design. It lays the groundwork for creating an improved ship synthesis tool that includes complete sensitivity to capabilities from all the combat systems on the ship and how these selected parameters impact mission performance in a large spectrum of warfare areas. With this new ship synthesis model, designers can directly address stakeholder concerns, and can conduct trade off analyses for decision makers that result in an optimal ship design...|$|R
