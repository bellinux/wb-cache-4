40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study and prepare basic time for piling works by synthetic equations. The time data of 7 work elements of piling works were collected from 10 different construction sites in Phuket Province of Thailand. The synthetic equations were derived with multiple regressions analysis method using statistic software package. These work elements consisted of pile driving work, moving piling rig left or right on <b>supporting</b> <b>rails,</b> moving <b>supporting</b> <b>rails</b> left or right, moving piling rig and <b>supporting</b> <b>rails</b> back or forth, joining of two-piece pile by welding, joining of two-piece pile by steel coupling, and pile driving with pushing post. These synthetic equations were used to determine the basic time, standard time, and productivity values for various types and sizes of square precast concrete pile. The researchers found that these productivity values were reliable compared to general practice, and could be applied in construction planning and scheduling in Phuket province or other area with similar geological conditions...|$|R

50|$|Flagler’s origins {{date back}} to the {{original}} railroad company founded by Henry M. Flagler in 1888. After visiting Florida with his sick wife, Flagler saw the state’s great potential for tourism. He began purchasing small railroad companies, and started expanding his rail network down Florida’s eastern seaboard. Florida East Coast Railway eventually stretched from Jacksonville to Key West.To <b>support</b> <b>rail</b> operations, Flagler also invested millions of dollars developing new infrastructure such as hotels, resorts, roadways, and utilities.|$|E
50|$|The Madison Street {{corridor}} {{was identified}} as a bus rapid transit candidate in the 2012 Transit Master Plan, adopted by the city of Seattle with input from King County Metro. While other routes were given feasibility studies for streetcars, as part of a new municipal system, Madison Street was considered too steep to <b>support</b> <b>rail</b> transit. The Madison Street corridor, from Downtown Seattle to Madison Park, was historically served by cable car service from 1890 until 1940, when they were scrapped and replaced with motor buses and trolleybuses on modern-day routes 11 and 12.|$|E

30|$|Discrete <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> {{model and}} {{continuous}} <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model are two classical {{models for the}} traditional mechanical analysis of railway track [1, 2]. In the discrete <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model, the stiffness of fastener supporting track is a spring constant, while in the continuous <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model, it is denoted by track modulus, which is calculated with the spring constant divided by the spacing between centers of discrete supports. The stiffness measurement method based on the Winkler elastic foundation model uses track modulus to characterize the overall track stiffness.|$|R
40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus is an {{important}} factor in safety of railway track. This parameter is defined as support force imposing on rail length unit per rail unit displacement in vertical direction. <b>Rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus is important because it affects track performance and maintenance requirements. Both low and large modulus is undesirable. Low modulus of the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> has been shown to cause differential settlement that then increases maintenance needs. On the other hand, higher value of <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> causes axle load to be distributed on fewer sleepers and therefore received dynamic loads for any sleeper and rail-sleeper fastening will be increased. Sandy desert areas are critical regions about the contamination of ballast. In these areas, flowing sand grains influence between ballast aggregates and increase the stiffness of ballast layer and the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus. In this paper, the results of a field investigation about the effect of ballast contamination on the values of the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus in sandy desert areas are presented...|$|R

5000|$|Americus's {{innovation}} was {{the addition}} of an [...] "escapement" [...] to Silbermann's realization of a string striking action design. Unlike Cristofori's design (to which of course Americus had no access) which interposed an intermediate lever between the lever that the key lifts and the striking hammer, Americus placed an upstanding wooden [...] "jack" [...] pivoting from this lever acting directly on a leather clothed notch in the hammer butt. An adjustable screw mounted underneath the hammer flange <b>support</b> <b>rail,</b> known as a [...] "set-off", impacts upon the jack, disengaging it from the hammer which is thus launched into free flight before it strikes its course of strings.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bed frame}} or {{bedstead}} {{is the part}} of a bed used to position the mattress and base (foundation), and may include means of supporting a canopy above. Bed frames are typically made of wood or metal. A bed frame includes head, foot, and side rails. It may also include slats to support the mattress, in which case a separate base is not necessary, as in a platform bed. Most double (full) sized beds, along with all queen and king size beds, require some type of center <b>support</b> <b>rail,</b> typically also with extra feet extending down to the floor. The term [...] "bed frame" [...] was first used in 1805-1815.|$|E
50|$|Under the plan, {{which was}} {{also known as the}} San Francisco Bay Project, the mouth of the Sacramento River (from Suisun Bay) would be {{channelized}} by dams and would feed two freshwater lakes within the bay, providing drinking water to the residents of the Bay Area. The barriers would <b>support</b> <b>rail</b> and highway traffic and would create two vast freshwater lakes, supplying irrigation water to farms. Between the lakes, Reber proposed the reclamation of 20000 acre of land that would be crossed by a freshwater channel. West of the channel would be airports, a naval base, and a pair of locks comparable in size to those of the Panama Canal. Industrial plants would be developed on the east.|$|E
50|$|The switch {{was formed}} {{of a single}} {{swinging}} section turning upon a hinge of great strength attached {{to one of the}} posts. A movement of four or five feet by the free end of the switch was enough to permit the cars and trucks on one track to clear the end of the other track. The free end travels upon a carriage provided with rollers moving upon a <b>supporting</b> <b>rail.</b> Suitable mechanism was provided for operating the switch and locking it in place.|$|R

5000|$|The Northgate Border Crossing {{connects the}} cities of Bowbells, North Dakota and Alameda, Saskatchewan on the Canada-US border. It is reached by North Dakota Highway 8 on the American side and Saskatchewan Highway 9 on the Canadian side. This border {{crossing}} opened in 1962, when Highway 8 was built, which passed a half mile west of {{the small town of}} Northgate, North Dakota. The abandoned US and Canada border stations stand in ruins at the former crossing. After being idle for years, the Canadian National Railway upgraded its tracks at this crossing to <b>support</b> <b>rail</b> traffic from the Bakken oil field. [...] The US upgraded its border station on Highway 8 in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Company towns {{often become}} regular public {{cities and towns}} as they grow and attract other settlement, {{business}} enterprises, and pool transportation and services infrastructure. Other times, a town may not officially be a company town, {{but it may be}} a town where the majority of citizens are employed by a single company, thus creating a similar situation to a company town (especially in regard to the town's economy). Further, such dependencies extend to neighborhoods and regions of larger cities. In each case, if the primary company falls on lean times, fails outright or the industry fades in importance (as with steam locomotive <b>support</b> <b>rail</b> yards and anthracite mining industries which depended on steam locomotives spurring demands) the communities contract and lose property value and then population as people move to find work elsewhere, and the youth of the community bears the children of their generation in another demographic region.|$|E
