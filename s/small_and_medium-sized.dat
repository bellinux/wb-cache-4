40|$|Megacities have {{frequently}} received a disproportionate {{amount of attention}} over other sizes of cities in recent discourse on urban sustainability. In this article, {{the authors argue that}} a focus on <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> cities is crucial to achieving substantial progress towards more sustainable urban development, not only because they are home to at least a quarter of the world’s population but because they also offer great potential for sustainable transformations. In principle, their size allows for flexibility in terms of urban expansion, adoption of “green” travel modes, and environmental protection. At the same time, <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> cities often have fewer resources to implement new transport measures and can be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the world economy. This article critically reviews the potential role and impact of nine commonly considered options for sustainable urban transport in cities in developing countries: (1) road infrastructure; (2) rail-based public transport; (3) road-based public transport; (4) support for non-motorized travel modes; (5) technological solutions; (6) awareness-raising campaigns; (7) pricing mechanisms; (8) vehicle access restrictions; and (9) control of land-uses. Drawing on international research and examples of policies to reduce the environmental impacts of transport in urban areas, this article identifies some key lessons for sustainable urban transport in <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> cities in developing countries. These lessons are certainly not always identical to those for megacities in the global south. OTBArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R

5|$|The common endemic Fiji goshawk is a {{specialist}} predator of <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> birds, and the swamp harrier {{is also a}} widespread predator, often taking fledglings. The local subspecies of the peregrine falcon, Falco peregrinus nesiotes will hunt finches, but is itself rare and declining. Barn owls eat mainly rats, but sometimes take small birds. Rats and mice use Fiji parrotfinch nests, and may be significant predators of the species, and the small Asian mongoose will prey on birds feeding on the ground. The fan-tailed cuckoo, which has an endemic Fijian subspecies, is a brood parasite, but the parrotfinch {{does not appear to}} be a host of this large cuckoo.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the tail}} {{had at least}} forty caudal vertebrae, it was highly mobile. It could {{possibly}} swing at an arc of 180 degrees, covering the entire half circle behind it. Swing speeds {{at the tail end}} may have been as high as 50km/h. Continuous rapid swings would have allowed the spikes to slash open the skin of its attacker or to stab the soft tissues and break the ribs or facial bones. More directed blows would have resulted in the sides of the spikes fracturing even sturdy longbones of the legs by blunt trauma. These attacks would have crippled <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> theropods and may even have done some damage to large ones. Earlier interpretations of the defensive behaviour of Kentrosaurus included the suggestion that the animal might have charged to the rear, to run through attackers with its spines, in the way of modern porcupines.|$|E

A suggested example of such old family remains are the 9 Metis and 113 Amalthea pair. Further evidence for a large number of past families (now dispersed) comes from analysis of chemical ratios in iron meteorites.

5|$|Tourism {{supported}} by fishing is {{the mainstay of}} Whitby's economy in an isolated community with poor transport infrastructure and restricted by building constraints in the surrounding North York Moors National Park. The economy is governed by the changing fortunes of fishing, tourism and to some extent, manufacturing. Structural changes have led to concentrations of deprivation, unemployment and benefit dependence. A narrowing employment base and dependence on low wage and low skill sectors has resulted in younger age groups leaving the area. There are few business start-ups and <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> enterprises. Older people who make increasing demands on the area's health and social care capacity have moved into the area. Demographic changes, Whitby's relative isolation from the region's main growth areas and decline in traditional employment sectors pose an economic challenge.|$|E
5|$|Most slaves {{worked as}} {{plantation}} laborers. Relatively few Brazilians owned slaves and most <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>medium-sized</b> farms employed free workers. Slaves {{could be found}} scattered throughout society in other capacities: some were used as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners and in many other roles. Many emancipated slaves went on to acquire slaves and there were even cases of slaves who had their own slaves. While slaves were usually black or mulatto there were reported cases of slaves {{who appeared to be}} of European descent—the product of generations of inter-ethnic sexual relations between male slave owners and their female mulatto slaves. Even the harshest slave owners adhered to a long-established practice of selling slaves along with their families, taking care not to separate individuals. Slaves were regarded by law as properties. The ones who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteed—the only exception being that, until 1881, freed slaves were barred from voting in elections, although their children and descendants could vote.|$|E
