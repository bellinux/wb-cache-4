5|$|Fabry-Pérot etalons {{are widely}} used in telecommunications, lasers and {{spectroscopy}} to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, the technology that {{enables the use of}} multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. <b>Single-mode</b> lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and <b>single-mode</b> fibers. Multimode fibers {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} and procurement {{of the original}} <b>single-mode</b> missiles cost £370m, a figure inflated by accounting charges relating to the delays. The development of the dual-mode version cost an additional £10m. The Daily Telegraph reported that the dual mode missiles cost £105,000, which {{is comparable to the}} cost of the AGM-65 Maverick; the MoD quote only a gross book value of £175,000, which includes development costs as well as the purchase cost of the missile. Upgrading a <b>single-mode</b> missile to dual mode costs between £35,000 and £45,000 plus VAT, depending on quantities ordered.|$|E
25|$|Empirical {{research}} has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both scattering and absorption. <b>Single-mode</b> optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard <b>single-mode</b> fiber for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17dB/km at 1550nm. For example, an 8km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was as clear as fiber, one could see {{all the way to the}} bottom even of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.|$|E
25|$|The IEEE 802.3cd Task Force is {{currently}} developing 50 and next-generation 100 and 200 Gbit/s standards using one, two, or four 50Gbit/s lanes respectively. 200Gbit/s over <b>single-mode</b> fiber is developed alongside 400Gbit/s by task force 802.3bs.|$|E
25|$|The {{waveguide}} {{analysis shows}} that the light energy in the fiber is not completely confined in the core. Instead, especially in <b>single-mode</b> fibers, a significant fraction of the energy in the bound mode travels in the cladding as an evanescent wave.|$|E
25|$|Most WDM systems {{operate on}} <b>single-mode</b> fiber optical cables, {{which have a}} core {{diameter}} of 9µm. Certain forms of WDM {{can also be used}} in multi-mode fiber cables (also known as premises cables) which have core diameters of 50 or 62.5µm.|$|E
25|$|For {{high output}} power and broader {{wavelength}} range, tapered amplifiers are used. These amplifiers {{consist of a}} lateral <b>single-mode</b> section and a section with a tapered structure, where the laser light is amplified. The tapered structure leads to a reduction of the power density at the output facet.|$|E
25|$|With {{properly}} polished <b>single-mode</b> fibers, the emitted beam has {{an almost}} perfect Gaussian shape—even {{in the far}} field—if a good lens is used. The lens needs to {{be large enough to}} support the full numerical aperture of the fiber, and must not introduce aberrations in the beam. Aspheric lenses are typically used.|$|E
25|$|In simpler terms, {{there is}} a maximum angle from the fiber axis at which light may enter the fiber {{so that it will}} propagate, or travel, in the core of the fiber. The sine of this maximum angle is the {{numerical}} aperture (NA) of the fiber. Fiber with a larger NA requires less precision to splice and work with than fiber with a smaller NA. <b>Single-mode</b> fiber has a small NA.|$|E
25|$|Polarization is best {{understood}} by initially considering only pure polarization states, {{and only a}} coherent sinusoidal wave at some optical frequency. The vector in the adjacent diagram might describe the oscillation of the electric field emitted by a <b>single-mode</b> laser (whose oscillation frequency would be typically 1015 times faster). The field oscillates in the x-y plane, along the page, with the wave propagating in the z direction, perpendicular to the page.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>single-mode</b> fiber has a core {{diameter}} of 8–10 micrometers and is designed for use in the near infrared. The mode structure depends on the wavelength of the light used, so that this fiber actually supports a small number of additional modes at visible wavelengths. Multi-mode fiber, by comparison, is manufactured with core diameters as small as 50 micrometers and as large as hundreds of micrometers. The normalized frequency V for this fiber should be less than the first zero of the Bessel function J0 (approximately 2.405).|$|E
25|$|In a {{laboratory}} environment, a bare fiber end is coupled using a fiber launch system, {{which uses a}} microscope objective lens to focus the light down to a fine point. A precision translation stage (micro-positioning table) is used to move the lens, fiber, or device to allow the coupling efficiency to be optimized. Fibers with a connector on the end make this process much simpler: the connector is simply plugged into a pre-aligned fiberoptic collimator, which contains a lens that is either accurately positioned {{with respect to the}} fiber, or is adjustable. To achieve the best injection efficiency into <b>single-mode</b> fiber, the direction, position, size and divergence of the beam must all be optimized. With good beams, 70 to 90% coupling efficiency can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{connector}} {{is installed}} by preparing the fiber end and inserting {{it into the}} rear of the connector body. Quick-set adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a strain relief is secured to the rear. Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, {{depending on the type of}} fiber and the application. For <b>single-mode</b> fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called gap loss. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.|$|E
25|$|Fiber with a core {{diameter}} less than about {{ten times the}} wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when coherent light propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called <b>single-mode</b> or mono-mode fiber. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the fiber core {{is large enough to}} support more than a few modes.|$|E
25|$|Brimstone {{was used}} {{extensively}} during Operation Ellamy over Libya in 2011. According to a British Ministry of Defence News report, dated 26 March 2011, RAF Tornado GR4 aircraft launched several Brimstone missiles over {{the towns of}} Misrata and Ajdabiya destroying {{a total of five}} armoured vehicles belonging to the Gaddafi regime. Sixty Brimstone were fired in the first four weeks of the Libya campaign, out of 110 Brimstone fired in all operations up to that time. This prompted the MoD to ask MBDA to convert more missiles to the dual-mode version. 150 dual-mode missiles had been ordered in December 2010, but according to the Royal United Services Institute, stocks of usable dual-mode missiles fell to single figures at one stage of the Libya campaign. The 500th dual-mode Brimstone was delivered in March 2012, at which time over 200 had been fired in combat. The <b>single-mode</b> missile was not fired in combat until 15 September 2011 when a pair of RAF Tornado GR4 of IX(B) Squadron fired 22 missiles (including a salvo of 12 by one aircraft) against an armoured column near Sebha/Sabha, 400 miles south of Tripoli.|$|E

2500|$|Optical fibers {{typically}} {{include a}} core {{surrounded by a}} transparent cladding material with a lower index of refraction. Light is kept in the core by the phenomenon of total internal reflection which causes the fiber {{to act as a}} waveguide. Fibers that support many propagation paths or transverse modes are called multi-mode fibers (MMF), while those that support a single mode are called <b>single-mode</b> fibers (SMF). Multi-mode fibers generally have a wider core diameter and are used for short-distance communication links and for applications where high power must be transmitted. <b>Single-mode</b> fibers are used for most communication links longer than [...]|$|E

In 2002, the first 10 Gigabit Ethernet {{standard}} was published as IEEE Std 802.3ae-2002. Subsequent standards encompass media types for <b>single-mode</b> fibre (long haul), multi-mode fibre (up to 400m), copper backplane (up to 1m) and copper twisted pair (up to 100m). All 10-gigabit standards were consolidated into IEEE Std 802.3-2008. , 10 Gigabit Ethernet is predominantly deployed in carrier networks, where 10GBASE-LR and 10GBASE-ER enjoy significant market shares.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} features of any VECSEL is the small thickness of the semiconductor gain region in the direction of propagation, less than 100nm. In contrast, a conventional in-plane semiconductor laser entails light propagation over distances of from 250µm upward to 2mm or longer. The significance of the short propagation distance is that it causes the effect of [...] "antiguiding" [...] nonlinearities in the diode laser gain region to be minimized. The result is a large-cross-section <b>single-mode</b> optical beam which is not attainable from in-plane ("edge-emitting") diode lasers.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1970 and 1978, Japan {{operated}} a project called [...] "Computer-controlled Vehicle System" [...] (CVS). In a full-scale test facility, 84 vehicles {{operated a}}t {{speeds up to}} [...] on a [...] guideway; one-second headways were achieved during tests. Another version of CVS was in public operation for six months from 1975–1976. This system had 12 <b>single-mode</b> vehicles and four dual-mode vehicles on a [...] track with five stations. This version carried over 800,000 passengers. CVS was cancelled when Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport declared it unsafe under existing rail safety regulations, specifically in respect of braking and headway distances.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{protracted}} development programme, <b>single-mode</b> or [...] "millimetric" [...] Brimstone entered service with RAF Tornado aircraft in 2005, and the dual-mode variant in 2008. The latter {{has been extensively}} used in Afghanistan and Libya. An improved Brimstone 2 was expected to enter service in October 2012, but problems with the new warhead from TDW and the ROXEL rocket motor put back the planned date to November 2015. MBDA {{is working on the}} targeting of swarms of small boats under the name Sea Spear. The RAF intend to fit Brimstone to their Eurofighter Typhoons, and planned to integrate it with their Harriers until the latter were withdrawn from service in 2011. MBDA is studying the use of Brimstone on ships, attack helicopters, UAVs, and from surface launchers. [...] However, it will not be integrated on the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. The United States, France and India have expressed interest in buying Brimstone for their aircraft, but Saudi Arabia is the only export customer [...] The cost per missile has been quoted as £175,000 ($263,000) each in 2015, or 'over £100,000'.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{multi-mode}} optical fibers, <b>single-mode</b> fibers do exhibit {{modal dispersion}} resulting from multiple spatial modes but with narrower modal dispersion. <b>Single-mode</b> fibers are therefore better at retaining the fidelity of each light pulse over longer distances than multi-mode fibers.

5000|$|The main {{difference}} between multi-mode and <b>single-mode</b> optical fiber {{is that the}} former has much larger core diameter, typically 50-100 micrometers; {{much larger than the}} wavelength of the light carried in it. Because of the large core and also the possibility of large numerical aperture, multi-mode fiber has higher [...] "light-gathering" [...] capacity than <b>single-mode</b> fiber. In practical terms, the larger core size simplifies connections and also allows the use of lower-cost electronics such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) which operate at the 850 nm and 1300 nm wavelength (<b>single-mode</b> fibers used in telecommunications typically operate at 1310 or 1550 nm [...] ). However, compared to <b>single-mode</b> fibers, the multi-mode fiber bandwidth-distance product limit is lower. Because multi-mode fiber has a larger core-size than <b>single-mode</b> fiber, it supports more than one propagation mode; hence it is limited by modal dispersion, while single mode is not.|$|E
