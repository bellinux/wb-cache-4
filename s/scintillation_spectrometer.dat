50|$|Cosmos 428 was {{launched}} by the USSR into Earth orbit on June 24, 1971 and recovered July 6, 1971. The orbit characteristics: apogee/perigee/inclination 208 km, 271 km, and 51.8°, respectively. It was a military satellite on which X-ray astronomy experiments had been added. There was a <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometer</b> sensitive to X-rays >30 keV, with a 2° × 17° field of view. In addition, there was an X-ray telescope which operated in the range 2-30 keV. Cosmos 428 detected several X-ray sources which were correlated to already identified Uhuru point sources.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{investigations}} {{have been performed}} to observe the gamma-ray spectra of the Sun and other astronomical sources, both galactic and extra-galactic. The Gamma-Ray Imaging Spectrometer, the Hard X-ray/Low-Energy Gamma-ray experiment (A-4) on HEAO 1, the Burst and Transient Spectrometry Experiment (BATSE) and the OSSI (Oriented <b>Scintillation</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> Experiment) on CGRO, the C1 germanium (Ge) gamma-ray instrument on HEAO 3, and the Ge gamma-ray spectrometer (SPI) on the ESA INTEGRAL mission are examples of cosmic spectrometers, while the GRS on the SMM and the imaging Ge spectrometer on the RHESSI satellite have been devoted to solar observations.|$|E

The instrumentation includes two low-energy imaging telescopes (LEIT) with Wolter I X-ray optics (for the 0.04-2 keV energy range), a medium-energy experiment using Ar/CO2 and Xe/CO2 detectors (for 1.5-50 keV), a Xe/He gas <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (GSPC) (covering 2-80 keV), and a reprogrammable onboard data-processing computer.

5000|$|The Oriented <b>Scintillation</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> Experiment, (OSSE), by the Naval Research Laboratory {{detected}} {{gamma rays}} entering {{the field of}} view of any of four detector modules, which could be pointed individually, and were effective in the 0.05 to 10 MeV range. Each detector had a central <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometer</b> crystal of NaI(Tl) 12 in (303 mm) in diameter, by 4 in (102 mm) thick, optically coupled at the rear to a 3 in (76.2 mm) thick CsI(Na) crystal of similar diameter, viewed by seven photomultiplier tubes, operated as a phoswich: i.e., particle and gamma-ray events from the rear produced slow-rise time (~1 μs) pulses, which could be electronically distinguished from pure NaI events from the front, which produced faster (~0.25 μs) pulses. Thus the CsI backing crystal acted as an active anticoincidence shield, vetoing events from the rear. A further barrel-shaped CsI shield, also in electronic anticoincidence, surrounded the central detector on the sides and provided coarse collimation, rejecting gamma rays and charged particles from the sides or most of the forward field-of-view (FOV). A finder level of angular collimation was provided by a tungsten slat collimator grid within the outer CsI barrel, which collimated the response to a 3.8° x 11.4° FWHM rectangular FOV. A plastic scintillator across the front of each module vetoed charged particles entering from the front. The four detectors were typically operated in pairs of two. During a gamma-ray source observation, one detector would take observations of the source, while the other would slew slightly off source to measure the background levels. The two detectors would routinely switch roles, allowing for more accurate measurements of both the source and background. The instruments could slew with a speed of approximately 2 degrees per second.|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} instruments consisted of an ion chamber and Geiger-Müller tube to measure total radiation flux, a proportional radiation counter telescope to measure high energy radiation, a scintillation counter to monitor low-energy radiation, a VLF receiver for natural radio waves, a transponder to study electron density, {{and part of}} the flux-gate and search coil magnetometers mounted on the instrument platform. The micrometeorite detector and sun scanner were mounted on the sphere. The difference between the payload of Pioneer P-30 and the earlier Pioneer P-3 was the replacement of the TV facsimile system on P-3 with a <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometer</b> to study the Earth's (and possible lunar) radiation belts, mounted on the instrument platform, and a plasma probe mounted on the sphere to measure energy and momentum distribution of protons above a few kilovolts to study the radiation effect of solar flares. The total mass of the science package including electronics and power supply was roughly 60 kg. Total cost of the mission was estimated at 9-10 million dollars.|$|E

We review {{developments}} in radiocarbon measuring techniques from the Libby counter through proportional gas counters and liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometers</b> {{to the more}} recent developments of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), followed by a coupling of gas chromatography with AMS for compound-specific 14 C analyses.

From single and coincidence spectra with <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometers</b> the gamma-ray branchings of the resonance levels and of nineteen lower levels in 34 Cl were obtained.

50|$|The primary payload, the Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO), was {{deployed}} {{on flight}} day 3. GRO's high-gain antenna failed to deploy on command; {{it was finally}} freed and manually deployed by Ross and Apt during an unscheduled contingency space walk, the first since April 1985. The following day, the two astronauts performed the first scheduled space walk since November 1985 to test means for astronauts to move themselves and equipment about while maintaining the then-planned Space Station Freedom. GRO science instruments were Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL), Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) and Oriented <b>Scintillation</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> Experiment (OSSE). GRO was the second of NASA's four Great Observatories. The Hubble Space Telescope, deployed during Mission STS-31 in April 1990, was the first. GRO was launched on a two-year mission {{to search for the}} high-energy celestial gamma ray emissions, which cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere. At about 35,000 pounds, GRO was the heaviest satellite to be deployed into low-Earth orbit from the Shuttle. It was also designed to be the first satellite that could be refueled in orbit by Shuttle crews. Five months after deployment, NASA renamed the satellite the Arthur Holly Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, or Compton Observatory, after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who did important work in gamma ray astronomy.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989 Clayton {{surprised}} academia {{by accepting}} a professorship at Clemson University {{to develop a}} graduate research program in astrophysics there. This academic segment of his career (1989-present) began by hiring three young astrophysicists [...] to vitalize joint research with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (launched in 1991 after several delays), whose instruments successfully detected gamma-ray lines identifying several of the radioactive nuclei that Clayton had predicted {{to be present in}} supernova remnants. At Rice University Clayton had been named ten years earlier Co-Investigator on the NASA proposal submitted by James Kurfess for the Oriented <b>Scintillation</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> Experiment OSSE, one of the four successful instruments carried into orbit by Space Shuttle Atlantis, and he carried that research contract to Clemson. Simultaneously Clayton developed at Clemson his stardust research, introducing annual workshops for its researchers. The initial NASA sponsored workshop at Clemson University in 1990 was so lively that it was repeated the following year jointly with Washington University (St. Louis) cosponsorship, and in later years cosponsored also by the University of Chicago and by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. These workshops featured the excitement of new isotopic discoveries, but also helped participants focus their ideas for submission of abstracts to NASA's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Otherwise participants' workshop discussions were not shared or publicized. Eventually a unique new goal became to assemble from Clayton's large personal collection of photographs a web-based archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics and to donate the originals [...] to the Center for the History of Physics. The thrusts of Clayton's career at Clemson University are well represented on that Photo Archive by photos between 1990 and 2014. Following his retirement from academic duties in 2007, Clayton remained quite active in research problems involving condensation of dust within supernovae and has also published a scientific autobiography, Catch a Falling Star. Clayton's published refereed research papers prior to 2011 are listed at http://claytonstarcatcher.com/files/documents/JournalPub.pdf ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{which will}} be described is centered around {{the development of a}} beta <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometer</b> capable of quantitative measurements of beta spectra in the energy region from about 2 to about 17 MeV. Part II will deal with the design, operation, and properties of this <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometer</b> and with examples of measured spectra. It will be shown that this device gives results which compare well with data from magnetic analysis. It will also be shown that the distortion effects which are present in measurements using this device are either negligible or small and correctable. Part III deals with a measurement of the beta spectra of N 12 and B 12 which are respectively positron and electron transitions to C 12. The N 12 decay is the most energetic beta decay known, with an end-point energy in excess of 16 MeV, and the B 12 decay is also quite energetic. These spectra were measured with the beta <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> Section IV describes a measurement of the half life and end-point of the mirror transition Sc 41 (beta+) Ca 41 which was performed using the beta <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometer...</b>|$|E

40|$|Every {{radiation}} counting system {{exhibits a}} characteristic pulse resolving time (dead time) that {{is related to}} the time required to individual detected events. In case that a second pulse occures before the first has disappeared the two pulses will form a single distored pulse. Because of dead time losses, the measured counting rate (cps) is less than the true (teoretical) counting rate. Pulse resolving time can considerably change the relationship in case of measuring small and high activities. According to experimental results in my work dead time losses are dependant on the scintillators type, time constant of pulse amplifier and energy of radionuklides. There are given counting rate limits for three radionuklides - 99 mTc, 51 Cr and 131 I and two <b>scintillation</b> <b>spectrometers</b> - JKA 300 and JKA 1102...|$|R
