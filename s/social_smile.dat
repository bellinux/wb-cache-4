40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Infant {{siblings}} {{of children}} diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; High-Risk, HR-infants) {{are at an}} increased risk of developing ASD compared to infant siblings of typically developing children (Low-Risk, LR-infants; Messinger et al., 2013; Ozonoff et al., 2011). Limited <b>social</b> <b>smiling</b> has been identified as an early behavioral risk marker of ASD (e. g. Ozonoff et al., 2010). Recent theories propose that maternal behaviors that promote engagement and reciprocity during parent-child interactions may attenuate ASD symptom development over time for infants at high risk for developing ASD (Dawson, 2008). This study examined maternal and infant behaviors in HR- and LR-infants during free play sessions. Maternal responsiveness and directiveness at 9 months were examined as predictors of growth in infant <b>social</b> <b>smiling</b> between 9 and 18 months. Both maternal responsiveness and directiveness predicted growth in infant <b>social</b> <b>smiling.</b> Higher levels of responsiveness were associated with increased growth in <b>social</b> <b>smiling</b> for HR- and LR-infants. Conversely, higher levels of maternal directiveness were associated with slower growth in infant <b>social</b> <b>smiling</b> for both groups. Mothers of HR-infants displayed higher levels of maternal directiveness, but not responsiveness, relative to mothers of LR-infants. No group differences were found for trajectory of growth in infant <b>social</b> <b>smiling.</b> These findings provide further evidence that early maternal behaviors may {{play an important role in}} the social development of infants at high and low risk for ASD...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} infant smiling behaviour during wake and active sleep. In {{the majority of}} studies authors agreed that two month-old infants exhibit <b>social</b> <b>smiles.</b> However {{it is not clear}} if newborns exhibit different kinds of smiles during wake and active sleep to two month-old infants and if the communicative context can affect {{the quantity and quality of}} these smiles. The aim of this study was to test if different kinds of communication affects the amount and the quality of smiles during different behavioural states. Smiling behaviour was analyzed during interactive wake (IW) and active sleep (AS), in 40 newborns randomly assigned to 4 groups of 10 newborns each: continuous tactile communication group, discontinuous non periodic tactile communication group, discontinuous periodic tactile communication group, absent communication group. In the total sample the open/closed mouth (social/non <b>social)</b> <b>smiles</b> ratio was 38 / 5 during IW and 1 / 28 during AS (p <. 001). Moreover these ratios were different between the four groups. Different kinds of tactile communication affect amount and quality of the smiles of newborns during IW and AS. Moreover the morphological difference of the smiles during IW and AS suggested that for newborns the smiling behaviour during IW could have a social meaning, as it does for two month-old infants.

40|$|Objective: To {{find out}} a few simple and easily elicitable items at three and six months of age that can predict neurodevelopmental outcome at one year in high risk babies. Design: One year {{longitudinal}} follow up study. Setting: Hospital based study including inborn and outborn infants discharged from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of a referral hospital, followed up in a High Risk Clinic. Methods: Sixty high risk babies were followed up longitudinally {{for a period of}} one year. A detailed neurodevelopmental examination was done with special attention to the following items- axillary suspension, head support, <b>social</b> <b>smile,</b> disappearance of primitive reflexes and neurobehavior at three months age while pull to sit, rolling over, sitting momentarily without support, transfer of objects and voluntary reach were evaluated at six months age. Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Baroda Norms) was used for assessing the outcome at one year. Results: Babies with absence of <b>social</b> <b>smile,</b> abnormal neurobehavior at three months and absent pulling to sit position, absent voluntary reach, and absent transfer of objects, remained delayed at one year.

40|$|In {{positive}} social contexts, both adults and older infants show more Duchenne smiling (which involves high cheek raising) than non-Duchenne smiling (which does not). This study compared Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles in early infancy {{for clues to}} their emotional significance. Infants (N = 13) from 1 to 6 months of age were videotaped weekly for 5 min in 208 face-to-face interactions with their mothers. Levels of Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiling were correlated within interactive sessions, and the 2 smiles had similar developmental trajectories. Duchenne smiles were typically preceded by non-Duchenne smiles. The results suggest these frequently contrasted types of smiles occur in similar situations and are often different temporal phases of a continuous emotional process. In contrast to adults, infant Duchenne smiles had longer durations than non-Duchenne smiles, suggesting infant smiling does not fit adult models of emotional functioning. Positive emotion is a central feature of social development. This study is an in-depth examination of the prototypical facial display of positive emotion, the smile. The premise is that information on how <b>social</b> <b>smiles</b> form and develop in early infancy will expand knowledge of the emotional processes that may be involved i...|$|R
30|$|The {{form and}} {{inclination}} of the OP hold individual characteristics and are connected {{not only with}} the function of the stomatognathic system but also with the esthetics of dentofacial appearance. A functional correlation between the inclination of OP and the masticatory closing path has been observed. This is an important determinant in occlusion and one of the contributing factors to masticatory movement [5]. The upper smile arc is the relationship of the curvature of the maxillary incisal and canine edges to the curvature of the lower lip during the <b>social</b> <b>smile,</b> which is influenced by the OP angle. By producing a computerized prediction of the appearance of the smile at differing OP angles, Batwa et al. [6] concluded that changing the OP angle does affect relative smile attractiveness.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Tooth {{display and}} lip {{position}} in smiling and speech are important esthetic aspects in orthodontics and dentofacial surgery. The spontaneous smile and speech are considered valuable diagnostic criteria {{in addition to}} the posed <b>social</b> <b>smile.</b> A method was developed to measure tooth display in both smile types and speech. METHODS: The faces of 20 subjects were individually filmed. Spontaneous smiles were elicited by a comical movie. The dynamics of the spontaneous smile were captured twice with a digital video camera, transferred to a computer, and analyzed on videoframe level. Two raters were involved. Posed social smiles and speech records were also included. Reliability was established by means of the generalizability theory. It incorporated rater, replication, and selection facets. RESULTS: Generalizability coefficients ranged from. 99 for anterior teeth to. 80 for posterior teeth. The main sources of error were associated with rater and selection facets. The replication facet was a minor source of error. CONCLUSIONS: This videographic method is reliable for measurement of tooth display and lip position in spontaneous and posed smiling and speaking. Application of the method is warranted especially when obtaining an emotional smile is difficult, such as cleft lip and palate or disfigured patients...|$|E
40|$|Atypical {{responsivity}} {{to social}} rewards {{has been observed}} in young children with or at risk of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). These observations contributed to the hypothesis of reduced social motivation in ASD. In the current study we develop a novel task to test social reward preference using a tablet computer (iPad), where two differently coloured buttons were associated with a social and a nonsocial rewarding image respectively. 63 young children, aged 14 – 68 months, with and without a diagnosis of ASD {{took part in the}} study. The experimental sessions were also recorded on video, using an in-built webcam on the tablet as well as an external camera. Children with ASD were found to show a reduced relative preference for social rewards, indexed by a lower proportion of touches for the button associated with the social reward image. Greater social preference as measured using the tablet-based task was associated with increased use of social communicative behaviour such as eye contact with the experimenter and <b>social</b> <b>smile</b> in response to the social reward image. These results are consistent with earlier findings from eye-tracking studies, and provide novel empirical insights into atypical social reward responsivity in ASD...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} computer recognition of "Duchenne" vs. non-Duchenne smiles. Duchenne smiles include the contraction of the orbicularis oculi, the sphincter muscles that circle the eyes. Genuine, happy smiles can be differentiated from posed, or <b>social</b> <b>smiles</b> by the contraction of this muscle (Ekman, Friesen, and O'Sullivan, 1988). This is a difficult visual discrimination task. Previously published performance of computer vision systems on this task is in the low 80 %'s for a two-alternative forced choice. Gabor wavelet representations {{have been found to}} be highly e#ective for image recognition, including facial identity recognition (Lades et al., 1993), and facial expression analysis (Bartlett, 2000). Here we {{investigate the}} performance of Gabor wavelet representations in combination with support vector machines (SVM's) on the task of discriminating Duchenne from non-Duchenne smiles. A multiscale Gabor representation defined by Lades et al. (1993) comprised the inputs to support vector machines. The SVMs performed significantly better on this task than previously published systems. We analyze the reasons underlying the success of our approach. Linear SVM kernels did not perform as well as polynomial or Gaussian kernels, suggesting that the classes are not linearly separable, despite the high dimensionality of the Gabor vectors. SVM's on unfiltered difference images did not perform as well as the SVM's on the Gabor filtered images, demonstrating that the Gabor filters did contribute to overall classification performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} used a {{multiple}} baseline across participants design {{to assess whether}} 4 children with autism could learn a generalized repertoire of helping adults with different tasks {{through the use of}} a multicomponent teaching package. Different helping responses were taught in the presence of multiple exemplars of discriminative stimuli drawn from experimenter-defined categories of helping behavior (e. g., locating objects, putting away items, setting up an activity). During the training condition, video models, prompting, and reinforcement were used. The results showed that all 4 children learned to emit appropriate helping responses in the presence of discriminative stimuli from the helping categories used during training. Generalization of helping responses was observed in the presence of untrained discriminative stimuli during additional probe conditions. Additional pre- and postintervention generalization trials showed that the frequency of helping responses also increased in the presence of novel stimuli, in a novel setting, and with a novel instructor.

40|$|In our {{previous}} studies {{we have shown}} that seeing another person “live” with a direct vs. averted gaze results in enhanced skin conductance responses (SCRs) indicating autonomic arousal and in greater relative left-sided frontal activity in the electroencephalography (asymmetry in the alpha-band power), associated with approach motivation. In our studies, however, the stimulus persons had a neutral expression. In real-life social interaction, eye contact {{is often associated with}} a smile, which is another signal of the sender's approach-related motivation. A smile could, therefore, enhance the affective-motivational responses to eye contact. In the present study, we investigated whether the facial expression (neutral vs. <b>social</b> <b>smile)</b> would modulate autonomic arousal and frontal EEG alpha-band asymmetry to seeing a direct vs. an averted gaze in faces presented “live” through a liquid crystal (LC) shutter. The results showed that the SCRs were greater for the direct than the averted gaze and that the effect of gaze direction was more pronounced for a smiling than a neutral face. However, in this study, gaze direction and facial expression did not affect the frontal EEG asymmetry, although, for gaze direction, we found a marginally significant correlation between the degree of an overall bias for asymmetric frontal activity {{and the degree to which}} direct gaze elicited stronger left-sided frontal activity than did averted gaze...|$|E

The social signals of emotion produced by 26 HR 6 -month-olds, 24 LR 6 -month-olds, 24 HR 11 -month-olds, and 33 LR 11 -month-olds were measured in the context of face-to-face interaction with their mothers. Results indicated that increased positive affect at 6 months may characterize HR infants later diagnosed with ASD (HR-ASD infants), while increased looking to mother at 6 months and increased positive affect at 11 months may characterize HR infants with no known diagnosis of ASD (HR-no ASD). Eye-tracking methods were utilized to measure visual attention to smile/neutral face pairings displayed by 31 HR 6 -month-olds, 28 LR 6 -month-olds, 37 HR 11 -month-olds, and 32 LR 11 -month-olds. Results revealed that increased visual attention to the whole stimulus and the internal features of the face at 6 months may characterize HR infants as a whole (i. e., HR-no ASD and HR-ASD). Taken together, these findings suggest that emotion production and perception help define the early phenotype of HR infants. Increased positive affect and looking to affective stimuli observed in the HR sample are discussed as possible indicators of arousal regulation and visual disengagement difficulty. All findings are discussed from the theoretical framework of transactional models of child development and experience-expectant model of emotion development...|$|R
