40|$|It {{is known}} that lpr mice develop {{systemic}} lymphadenopathy and lupus erythematosus-like autoimmune disease {{that are associated with}} the accumulation of CD 4 - CD 8 - (double-negative; DN) CD 3 + B 220 + abnormal T cells as well as normal mature CD 4 + or CD 8 + single-positive (SP) CD 3 + T cells. In order to clarify the role of B cells in the lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity of lpr mice, we created B-cell-deficient C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) lpr mice (B 6 lpr/lpr microMT/microMT) by crossing B 6 lpr/lpr mice with B 6 microMT/microMT mice in which the B-cell development was arrested at pre-B stage owing to a targeted disruption of the immunoglobulin mu heavy-chain gene locus. In the B-cell-deficient B 6 -lpr mice, both lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly were markedly suppressed. Although the accumulation of both CD 3 + B 220 - <b>SP</b> <b>normal</b> T cells and CD 3 + B 220 + DN abnormal T cells was inhibited in the B-cell-deficient lpr mice, the decrease in numbers of CD 3 + B 220 - <b>SP</b> <b>normal</b> T cells occurred more strikingly than that of the CD 3 + B 220 + DN abnormal T cells. Glomerulonephritis did not develop in the B-cell-deficient lpr mice over 40 weeks. The present results indicate that the B cells thus {{play a crucial role in}} the extensive proliferation of normal CD 3 + B 220 - mature SP T cells rather than the accumulation of abnormal DN T cells...|$|R

The WDSL is characterized {{by the fact that the}} Landau-level filling factor of one of the 2 DES (the defective 2 DES) is different from the value of Landau-level filling factor of the other 2 DES's. At the same time, it is assumed that the defective 2 DES can hold an arbitrary position in the WDSL. The dispersion and energy properties of SP in the finite WDSL are investigated for the case when the WDSL is placed in a uniform dielectric medium, and for the case when it is placed on a substrate and has a vacuum(air) boundary. It is shown that under the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) conditions, all characteristics of SP are represented by quantized values.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of bifurcations associated with stability of stationary points (SP's) in a parametrically forced magnetic pendulum and a comparison of its results with numerical results are presented. The critical values for which the SP's lose or gain their stability are experimentally measured by varying the two parameters Ω (the normalized natural frequency) and A (the normalized driving amplitude). It is observed that, when the amplitude A exceeds a critical value, the <b>normal</b> <b>SP</b> with θ= 0 (θ is the angle between the permanent magnet and the magnetic field) becomes unstable either by a period-doubling bifurcation or by a symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation, depending on the values of Ω.

To investigate whether A beta 42 (43) also predominates over A beta 40 in normal aging, we examined by immunocytochemistry the C-termini of A beta in SP in the brains of non-demented aged individuals and compared the results with those in AD. Virtually all SP were A beta 42 (43) -positive; of these 12 % in non-demented aged individuals and 25 % in AD patients (mean of three areas examined) were also A beta 40 -positive.

In the absence of significant heat transfer surface motion, impingement heat transfer expressed as stagnation and average Nusselt number with the present nozzles set either normal or 15 $ <b>sp</b> circ$ from <b>normal,</b> {{is similar to that}} with ASME standard contoured entry nozzles at a nozzle-to-surface spacing of 6 nozzle widths. As this spacing is reduced by one-half, heat transfer becomes much larger for the re-entry channel nozzles, by 100 % for average Nusselt number, by 250 % for stagnation Nusselt number under the conditions tested. For an impingement surface moving at high speed, highest heat transfer is obtained with the nozzle set at inclinations between normal and 15 $ sp circ$ with the jet opposing the impingement surface motion. Use of jets in the aiding flow orientation result in large drops in heat transfer rate, as does the use of opposing jets inclined at angles large than 15 $ <b>sp</b> circ$ from <b>normal.</b> The same large advantage of the re-entry straight channel nozzle over the ASME standard contoured entry nozzle applies for impingement surface moving at high speeds as in the absence of surface motion.

In active rheumatic heart disease (ARHD), IL- 1 activity returned to within normal range at 48 weeks, but IL- 2 activity remained persistently elevated compared with CRHD, SP and healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers. CD 4 + T lymphocytes were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of ARF and ARHD patients. The amount of IL- 2 produced by ARF and ARHD patients correlated with the percentage of helper T lymphocytes (CD 4 + cells) {{but not with the}} percentage of suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD 8 + cells). Moreover, pre- and post-phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from ARF and ARHD patients contained higher proportions of IL- 2 R+ (CD 25 +) cells than those from patients with <b>SP,</b> CRHD and <b>normal</b> individuals, which persisted up to 48 weeks. The percentage of CD 25 + cells in both types of PBMC cultures directly correlated with the percentage of CD 4 + cells and not with CD 8 + cells in active rheumatic patients only. These findings indicate that the immune response in ARF and ARHD patients is skewed to produce activated helper T cells that release IL- 2 which drives the accumulation of more T helper cells.

Simvastatin, {{as one of}} the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for lowering lipids, {{has been}} demonstrated its potential benefit in bone formation, while no study reported whether simvastatin could prevent the bone loss in unloaded bone. Objective: We performed this study to assess the effect of simvastatin on bone mass and bone formation in tail-suspension rat. Methods: Tail-suspension rats were treated with or without simvastatin for 3 weeks, The right femurs were removed for the measurement of bone histomorphometry after bone mineral density(BMD) assessment by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: The total bone mineral density(tBMD) and distal bone mineral density(dBMD) of tail-suspended rats were significantly lower than that of normal rat, while proximal bone mineral density(pBMD) of normal rats was significantly higher than tail-suspended rat, but no statistical difference was observed between normal and simvastatin-treatment rats.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dental pulp has neural fibers {{that produce}} neuropeptides like Substance P (SP) and {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP). The inflammation of dental pulp {{can lead to}} an increase amount of SP and CGRP release, especially in symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Therefore, it can be assumed that neuropeptides have some role in the progression of inflammation of the dental pulp. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relation between the presence and concentration of neuropeptides in dental pulps of carious teeth caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, pulpal tissues were collected from 40 teeth (20 carious and 20 intact). Pulpal samples were cultured for 72 hours. ELISA reader was used for the detection of SP and CGRP in supernatant fluids. Statistical analysis was made by Mann-Whitney U and Chi square tests. RESULTS: SP and CGRP were present in 65 % and 20 % of inflamed pulpal samples, respectively and 40 % and 5 % of normal pulpal samples, respectively. Level of SP was significantly higher in inflamed pulp samples compared to intact pulps; however, there was no statistical difference when the other groups and neuropeptides were compared. The mean concentration of <b>SP</b> in <b>normal</b> pulps was 3. 4 times greater than that of CGRP; interestingly in inflamed pulps the concentration of SP was 22. 3 times greater than CGRP.

However, the π-population, as well as the π-acidity and π-basicity, are related to the π-MOs.

Such an analysis allows a rationalization of the trends observed for the π-electronic structure of these ligands.

At temperatures between 55 and 85 degreesC, waxy starches had higher <b>SP</b> than <b>normal</b> starches. In this temperature range, however, SP and C* {{of the normal}} starches were independent of AAM and FAM. On the contrary, at temperatures between 95 and 125 degreesC, SP and C* of all starches decreased and increased with AAM and FAM contents, respectively. For the <b>normal</b> starches, <b>SP</b> decreased and C* increased with LAM contents at 65 degreesC. For all starches, relative amounts of short amylopectin chains with degrees of polymerisation (DP) 6 - 9 led to increased SP and decreased C* at 55 and 65 degreesC. Opposite results were observed for relative amounts of longer amylopectin chains with DP 12 - 22. AAM and FAM contents decreased with starting gel point temperatures (6, 8 and 10 % dry matter starch) of normal intermediate and high peak gelatinisation temperature starches. Peak and breakdown viscosities (6 % dry matter starch) decreased, whereas setback and final viscosities (10 % dry matter starch) increased with AAM and FAM contents of all investigated starches.

Material and Methods-To investigate possible release of SP in the middle ear mucosa during AOM, we used a well-established rat model of AOM caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Following tissue extraction on Days 1, 3 and 6 post-inoculation, the mucosal concentration of SP was measured using a radioimmunoassay. Results-Compared to sham-inoculated control ears, the concentration of SP was significantly reduced on Day 1 and even further reduced on Day 3, whereas partial replenishment was found on Day 6. Conclusion-SP seems to be depleted in the rat middle ear mucosa in the hyperacute phase of AOM. This depletion is followed by replenishment and the concentration of <b>SP</b> approaches its <b>normal</b> level 6 days post-inoculation. The release of SP may be the trigger of the concurrent bone resorption and may further augment the inflammatory response to the bacterial colonization...|$|R
40|$|Normal DNA of Bacillus subtilis phage SP 15 {{contains}} approximately equimolar {{quantities of}} dTMP and a hypermodified nucleotide, 5 -dihydroxypentyl-dUMP (DHPdUMP). Deoxythymidine (dThd) rescue of phage DNA synthesis in 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) -inhibited cultures {{resulted in the}} synthesis of SP 15 DNA containing enhanced levels of dTMP and correspondingly reduced levels of DHPdUMP. This rescued system was used to probe possible roles of DHPdUMP in phage development. The results suggested that normal levels of DHPdUMP were not required for proper transcription of phage DNA, but normal amounts of DHPdUMP were indispensable for phage assembly and/or DNA maturation. The amount of exogenous dThd required to rescue phage DNA synthesis in FUdR-inhibited cultures was 20 -fold higher than the concentration required to rescue cellular replication, whereas the same low concentrations of dThd sufficed to rescue viral and bacterial DNA syntheses in aminopterin-inhibited cultures. <b>Normal</b> <b>SP</b> 15 DNA was made in rescued, aminopterin-inhibited cultures. We suggest that FUdR (but not aminopterin) partially suppresses biosynthesis of the hypermodified nucleotide {{and that there is}} a barrier to replacement of DHPdUMP by dTMP; therefore, exceptionally large amounts of dThd must be salvaged in FUdR-inhibited cultures to force replacement of the unusual nucleotide by dTMP...|$|R
40|$|Although adult murine B {{cells can}} be stimulated to proliferate by IgM {{receptor}} cross-linking, we {{and others have}} shown that these cells will undergo apoptosis In vitro In a dose-, time- and temperature-dependent manner with polyclonal but not monoclonal antl-lgM. To test the role of c-myc and cell cycle progression in B cell apoptosis, we examined <b>normal,</b> <b>Sp</b> 6 antl-TNP Ig and E^-myc transgenlc splenocytes for receptor-mediated apoptosis In vitro. In normal mice, both spontaneous and antl-lgM-lnduced programmed cell death were specifically blocked by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides for the c-myc proto-oncogene, whereas nonsense myc ollgonucleotides and irrelevant oligonucleotides had only a minor effect. Similarly, TNP-dextran-lnduced apoptosis In Sp € antl-TNP transgenlcs was inhibited by antisense c-myc. This effect was not due to the mitogenlc effects of unmethylated CpG-contalnlng sequences because ones lacking this motif, as well as methylated oligonucleotides containing this motif, prevented apoptosis, and mltogenic doses of llpopolysaccharlde failed to Inhibit antl-lgM-driven cell death. Importantly, antisense c-myc also prevented the antl-lgM-lnduced Increase In myc protein species. Moreover, spontaneous apoptosis In vitro was exaggerated In E^-myc transgenlc B cells. To examine the role of CD 45 i...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{physiological}} mechanisms underlying auditory neuropathy are unclear, {{and there are}} likely to be multiple sites of lesion. A better understanding of the disruption in individual cases may lead to more effective management and device selection. Frequency-specifi c round-window electrocochleography (ECochG) waveforms were used to assess local hair cell, dendritic, and axonal currents generated within the cochlea in 15 subjects with auditory neuropathy (16 ears). These results were compared with electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR) measured after cochlear implantation. The results of this study demonstrate that predominantly two patterns of ECochG waveforms can be identifi ed: (i) a prolonged latency of the hair cell summating potential (SP) waveform with or without residual CAP activity and (ii) a <b>normal</b> latency <b>SP,</b> typically followed by a dendritic potential (DP). We show that seven of eight subjects with a prolonged <b>SP</b> showed a <b>normal</b> EABR waveform, consistent with a presynaptic lesion, whereas six of seven subjects with a <b>normal</b> latency <b>SP</b> showed poor morphology or absent EABR waveforms, consistent with a postsynaptic lesion. We suggest that a presynaptic and postsynaptic type of auditory neuropathy exist, which may have implications for the fi tting of cochlear implants. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{carried out}} a {{comprehensive}} analysis of the chemical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the stellar population (<b>SP)</b> of current <b>normal</b> galaxies and their progenitors in a hierarchical clustering scenario. We compared the results with observations of Damped Lyman-α systems (DLAs) under the hypothesis that, at least, part of the observed DLAs could originate in {{the building blocks of}} today normal galaxies. We used a hydrodynamical cosmological code which includes star formation and chemical enrichment. Galaxy-like objects are identified at z = 0 and then followed back in time. Random line-of-sights (LOSs) are drawn through these structures in order to mimic Damped Lyman α systems. We then analysed the chemical properties of the ISM and SP along the LOSs. We found that the progenitors of current galaxies in the field with mean L < 0. 5 L ∗ and virial circular velocity of 100 − 250 km/sec could be the associated DLA galaxies. For these systems we detected a trend for 〈L/L ∗ 〉 to increase with redshift. We found moderate metallicity evolution for the [Zn/H], [Fe/H] and [Si/H]. However, when we applied the observational filter suggested b...|$|R
40|$|The {{destruction}} of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in autoimmune arteritis is a poorly understood phenomenon. For {{evaluation of the}} cellular interactions that may contribute to vasculitis, the immunobiology of VSMCs and lymphocytes was explored in vitro. Primary VSMC cultures were established, and the interaction of these cells (from normal or autoimmune mice) with lymphocytes was then assessed. Specifically, splenocytes from MRL/lpr or C 3 H mice were cocultivated with MRL/lpr or C 3 H VSMCs. Massive mononuclear cell clusters from normal and autoimmune mice enveloped MRL/lpr VSMCs, which culminated in the detachment of MRL/lpr VSMCs from the culture plate. In contrast, the interaction of <b>SPs</b> from either <b>normal</b> or autoimmune mice did not encompass or destroy normal VSMCs. Further investigation indicated that MRL/lpr, but not C 3 H, VSMCs spontaneously expressed Ia and released Il- 1 like factor(s), which may be at least two mechanisms by which MRL/lpr VSMCs stimulate the in vitro mononuclear cell influx. As {{a result of these}} studies, a novel mechanism for the induction of mononuclear cell autoimmune vasculitis is proposed. VSMCs derived from autoimmune mice may stimulate a mononuclear inflammatory cell phlogistic response which culminates in VSMC autodestruction...|$|R
