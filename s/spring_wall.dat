Padded or <b>spring</b> <b>walls</b> protect people from impact injuries. Despite these precautions, there has been at least one death recorded due to a head-first landing at a trampoline park. In March 2012, New York Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain seriously injured his ankle while jumping at a commercial jump center in Tampa with his son.|$|R

5000|$|Woodward has {{cited the}} {{influence}} of Derek Jarman's garden in Dungeness, for its simplicity, sense of place and limited range of local, often wild, plants, herbs and flowers. [...] He has claimed that Tair-Ffynnon is, in his phrase, a ‘not garden’, because conventional garden features such as lawns, beds, shrubs, even plants, deliberately {{have no place in}} it. ‘Tair-Ffynnon already was a garden - at least to me. It needed no embellishment. Our “garden” would consist merely of the existing idioms of the hill: the <b>spring,</b> <b>walls,</b> gates, wildflower meadows, stone piles, rusting farm implements. The views and clouds could do the rest.’ [...] The garden’s few ‘features’ are site-specific, hill-top ones: an ‘infinity vegetable patch’; clipped box balls ‘rolling’ down through a wild flower meadow; part of the Anglo-Welsh poet Edward Thomas’s ‘The Lofty Sky’ painted onto the wall of a barn facing a take-off point for hang gliders and paragliders. Some commentators have declared the garden ‘non-existent’. In 2011 Tair-Ffynnon featured on ITV's Countrywise (ITV 14 June 2011) and in 2013 the garden was included in the book The Gardens of England: Treasures of the National Gardens Scheme (2013).|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, {{the young}} knyaz Dmitry Donskoy in 1367 began a {{rebuilding}} of the fortress. All winter long from the Mukachyovo village 30 virsts (country miles) from Moscow, limestone was hauled back on sledges, allowing {{the construction of}} the first stone walls to begin the following <b>spring.</b> The <b>walls</b> successfully withstood two sieges during the Lithuanian-Muscovite War (1368-72). Within a few years the city was adorned with beautiful white-stone walls. Whilst it was successfully invaded by the Tatars again in 1382, the massive fortification suffered no damage.|$|R
5000|$|Occupy Ottawa was {{a mostly}} peaceful, leaderless, {{grassroots}} and democratic protest movement that began on Confederation Park in Ottawa, Ontario, on October 15, 2011. The movement's slogan [...] "Home {{of the global}} revolution in Ottawa" [...] refers to its inspiration by, and association with, the Arab <b>Spring,</b> Occupy <b>Wall</b> Street and the global Occupy Movement, which protests growing economic inequality, corporate greed, {{and the influence of}} corporations and lobbyists on electoral politics and government. Occupy Ottawa seeks global economic, social, political and environmental justice.|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of oscillatory flows over compliant surfaces is studied analytically and numerically. The types of compliant surfaces studied are the <b>spring</b> backed <b>wall</b> model, which permits tangential {{motion of the}} surface, and the incompressible viscoelastic gel model. The stability is determined using the Floquet analysis, where amplitude of perturbations at time intervals separated by one time period is examined to determine whether perturbations grow or decay. The oscillatory flows past both the <b>spring</b> backed <b>wall</b> model and the viscoelastic gel model exhibit an instability {{in the limit of}} zero Reynolds number, and the transition amplitude of the oscillatory velocity increases with the frequency of oscillations. The transition amplitude has a minimum at zero wave number for the spring backed plate model, whereas the minimum occurs at finite wavenumber for the viscoelastic gel model. For the spring backed plate model, it is shown that the instability due to steady mean flow and the purely oscillatory instability reinforce each other, and the regions of instability are mapped in the (Λ-A) plane, where Λ is the steady strain rate and A is the oscillatory strain rate. For the viscoelastic gel model, the instability is found to depend strongly on the gel viscosity η_g, and the effect of oscillations on the continuation of viscous modes at intermediate Reynolds number shows a complicated dependence on the oscillation frequency.

40|$|Resonator AS is {{developing}} a hammer drilling system suitable for oil and geothermal drilling. The nature of the device involves high speed linear motion at high frequencies. As a result of this, the gas springs used in their device are subject to high pressures and temperatures. To prevent pressure leakage from the device, seals are installed. The seals used in the device are fit {{for use in a}} limited range of temperatures and pressures. This pose a challenge since a high amount of heat is generated {{as a result of the}} friction between the seal and and the gas <b>spring</b> <b>walls.</b> The main objective of this thesis has been to develop a model to investigate the effects of the frictional heat. Control volume techniques have been used to model the effects on the gas pressure and temperature. A detailed heat transfer formulation comprising convection and conduction has been developed. To model the conduction it was necessary to derive two-dimensional heat transfer equations for cylindrical coordinates. A MATLAB-code has been written in order to simulate the behavior of the system. Test results have been compared with the simulations to validate the model. The comparison showed that the model described the thermal inertia of the system appropriately. It also showed that the present friction model is not able to describe the friction in a satisfactory manner. </p...|$|R

5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can <b>spring</b> off <b>walls</b> by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single <b>wall</b> by <b>springing</b> off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|R
