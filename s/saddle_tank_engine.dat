500|$|The largest ELR {{class was}} a series of outside-frame 2-4-0s with [...] {{cylinders}} and [...] driving wheels. [...] Some may have originated as 2-2-2s, and some were later rebuilt as 2-4-0 tank engines. [...] One was rebuilt as a 2-4-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engine.</b> [...] These were among the last locomotives to be built in Bury. [...] Other manufacturers to supply the ELR were Sharp, Roberts and Company, Stothert, Slaughter and Company, and Beyer, Peacock and Company.

5000|$|... 0-6-0 side <b>tank</b> and <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> {{for light}} duties and shunting. Many of these {{machines}} {{were converted to}} pannier tanks {{in the time of}} Churchward, when Belpaire fireboxes were fitted.|$|R
50|$|Barry Railway Class F were 0-6-0ST steam <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> of the Barry Railway in South Wales. They were {{designed}} by J. H. Hosgood and built {{by a number of}} British companies.|$|R
5000|$|Notes on the Locomotives [...] The {{first two}} {{locomotives}} were outside cylinder 0-4-0 <b>tank</b> <b>engines.</b> They proved {{not to be}} powerful enough for the severe inclines so engines 3 to 10 were 0-6-0 inside cylinder <b>saddle</b> <b>tanks</b> {{from a wide range}} of builders. Some poorly researched historical sources often get this fact wrong and describe the larger <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> as outside cylinder engines.|$|R
50|$|The second {{engine was}} also a Porter-built 0-6-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> (s/n 962), from the former Waterloo Mining Railroad at Calico.|$|E
5000|$|The GS&WR Class L2 [...] Sambo was an 0-4-2 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> {{used by the}} GSR of Ireland. The {{original}} [...] "Sambo" [...] {{model was}} a rebuild of an old Wakefield locomotive but in 1912; Maunsell designed the saddle. The model was sent for scrap in 1962.|$|E
50|$|When {{the line}} was completed, the D&TSL had no {{equipment}} except a small locomotive which had been purchased from the contractor and an old dummy <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> that had formerly run on the New York City elevated. There was some work equipment consisting of Rogers ballast cars but no cabooses or any freight equipment. Only one station had been constructed-at Monroe-but there were few telephone shanties scattered along the road.|$|E
50|$|The {{company began}} trading in 1864 at the Atlas Engine Works, St. George, Bristol, as Fox, Walker and Company, {{building}} four and six-coupled <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> for industrial use. They also built stationary engines and pioneered steam tramcars, the first {{being tested in}} Bristol in 1877.|$|R
5000|$|Much {{of their}} output was exported, mostly 0-6-0, with some 0-4-0, 2-4-0 and 0-4-2. In 1878 they {{produced}} six 1'6" [...] gauge 2-4-2 trench engines for the Royal Engineers at Chatham using Henry Handyside's steep gradient apparatus. They also produced nine 0-6-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> for the Somerset and Dorset Railway.|$|R
50|$|The company {{provided}} {{a number of}} 0-4-0 tender engines for the Furness Railway of which Number 20, built in 1863 has been restored to working order by the Lakeside & Haverthwaite Railway in Cumbria. In 1862, the company began making larger engines, first some 4-6-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> for the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. By 1865 they were building 0-8-0s, again for India.|$|R
50|$|Percy the Small Engine is an 0-4-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> of {{indeterminate}} origins. He {{is painted}} green with red stripes and is No.6 in the North Western Railway fleet. He is a cheeky little engine {{with a strong}} sense of adventure, a high work rate and doesn't let anyone push him around, which sometimes gets him into trouble. He was built sometime around the 1920s or 30s and arrived on Sodor sometime before 1935 during a railway strike.|$|E

50|$|Cornwall's last steam railway {{locomotive}} {{in industrial}} commercial service {{had come to}} Poldark in 1986 from nearby Falmouth Docks along with some other machinery {{as a gift to}} the museum. Built in 1919 as No. 1530 by Peckett and Sons of Bristol for the CWS factory in Irlam beside the Manchester Ship Canal, the 26 ton <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> was moved to Falmouth Docks where it worked to the end of their steam operations. This locomotive was sold in 2013 to the Chasewater Railway in Staffordshire, but it was returned in October 2014.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] 119 Class of the Great Western Railway {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} 11 0-6-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engines.</b> They were numbered 119-21 and 123-30 and had originally been built in 1861 at Swindon Works as tender engines to a design of Daniel Gooch, part of the 79 Class. Their rebirth as <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> was the result of their being renewed at Wolverhampton Works under the aegis of George Armstrong between 1878 and 1883.|$|R
5000|$|... 30 0-6-0s {{built by}} Beyer, Peacock & Co. of Manchester. The first 20, Nos. 322-41, were ordered by Gooch and built in 1864; ten more, Nos. 350-59 {{followed}} in 1866, having been ordered by Armstrong. The latter {{were the last}} 19th-century GWR locomotives to be built by an outside contractor. Like the 79 Class, they were initially used between Pontypool Road and Birkenhead. Between 1878 and 1885 six were rebuilt at Wolverhampton as <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engines.</b> The rest were withdrawn between 1912 and 1934, and quite exceptionally three of the class, Nos. 354, 355 and 388, achieved mileages of over 1,500,000.|$|R
50|$|First {{long-range}} variant {{with higher}} gross weight and fuel capacity, {{with most of}} the added fuel in <b>saddle</b> <b>tanks</b> in enlarged <b>engine</b> nacelles. (Only Pan Am and South African DC-7Bs had the <b>saddle</b> <b>tanks.)</b> 112 built.|$|R
50|$|The largest ELR {{class was}} a series of outside-frame 2-4-0s with 15 x 20 in {{cylinders}} and 5 ft driving wheels. Some may have originated as 2-2-2s, and some were later rebuilt as 2-4-0 tank engines. One was rebuilt as a 2-4-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engine.</b> These were among the last locomotives to be built in Bury. Other manufacturers to supply the ELR were Sharp, Roberts and Company, Stothert, Slaughter and Company, and Beyer, Peacock and Company. The ELR livery for passenger locomotives was dark green with red brown frames, and polished domes and safety valves.|$|E
5000|$|All seven {{locomotives}} {{were present}} {{in and around the}} shed. The three Jung tanks and the two old East Indian Railway (EIR) 0-6-4 tank locomotives were seen in very clean condition and ready to run. The fourth Jung tank engine was stripped down for long-term repair. The only really grubby looking loco of the lot was the Kerr Stuart <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engine.</b> Considering that these locomotives had not turned a wheel since the early 1980s, they were indeed in remarkable condition and everyone around spoken to was optimistic that one day the order will come for them to return to service and they will be ready for it! ...|$|E
5000|$|Quarrying for {{iron ore}} and {{limestone}} {{was carried out}} at Whiston between 1914 and about 1922. The quarry was to the south west of the village adjoining an earlier quarry at Cogenhoe. The quarrying must at first have been done by hand {{with the aid of}} explosives but a steam navvy and a transporter machine was brought in in 1915. The ore was taken away by a steeply graded standard gauge railway leading to sidings at the London & North Western Railway's Northampton to Peterborough line.This was operated by a steam locomotive (a <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> built by Andrew Barclay Sons & Co Ltd.) The gradient was in favour of the loaded trains.|$|E
25|$|Blythe, 0-6-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank,</b> Avonside <b>Engine</b> Company no. 1894 of 1922. Bought new. It {{was based}} at Scar Village and worked goods trains to Pateley Bridge. It was fitted with vacuum braking and an {{electric}} generator, and also worked Saturday passenger trains to Pateley Bridge. Sold 1931 or 1932, {{and worked at}} Southampton New Docks.|$|R
5000|$|Nos. 57-68, 12 0-6-0 freight engines {{designed}} by Gooch built at Swindon in 1855-6. They were typical Gooch engines, resembling his broad gauge Standard Goods, suitably narrowed {{for the standard}} gauge. On delivery {{they had to be}} transported to Wolverhampton on specially constructed broad gauge wagons. Between 1873 and 1890 all were [...] "renewed" [...] at Wolverhampton - that is, built afresh with minimal use of parts from the original engines - and in 1890-91 William Dean added, for some reason, three more to the class, as Nos. 316-8. With a few exceptions the class remained in the Northern Division, and the last was withdrawn in 1927. Nos. 60 and 67 ran between 1876/7 and 1886 as <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engines,</b> having been renewed in that form by George Armstrong.|$|R
5000|$|The C-16 class {{switchers}} {{were the}} last 0-4-0 steam locomotives built for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. They {{were assigned to the}} Baltimore, Maryland [...] "Pratt Street Line" [...] along the Inner Harbor, and to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania waterfront trackage. Initially constructed as <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> <b>engines,</b> nos. 96 and 99 were given tenders in later years. After the <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> was removed in 1926 they were then given the classification of [...] "C-16A" [...] (Nos. 97 and 98 remained unchanged.) The diminutive size and short wheelbase were required to handle the tight curves of these lines. No. 99 was scrapped in 1944. No. 97 was renumbered 897 in 1950 and scrapped in 1951. No. 98 was renumbered 898 in 1950 and also scrapped in 1951. Nicknamed [...] "Little Joe" [...] by railroad workers, they became famous to several generations of model railroad enthusiasts through construction of HO, S & O scale models of the [...] "Dockside" [...] switcher. Arguably one of the best known of all steam locomotive models for half a century, versions of the C-16 have been offered by Varney, Rivarossi, Gem, Life-Like, Pacific Fast Mail, MTH and others.|$|R
50|$|A Class 91 locomotive, 91 124, used to {{bear the}} name The Rev W Awdry. A Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST (<b>saddle</b> <b>tank)</b> <b>engine</b> on the Dean Forest Railway is named Wilbert after him; and {{was used as the}} title {{character}} in Christopher Awdry's Railway Series book Wilbert the Forest Engine. In 2015, he was rendered in CGI for a special cameo in Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure, then later in 2016, he was rendered in CGI again as a cameo in, The Great Race.A pedestrian rail crossing bridge has been dedicated to Awdry in 2017 in the small Hampshire town of Chandlers Ford, which is very close (and has the closest railway line and station) to his birth place of Ampfield.|$|E
5000|$|Edward Slaughter {{joined the}} company in 1841, when it became known as Stothert, Slaughter and Company. By 1844 their works were named [...] "Avonside Ironworks". In 1846 built Avalanche the first of five six-coupled <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> banking <b>engines</b> for the GWR. Another large order came for ten broad gauge {{passenger}} 4-2-2s with 7 ft 6 in drivers and eight goods engines from the Bristol and Exeter Railway for the independent operation of that line from 1 May 1849. In 1851 the company acquired a shipbuilding yard, of which Henry Stothert took charge as a separate undertaking.|$|R
5000|$|No. 5: a [...] {{narrow gauge}} outside frame 0-6-2 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> locomotive. This <b>engine</b> {{is not in}} {{operating}} condition, {{but it is the}} only steam engine owned by the LKPRR with historical ties to Hawaii. It once ran on the Oahu Railway and Land Company until it was donated in 1954 to the Travel Town Museum in Los Angeles. [...] Through an equipment trade with Travel Town, the LKPRR brought No. 5 back to Hawaii, where it remains today awaiting restoration.|$|R
5000|$|... 7058 Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns 0-4-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> {{built in}} 1942. Named OLWEN. Used as Percy for Thomas the <b>Tank</b> <b>Engine</b> Events. Stripped down for boiler work, {{should be back}} in 2016 in GWR colours.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> {{version of}} the wheel {{arrangement}} {{began to appear in}} the United Kingdom in the early 1850s, with the first significant class being six <b>saddle</b> <b>tanks</b> designed by Robert Sinclair for the Caledonian Railway.|$|R
5000|$|The GWR 322 Class <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> {{comprised}} six Great Western Railway outside-framed 0-6-0 steam locomotives, originally {{built by}} Beyer, Peacock and Company as 322 class tender engines, and subsequently rebuilt in 1878-85 as <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> locomotives by George Armstrong at Wolverhampton Works.|$|R
2500|$|While {{a tender}} engine might be {{described}} as an 0-6-0, the matching <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> would be described as an 0-6-0T for a plain tank, an 0-6-0ST for a <b>saddle</b> <b>tank,</b> and so on ('PT' indicating a pannier tank, 'WT' a well tank, and 'CT' a crane tank, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|The railway {{installation}} {{consisted of}} two sidings, forming a passing loop, with temporary trackwork laid beyond that to reach the tipping point. Trains of wooden wagons were delivered to one siding, and each was then lowered {{to the end of}} the tipping track on a cable, emptied, and then hauled back to the other siding by a David Brown tractor. The wooden wagons were replaced by steel ones in 1958, and a dragline mechanical excavator was supplied by Thomas Smith and Sons of Rodley two years later. The tractor was replaced by a diesel hydraulic locomotive in 1962. This had been built as an 0-4-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> steam <b>engine</b> in 1918 by Peckett and Sons of Bristol, but was converted when the Blackburn Meadows works acquired two diesel electric shunters. The work was undertaken by staff at Blackburn Meadows, who removed the water tank and boiler, and fitted a Perkins 4-cylinder engine extracted from a crane which was by then redundant. The result was of unusual appearance, but proved to be efficient and trouble-free. It was returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut up for scrap soon afterwards.|$|R
50|$|Apart from rebuilds and {{renewals}} of engines built elsewhere, {{according to}} Holcroft George Armstrong built relatively few tender engines, {{all of the}} 2-4-0 and 0-6-0 wheel arrangements and dating from his first years in charge at Wolverhampton. After that the Works concentrated almost exclusively on <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> of the 0-6-0 and 0-4-2 types, <b>saddle</b> <b>tanks</b> at first, then side tanks (such as the 517 and 645 classes). They were often turned out at remarkable speed. Many of the 0-6-0 <b>saddle</b> <b>tanks</b> were rebuilt as pannier tanks {{in the time of}} Churchward, at the time they were fitted with Belpaire fireboxes.|$|R
25|$|The early 0-6-0 <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> were {{fitted with}} either <b>saddle</b> <b>tanks</b> (wrapped over the boiler) or side tanks (mounted {{at the side}} of the boiler and {{reaching}} down to the running platform). GWR first fitted pannier tanks (mounted on the side of the boiler but not reaching down to the running platform) in 1898 to nine 4-4-0 tank locomotives and, in 1901, to five 0-6-0T locomotives which were also fitted with Belpaire fireboxes. The shape of the Belpaire firebox gives a larger surface area which improves heat transfer and steam production, but their rectangular shape made them difficult to combine with <b>saddle</b> <b>tanks.</b> Locomotives fitted with pannier tanks have a lower centre of gravity than those with <b>saddle</b> <b>tanks</b> (enabling higher speeds on curves), and access for maintenance is easier than for those fitted with side tanks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives {{that worked}} on the colliery railway system were a narrow gauge engine that worked the tramway to the Bridgewater Canal possibly named [...] "Gordon" [...] and [...] "Tyldesley", a 6-coupled Manning Wardle <b>saddle</b> <b>tank</b> locomotive, bought in 1868 and renamed [...] "Jackson" [...] in 1872. A 2-2-0 tender locomotive [...] "Lady Cornwall" [...] was sold to George Peace in 1774 by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's works at Miles Platting {{at a cost of}} £150 and was later rebuilt as <b>tank</b> <b>engine.</b> In 1875 Manning Wardle supplied [...] "Maden", a 6-coupled <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> and [...] "Astley" [...] another 6-coupled tank locomotive was bought from Sharp Stewart in 1886. The second [...] "Tyldesley", another 6-coupled <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> was bought in 1894 from Peckett with [...] "Jackson" [...] taken in part exchange.|$|R
50|$|The first {{locomotive}} {{built by}} the LYR at Horwich was a 2-4-2 <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> designed by John Aspinall. This locomotive was LYR No. 1008 and is now preserved at the National Railway Museum. By 1899 a further 677 locomotives had been built, and another 220 under Henry Hoy. Between 1891 and 1900, 230 0-6-0 tender engines designed by Barton Wright were rebuilt as 0-6-0ST <b>saddle</b> <b>tanks,</b> LYR Class F16.|$|R
