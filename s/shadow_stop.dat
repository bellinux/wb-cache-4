5000|$|Before mass separation, {{a beam of}} {{positive}} ions has to be extracted from the plasma and focused into the mass-analyzer. It is important to separate the ions from UV photons, energetic neutrals and from any solid particles {{that may have been}} carried into the instrument from the ICP. Traditionally, ICP-MS instruments have used transmitting ion lens arrangements for this purpose. Examples include the Einzel lens, the Barrel lens, Agilent's Omega Lens [...] and Perkin-Elmer's <b>Shadow</b> <b>Stop.</b> Another approach is to use ion guides (quadrupoles, hexapoles, or octopoles) to guide the ions into mass analyzer along a path away from the trajectory of photons or neutral particles. Yet another approach is Varian patented used by Analytik Jena ICP-MS 90 degrees reflecting parabolic [...] "Ion Mirror" [...] optics, which are claimed to provide more efficient ion transport into the mass-analyzer, resulting in better sensitivity and reduced background. Analytik Jena ICP-MS PQMS is the most sensitive instrument on the market.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{variable}} selection method based on model-based gradient boosting and randomly permuted variables. Model-based boosting {{is a tool}} to fit a statistical model while performing variable selection at the same time. A drawback of the fitting lies in the need of multiple model fits on slightly altered data (e. g. cross-validation or bootstrap) to find the optimal number of boosting iterations and prevent overfitting. In our proposed approach, we augment the data set with randomly permuted versions of the true variables, so called <b>shadow</b> variables, and <b>stop</b> the step-wise fitting as soon as such a variable would {{be added to the}} model. This allows variable selection in a single fit of the model without requiring further parameter tuning. We show that our probing approach can compete with state-of-the-art selection methods like stability selection in a high-dimensional classification benchmark and apply it on gene expression data for the estimation of riboflavin production of Bacillus subtilis.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{software}} developed for automated processing of 2 D powder diffraction data-sets as for instance acquired {{with an image}} plate setup. For structural analysis, such 2 D data usually is integrated to 2 θ-scan powder diffraction patterns. Our software is capable to automate such integrations including a geometry correction and automated masking of intensities pixels not resulting from the powder sample (beam <b>stop</b> <b>shadow,</b> single crystal spots etc.). The intensity uncertainty assigned to each 2 θ-bin {{is assumed to be}} given by the uncertainty of a Poissondistributed quantity. The integrated data-sets may be directly output to files readable by the Rietveld packages GSAS or FullProf. Furthermore, our software is capable to produce pole density figures from 2 D data-sets. For quantitative texture analysis with an image plate setup, diffraction patterns of various sample orientations are measured. The, due to texture, inhomogeneous intensity distributions on the Debye-Scherrer rings are corrected for background and absorption and converted to pole density figures...|$|R

Old Redtail circled in the air just overhead, and every time he caught sight of Shadow, he swooped at him with great, cruel claws spread to clutch him. Shadow dodged around the trunk of the tree. He was more angry than frightened, for his sharp eyes had spied a little hollow in a branch of the chestnut-tree, and he knew that once inside of that, he would have nothing to fear. But he was angry clear through to think that he should be cheated out of that dinner he had been so sure of only a few minutes before. So he screeched angrily at old Redtail and then, {{watching}} his chance, scampered out to the hollow and whisked inside, just in the nick of time.|$|R
5000|$|Beckett's mother's case {{is again}} brought up at [...] "Sucker Punch" [...] when Lanie {{contacts}} a specialist, Dr. Murray, after realizing the wound {{similarities between the}} victim and Beckett's mother.

At first she is informed by a corrupt philanthropist Dick Coonan that it is a contract killer named [...] "Rathborne" [...] that killed her mother and the four other victims. They then set up an exchange—Castle actually donating $100,000 of his own money to cover the fee to fake a hit—so Beckett can finally catch the killer but he never shows. After the exchange goes bust she realizes that Coonan himself is the killer—given that he implied awareness of her connection to [...] "Rathborne" [...] without Beckett having made any reference to her mother's death—and as she goes to arrest and confront him, he takes Castle hostage. Castle manages to free himself but Coonan comes charging after him, only to have Beckett shoot him in the chest, killing him instantly. Though she gains some closure for having dealt with the assailant that killed her mother, she still must figure out who ordered her mother's death. In the same episode, Castle states that he will <b>stop</b> <b>shadowing</b> her and feels guilty that Beckett had to kill in order to save his life. However, Beckett tells him to stay, admitting that she has grown accustomed to Castle [...] "pulling on her pigtails"—although she threatens to shoot him if he mentions that to anyone else—that he makes her hard job more fun, and that she wants him to be there when she finally finds whoever ordered her mother's murder.|$|R
5000|$|When the G.I. Joe team is {{reactivated}} in Devil's Due Publishing's G.I. Joe: America's Elite, Storm Shadow {{is added}} to the team due to his expertise as a covert ops specialist and ninja. However, what proves more important to the team, is the knowledge he gained as Cobra Commander's bodyguard. While Snake Eyes and Stalker accept him as a member, fellow team member Shipwreck is the most vocal about his suspicions, considering the ninja's constantly changing loyalties. Storm Shadow is the first to learn of the Baroness being alive and being held {{in the basement of the}} new G.I. Joe command center, [...] "The Rock". After Snake Eyes' death aboard Destro's sub, Storm Shadow assists the team in search of the body, and encounters Major Bludd in Australia. He finds the Red Ninja clan had raised Snake Eyes from the dead, and had used some of their ancient techniques to place Sei-Ten in the body of T'jbang. After stopping Snake Eyes by placing Scarlett's life in danger, Storm Shadow temporarily leaves the team to assist the Red Ninjas in rebuilding and reviving their leader to set things right.

50|$|In a far off school called Fairy Academy, where Tarte {{is giving}} a lecture about the Pretty Cure, a rowdy fairy named Grell and a shy fairy named En-En are called towards a {{forbidden}} tree, where a being taking {{the form of}} Grell's Shadow, who takes interest in hearing that the Cures are simply normal girls if they can't transform and convinces Grell he would be famous if he could obtain their transformation items. Shortly afterwards, the Cures receive invitations to come to Fairy Academy for a party. Meanwhile, Mana, Rikka, Alice and Makoto receive a call from Miyuki and Candy informing them of the party, inviting them to come along as well. Meanwhile, at Fairy Academy, Shadow coerces Grell into capturing the Cures' fairy partners and transformation items, leaving them defenseless against attacking shadow monsters. After most of the Cures are defeated in this manner, Shadow turns his attention towards the Smile PreCures, using a PreCure guidebook to counter their every move and steal their Smile Pacts before imprisoning them in statues like the others. As En-En laments helping Shadow, Miyuki tells him not to worry and asks him to seek out help from the Dokidoki PreCure before being encapsulated herself. With assumedly no more Cures in his way, Shadow reveals his true intentions to destroy the academy and imprison all of its students, much to Grell's shock. Grell and En-En manage to find the DokiDoki PreCures and ask for their help in <b>stopping</b> <b>Shadow.</b> As the Cures fight Shadow's minions, Grell and En-En, assisted by Candy and Pop, manage to find the captured fairies and, {{with help from the}} fairy students who use the Miracle Lights, help return the stolen transformation items to the other Cures, allowing them to transform again and restore light to the fairy world. With support from the fairies, the Cures team up to fight against Shadow. As a last resort, Shadow combines all of his strength to become a giant spider, but he is ultimately defeated by the combined might of the Pretty Cure, reduced to his original size in the process. Realising the error of his ways, Grell befriends his shadow, who returns to his rightful place. As Grell and En-En become determined to become Precure fairies, the Cures help repair the academy before having a proper party.|$|R
500|$|On September 30, {{hoping to}} {{separate}} {{himself from the}} policies of the Johnson administration at the advice of O'Brien who noted that he needed the anti-war vote to win in New York and California, Humphrey delivered a televised speech in Salt Lake City to a nationwide audience, and announced that if he was elected, he would {{put an end to the}} bombing of North Vietnam, and called for a ceasefire. He labeled the new policy [...] "as an acceptable risk for peace." [...] The plan was compared to Nixon's, which the candidate stated would not be revealed until Inauguration Day. After the speech, anti-war protesters <b>stopped</b> <b>shadowing</b> Humphrey's appearances, and a few McCarthy supporters joined the campaign. Donations totaling $300,000 were immediately made to Humphrey, and he also improved in the polls, cutting Nixon's lead to single digits by mid-October. Meanwhile, Nixon tried to shift the emphasis of the campaign to the issue of law and order, and declared that a vote for Humphrey, would amount to [...] "a vote to continue a lackadaisical, do nothing attitude toward the crime crisis in America." [...] While campaigning in San Antonio, Humphrey went on the attack against Nixon. He accused the Republican nominee of playing politics with human rights, and claimed that he was [...] "on the road to defeat." [...] Hoping to gain favor among the Hispanic community, Humphrey alleged that Nixon had never discussed the concerns of Hispanic-Americans during the course of the campaign. Nixon continued to tie Humphrey to Johnson. He argued that the administration was playing politics with the Vietnam War by trying to complete a treaty before the election to favor the Vice President. Humphrey fired back at Nixon's allegations, stating that the former Vice President was using [...] "the old Nixon tactic of unsubstantiated insinuation" [...] and requested that he show evidence for his claims. Humphrey challenged Nixon to a series of presidential debates, but the Republican nominee declined, largely due to his uncomfortable experience at the 1960 presidential debates, and to deny recognition to the populist American Independent Party candidate, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, who would have been included at the event. Both the Humphrey and Nixon campaigns were concerned that Wallace would take a sizable amount of states in the electoral college and force the House of Representatives to decide the election. Although Wallace had focused most of his campaign on the south, he was drawing large crowds during appearances in the north. Both campaigns delegated a large amount of resources to denounce Wallace as a [...] "frustrated segregationist". As election day neared, Wallace fell in the polls, greatly diminishing the chance that he would influence the result.|$|R
