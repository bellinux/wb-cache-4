The clock had originally been erected in 1882 at Flinders Street station, opposite the end of Elizabeth Street, atop a lattice tower about 60 ft high. In 1902 the clock was moved to Princes Bridge station, and in 1910 it was relocated again, to Spencer Street station, where it remained until it was removed {{as part of the}} station's redevelopment in the mid-1960s. The clock mechanism was given to Museum Victoria, but the characteristic turret that housed the clock was sold to a <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>merchant.</b> It was later rescued by private collectors, and the clock was returned to public ownership, being put on display in 1999 at the Scienceworks Museum, Spotswood. The clock was extensively restored before its return to Southern Cross, but the original mechanism remains in the collection of Museum Victoria.|$|E

5000|$|The ongoing {{tension between}} the two {{countries}} over the islands increased on 19 March when a group of Argentine <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>merchants</b> (actually infiltrated by Argentine marines) raised the Argentine flag at South Georgia Island, an act that would later be seen as the first offensive action in the war. The Royal Navy ice patrol vessel [...] was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia in response, subsequently leading to the invasion of South Georgia by Argentine forces on 3 April. The Argentine military junta, suspecting that the UK would reinforce its South Atlantic Forces, ordered the invasion of the Falkland Islands to be brought forward to 2 April.|$|R

50|$|Brotherton died {{suddenly}} {{from a heart}} attack aged 73 in January 1857, while travelling to a meeting in Manchester. He was buried on 14 January in the new Weaste municipal cemetery, Salford, the first interment at the cemetery he campaigned for, following a two and a half mile long funeral procession. A Joseph Brotherton Memorial Fund was established, and a statue of Brotherton was erected in Peel Park in 1858. The statue was dismantled in 1954 and sold into private ownership in 1969. At the time Salford City Council were looking for any additional revenue and it sold the statue to a <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>merchant.</b> He was aware of the rivalry between the two cities so he approached Manchester with the suggestion they might buy it. It was purchased by Manchester City Council in 1986, and was resited at Riverside Walk, overlooking the River Irwell and facing towards Salford. The effect was that he was looking balefully at the city that thought so little of him as to sell his statue. It is currently being relocated onto the Salford bank of the Irwell {{to make way for a}} new footbridge linking Salford to the Spinningfield development.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the third}} novel, Life, the Universe and Everything, {{we find that}} Marvin survived his {{collision}} with the sun of Kakrafoon, and was sent back in time by the Improbability Field projected by the Heart of Gold to be rescued by a <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>merchant</b> on Sqornshellous Zeta. The merchant grafted a steel rod to Marvin's now lost leg, and sold him to a Mind Zoo, where excited onlookers would try to make him happy. This made him something of a celebrity on the planet of Sqornshellous Zeta, and {{he was asked to}} open the brand new bridge that was meant to revitalise the planet's economy. Marvin dutifully plugged himself into the bridge's opening circuit, and, just like the police computer, the bridge committed suicide, taking the entire gathered crowd with it. Marvin was left in the swamp, his false leg having trapped him in the mud, so he spent just over 1.5 million years walking around in a circle, [...] "just to make the point." [...] He planned to keep walking in a circle for another million years before trying it backward. [...] "Just for the variety, you understand." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 19 March 1982, a {{group of}} 50 Argentines posing as <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>merchants</b> landed at Leith Harbour on South Georgia aboard the ARA Bahía Buen Suceso and hoisted the Argentine flag. The British {{government}} responded by sending HMS Endurance with 22 Royal Marines to expel the Argentines, but they were held off to avoid increasing the tension. Further Argentine troops, led by Lieutenant Alfredo Astiz (known as the [...] "blond angel of death") were landed and the British set up a station to monitor the activities there. Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands on 2 April 1982 and took Grytviken the following day, leaving 44 marines. Despite seizing Grytviken and Leith, the Argentines {{were not able to}} take the entire island and several British Antarctic Survey field camps remained {{in the hands of the}} United Kingdom throughout the length of the war.|$|R
5000|$|The work at {{the dump}} was {{organized}} by informal means, as described by Helleiner: [...] "Gaining and keeping a regular position at the dump depended on having close kinship or affinal ties to those already established." [...] Also, <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> collection involved logistical challenges of transporting product, {{and the need for}} capital investments such as vehicles. In spite of the health risks (including cleaning the metal by burning off non-metallic material) and capital investments entailed in this work, Travellers were economically disadvantaged by fluctuations in prices set from <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> <b>merchants.</b> According to Helleiner Travellers were in a vulnerable position in this exchange as the prices for scrap were set by larger forces of demand and supply and bore no relationship to the amount of labour involved. There were few ways for Travellers to alter the terms of trade to their advantage. Most, for instance, had little withholding power as they lacked sufficient space on which to stockpile scrap in anticipation of higher prices ... This particular form of 'self-employment,' then, was dependent upon unequal exchanges over which Travellers had little independent control.|$|R
5000|$|The rag-and-bone trade {{fell into}} decline though; in the 1950s Manchester and Salford had, between them, around sixty rag merchants, but this {{had fallen to}} about twelve by 1978, many having moved into the <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> trade. Local <b>merchants</b> blamed several factors, {{including}} demographic changes, for the decline of their industry. [...] A newspaper report of 1965 estimates that in London, only a [...] "few hundred" [...] rag-and-bone men remained, possibly due to competition from more specialised trades such as corporation dustmen, and pressure from property developers to build on rag merchants' premises. [...] Despite the BBC's popular Steptoe and Son, which helped maintain the rag-and-bone man's status in English folklore, by the 1980s they were mostly gone. Lately, rising <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> prices have prompted their return, although most drive vans, not horses and announce their presence by megaphone, causing {{some members of the}} public to complain about the noise created.|$|R

40|$|The <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> {{industry}} {{is part of}} the broader recycling industry that involves the collection,separation and processing of materials for manufacture into raw materials or new products. The demand for <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> is a derived demand – based on the demand for steel because <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> is an input to steel production. Steel demand in turn is based on demand by construction,manufacturing and other industrial sectors. Hence prices for <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> are a function of prices for steel. <b>Scrap</b> <b>metal</b> is an international commodity market – Australia is essentially a price taker and prices are set in global markets based on demand and supply factors. Prices of <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> in Australia are essentially set by the world price. Estimates of the sensitivity of Australian (or even global) <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> prices to global economic conditions are difficult to find. Nonetheless, one implicit estimate for Australia is that a 1 per cent fall in demand for <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> results in a fall in domestic <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> prices of 0. 46 per cent. Nonetheless estimates of the price sensitivity of <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> to demand and global economic conditions can be highly volatile. Evidence suggests global <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> prices regularly halve and double over the period of 18 - 24 months. ...|$|R
