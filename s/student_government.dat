5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{official}} <b>student</b> <b>government</b> during the first few decades at Georgia Tech, the ANAK society acted as an unofficial <b>student</b> <b>government</b> and proposed an Honor Code, modeled on that of West Point's, in 1908. ANAK worked to set up a more formal organization, the Student Council (later the <b>Student</b> <b>Government</b> Association), in 1922, at which point it relinquished any decision-making privileges it had over the student body.|$|E
5|$|The <b>student</b> <b>government</b> was {{established}} in 1935 and consists of executive, judicial, and legislative branches.

5|$|For the 2010–2011 {{academic}} year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 300registered student organizations. Among {{the groups}} are academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, personal interest organizations, sports clubs, and <b>student</b> <b>government</b> agencies. These clubs and organizations {{run the gamut from}} sailing to Ultimate Frisbee, from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild, from political organizations to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $9million that is then given to <b>student</b> <b>government</b> for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The <b>student</b> <b>government</b> also finances other student life programs, including career fairs, the University Press, OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.|$|E

5000|$|A student {{court is}} a type of {{judicial}} system occasionally seen in <b>student</b> <b>governments.</b> <b>Student</b> courts vary in size and functions, but they are most often engaged in conflict resolution and interpretation of student bylaws and constitutions. Names of student courts vary, with the body variously referred to as the [...] "Student Court," [...] "Judicial Council", the [...] "Judicial Board", the [...] "Supreme Court," [...] or others. Typically, however, <b>student</b> <b>governments</b> only possess legislative and executive branches. Student courts are a less-common feature of <b>student</b> <b>governments.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>Student</b> <b>Government</b> Association {{presides over}} and funds the over 300 student clubs and {{organizations}} and honor societies {{at the university}} and has an operating budget of over $14million. The <b>Student</b> <b>Government</b> Association is split into three branches, with the Executive, a Legislative Student Senate, and Judicial Supreme Court. Due to the unique nature of a multi-campus university, the President of Modesto Maidique Campus (University Park) serves as the Student Representative on the University's Board of Trustees, while the President for the Biscayne Bay Campus serves {{as a member of}} the Foundation Board.|$|E
5|$|The {{student body}} is {{represented}} by the three-branch <b>Student</b> <b>Government.</b> The executive branch consists of seven executives who each have different areas of focus. The legislative branch consists of 23 student senators who represent each academic and residential district. The judicial branch consists of seven justices that deal with judicial matters when necessary. In addition, three standing committees enhance university life for all students: University Programming Council (UPC), Student Organization Funding Agency (SOFA), and Student Communications Funding Committee (SCFC). In addition, five administrative assistants help with all areas of <b>Student</b> <b>Government.</b>|$|E

The Act also states that <b>student</b> <b>governments</b> must be governed by a constitution and an elected student council.|$|R

5|$|Several extracurricular {{activities}} {{are available to}} students, including over 350student organizations overseen by the Office of Student Involvement. The <b>Student</b> <b>Government</b> Association (SGA), Georgia Tech's <b>student</b> <b>government,</b> has separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches for undergraduate and graduate students. One of the SGA's primary duties is the disbursement of funds to student organizations in need of financial assistance. These funds are derived from the Student Activity Fee that all Georgia Tech students must pay, currently $123 per semester. The ANAK Society, a secret society and honor society established at Georgia Tech in 1908, claims responsibility for founding many of Georgia Tech's earliest traditions and oldest student organizations, including the SGA.|$|E

5|$|The University of Central Florida's <b>Student</b> <b>Government</b> Association (SGA) is {{the leading}} {{advocacy}} group for the students who attend the university, representing the university's nearly 60,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.

50|$|Many <b>student</b> <b>governments</b> are {{structured}} similarly to the United States Government, consisting of distinct executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Alternatively, a parliamentary model is followed. These structures often include elements {{which are not}} found in the federal government (e.g. legislative veto, programming branches, initiative, recall, referendum). In some cases, <b>student</b> <b>governments</b> follow a corporate model where offices reflect business roles such as Vice President of Finance, Director, etc.|$|R
50|$|The European student {{movement}} and the United States movement also differ on a local institutional level. In Europe most institutional student organizations {{are referred to as}} student unions which suggests that they are engaged in lobbying for student rights. In America these are referred to as <b>Student</b> <b>Governments</b> or <b>Student</b> Associations and the focus is more on learning the democratic process. The problem is, however, that most <b>student</b> <b>governments</b> only have about 20-25% representation in the Academic Senate or institutional decision making body and far less experience in democratic processes than other institutional representatives. <b>Student</b> <b>governments</b> focus on teaching students how to be leaders and participate in democracy where as unions focus more on determining the student voice and achieving student rights through lobbying.|$|R
