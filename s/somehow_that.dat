In the election of 1860 he sought the elusive middle ground, and was one of the Delaware leaders of the short lived Constitutional Union Party. This party supported the right of each state to decide the slavery question, but argued that <b>somehow</b> <b>that</b> right could be preserved within the Union.|$|E

Ask any middle-aged {{socially}} conscious intellectual {{to list the}} books that influenced his or her youthful thinking, {{and he or she}} will most likely mention The Autobiography of MalcolmX. Some will do more than mention it.

60|$|And <b>somehow,</b> now <b>that</b> he {{had acted}} like this, he was {{surprised}} at himself.|$|R

2500|$|Vyjayanthimala {{commented that}} [...] "his {{death is a}} big loss to the industry. It's my bad luck that I didn't {{have the chance to}} work with him because he came much later.

[...] Manna Dey said: [...] "He was a great actor, truly a superstar, no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done playback for him.

6000|$|... "Oh, I don't, judge, I don't!" [...] Bittridge interposed. [...] "All I {{want is to}} be able to tell my mother--I don't {{care for}} anybody else--that I saw you, and you allowed me to say that I was truly sorry for the pain--if it was pain; or annoyance, anyway--that I had caused you, and to go back to her with the hope of atoning for it {{sometime}} or <b>somehow.</b> <b>That's</b> all." ...|$|R

60|$|Alora frowned, and <b>somehow</b> <b>that</b> frown {{reminded}} Mary Louise of the girl's father.|$|E
60|$|He {{bowed and}} smiled down at her. <b>Somehow</b> <b>that</b> smile changed {{his face a}} little.|$|E
5000|$|De La Soul had {{previously}} appeared on Gorillaz previous albums Demon Days and Plastic Beach on the songs [...] "Feel Good Inc" [...] and [...] "Superfast Jellyfish" [...] respectively, and {{appear on the}} album's fifth track [...] "Momentz".

60|$|To {{my great}} surprise, I {{could make out}} <b>somehow</b> <b>that</b> Lemarchant was meddling with the bottles in the medicine-chest.|$|E
60|$|She {{smiled at}} me a little curiously. All the time I felt <b>somehow</b> <b>that</b> she was taking very careful note of my answers.|$|E
