40|$|Although RNA {{interference}} offers therapeutic {{potential for}} treating skin disorders, delivery hurdles have hampered clinical translation. We have recently demonstrated that high pressure, resulting from intradermal injection of large liquid volumes, facilitated nucleic acid uptake by keratinocytes in mouse skin. Furthermore, similar intradermal injections of small interfering RNA (siRNA; TD 101) into pachyonychia congenita (PC) patient foot lesions resulted in improvement. Unfortunately, the intense pain associated with hypodermic needle administration to PC lesions precludes {{this as a}} viable delivery option for this disorder. To investigate siRNA uptake by keratinocytes, an organotypic epidermal model, in which pre-existing endogenous gene or reporter gene expression can be readily monitored, {{was used to evaluate}} the effectiveness of “self-delivery” siRNA (i. e., siRNA chemically modified to enhance cellular uptake). In this model system, <b>self-delivery</b> siRNA treatment resulted in reduction of pre-existing fluorescent reporter gene expression under conditions in which unmodified controls had little or no effect. Additionally, treatment of PC epidermal equivalents with <b>self-delivery</b> “TD 101 ” siRNA resulted in marked reduction of mutant keratin 6 a mRNA with little or no effect on wild-type expression. These results indicate that chemical modification of siRNA may overcome certain limitations to transdermal delivery (specifically keratinocyte uptake) and may have clinical utility for inhibition of gene expression in the skin...|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of RNA interference (RNAi) {{and the subsequent}} demonstration that synthetic short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules could induce sequence-specific silencing of mRNA expression in human cells has {{opened the door to}} a new class of therapeutics. However, unlike small molecule drugs (< 500 Da) that can diffuse passively across cell membranes, siRNAs are both too large (~ 14, 000 Da) and too charged to enter cells unassisted. Consequently, delivery of siRNA is the major problem for the development of RNAi therapeutics. To address the problem of siRNA delivery, our laboratory developed short interfering ribonucleic neutrals (siRNNs) whose anionic phosphate backbone is synthetically neutralized by bioreversible phosphotriester groups. The first generation of siRNNs utilized t-butyl-s-acyl- 2 -thioethyl (tBu-SATE) phosphotriester groups that proved too hydrophobic for biologic use. To improve siRNNs, we synthesized more hydrophilic hydroxyl-SATE (O-SATE) phosphotriester groups and used them to generate maximally neutral siRNNs for delivery by conjugated cationic peptide transduction domains (PTDs). Unfortunately, despite an overall cationic charge, PTD-siRNN conjugates were incapable of <b>self-delivery</b> in vitro. To solve this problem, we utilized conjugatable Aldehyde-SATE (A-SATE) phosphotriesters to make multivalent PTD-siRNN conjugates. Multivalent PTD-siRNN conjugates were capable of non-cytotoxic <b>self-delivery</b> and the induction of dose-dependent RNAi responses in vitro, a first for siRNNs. To study the function of siRNNs in vivo, we employed N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), a hepatocyte-specific targeting domain. Single dose systemically administered GalNAc-siRNN conjugates induced extended dose-dependent RNAi responses in mice. This work constituted the first instance of in vivo target gene knockdown by siRNNs containing bioreversible neutralizing phosphotriester groups. Finally, we investigated small, double-stranded, left-handed hairpin (LHP) RNAs as alternative RNAi triggers for the application of RNN technology. Taken together, this work describes the development of readily adaptable, monomeric siRNA prodrugs (siRNNs) and opens a new avenue for RNAi therapeutics to treat human disease...|$|E

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to identify mechanisms responsible for observed “self-reinforcement” effects. In Experiment 1, using a studying task, self-reinforcement procedures did not work when they were private (i. e., when others {{are not aware of}} the goals or contingencies), but did work when they were public. <b>Self-delivery</b> of consequences added nothing to the effectiveness of the procedure. The data suggested that public goal setting was the critical element in the procedure's effectiveness. In Experiment 2, an applied extension, goal setting alone was effective in modifying over a long time period studying behaviors of people with significant studying difficulties, but only when the goals were known to others. Overall, the two experiments make more plausible the view that self-reinforcement procedures work by setting a socially available standard against which performance can be evaluated. The procedure itself functions as a discriminative stimulus for stringent or lenient social contingencies. The application of this mechanism to other problems of applied significance is briefly discussed...|$|E

However, insufficient bioenvironmental stability [11] or poor-targeting efficiency seriously limited its further clinical application. Our previous study demonstrated that methotrexate (MTX) anticancer drug itself could also be utilized as a folic acid (FA) receptor-overexpressing cancer cell-specific “targeting ligand,” playing a dual role [12, 13]. Inspired and motivated by the unique advantage of drug self-constructed nanoparticles and potential merits of therapeutic agent with a dual role, one would envisage the possibility of designing a self-targeting and high-drug loading nanomulti-drug to simply achieve the more effectively and specifically cell-targeting effect and cell-killing efficacy against cancer cell. The highly convergent design of self-targeting nanomulti-drug by “self-targeted multi-drug co-delivery and combination cancer therapy” may open a promising new door to nanomedicine.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{development}} of potent siRNAs that effectively target genes responsible for skin disorders, translation to the clinic has been hampered by inefficient delivery through the stratum corneum barrier and into the live cells of the epidermis. Although hypodermic needles {{can be used to}} transport siRNA through the stratum corneum, this approach is limited by pain caused by the injection and the small volume of tissue that can be accessed by each injection. The use of microneedle arrays is a less painful method for siRNA delivery, but restricted payload capacity limits this approach to highly potent molecules. To address these challenges, a commercially available motorized microneedle array skin delivery device was evaluated. This device combines the positive elements of both hypodermic needles and microneedle array technologies with little or no pain to the patient.

Functional studies indicated that miR- 134 controls STAT 5 B which, in turn, controls Hsp 90. miR- 134 delivered by direct transfection into Hs 578 Ts(i) 8 cells (in which it was greatly down-regulated) reduced STAT 5 B, Hsp 90, and Bcl- 2 levels, reduced cellular proliferation, and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Delivery via miR- 134 -enriched EVs also reduced STAT 5 B and Hsp 90, reduced cellular migration and invasion, and enhanced sensitivity to anti-Hsp 90 drugs.

The book deals with research and policy issues stemming from {{the fact that in the}} last ten years European cities have been affected by a structural crisis, not only financial but also a social, environmental and spatial, leading to an economic collapse. The crisis and its consequences due to political, financial and social conflicts contribute to increasing a city's complexity in terms of decrease of public finance, slowdowns in the real estate market, economic stagnation and the reduction of the consolidated welfare policies. In light of this, this book proposes to reframe European urban welfare towards a "framework-rule" perspective. It is based on new rules and responsibilities as a path to change that would enable cities to respond to new circumstances through innovative actions thanks to co-production. The book focuses on the potential of this approach, identifying innovative perspectives for researchers, institutions and practitioners in the field of urban and regional planning.

40|$|The {{development}} of siRNA-based gene silencing therapies has significant potential for effectively treating debilitating genetic, hyper-proliferative or malignant skin conditions caused by aberrant gene expression. To be efficacious and widely accepted by physicians and patients, therapeutic siRNAs must access the viable skin layers {{in a stable}} and functional form, preferably without painful administration. In this study we explore the use of minimally-invasive steel microneedle devices to effectively deliver siRNA into skin. A simple, yet precise microneedle coating method permitted reproducible loading of siRNA onto individual microneedles. Following recovery from the microneedle surface, lamin A/C siRNA retained full activity, as demonstrated by significant reduction in lamin A/C mRNA levels and reduced lamin A/C protein in HaCaT keratinocyte cells. However, lamin A/C siRNA pre-complexed with a commercial lipid-based transfection reagent (siRNA lipoplex) was less functional following microneedle coating. As Accell-modified "self-delivery" siRNA targeted against CD 44 also retained functionality after microneedle coating, this form of siRNA was used in subsequent in vivo studies, where gene silencing was determined in a transgenic reporter mouse skin model. <b>Self-delivery</b> siRNA targeting the reporter (luciferase/GFP) gene was coated onto microneedles and delivered to mouse footpad. Quantification of reporter mRNA and intravital imaging of reporter expression in the outer skin layers confirmed functional in vivo gene silencing following microneedle delivery of siRNA.

Microneedles are able to penetrate the stratum corneum skin barrier in a minimally invasive manner to allow targeted delivery of therapeutic macromocules. To date, there are limited studies reporting the delivery of nucleic acids, particularly siRNA, to the skin using microneedle devices. A range of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo skin models was developed to characterise nucleic acid delivery and functional response. In vitro studies conducted in both continuous and primary keratinocyte cultures provided proof-of-concept of efficient and non-toxic cell uptake and gene silencing with siRNA and moderately efficient gene expression with pDNA. In initial studies, pDNA and siRNA was pre-complexed with lipid-based transfection reagents, however, {{in the case of}} siRNA, coating of the lipoplexes onto microneedles resulted in a reduction in functionality. Hence, modified <b>self-delivery</b> (sd) siRNA formulations were used in subsequent microneedle delivery experiments. Stainless steel microneedles coated with reporter pDNA or sd-siRNA were successful in penetrating the stratum corneum barrier of ex vivo viable human breast skin. It was difficult to demonstrate equivocally both plasmid gene expression and functional gene silencing in the skin explants, which only remain viable for short periods.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the field}} of {{occupational}} therapy, the assistive equipment provision process (AEPP) is a prominent preventive strategy used to promote independent living and to identify and alleviate fall risk factors via the provision of assistive equipment within the home environment. Current practice {{involves the use of}} paper-based forms that include 2 D measurement guidance diagrams that aim to communicate the precise points and dimensions that must be measured in order to make AEPP assessments. There are, however, issues such as "poor fit" of equipment due to inaccurate measurements taken and recorded, resulting in more than 50 % of equipment installed within the home being abandoned by patients. This paper presents a novel 3 D measurement aid prototype (3 D-MAP) that provides enhanced measurement and assessment guidance to patients via the use of 3 D visualization technologies. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the perceptions of older adults with regard to the barriers and opportunities of using the 3 D-MAP application as a tool that enables patient <b>self-delivery</b> of the AEPP. METHODS: Thirty-three community-dwelling older adults participated in interactive sessions with a bespoke 3 D-MAP application utilizing the retrospective think-aloud protocol and semistructured focus group discussions. The system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire was used to evaluate the application's usability. Thematic template analysis was carried out on the SUS item discussions, think-aloud, and semistructured focus group data. RESULTS: The quantitative SUS results revealed that the application may be described as having "marginal-high" and "good" levels of usability, along with strong agreement with items relating to the usability (P=. 004) and learnability (P<. 001) of the application. Four high-level themes emerged from think-aloud and focus groups discussions: (1) perceived usefulness (PU), (2) perceived ease of use (PEOU), (3) application use (AU) and (4) self-assessment (SA). The application was seen as a useful tool to enhance visualization of measurement guidance and also to promote independent living, ownership of care, and potentially reduce waiting times. Several design and functionality recommendations emerged from the study, such as a need to manipulate the view and position of the 3 D furniture models, and a need for clearer visual prompts and alternative keyboard interface for measurement entry. CONCLUSIONS: Participants perceived the 3 D-MAP application as a useful tool that has the potential to make significant improvements to the AEPP, not only in terms of accuracy of measurement, but also by potentially enabling older adult patients to carry out the data collection element of the AEPP themselves. Further research is needed to further adapt the 3 D-MAP application in line with the study outcomes and to establish its clinical utility with regards to effectiveness, efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of measurements that are recorded using the application and to compare it with 2 D measurement guidance leaflets...|$|E
40|$|This study {{applies the}} RFID and {{information}} transmission equipment for establishing {{a set of}} goods supply and assortment system, together with introducing the existing purchase, sales and inventory system in the auction market.

The system will send the purchase data to the designated flower auction market via internet and, at the same time, the Original Supply System will print out RFID Tags, which contain the flower purchase data, via the RFID barcode printer. The operating personnel will then stick the RFID Tags (the tags' surface contains Code 128 barcode) to the holding plate and the truck will deliver the flowers to the auction market. After off-loading, the assorting personnel in the auction market will retrieve the data in the RFID Tags via a palm RFID Reader with non-touch sensor. The data is then transmitted into the “Server of market-end assortment system” via the wireless access point (AP) and compared with the flower purchase data uploaded by the original supplier. Through this system, accuracy of the supplier's flower delivery can be effectively ascertained; such method can speed up the purchase and assortment operation in the flower auction market, as well as improve the accuracy of supply data. This will effectively increase the economic benefits of the flower auction market, and improve problems such as delayed operation rising from long collection time and late delivery of suppliers of the auction market. 本研究應用RFID與資訊傳輸設備建立一套供貨、理貨系統，並導入拍賣市場既有的進、銷、存系統。供應人將盆花送至集貨站（亦可自行運送至花卉拍賣市場），並同時做好理貨工作，將進貨明細表資料交由作業人員輸入『產地供貨系統』中，此系統將進貨資料藉由網際網路傳送至指定花卉拍賣市場，同時間產地供貨系統透過RFID標籤編碼/列印機輸出具有花卉進貨資料之RFID Tag，作業人員並將此標籤（標籤表面含印製Code 128 條碼）黏貼至端盤，再由貨車將花卉運送至拍賣市場；在卸貨後，市場理貨人員透過掌上型資料收集器（RFID Reader），以非接觸式感應RFID Tag內資訊，並藉由無線基地台（AP）傳輸至『市場端理貨系統伺服器』內，與由產地上傳之花卉進貨資料進行比對，藉此能有效獲知供應人是否有誤送進貨花卉之情況，此種方式，可加速花卉拍賣市場進貨、理貨作業速度及提高供貨資料正確性。透過此系統之建置，可大幅縮減拍賣市場的進貨、理貨作業時間、減少作業錯誤以及加速作業流程；將有效提高花卉拍賣市場之經濟效益、改善拍賣市場集貨作業時間冗長與供應人遲到貨車所造成理貨作業延誤等問題。摘要I AbstractII 目錄III 圖目錄VIII 表目錄XIV 第一章 緒論 1 1. 1 研究背景 1 1. 2 研究動機 2 1. 3 研究目的 3 第二章 文獻探討 7 2. 1 台灣花卉產業之簡介 7 2. 1. 1 台灣盆花之生產分佈與產值 7 2. 1. 2 花卉供應鏈與花卉拍賣市場的關係 10 2. 1. 3 台灣花卉批發市場作業流程之介紹 13 2. 2 網際網路之概述 23 2. 2. 1 網際網路起源歷史 23 2. 2. 2 網路通訊協定 24 2. 2. 2. 1 開放系統互連 24 2. 2. 2. 2 OSI Model與TCP/IP規約的關係 26 2. 2. 2. 3 TCP/IP通訊協定 27 2. 2. 2. 4 NetBEUI協定 29 2. 2. 2. 5 IPX/SPX協定 29 2. 2. 3 Socket介紹 29 2. 2. 4 IP概述 30 2. 3 無線網路之介紹 33 2. 3. 1 無線網路概述 33 2. 3. 2 IEEE 802. 11 b無線網路簡介 35 2. 3. 3 IEEE 802. 11 無線網路架構 36 2. 4 條碼之概述 39 2. 4. 1 條碼歷史背景 39 2. 4. 2 條碼識別原理 39 2. 4. 3 一維條碼 41 2. 4. 4 二維條碼 51 2. 5 RFID的介紹 55 2. 5. 1 解釋RFID 55 2. 5. 2 RFID系統架構 56 2. 5. 3 RFID系統應用實例 62 2. 5. 4 RFID系統與個人數位助理(PDA) 之整合應用 63 2. 5. 5 條碼與RFID之比較 64 第三章 系統相關技術簡介 66 3. 1 系統相關技術 66 3. 1. 1 串列通訊 66 3. 1. 2 Web Services技術 69 3. 1. 3 資料庫 69 3. 1. 3. 1 資料庫存取方式 70 3. 1. 3. 2 MySQL資料庫 72 3. 2 設備通訊介面 72 3. 2. 1 字元集 72 3. 2. 2 RS 232 通訊參數 73 3. 3 無線掌上型資料收集器之程式作業架構 74 3. 3. 1 Client端 74 3. 3. 2 Server端 76 3. 4 Socket通訊程式建立 77 3. 4. 1 伺服器端程式 77 3. 4. 2 用戶端程式 78 第四章 實驗設備、方法與系統操作說明 79 4. 1 實驗設備 79 4. 1. 1 硬體部分 79 4. 1. 2 軟體部分 83 4. 2 研究流程 86 4. 3 實驗方法 89 4. 3. 1 產地供貨系統 89 4. 3. 2 市場端理貨系統 90 4. 3. 3 整體系統作業說明 92 4. 3. 4 具RFID Tag之條碼標籤欄位說明 96 4. 3. 5 資訊安全建置內容及方法 98 4. 3. 6 市場端導入RFID前後理貨作業所需時間及成本 99 4. 3. 7 身分辨識 100 4. 4 系統操作說明 100 4. 4. 1 產地供應系統操作說明 101 4. 4. 2 花市端理貨系統之使用及安裝說明 109 第五章 結果與討論 115 5. 1 產地端供貨系統 115 5. 2 花市端理貨系統 119 5. 3 RFID系統導入花市端進、銷、存系統之效益 125 5. 4 RFID系統導入花市端後之成本計算 130 5. 5 RFID 掌上型資料收集器之身分辨識性能測試 133 第六章 結論與建議 135 6. 1 結論 135 6. 2 建議 137 參考文獻 139 附錄A：EAN國際條碼會員國 145 附錄B：宜蘭忠順花卉園藝現行使用之花卉代碼 146 附錄C：台灣盆花品名代碼 147 附錄D：專業與非專業理貨員之人工登錄 80 筆資料準確性紀錄 155 附錄E： 2007 年高雄花市之進貨量、交易量、交易金額 15...|$|E
