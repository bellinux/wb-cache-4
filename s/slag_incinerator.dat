40|$|Mineral {{carbonation}} is {{a permanent}} and safe way for the sequestration of anthropogenic CO 2. Carbonation reactions of metal oxides- and hydroxides-bearing alkaline solid waste occur spontaneously at atmospheric temperature and pressure, but proceed slowly to obtain an industrial viable process. In order to enhance mineral carbonation it is necessary a careful selection of the process routes and the process conditions and to use pre-treatments that increase the material reactivity. Mechanical activation is a pre-treatment method that increases mineral dissolution rates due to particle size reduction, specific surface increase and structural disorder production. Many experiments were conducted by increasing the grinding time and the carbonation time of the selected materials (steelmaking <b>slag,</b> <b>incinerator</b> ashes and track ballast) to evaluate how increasing grinding time influences the carbonation rate. The two key factors for {{the selection of the}} materials for the laboratory tests were the presence of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals and the time of mechanical activation. A jaw crusher and a continuous ring mill were used to reduce the samples size and / or to obtain homogeneous samples, while a disc mill and a vario-planetary mill were used for mechanical activation. The chemical composition of the samples was determined with X-ray fluorescence, a simultaneous DSC / TGA analyzer was utilized to define the carbonate content, the CO 2 uptake and the calcium conversion efficiency and X-ray diffraction was used to determine the mineralogical composition of the materials and the changes in the crystal structure after the experiments. X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analyses of mechanically activated alkaline residues show respectively that with increasing the grinding time the crystallinity of the materials decreases and the carbonate content, the CO 2 uptake and the calcium conversion efficiency generally increase...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to study the effect of kaolin {{addition}} on the performance of Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM) made using industrial hazardous waste <b>incinerator</b> bottom <b>slag.</b> Various mix formulatiuons of CLSM were made with the <b>incinerator</b> bottom <b>slag,</b> kaolin, and cement. Amount of cement added varied from 0 to 40 percent of weight of slag. Amount of kaolin added were 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of weight of cement. Water content was adjusted to get sufficient flowability. The CLSM mixes prepared were tested for setting time, bleeding, and corrosivity in fresh state. Tests like compressive strength, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), Initial Surface Absorption (ISAT), settlement, and water absorption, were conducted on the hardened CLSM. Compressive strength tests were conducted at 7, 14, and 28 days on 70. 7 mm cubes. Heavy metals analysis for bleed and leachate water was also conducted on the CLSM mixes. The 28 days compressive strength of CLSM tested ranged from 0. 36 to 4. 40 MPa. CBR values ranged from 10 to 46, and ISAT values at 1 hour from 0. 56 to 4. 76 mL/m 2 /s. None of the twelve heavy metals tested exceeded the threshold limits. It is concluded that the kaolin addition in CLSM using <b>incinerator</b> <b>slag</b> showed reduction in the compressive strength, but improved performance with regard to ISAT, CBR, and water absorption. It is concluded that the <b>incinerator</b> <b>slag</b> can be developed as a new sustainable construction material in CLSM...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe joint {{research}} project "Environmental implications of useful applications of {{primary and secondary}} materials to be used on or in the ground", {{was carried out by}} four institutes i. e. RIVM, ECN, TNO and INTRON. In this research project an estimation had been made of the environmental implications when primary materials (natural materials) are replaced by secondary materials (waste materials) in road constructions and building materials. For this estimation the standard leaching test was used. The standard leaching test is applicable to materials with particles smaller than 3 mm. Therefore, some materials have to be reduced by crushing and grinding. This report concerns the determination of the size distribution of the raw materials and materials after grinding by dry sieving and wet sieving. On the basis {{of the results of the}} test sieving an estimation of the surface area's was made. In general, it was found that the particles smaller than 20 mum contributes more than 90 % to the total surface area and less than 10 % to the mass weight of the materials. Grinding hardly affects the percentage of mass weight of the fractions > 20 mum and < 20 mum. A relatively small increase of the fraction < 20 mum results in a considerable increase of the total surface area. The surface area of waste <b>incinerator</b> <b>slag</b> had been measured by the BET-method too. It was found that it wasn't expedient to determine accurately the surface area of particles larger than 1 mm. Moreover, the relation between the particle size of the material and the leaching behaviour of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, and Zn had been investigated by the column-tests on waste <b>incinerator</b> <b>slag,</b> which had been grinded to different particle sizes. No significant relationship was found between the leaching behaviour and the particle size...|$|R

Moreover, the experimentally observed devitrification and {{the identification of the}} crystalline phases formed were compared with the indications derived from Ginsberg, Raschin-Tschetveritkov, and Lebedeva diagrams used for petrological glass-ceramics. All the glasses showed a good crystallization tendency with the formation of dendritic pyroxene and acicular wollastonite together with feldspar and iron spinels starting from the surface. The activation energy values for crystallization ranging from 472 to 832 kJ. mol(- 1) were found to be close to those typical for aluminosilicate glasses; moreover, the possibility to vitrify and devitrify up to 100 wt% of slag and up to 40 - 50 wt% of ash mixed with glass cullet and dolomite makes the vitrification treatment a suitable disposal procedure...|$|R
40|$|The supply {{risk for}} some {{critical}} rare-earth elements (REEs), which are instrumental in many cleantech applications, has sparked {{the development of}} innovative recycling schemes for End-of-Life fluorescent lamps, permanent magnets and nickel metal hydride batteries. These waste fractions represent relatively small volumes, albeit with relatively high rare-earth contents. Rare earths are also present in lower concentrations in a multitude of industrial process residues, such as phosphogypsum, bauxite residue (red mud), mine tailings, metallurgical <b>slags,</b> coal ash, <b>incinerator</b> ash and waste water streams. This review discusses the possibilities to recover rare earths from these “secondary resources”, which have in common that they contain only low concentrations of rare-earth elements, but are available in very large volumes and could provide significant amounts of rare earths. The success rate is set to increase if the rare-earth recovery from these industrial waste streams {{is part of a}} comprehensive, zero-waste, “product-centric” valorisation scheme, in which applications are found for the residual fractions that are obtained after removal of not only the rare earths but also other valuable (base) metals. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|During recent years, special {{attention}} has been devoted both to solving pollution problems during the manufacturing of ceramics and to learning how ceramics can themselves be a solution. Waste encapsulation opportunities for structural clay products have been studied. These opportunities affect environmental isolation within the semivitreous matrix of the product and remove and destroy volatile organic components of the waste and recrystallized <b>incinerator</b> <b>slags</b> and encapsulant for such heavy metals as lead. To reduce hazards to workers and community and to realize a safe environment, some manufacturers have planned for a production process that recycles wastes. This plan represents the best option to reduce or minimize pollution by permitting the complete elimination of wastes and thus avoiding their very expensive storage in appropriate dumps. Studies have been performed to evaluate {{the effects of the}} presence of exhausted lime and sludges in tile bodies and to obtain information for the rationalization of the recycling process. The focus has been on the evaluation {{of the effects of the}} presence of wastes on the rheological and thermal behavior of the tile bodies.

40|$|The melt-solidification {{treatment}} of the residue from municipal solid waste incinerators {{is expected to be}} the resource recycling method that resolves the landfill issue by utilizing the products, such as slag, metal and fly ash as new materials and resources. In this study, the fusing temperature, fusing time and slag treatment method were set as the experimental parameters, and dissolution assay of the <b>incinerator</b> <b>slag,</b> as well as the strength test of the mortar with pulverized aggregate, the autoclave test and freezing and thawing test on the interlocking concrete block were carried out. As a result, elution of SiO 2 ，Al 2 O 3 ，CaO has been confirmed as main elements from the residue, and small amount of Na 2 O，K 2 O，Cl，Pb，Zn, etc. has also been detected. The more concentrated form of these elements was found in the fly ash. When the residue is fused at higher than 1450 degrees centigrade, the content rate of Al in the slag becomes less than 0. 0 wt% and the slag is possible to be used as the alternate material for sand to mix in the mortar. It has become clear that bending strength and freeze-thaw of interlocking block that contains slag stay within the normal range, if the ratio of slag substituted for sand is around 10 %...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Increased {{concentrations}} of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-furans (PCDFs) in pooled blood samples from workers at municipal waste incinerators have been reported. This study was undertaken to confirm these results in individual blood samples from potentially exposed and unexposed workers at municipal waste incinerators compared with matched unexposed controls and compared with {{concentrations in the}} slag and fly ash from the municipal waste incinerators. METHODS [...] Concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs were determined {{in the blood of}} 10 workers from an old municipal waste incinerator without adequate pollution controls, 11 workers from a newer incinerator with modern pollution controls, and 25 controls from the general population group matched for age (+/- 10 years), sex, and race, and in the slag and fly ash from the older incinerator. RESULTS [...] Significant increases of certain PCDDs and PCDFs were found in the blood of the workers from the older incinerator compared with the controls as follows: octaCDD (1051 (438) v 637 (344), P < 0. 001), hexaCDF (52. 3 (28. 7) v 30. 2 (18. 2), P < 0. 01), heptaCDF (43. 9 (30. 4) v 22. 7 (12. 4), P < 0. 001), total PCDDs (1262 (484) v 825 (454), P < 0. 001), total PCDFs (133. 0 (68. 1) v 93. 7 (36. 7), P < 0. 05), and total PCDD/Fs (1395 (537) v 918 (437), P < 0. 001). The workers from the older incinerator with the greatest exposure were found to have the most significant increases of the blood PCDDs and PCDFs, and the pattern of increased PCDD and PCDF congeners in the blood corresponded to the pattern in the <b>incinerator</b> <b>slag</b> and ash. No {{significant differences were found between}} the blood {{concentrations of}} the workers at the newer incinerator and the controls. CONCLUSION [...] Occupational exposure to slag and fly ash from municipal waste incinerators may increase the blood concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs. Modern pollution control technology in new incinerators may be able to minimise potential exposure to slag and fly ash and thus the absorption of PCDDs and PCDFs from this source...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the recent}} decades, {{there has been}} {{widespread}} concern regarding the toxic impact of mercury (Hg) in the ecosystem due to its mobility, volatility and potential for bioaccumulation. Hg in fish and the aquatic environment {{is also a great}} problem in the Nordic region of the EU 1 (European Union). Hg is classified as a dangerous chemical in the countries of the EU. Hg in the regulation of waste is regarded as a dangerous substance which, when contained in waste, is one of the properties, leading to a classification of waste as hazardous. Estimation of the quantity of Hg in waste within the EU countries is an important task although still incomplete. In this present study, Hg in waste in the EU has been estimated at around 990 metric tonnes (t) (including coal combustion products, landfills, chlor-alkali waste and <b>incinerator</b> <b>slag)</b> for the year 1995, and it is suggested that if complete information was available for the 15 member states, the amount would be 2 – 4 times larger. During the 1990 s there were 45 Hg cell chlorine facilities in the EU and the amount of Hg in chlorine (Cl 2) was calculated at 95. 2 t based on 14 – 17 gHg t− 1 of Cl 2 capacity. The waste from coal-fired power plants in the EU member states contained about 16. 5 t of Hg, which was transferred to products for road construction, and other industrial uses or stored in landfills. This Hg can then be exchanged between the atmospheric, aquatic and terrestrial compartments. Hg is occasionally recovered from waste, but this is often discouraged for economic reasons. Recovery units are found, for example, in Germany, France, Austria, and Sweden. The total amount of secondary Hg recovered from waste is not known. Metallic Hg and Hg-bearing waste are exported and imported from the EU member states, except for export from Sweden, which is banned by national legislation. The use of Hg in lamps and batteries is declining, and the Nordic countries, Germany and Austria have stringent regulations on the use of amalgam and Hg thermometers. It is found that 18 % of municipal solid waste generated in the EU is burnt in incinerators, in order to decrease the volume. 88 t of Hg enter into the landfills of the EU through waste and residues from waste incineration. Prevention of the generation of hazardous waste containing Hg {{is one of the most}} challenging tasks for the EU, with regard to sustainable waste management. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Pollution control {{represents}} one of the main problems of public interest in all industrialised countries. Since the 1970 s, when the engineering of waste containment began, the overall objective of Environmental Geotechnics was to limit contaminant discharge to groundwater and subsoil. Since the 1990 s design engineers and environmental agencies have shown a growing interest in the use of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) as an alternative to compacted clays in cover systems or in bottom lining of waste containment facilities because they have very low hydraulic conductivity to water and relatively low cost. GCLs contain a thin layer of sodium bentonite with a dry thickness between 5 and 10 mm, sandwiched between two geotextiles or glued to a geomembrane, GM. The excellent hydraulic performances of GCLs have to be attributed to bentonite characteristics and, since these last are greatly influenced by the chemical composition of the environment surrounding the barrier and by the state parameters, the performances of GCLs can be altered, and then worsened, by a simple variation of the chemical or physical boundary conditions. Aimed at solving this last issue, clay liners and GCLs have undergone great change during the last two decades, with new material being introduced (i. e. polymers) and new design methods being adopted (i. e. membrane behaviour investigation, contaminant diffusion estimation). The research project developed during the Ph. D. has been focused on bentonite barriers. The term "bentonite barriers" includes bentonite or bentonite-based barriers which find application both in urban waste landfill, hazardous or radioactive wastes final disposal and in hydrocarbon containment. The developed theoretical and experimental study has had the aim of evaluating the possible improvement of containment performance of the bentonite barriers, towards standard and non standard liquids, acting on their state parameters, chemical composition, and boundary conditions at installation. The contents of the thesis are reported below: Chapter 1 - Bentonite barriers. This chapter is an introduction to the topic of the research activity: the improvement of contaminant containment performances of the bentonite barrier. Chapter 1 gives a phenomenological and physical description of the mineralogical, chemical and physical properties of sodium and calcium bentonite. Moreover, the main features and issues concerning Geosynthetic Clay Liners, and bentonite barriers in general, are introduced. Chapter 2 - Containment performances of natural and polymer-modified bentonite barriers subjected to physical pre-treatments. The role of physical pre-treatments, such as pre-hydration, pre-consolidation and salt removal, applied to sodium and polymer modified bentonites, has been analyzed in the Paper reported in chapter 2, titled: "THE ROLE OF PHYSICAL PRETREATMENTS ON THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF NATURAL AND POLYMER MODIFIED SODIUM BENTONITES". Moreover, the effect of {{the presence or absence of}} needling across the bentonite layer has been studied. All these variables have been shown to influence the hydraulic performances of bentonite through hydraulic conductivity change in both short and long term conditions. Physical pre-treatments and polymer addiction, in fact, influence the swelling behaviour of bentonite and its response to the cation exchange phenomenon. Chapter 3 - Osmotic and swelling properties of bentonite barriers. In the Paper included in this chapter, titled "COUPLED CHEMICAL-HYDRAULIC-MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF BENTONITES", a theoretical approach has been proposed in order to derive constitutive equations which describe the coupled chemical-hydraulic-mechanical behaviour of bentonite barriers, with the aim to assess their long term performance. The phenomenological parameters that govern the transport of electrolyte solutions through bentonites, i. e. the hydraulic conductivity, the reflection coefficient, which is also called the chemico-osmotic efficiency coefficient, and the osmotic effective diffusion coefficient, have been measured through laboratory tests on a natural sodium bentonite The obtained results have been interpreted by assuming that the microscopic deviations of the pore solution state variables from their average values are negligible. In this way, it is possible to interpret the macroscopic behaviour on the basis of the physical and chemical properties of the bentonite mineralogical components. At the end of the chapter two further chemico-osmotic tests are described aimed at analysing (1) the osmotic behaviour of calcium bentonite and (2) the effects induced on osmotic behaviour by stress-strain properties. Moreover, the osmotic results are confronted with data from literature. Finally, the design of a new osmotic apparatus to measure both the swelling pressure and the reflection coefficient is proposed. Chapter 4 - Hydrocarbon containment performances of natural and polymer-modified bentonite barriers. Background information on hydrocarbon behaviour in soils is reported in the first part of this chapter. In particular, the effects of capillary forces on the distribution of immiscible fluids in porous media and the theoretical aspects, regarding the formation of tactoids induced by the low dielectric constant that characterizes the most of hydrocarbon species, are studied. An experimental study is presented in the Paper titled "HYDRAULIC PERFORMANCE OF GCLS WITH DIESEL OIL AND POLYMER TREATMENT PROPOSAL", which is aimed at evaluating the hydraulic performance of a needle-punched GCL using both standard liquids (i. e. de-ionized water) and diesel oil in order to estimate the change in hydraulic conductivity and swelling ability upon contact or permeation with hydrocarbons. Moreover, the hydraulic conductivity to diesel oil of GCL samples saturated at different initial gravimetric water contents was investigated with the aim to analyse the effect of initial water saturation on hydrocarbon containment performances. Finally, the swelling and hydraulic performances to diesel oil of an innovative material, obtained by mixing sodium bentonite with a polymer, were measured. Chapter 5 - Containment performances of a bentonite-based barrier constituted of municipal solid waste bottom ashes. The research described in the Paper included in this chapter, titled "REUSE OF MSWI BOTTOM ASH MIXED WITH NATURAL SODIUM BENTONITE AS LANDFILL COVER MATERIAL" has the aim of evaluating the reuse of <b>incinerator</b> <b>slag,</b> mixed with sodium bentonite, for landfill capping system components. A chemical, hydraulic and mechanical characterization was performed on pure bottom ash (BA) samples from an incinerator in the North of Italy and on the BA-bentonite mixture. This study qualifies the BA-bentonite mixture as a suitable material for landfill cover in Italy. Moreover, owing to the low release of toxic compounds from BA, the proposed cover system does not affect the leachate quality in the landfill. Chapter 6 - Finite difference modelling of diffusive flux of Calcium through a bentonite barrier in in-situ conditions. The evidence of the strong degradation induced in the hydraulic performances of sodium bentonite barriers by the cation exchange phenomenon has been highlighted in the previous chapters. This experimental result underlines the need to study the transitional development of the cation exchange phenomenon with the aim to compare that to the period in which landfill barrier performances have to be guaranteed in in-situ conditions. The mathematical study developed in this chapter is focused on the evaluation of the role of the diffusive component of Calcium flux in the cation exchange phenomenon which can develop in a sodium bentonite barrier, placed in an environment inexorably rich in chemical compounds containing soluble Calcium (i. e. the natural soil, the aquifer, the drainage layer saturated with waste leachate or raining water...|$|R
