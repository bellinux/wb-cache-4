40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze Kitab al-Tajalliyât (The Book of Theophanies), a trilogy by the {{contemporary}} Egyptian author Jamal al-Ghitani. I will be situating my analyses {{within the context of}} contemporary Arab discourse about the relationship between al-turath (tradition) and al-mu'asara (modernity). ln his experimentation with narrative strategies, al-Ghitâni constructs his works in a relationship of "hypertextuality" to conventional forms of discourse that constitute part of the Islamic turâth. In Kitab al-Tajalliyat, he parodies the genre of sufi epistles, with specifie evocation of the discourse of Muhyi al-Din Ibn 'Arabi (1165 - 1240).

40|$|Abstract: The {{restoration}} of longitudinal connectivity of a watercourse altered by man-made obstacles {{is a key}} issue for the protection and safeguard of freshwater ecosystems {{and the construction of}} fish passes constitutes a relevant ad hoc measure. However, in many countries, like Italy, there is still not an adequate technical-scientific background and experience in this field and therefore several migratory species have become extinct or are suffering from severe impacts. The main elements of the river rehabilitation for fish project promoted by the Modena Province concerning the middle course of the Panaro River (North Italy), a watercourse characterised by high naturalistic and environmental values but fragmented by several weirs built to prevent riverbed erosion, are presented in this paper. The case study is analysed through the main steps that were carried out to define a preliminary plan for the {{restoration of}} the river continuity for the migration of four target species (South European nase (Chondrostoma genei), Italian barbel (Barbus plebejus), chub (Leuciscus cephalus cabeda) and <b>soufie</b> (Leuciscus souffia muticellus)) through the design of an innovative type of steep-slope fish ramp with large-scale roughness elements. The case study is part of an overall project and is the applicative section of an “educational ” document drawn up in the form of guidelines on the correct methodological approach for fish passes design, that will be addressed to professionals, technicians and local Authorities working in the field of water resource management...|$|E
40|$|Abstract River fish assemblages, {{as well as}} {{representing}} an important research topic related to the community of aquatic systems, are also the target of many actions linked {{to the implementation of}} EU Directives aimed at the sustainable management of these systems and biodiversity conservation, such as the Water Framework Directive (EC, 2000) and the Habitat Directive (EC, 1992), the latter specifically referring to indigenous fish species and aquatic communities taken as sensitive biotic components to be monitored in order to devise plans for their protection and safeguarding. Ecologically speaking, fish assemblages represent a fundamental biotic component of river systems, where they occupy {{the highest levels of the}} trophic networks and exert a strong influence on the structuring and functionality of the ecosystems. Precisely because of their position in the trophic networks and their sensitivity to environmental changes, fish assemblages are often used as bioindicators to evaluate the ecological status of aquatic systems (Tancioni et al., 2005; Scardi et al., 2006). The existing structure of fish assemblages has been affected by a series of remote natural “filters”, such as zoogeographic factors, which have led to the selection of primary endemic taxa (that is, which are confined to fresh or salt waters) as well as by more recent factors of anthropic origin that, after they have become acclimatized, are added to and often compete with similar primary taxa. An analysis of fish assemblages and fish populations, above all in protected fluvial areas, such as the Monterano Regional Nature Reserve (RM), a site of EU interest (Fiume Mignone-Medio Corso IT 6030001), is a fundamental step in the identification of conservation and sustainable management actions regarding original fish biodiversity and that of the river ecosystem concerned. The hydrographic profile of the protected area consists essentially of the middle course of the Mignone River, with its left tributary Torrente Lenta and other secondary water courses. These lotic environments were studied for the purpose of characterizing the fish fauna both in the distant past (Cataudella, 1977; Bianco, 1989), and in more recent times, in order to draw up the Fish Chart for the fish fauna conservation management plan (Bianco and Santoro, 2004), to prepare the Fish Map (Tancioni and Cataudella, 2009) and the Biodiversity Fish Map of the Province of Rome. During the last two study phases regarding the main stretch of the Mignone and along the Lenta, 8 sampling stations were set up, representing different environmental conditions. At these stations experimental fish catches were performed and the environmental characteristics recorded in order to analyse the composition, abundance and structure of the populations and the fish assemblages in conformity with the ISPRA-MATTM sampling protocol for fish fauna in lotic environments (Scardi and Tancioni, 2007). The experimental catches allowed the identification of 14 fish taxa, 6 of which autochthonous and 8 allochthonous (5 taxa transferred from north Italian river basins and 3 taxa of exotic origin), the latter having been introduced principally in the 1980 s. Of the observed taxa, the autochthonous species (chub, S. cephalus, Italian <b>soufie,</b> T. muticellus, Apennine barbel, B. tyberinus, Italian brook goby, G. nigricans, Italian orange-fin roach R. rubilio and eel, A. anguilla) account for 43...|$|E
40|$|Connecting T. S. Eliot's Waste Land to R. F. Burton's Kasidah {{produces}} a literary theory. The founding principle of this theory is the Unity of Consciousness (Wahdat al Wayy), after the exegesis of Ibn Arabi (Wahdat al Wujud and Wahdat al Adyan). It also postulates that any life {{is but a}} stream of consciousness. Action is thus the way by which consciousness writes in the world, and experience {{is the way the}} world writes in consciousness. The expression of consciousness in perspective is in turn a profound literary invariant, connecting The Waste Land and The Kasidah but also Poe's Al Aaraaf, Baudelaire's Voyage, Villon's Testament or Leopardi's Canto Notturno. Another invariant, based on the precedent, is the invariant of the wasteland, which can be summed up by the myth of the Ortolano Eterno : Homo : locatus est, damnatus est, humatus est, renatus est : in Horto. Now the seventh surah of the Quran is a notable expression of the invariant of the wasteland. In the same way that there is a connectomics of the human brain, there is a connectomics and also a biology of literatures. A sample of its corpus callosum, connecting the Western and Eastern literatures, is the "chain of the wasteland", a lineament of texts which leitmotiv is the interaction between consciousness and the world. Regarding Eliot his direct sufi influences range from Omar Khayyam to Guénon and Schuon, and his indirect ones regard the known sufi influence over the troubadours. In turn Eliot has been influencing the contemporary poetry of the muslim area since at least 1950. Le rapprochement du Waste Land de T. S. Eliot et de la Kasidah de R. F. Burton produit une théorie littéraire. Cette théorie est fondée sur le principe de l'Unité de la Conscience (Wahdat al Wayy) d'après l'exégèse d'Ibn Arabi (Wahdat al Wujud et Wahdat al Adyân). Elle postule également que toute vie n'est qu'un courant de conscience. L'action est une forme d'écriture de la conscience dans le monde, et l'expérience vécue est une forme d'écriture du monde dans la conscience. Or l'expression de la conscience en perspective est un invariant profond des littératures, qui relie The Waste Land et The Kasidah mais également Al Aaraaf de Poe, le Voyage de Baudelaire, le Testament de Villon ou encore le Canto Notturno de Leopardi. Un autre invariant, fondé par le précédent, est l'invariant de la gâtine, que l'on peut résumer par le mythe de l'Ortolano Eterno : Homo : locatus est, damnatus est, humatus est, renatus est : in Horto. Or la Septième sourate du Coran est une expression notable de l'invariant de la gâtine. Ainsi comme il existe une cartographie dynamique des connexions cérébrales, la connectomique, il existe une connectomique des littératures et une biologie des littératures. Une partie du corps calleux des littératures, le faisceau de connexions directes entre Orient et Occident, est la "chaîne de la gâtine", un linéament de textes qui se fascinent pour l'interaction entre le monde et la conscience. Concernant Eliot, ses influences soufies directes vont de Omar Khayyam à Guénon ou Schuon, et ses influences indirectes relèvent de l'influence <b>soufie</b> sur les troubadours. Eliot influence lui-même la poésie de l'aire musulmane depuis au moins 1950...|$|E
