40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} the particle structure in an AA 1200 <b>sheet</b> <b>ingot</b> used for litho applications has been studied. Caustic etching of the as-cast material was seen {{to result in a}} zone close to the surface with a different etching response. This zone was identified as what is known as a fir-tree zone or an Altenpohl zone [1, 2, 3, 4]. A variation in particle type over the cross section of the as-cast ingot was seen to follow the differences in etching response. After heat treatment of the material, the fir-tree zones were no longer visible, and the accompanying change in particle structure was studied. Samples from the subsurface regions and from a distance of ~ 20 cm from the surface has been investigated before and after heat treatment. In the as-cast material, the sample from the surface was dominated by featherlike particles with long strings of particles, identified as AlmFe. While closer to the centre Al 3 Fe and Al 6 Fe were seen to be the main phases, however, some AlmFe and probably some α-AlFeSi was also found in this sample. After heat treatment, the particle structure was seen to change, and the surface sample contained mainly Al 3 Fe in addition to a small amount of AlmFe. The change in particle structure during heat treatment is discussed with reference to the change in etching response...|$|E

50|$|Aluminium foil is {{produced}} by rolling <b>sheet</b> <b>ingots</b> cast from molten billet aluminium, then re-rolling on sheet and foil rolling mills to the desired thickness, or by continuously casting and cold rolling. To maintain a constant thickness in aluminium foil production, beta radiation is passed through the foil to a sensor on the other side. If the intensity becomes too high, then the rollers adjust, increasing the thickness. If the intensities become too low and the foil has become too thick, the rollers apply more pressure, causing the foil to be made thinner.|$|R

40|$|Cost {{reduction}} of silicon {{materials in the}} photovoltaic program of materials was examined. The current process of producing silicon sheets is based entirely on the conventional Czochralski ingot growth and wafering used in the semiconductor industry. The current technology cannot meet the cost reduction demands for producing low cost silicon sheets. Alternative sheet production processes such as unconventional crystallization are needed. The production of polycrystalline silicon <b>sheets</b> by unconventional <b>ingot</b> technology is the casting technique. Though large grain sheets were obtained by this technique, silicon ribbon growth overcomes deficiencies of the casting process by obtaining the sheet directly from the melt. The need to solve difficulties of growth stability and impurity effects are examined. The direct formation process of polycrystalline silicon sheets with large grain size, smooth surface, and sharp edges from the melt with a high growth rate which will yield low cost silicon sheets for solar cells and the photovoltaic characteristics associated {{with this type of}} sheet to include an EBIC study of the grain boundaries are described...|$|R
40|$|Hot tearing {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe defects {{observed}} in castings, e. g. in billets or <b>sheet</b> <b>ingots</b> of aluminum alloys produced by DC casting. It is due to both tensile strains and a lack of interdendritic feeding in the mushy zone. In order to predict this phenomenon at the scale of an entire casting, the two-phase averaged conservation equations for mass and momentum must be solved in the mushy (i. e. mixed solid and liquid) region of the material. In recent contributions, M'Hamdi et al [1] proposed a strongly coupled resolution scheme for this set of equations. The solution of the problem was obtained using a rheological model established by Ludwig et al [2] and that captures the partially cohesive nature of the mushy alloy. In the present contribution, the problem is addressed using a slightly different approach. The same rheological model (i. e. saturated porous media treatment) is used, but the influence of the liquid pressure is neglected at this stage. This assumption allows for a weakly coupled resolution scheme in which the mechanical problem is first solved alone using ABAQUS™ and user subroutines. Then the pressure in the liquid phase is calculated separately accounting for the viscoplastic deformation of the porous solid skeleton and solidification shrinkage. This is done with a code previously developed for porosity calculations, and that uses a refined mesh in the mushy zone [3]. This semi-coupled method was implemented and its numerical convergence studied from the point of view of both time step and mesh size. Guidelines for selecting these numerical parameters as well as the conditions under which the semi-coupled method may be applied are provided. The model was then applied to three cases, i. e. two tensile tests conducted on mushy alloys [4, 5] and the casting of an entire billet [6]. Experimental data was indeed available concerning these problems prior to the present work. This information was used for the validation of the thermal and mechanical models that were setup to describe these different cases. The results of the semi-coupled approach were also used to describe in more details these different castings. First of all, the numerical study of the mushy zone tearing test [5] proved helpful for distinguishing different fracture modes. The role of the high strain rate applied to the mushy alloy in this case was also outlined. Another tensile test, referred to as the rig test [4], was successfully modeled in the present framework. The numerical results could be used to quantify the redistribution of strain in the mushy sample. As a consequence, intrinsic properties of the material, such as its ductility, could be extracted from the results. This study also gave further insight about the conditions under which tearing occurs in the samples. Finally, the semi-coupled method was used to study the DC casting process. In this case, a real process performed under realistic conditions for the production of an industrial scale billet was modeled. As it is more complex and difficult to characterize experimentally, the conditions for hot tearing formation are less accessible. However, the isotherm velocity, the strain, the strain rate and the liquid pressure could be described reasonably accurately. It was thus possible to correlate experimental observations of the hot tear with various calculated indicators of hot tearing susceptibility. Even with this information, it remains difficult to formulate new hot tearing criteria because all the indicators follow a similar trend during the casting and their respective contributions can thus not be distinguished. The present work showed that the level of accuracy and detail that can be reached using two-phase models with appropriate materials properties and boundary conditions is satisfactory. It is indeed possible to model the relevant phenomena (heat flow, solid deformation and liquid feeding) at the scale of an entire casting. The variation of the different simulated fields can be described down to a scale of the order of a few millimeters. In that sense, this approach is one important aspect required to build a multiscale model for the problem of hot tearing. It is expected that coupling such a method with granular models (which cover length scales from a few microns to a few centimeters [7]) will allow for a more complete description of the phenomena at hand. In the future, the development of such a multiscale numerical tool may prove to be the most efficient way towards quantitative predictions of hot tearing formation in real solidification processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Accumulative Roll Bonding (ARB) is a {{technique}} of grain refinement by severe plastic deformation, which involves multiple repetitions of surface treatment, stacking, rolling, and cutting. The rolling with 50 % reduction in thickness bonds the sheets. After several cycles, ultrafine-grained (UFG) materials are produced. Since ARB enables the production of large amounts of UFG materials, its adoption into industrial practice is favoured. ARB has been successfully used for preparation of UFG <b>sheets</b> from different <b>ingot</b> cast aluminium alloys. Twin-roll casting (TRC) is a cost and energy effective method for manufacturing aluminium sheets. Fine particles and small grain size are intrinsic for TRC sheets making them good starting materials for ARB. The paper {{presents the results of}} a research aimed at investigating the feasibility of ARB processing of three TRC alloys, AA 8006, AA 8011 and AA 5754, at ambient temperature. The microstructure and properties of the ARB were investigated by means of light and transmission electron microscopy and hardness measurements. AA 8006 specimens were ARB processed without any problems. Sound sheets of AA 8011 alloy were also obtained even after 8 cycles of ARB. The AA 5754 alloy suffered from severe edge and notch cracking since the first cycle. The work hardening of AA 8006 alloy saturated after the 3 rd cycle, whereas the hardness of AA 5754 alloy increased steadily up to the 5 th cycle. Monotonous increase in strength up to 280 MPa was observed in the ARB processed AA 8011 alloy...|$|R
40|$|During the {{conventional}} production of aluminum <b>sheets</b> from casted <b>ingots,</b> the workpiece {{passes through a}} sequence of rolling and annealing steps. This thermomechanical treatment is {{required in order to}} allow the desired thickness reduction without damage. In addition, it is utilized to achieve favored final properties of the semi-finished product. In the course of production, the process influences the microstructure, i. e. via deformation and heat input the texture, grain size and other microstructural characteristics develop. Thus, the resulting properties of the workpiece are altered throughout the process. If this aforementioned production route is mapped computationally via integrated process- and microstructure-simulation tools, there is a high potential for optimizing microstructural and final properties and the process itself. Furthermore, the utilization of such a simulation setup gives the possibility to gain understanding of complex interactions within the system, which {{might not be able to}} be tracked experimentally. As it turned out, no process simulation package with a fully integrated microstructure development existed so far, which covers the considered industrial production chain. The aim of this work was to implement a setup, which overcomes these shortcomings. The requirements for such a model package are the following: • A full integration of process models and microstructure models, i. e. to calculate the evolution of appropriate process and (microstructural-) state variables in the course of the production chain, • a transferability to an industrial scale, • a reasonable balance between computational effort and accuracy, • a high usability, and • a possibility to validate individual models and the entire model package. To meet these requirements, the following steps were taken: Within the simulation of a single rolling pass the microstructure models 3 IVM+, GIA and Core, which were developed at the Institute of Physical Metallurgy and Metal Physics (IMM), were interlinked via the transfer of chosen state variables. Furthermore, these models were coupled with two process models, namely ROSERoll and ROSEAnneal, which were provided by Hydro Aluminium Rolled Products, R&D Bonn. Via the latter models a transferability to an industrial production (i. e. temperature development, interpass times, geometrical conditions) is given by the use of real processing data from productions lines. In order to realize a continuous evolution of microstructure variables over sequential thermomechanical treatments, two new modules had to be integrated. Firstly, the Passlinker module, and secondly a database for tracking the deformation history of individual grains throughout the process. Within the model package, the microstructure discretization was implemented in such a way, that it is freely scalable. The behavior of the simulation setup at different degrees of discretization was statistically analyzed. In addition, it was validated with experimental observations. The whole model package has been fully automated in the internet-based platform SimWeb from IMM. Here, also input templates and result templates were added. Furthermore, for microstructure characterization and sample preparation, efficient experimental methods have been created to support the simulation. These activities resulted in the following benefits for through-process simulations: The full integration of models and modules into the aforementioned package improves the predictive capability of the microstructure evolution under the influence of the process during complete production chains. The model setup is now capable to reproduce the – in a metal-physical context – demanding evolution of partially recrystallized intermediate microstructural conditions during further processing in a qualitative manner. In addition, a validation of such conditions is now possible with the newly established experimental analysis and sample preparation methods. Moreover, these techniques reduce experimental effort, and go hand in hand with an increased accuracy. Based on the findings from statistical simulation analysis on the numerical behavior of the modelling setup, the user can derive a suitable level of microstructure discretization for a given task. Noteworthy, the efficiency and usability of the through-process simulation framework is significantly improved via automation, being important for large parametric studies or further statistical analyses. Moreover, this automated implementation of the model package within the SimWeb platform also promotes the sustainability of the process chain simulation. Thus, it provides a sound basis for future additions and advancements...|$|R
