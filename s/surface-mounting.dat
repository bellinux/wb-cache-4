25|$|Through-hole {{manufacture}} adds {{to board}} cost by requiring many holes to be drilled accurately, and limits the available routing area for signal traces on layers immediately below {{the top layer}} on multi-layer boards since the holes must pass through all layers to the opposite side. Once <b>surface-mounting</b> came into use, small-sized SMD components were used where possible, with through-hole mounting only of components unsuitably large for <b>surface-mounting</b> due to power requirements or mechanical limitations, or subject to mechanical stress which might damage the PCB.|$|E

This model resembles the Washburn Wonderbar in that the springs and strings do not go through the body, thus eliminating the routing necessary to install the classic Floyd Rose tremolo in classic, fixed-bridge electric guitars.|$|E

40|$|Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) {{are uniquely}} suited to {{miniaturized}} free-space optical systems in which <b>surface-mounting</b> and hybrid assembly techniques {{can be used}} to combine different technologies together. Two examples are described of such microsystems that are being developed for sensing applications. The first example is a optical position sensing system for rotating parts. Progress on fabricating similar systems by flip-chip bonding techniques is then discussed. The second example is a chemical sensing/analysis system which uses a miniature fluorescence detection module that is based on surface-mounted VCSELs and diffractive optical elements. The detection module is integrated with a capillary electrochromatography separation system and uses substrate-mode light propagation to focus the VCSEL beam on the capillary channel...|$|E
30|$|Appearance {{should not}} to be {{overlooked}} {{when it comes to}} installing cameras. If the cameras will be installed in an outdoor environment, large outdoor enclosures may invoke a sense of intimidation (see Figure 4 (a)). It is recommended to take into consideration the environment the cameras will be installed to decide whether discreetness or visibility are higher concerns. As opposed to <b>surface-mounting</b> (installing a camera directly on a ceiling surface), flush-mounting (cutting a hole and installing a camera in the ceiling with the optics exposed) will provide a more discreet and streamlined appearance, but will require permanent alteration to the installation locations. If a network is temporary, readers are recommended to consider the life expectancy of the network before opting for flush mounting.|$|E
40|$|An ultra {{low-power}} differential varactor-less 10 GHz LC oscillator {{has been}} fabricated. The implementation IC technology allows <b>surface-mounting,</b> eliminates substrate losses {{and has a}} copper back-end. The quality factor of the used 0. 63 nH inductor is estimated by measuring the required start-up current of the oscillator. With a supply voltage of 3 V, the estimated quality factor {{is as high as}} 39 at 10 GHz. At 10 GHz the dissipation of the oscillator core is 420 mW (with 3 V supply voltage) and the measured phase noise better than - 94. 7 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset of the carrier. By increasing the bias current, the frequency can be tuned from 10. 2 GHz to 8. 7 GHz, which corresponds to 15. 8 % tuning range.

30|$|While the {{selected}} Axis 215 camera offers an outdoor dome enclosure, a dilemma was faced {{as there were}} no discreet outdoor enclosures for them; {{we had to find}} a way to make the cameras relatively weatherproof to withstand humidity and moisture. By choosing the Axis 215, we had to compensate for the lack of an available outdoor enclosure and improvise using the supplied flush-mount enclosures with smoked domes and surface-mount enclosures with clear domes, both designed for indoor installation. The solution was to use the surface-mount enclosures and make them weather-resistant by sealing the plastic seams with silicone sealant. In addition, the clear domes were interchanged with the smoked domes. The end result was a non-threatening camera dome suitable for <b>surface-mounting</b> at any of the 37 locations (see Figure 4 (c)). Long-term effects of humidity, heat, and moisture on the cameras despite the sealed domes remains to be seen.|$|E
40|$|A {{printed circuit}} board (PCB) {{grouping}} problem arising from the electronics industry is considered. Given a <b>surface-mounting</b> device {{with a number of}} component feeders and several types of PCBs to be produced, the problem is how to group the PCBs so that the total set-up time for component feeders is minimized. The problem is formulated as an integer-programming problem and a column generation approach is proposed to solve it. In this approach, the original problem is decomposed into a master problem and a column-generation subproblem. Starting with a few columns in the master problem, new columns are generated successively by solving the subproblem optimally. To solve the subpro-blem, a branch-and-cut approach is used. To solve the master problem, a branch-and-bound algorithm is used with the generated columns. However, a branching strategy is also proposed that maintains consistency in the column-generation procedure after branching. Computational experiments show that the solution approach gives high-quality solutions in reasonable computing time...|$|E

40|$|Although a wide {{selection}} of digital and linear ICs have been available in <b>surface-mount</b> packages for some time, circuits that require power devices have, for the most part, required “mixed-technology ” assembly processes.

The DPAK provides, at best, tolerable compatibility with other <b>surface-mount</b> components, and it offers little density advantage over “through-hole ” technologies.
