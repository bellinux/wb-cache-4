Thousands of people arrived, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>that</b> the meeting was moved to the larger Old South Meeting House. British law required the Dartmouth to unload and pay the duties within twenty days or customs officials could confiscate the cargo. The mass meeting passed a resolution introduced by Adams urging the captain of the Dartmouth to send the ship back without paying the import duty. Meanwhile, the meeting assigned twenty-five men to watch the ship and prevent the tea from being unloaded.|$|E

However each angel will enter a service according to the use that they had performed in their earthly life.

It became one of Marvel's most successful titles, attracting 300 to 400 fan letters with every issue, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>that</b> the studio had to suspend its practice of writing personal responses.

The first royal coach left Buckingham Palace and moved down the Mall, which was filled with flag-waving and cheering crowds. It {{was followed by the}} Irish State Coach carrying Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who wore the circlet of her crown bearing the Koh-i-Noor diamond. Queen Elizabeth II proceeded through London from Buckingham Palace, through Trafalgar Square, and towards the abbey in the Gold State Coach. Attached to the shoulders of her dress, the Queen wore the Robe of State, a 6-yard (5.5metre) long, hand woven silk velvet cloak lined with Canadian ermine that required the assistance of the Queen's maids of honour—Lady Jane Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Lady Anne Coke, Lady Moyra Hamilton, Lady Mary Baillie-Hamilton, Lady Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, Lady Rosemary Spencer-Churchill and the Duchess of Devonshire—to carry.|$|E

It was translated into numerous languages, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>that</b> McCrae himself quipped that [...] "it needs only Chinese now, surely". Its appeal was nearly universal. Soldiers took encouragement from it as a statement of their duty to those who died while people on the home front viewed it as defining the cause for which their brothers and sons were fighting.|$|E

During World War II, more than 340 of the village's 1,830 residents served in the United States Armed Forces; eight streets in the village are named after residents who died in the war. Many of the village's firefighters (at least nine on active duty) left to fight during the war; <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>that</b> the village had to request volunteers ages 16–18 to join the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department.

500|$|Original War Department {{estimates}} {{called for}} the Army to raise, equip, train, and deploy as many as 350 divisions. [...] Later estimates revised this number downward to between 200 and 220. [...] One factor that enabled this downward revision was that U.S. divisions were better equipped {{in some areas of}} their organizations than those of their adversaries, particularly later in the war; for example, every U.S. division was completely mechanized, while German divisions relied on as many as 4,000 horses for transporting soldiers, supplies, and artillery. [...] A variety of other factors, including the entry of the Soviet Union into the war {{on the side of the}} Allies after Adolf Hitler broke his non-aggression pact with Joseph Stalin by launching Operation Barbarossa, the need to ensure that enough farmers and agricultural workers were available for food production, and the need to maintain a U.S. workforce large enough to handle the production of weapons, vehicles, ammunition, and other equipment caused Army Chief of Staff Marshall to decide that maintaining the Army's ground combat strength at 90 divisions would strike the balance between too few soldiers to defeat the Axis powers, and <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>that</b> there were not enough civilians in the U.S. workforce.|$|E

500|$|Jose Sarria {{fought against}} police harassment, both of gays and of gay bars. Raids on gay bars were routine, with {{everyone}} inside the raided bar {{taken into custody}} and charged with such crimes as being [...] "inmates in a disorderly house". Although the charges were routinely dropped, the arrested patrons' names, addresses and workplaces were printed in the newspapers. When charges were not dropped, the arrested men usually quietly pleaded guilty. Sarria encouraged men to plead not guilty and demand a jury trial. Following Sarria's advice, more and more gay men began demanding jury trials, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>that</b> court dockets were overloaded and judges began expecting that prosecutors have actual evidence against the accused before going to trial. One favored harassment technique, employed especially on Halloween after midnight, was to arrest drag queens under an old city ordinance that made it illegal {{for a man to}} dress in women's clothing with an [...] "intent to deceive". In consultation with attorney Melvin Belli, Sarria countered this tactic by distributing labels to his fellow drag queens (hand-made, {{in the shape of a}} black cat's head) that read [...] "I am a boy". If confronted, the queen would simply display the tag to prove that there was no intent to deceive. Sarria's actions helped bring an end to Halloween police raids. Along with Guy Strait, Sarria formed the League for Civil Education (LCE) in 1960 or 1961. The LCE ran educational programs on the topic of homosexuality and provided support for men being ostracized for being gay and for those caught in police raids.|$|E
500|$|Following its broadcast, [...] "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In {{his review of}} The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "Even in the series’ crummier seasons, the staff always seems {{to come up with}} a good Halloween episode", and that [...] "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] "continues that trend". Of the three segments, Jacobson found [...] "Life's a Glitch, Then You Die" [...] to be the weakest. He wrote [...] " [...] other than a good ending, it simply doesn’t have a lot going for it" [...] and added that it is the most dated of the three. He continued, [...] "'Diddily' offers a fun horror spoof, and 'Xena' is a terrific superhero bit with plenty of cleverness." [...] DVD Talk's Ian Jane gave the episode a positive review as well. Considering it to be one of the season's best episodes, Jane wrote [...] "This one, like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>that</b> have come before and since, is a great blend of horror movie parody and Halloween themed fun in Springfield." [...] In 2007, Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal included [...] "Desperately Xeeking Xena" [...] in a list called [...] "The Ten Best Treehouse of Horror Vignettes". Although he disliked Bart and Lisa's part in the segment, Patrick wrote that it [...] "earns its stripes by being perhaps Comic Book Guy's finest hour". He also praised the segment's references, as well as Lawless' line [...] "A wizard did it", a phrase used to explain continuity errors. In 2009, The Collector's marriage proposal to Lawless was included in [...] "Line-O-Rama: Comic Book Guy", a compilation of what IGN considers to be The Comic Book Guy's best lines.|$|E
