5|$|A meal often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (introductory course, <b>sometimes</b> soup), plat principal (main course), fromage (cheese course) or dessert, <b>sometimes</b> with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is <b>sometimes</b> {{used for}} pain relief {{or as an}} {{anticoagulant}} in veterinary medicine, primarily in dogs and <b>sometimes</b> horses, although newer medications with fewer side effects are generally used instead.|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are <b>sometimes</b> added to the list. Boron <b>sometimes</b> is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. <b>Sometimes</b> tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Both Continental Scandinavia and Iceland have a {{scattering}} of mentions of elves in medical texts, <b>sometimes</b> in Latin and <b>sometimes</b> {{in the form of}} amulets, where elves are viewed as a possible cause of illness. Most of them have Low German connections.|$|E
5|$|Ships were <b>sometimes</b> camouflaged in {{classical}} times. Mediterranean pirate ships were <b>sometimes</b> painted blue-gray for concealment. Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout ships were painted bluish-green when gathering intelligence {{along the coast}} of Britain during the Gallic Wars. Ships were <b>sometimes</b> painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while both sides in the American Civil War camouflaged their ships, whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sometimes,</b> Dhumavati rides a crow {{and holds}} a trident. She may be {{depicted}} wearing a garland of severed heads, with red-coloured limbs and matted but dishevelled hair. <b>Sometimes,</b> she carries the buffalo-horn of Yama, {{the god of}} death, symbolizing her association with death.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is <b>sometimes</b> used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, <b>sometimes</b> using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and <b>sometimes</b> only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is <b>sometimes</b> directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is <b>sometimes</b> performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between nonmetals and metals {{is by no}} means clear. The result is that a few borderline elements lacking a preponderance of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead <b>sometimes</b> classified as metalloids, or vice versa. For example, selenium (Se), a nonmetal, is <b>sometimes</b> classified instead as a metalloid, particularly in environmental chemistry; and astatine (At), which is a metalloid and a halogen, is <b>sometimes</b> classified instead as a nonmetal.|$|E
5|$|With {{her right}} leg held {{straight}} and her left leg bent a little (the pratyalidha stance), Chhinnamasta stands in a fighting posture on the love-deity couple of Kamadeva (Kama)– a symbol of sexual lust– and his wife Rati, who are engaged in copulation with the latter usually on the top (viparita-rati sex position). Kamadeva is generally blue-complexioned, while Rati is white. Below the couple is a lotus with an inverted triangle, and in the background is a cremation ground. The Chhinnamasta Tantra describes the goddess sitting on the couple, rather than standing on them. <b>Sometimes,</b> Kamadeva-Rati is replaced by the divine couple of Krishna and Radha. The lotus beneath the couple is <b>sometimes</b> replaced by a cremation pyre. The coupling couple is <b>sometimes</b> omitted entirely. <b>Sometimes</b> Shiva– the goddess's consort– is depicted lying beneath Chhinnamasta, who is seated squatting on him and copulating with him. Dogs or jackals drinking the blood <b>sometimes</b> appear in the scene. <b>Sometimes</b> Chhinnamasta is depicted standing on a lotus, a grass patch, or the ground.|$|E
5|$|A green tinge in {{the skin}} is <b>sometimes</b> {{associated}} with nausea and sickness. The expression 'green at the gills' means appearing sick. The color, when combined with gold, is <b>sometimes</b> seen as representing the fading of youth. In some Far East cultures the color green {{is used as a}} symbol of sickness or nausea.|$|E

5|$|Because of this property, {{lead nitrate}} is <b>sometimes</b> used in {{pyrotechnics}} such as fireworks.|$|E
5|$|Because with Calcraft's methods the {{condemned}} took several minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft would <b>sometimes</b> dramatically pull on legs or climb on shoulders {{in an effort}} to break a victim's neck. It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods partly to entertain the crowds, <b>sometimes</b> numbering 30,000 spectators or more.|$|E

5|$|Designation <b>sometimes</b> {{associated}} with the 1944 production aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes {{largely from the}} choice observational writings of <b>sometimes</b> disinterested Confucian scholars. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, <b>sometimes</b> provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described.|$|E

5|$|Governments <b>sometimes</b> operate {{units that}} {{specialize}} in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically {{part of a national}} Geological survey, for example the British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that <b>sometimes</b> affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.|$|E
5|$|Interspecific hybrids are the {{offspring}} from interspecies mating; these <b>sometimes</b> result in hybrid speciation.|$|E
5|$|Large {{fish are}} caught with the bill-tip, then tossed {{up in the}} air to be caught and slid into the gullet head-first. A gull will <b>sometimes</b> stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in their turn <b>sometimes</b> snatch prey from other waterbirds.|$|E

5|$|Other Australian {{locations}} mentioned and <b>sometimes</b> seen in {{the series}} include the fictitious suburbs of West Waratah, Eden Hills, and Anson's Corner. Real-life Australian towns {{in the state of}} Victoria such as Colac, Frankston and Shepparton are <b>sometimes</b> referred to. Oakey in Queensland is also mentioned and <b>sometimes</b> seen. On 27 August 2010, Neighbours filmed scenes in Sydney's Darling Harbour and on board a cruise ship. The episodes marked only the third time that the show has filmed scenes outside of Victoria. In October 2011, Neighbours filmed scenes in Port Douglas, Queensland and around the Great Barrier Reef region. Two storylines were filmed in Geelong and the Gold Coast in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Parades {{generally}} impress {{and delight}} (5, 6, 7, 8), often by including unusual, colourful costumes (6, 7). <b>Sometimes</b> they also commemorate (5, 8) or celebrate (1, 4, 8, 9, 10). <b>Sometimes</b> {{they have a}} serious purpose, such as when the context is military (1, 2, 5), when the intention is <b>sometimes</b> to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or {{have a role to}} play (6, 7, 9). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away (10), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.|$|E

5|$|Testaroli is {{prepared}} from a batter that is cooked {{on a hot}} flat surface, after which it may be consumed. It is traditionally cooked on a testo, a flat terra cotta or cast iron cooking surface from which the food's name is derived. It is <b>sometimes</b> cooked further in boiling water and then served. Testaroli is <b>sometimes</b> {{referred to as a}} bread, similar to focaccia in composition, and is <b>sometimes</b> referred to as a crêpe. It may be dressed with pesto sauce or other ingredients such as olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and garlic. Falsi testaroli al ragu is a similar dish prepared using sliced pasta dough and a ragù sauce.|$|E
5|$|The Free State of Galveston (<b>sometimes</b> {{referred}} to as the Republic of Galveston Island) was a whimsical name given to the coastal city of Galveston in the U.S. state of Texas during the early-to-mid-20thcentury.

5|$|The basidiospores are {{ellipsoid}} {{and measure}} 12–16 by 8–9.5µm. Basidia are 20–35 by 7–15µm and usually four-spored, but <b>sometimes</b> two-spored basidia can occur. Pleurocystidia are 60–90 by 20–50µm with variable morphology: club-shaped, fusiform, ovoid, and <b>sometimes</b> {{with a small}} apical papilla. Cheilocystidia are 55–100 by 15–40µm with similar morphology to the pleurocystidia; they completely cover the gill edge. The cap cuticle (pileipellis) is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae wide embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia are <b>sometimes</b> present, measuring 70–180 by 10–25µm; they are mostly cylindrical. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
