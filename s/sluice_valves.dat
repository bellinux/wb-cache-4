50|$|At {{the bow of}} the vessel, {{within the}} space {{enclosed}} by the two flaps already described, there is an opening fitted with a <b>sluice</b> <b>valve,</b> as shown in Fig. 2. This valve slides vertically, and is raised and lowered by means of a screw, which can be worked by hand. The arrangement of gearing employed is shown in Fig. 3. When the <b>sluice</b> <b>valve</b> is opened, it admits the water into a strongly constructed iron reservoir 6 ft 2 in (1.9 m) long, 4 ft (1.2 m) deep, and varying from 2 ft 3 in to 3 ft (690 to 910 mm) wide. At the top of this tank there is a manhole fitted with a cover, hinged and fastened {{so that it can be}} easily removed and replaced; and from the lower part of the tank, a suction pipe proceeds to one of the Andrews's pumps. The aft end of the tank is fitted with a gunmetal sphere 18 in (460 mm) in diameter, this sphere being held by two flanges as shown in Fig. 2, so that it forms a ball-and-socket joint. It is through an opening in this sphere that the torpedo tube projected torpedoes from the vessel. This tube is about 20 ft (6.1 m) long, and has an external diameter of 5 in (127 mm) and an internal diameter of 3 in (76 mm). It was made by Morris, Tasker and Co., Philadelphia, PA and was considered a very superior example of workmanship.|$|R

The ship had a 120 m long well deck that could be submerged 3 m under water. The movement of water within the ship was control by <b>sluices,</b> <b>valves</b> and automatic pumps. The ships were supplied with two EDICs (Landing Craft Tanks) which carried 11 light tanks or could accommodate 18 LCMs within the well deck. They could carry a variety of other loads. They were also designed as repair ships, able to dock ships up to 450 t within their well.|$|R

There was no outward sign of damage and it was not until after Untamed was salvaged on 5 July 1943 that it was found that she had been flooded through a <b>sluice</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first annual}} encampment {{for the north}} Queensland {{component}} of the colony's Defence Force had taken place at Townsville in 1885 at Cluden Park, on the south-eastern outskirts of the settlement. In 1887 drill practice was being conducted at Kissing Point and Magazine Island. As more volunteer units formed these encampments grew larger, necessitating their removal to a larger open space. In 1889 they were moved to the newly gazetted public recreation reserve of 25 acres (10.117 hectares) known as Norman Park, adjacent {{to the west of}} the Kissing Point reserve and leased to the Queensland and later the Australian governments by the Townsville Town Council. Regular encampments were held at Norman Park until the start of World War II. In preparation for these events the salt pan land adjacent to the south of the Kissing Point outcrop and subject to intermittent tidal flooding was drained with a dam and <b>sluice</b> <b>valve.</b> Similar earthwork, including a dam across a creek that flowed into Rowes Bay, was carried out to make the salt pan and mangrove areas along the western half of Norman Park into a suitable training and parade field. It was not until 1909 that the Deed of Grant for Norman Park was purchased for Defence Purposes by the Australian Government.|$|R
5000|$|A gate valve, {{also known}} as a <b>sluice</b> <b>valve,</b> is a valve which opens by lifting a round or {{rectangular}} gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a gate valve is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so gate valves are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. The gate faces can be parallel, but are most commonly wedge-shaped. Gate valves are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical gate valves shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, gate valves are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a knife gate valve is used to cut through the liquid. [...] On opening the gate valve, the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening. This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the flow change occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing gate and seat wear and eventual leakage if used to regulate flow. Typical gate valves are designed to be fully opened or closed. [...] When fully open, the typical gate valve has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. (Engineering Management) Abstract: When the {{complexity}} of the controller plant is a non-linear system, the production process cannot be fulfilled by the control effect and {{it is not easy to}} manipulate the parameters on Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller. The major objective under study is simulating and modelling machinery then come up with a suitable intelligent Condition Based Maintenance system (i. e to develop a suitable intelligent system using fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence). The area under study of Fuzzy Logic came as a concern of nonlinear systems which fail to give correct information since machines use conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative and hence this is for linear systems. Considering vibrations and continuous failure of machines, this will cause incorrect data portraying. Three companies were done in this thesis and all were analysed using fuzzy logic and some finite element analysis of components to monitor the parameters. Root cause analysis was also done to determine what was failing on different equipments. Three companies in a developing country were used as case studies for testing fuzzy logic approaches and models to machinery failure analysis. The three companies are designated as follows: Beverages Production Company, Hydro Power Generating Company and Water Distributing Company. The overall effectiveness of the companies were heavily affected due to many breakdowns. The main problem was found to be resulting from failure to monitor nonlinear systems that naturally exist in such environments. On the bottle washer at Beverages Production Company, fuzzy logic with Model Reference Adaptive Control to prevent failure on the bottle washer and introduce an intelligent Condition Based Maintenance program was done, a solution to come up with a control system that monitors water in the dam as well as protecting the equipment from failure and do stability control of machinery for Water Distributing Company as well as apply the concept of Maintenance Free Operating Period reliability metric to determine maintenance intervals as opposed to Mean Time Between Failure to the Hydro-Power Generation Company and also do a Simulink control on the governor. The results of the simulation of the control strategy of Fuzzy Logic Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller have much preferred performance as compared to the general Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller. This was done in the Simulink/Matlab simulation environment. The innovations behind this thesis at Beverages Production Company, the pneumatic valve of the bottle washer which controls the discharge of clean bottles was occasionally sticking or failing resulting in significant loss of production in the plant since all the other processes which follow depend on the bottle washer. The main causes of failure were caused by poor control of temperature and pressure. Excessive moisture and abrasive particles also caused failures. In order to solve this problem a Model Reference Adaptive Fuzzy Controller was designed for the pneumatic valve using the Matlab software. The error resulting from the difference between the actual system output and that of the reference model was executed by the Fuzzy Logic Controller. At company Hydro-Power Generation Company, the administering system of a 150 Megawatts Francis Turbine was developed using fuzzy logic. The representative framework parameters were mirrored with the real information accessible in the power plant. At Water Distributing Company the problem of corroding gates and failure was solved using solid works, Matlab, Programmable Logic Controller and Simulink. The <b>sluice</b> gate <b>valve</b> was controlled and done stability by Matlab to avoid failure. After fuzzy logic is applied in each and every company under study, the breakdowns will be less and machinery can be diagnosed and prognosis is easy to foresee the failures. A new gate was designed by the researcher. The research has shown that fuzzy logic being intelligent, machinery can last longer and production is high. The limitations are that although it is good in monitoring but in some machinery and companies may not work well because of environment like in the water gates. It is also expensive to implement and difficult to convince management to do the research for a start...|$|R
