40|$|The lack of {{effective}} treatment for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas imposes serious {{challenges to the}} healthcare system. Here, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of liquiritigenin involved in preventing or retarding the progression of liver diseases in a rat model with chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) exposure. Sprague Dawley rats were given CCl 4 and lliquiritigenin alone or simultaneously for 8 weeks before liver was harvested to check histological changes by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, apoptosis by TUNEL assay, ROS by dihydroethidium <b>staining,</b> <b>antioxidant</b> enzyme activities and malondialdehyde using specific kits, and gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Chronic CCl 4 exposure caused profound changes in liver histology with extensive hepatocyte death (necrosis and apoptosis), fat accumulation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, accompanied by depressed activities of antioxidant enzymes, increased oxidative stress, elevated expression of inflammation and fibrotic genes, and downregulation of PGC- 1 α, ND 1, and Bcl-x in rat liver. All these changes were abolished or alleviated by lliquiritigenin. The results demonstrated that liquiritigenin is effective in protecting liver from injury or treating chronic liver diseases. The modulation of PGC- 1 α and its downstream genes might {{play a critical role}} in relieving CCl 4 -induced hepatic pathogenesis by liquiritigenin...|$|E
40|$|Cyanobacteria are {{fascinating}} and versatile group of bacteria which are of immense biological importance. They are unique photosynthetic prokaryotes with an oxygenic photosynthesis process. They possess {{an array of}} protective mechanism comprising of antioxidants to eliminate the damages caused by the reactive oxygen species. Blooms caused by cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in temple ponds, lakes and other water reservoirs. In this study, the antioxidative potential of catalase in bloom forming cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus and Anabaena variabilis was determined. The activity of catalase by spectrophotometric analysis, using hydrogen peroxide as the substrate showed activity 35. 45 ± 4. 45 mM/min/µg protein in Synechococcus elongatus and 13. 68 ± 1. 09 mM/min/µg protein in Anabaena variabilis.

Woundhealing involves inflammation followed by granular tissue development and scar formation. In this study, synthetic chalcone 3 -(2 -Chlorophenyl) - 1 -phenyl-propenone (CPPP) was investigated for a potential role in enhancing wound healing and closure. Twenty-four male rats were divided randomly into 4 groups: carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (0. 2 mL), Intrasite gel, and CPPP (25 or 50 mg/mL). Grossmorphology, wounds treatmentwith theCPPP, and Intrasite gel accelerate the rate of wound healing compared to CMC group. Ten days after surgery, the animals were sacrificed. Histological assessment revealed that the wounds treated with CPPP showed that wound closure site contained little amount of scar and the granulation tissue contained more collagen and less inflammatory cells than wound treated with CMC. This finding was confirmed with Masson’s trichrome <b>staining.</b> The <b>antioxidant</b> defence enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly increased in the wound homogenates treated with CPPP...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of Banhasasim-tang (BHSST) on chronic acid reflux esophagitis (CRE) model. Rat CRE model was established operatively and then treated with BHSST (1 [*]g/kg body weight per day) for 15 days Esophageal pathological changes were analyzed using macroscopic examination and hematoxylin/eosin <b>staining.</b> The <b>antioxidant</b> and inflammatory protein levels were determined using Western blotting. The administration of BHSST significantly reduced both the overexpression of serum reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an excessive formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in esophagus tissue. Thus, the severity of esophageal ulcer was lower in BHSST treated rats than control rats on the gross and histological evaluation. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) led to the upregulation of antioxidant enzyme including SOD, GPx- 1 / 2, and HO- 1 by binding to antioxidant response element (ARE). Moreover, BHSST administration markedly reduced the expression of inflammatory proteins through mitogen-activated protein kinase- (MAPK-) related signaling pathways and decreased significantly the protein expressions of inflammatory mediators and cytokines by inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation. Taken together, these results support the fact that BHSST administration can suppress the development of esophageal mucosal ulcer via regulating inflammation through the activation of the antioxidant pathway...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was focused to assess the {{physiological}} behavior and antioxidant responses of the medicinal plant Lepidium sativum L. (commonly called Garden cress) subjected hydroponically to NaCl stress during its vegetative growth stage. The {{results showed that the}} addition of NaCl to growth medium significantly reduced plant growth. The magnitude of the response was also linked to the plant organ considered and NaCl concentration supplemented to the medium. Tissue hydration seemed unaffected by salinity. Reduction in dry weight (DW) production was associated with a high accumulation of Na+ and Cl- and a significant reduction of K+ content in shoots. The accumulation of osmoregulatory compounds (proline and total sugars) in shoots and roots was greatly increased by NaCl. Activity <b>staining</b> of <b>antioxidants</b> after a native polyacrylamide gel electrophores (PAGE) showed four superoxide dismutase (SOD) isozymes in the extract of leaf-soluble proteins (one Mn-SOD, two Fe-SODs, and one CuZn-SOD), and three isoforms in roots (Mn-SOD, Fe-SOD, and CuZn-SOD). Four peroxidase (POD) isozymes in the roots and only one isozyme in the leaves were detected. The work demonstrated that activities of antioxidant defense enzymes changed in parallel with the increased salinity. In summary, these findings proved that L. sativum can be classified as a moderately tolerant plant to salinity. © 2013 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the comparative evaluation of pharmacological efficacy between sulfasalazine alone and sulfasalazine in combination with herbal medicine on dextran sodium sulfate- (DSS-) induced UC in mice. Balb/c mice received 5 % DSS in drinking water for 7 days to induce colitis. Animals were divided into five groups (n= 9) : Group I (normal group), Group II (DSS control group), Group III (DSS + sulfasalazine (30 [*]mg/kg)), Group IV (DSS + sulfasalazine (60 [*]mg/kg)), and Group V (DSS + sulfasalazine (30 [*]mg/kg) + Cinnamomi Cortex and Bupleuri Radix mixture (30 [*]mg/kg) (SCB)). Colonic pathological changes were analyzed using hematoxyline/eosin <b>staining.</b> The <b>antioxidant,</b> inflammatory, and apoptotic protein levels were determined using western blotting. SCB supplementation, as well as sulfasalazine, suppressed colonic length and mucosal inflammatory infiltration. In addition, SCB treatment significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory signaling molecules through suppression of both mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways and prevented the apoptosis of the colon. Moreover, SCB administration significantly led to the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes including SOD and catalase. Taken together, SCB treatment might offer a better treatment for human UC than sulfasalazine alone or may be useful as an alternative therapeutic strategy against UC, without any evidence of side effects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Pioglitazone was {{reported}} to improve hepatic steatosis and necroinflammation in human studies. To investigate whether the hepato-protective effect of pioglitazone was associated with an improvement of antioxidant defense mechanism, oxidative DNA damage and repair activity were determined in a high fat diet model. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were respectively fed with a 30 % fat diet, the same diet with pioglitazone 100 mg/kg/day, or a chow diet as control for 8 weeks. Tissue oxidative stress was indicated by malondialdehyde concentration. Oxidative DNA damage was detected by immunohistochemical 8 -oxoG <b>staining.</b> Enzymatic <b>antioxidant</b> defense was detected by the real-time PCR of superoxide dismutase (Sod 1, Sod 2) and DNA glycosylase (Ogg 1, MutY). Oxidative DNA repair was detected by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting of OGG 1 expression. Results Our results show that hepatic steatosis was induced by a high-fat diet and improved by adding pioglitazone. Malondialdehyde concentration and 8 -oxoG staining were strongly increased in the high-fat diet group, but attenuated by pioglitazone. Gene expressions of antioxidant defense mechanism: Sod 1, Sod 2, Ogg 1 and MutY significantly decreased in the high-fat diet group but reversed by pioglitazone co-administration. Conclusion The attenuation of hepatic oxidative DNA damage by pioglitazone in a high-fat diet may be mediated by up-regulation of the antioxidant defense mechanism and oxidative DNA repair activity. The diminution of oxidative damage may explain the clinical benefit of pioglitazone treatment in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. </p...|$|R

The antioxidant ascorbic acid was administered 3 times at a dosage: 150 mg/kg/day to experimenttal groups 3 days before targeted radiation by a unique Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP). Histological <b>staining</b> indicated that <b>antioxidant</b> treated mice had less severe bone marrow damage 1 week after irradiation with substantial marrow cellular recovery 4 weeks later.

40|$|Canines {{are known}} for their natural {{development}} of age-related neuropathological brain lesions, such as beta amyloid deposits as senile plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and lipofuscin. Presence of these features in combination with cognitive decline and behavioral alterations is considered canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD). Studies have provided evidence of the beneficial effect of an antioxidant fortified diet in CCD patients and have connected these effects to reduced brain pathology. CCD in dogs shares similarities with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in humans, such as beta amyloid and tau pathology. The canine has therefore been suggested as a possibly promising animal model of AD. In scientific research devoted to AD, ApoE has suggested to be an important apolipoprotein in the disease pathology. Aims of the present investigation were to expand the knowledge of CCD and to support the view of the dog as a valuable animal model of AD. First, by studying the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT’s). NFT’s and dense content containing plaques have not been consistently demonstrated in the dog. Second, by exploring the ApoE 4 immunoreactivity in dogs. From a veterinary standpoint, this study focuses on the possible correlation between the quantity of ApoE 4 <b>staining</b> and <b>antioxidant</b> dietary treatment. Therefore 11 of the 12 canines available for immunohistochemistry were divided into 3 groups. One group containing old demented dogs, the second group housed the old demented dogs with dietary treatment and the third group consisted of the control dogs. Histopathological evaluation of NFT’s with the Bodian silver staining method resulted in the finding of tangles in four of the six demented dogs. Immunoreactivity of canine ApoE 4 with human antibodies was found in all of the nine elderly dogs. A trend for lower ApoE 4 quantities was demonstrated, with evident differences between the ApoE 4 amount in the groups old demented and non-demented old control dogs.

40|$|ABSTRACT Citrus plants {{grown in}} the Mediterranean area are {{currently}} facing biotic stress, and abiotic stress such as soil salinity. In order to cope with such a stress and improve fruit quality, citrus varieties are grafted on rootstocks with different tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Salinity stress is an increasing environmental problem for crop production worldwide. Citrus {{is one of the}} most important fruit crops globally and is considered as being salt sensitive. In this work, the leaf proteome expressed during moderate salt stress in the leaves and roots of citrus rootstocks showing different salt tolerance were studied. Protein changes in both control and salt-treated leaves and roots were revealed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE), coupled with mass spectrometry and data base search. About 900 spots were reproducibly detected in each gel for treated leaves. Twenty-five spots changed their expression level after salinity stress in the leaves of salt stressed citrus plants and were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The majority of these proteins were related to photosynthesis (25 %), energy production (16 %), and defense activity (25 %). The potential roles of these salt responsive proteins are discussed. Moreover, salt stress negatively affects many physiological processes in plants. Some of these effects may involve the oxidative damage of cellular components, which can be promoted by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prevented by antioxidants. In this study, using optimized protocols for in-gel activity staining on native PAGE, the isozyme pattern of two antioxidant enzymes, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), is characterized in the salt-treated leaves of citrus rootstocks showing different tolerance to salt stress. Diploid and tetraploid clones are used, because it seems that tetraploidy is to be a factor improving abiotic stress. Furthermore identification of Fe-SOD, after two dimensional native gel electrophoresis on immobilized gradient IPG strip and LC- MS/MS, is also reported. Data show involvement of APX in the response mechanisms to salt stress in citrus leaves. This study reports the isozyme patterns using in-gel activity staining of SOD and APX and their involvement in salt stress response in citrus. Twenty-five proteins were differentially expressed by 50 mM Na Cl exposure for three weeks in two different citrus rootstocks, the salt-tolerant C. reshni and the salt-sensitive Carrizo citrange. According to the biological processes in which the protein participates, the majority of identified proteins were correlated with oxidative stress (32 %), metabolic processes (16 %) and ATP synthesis (8 %) and 16 % of proteins have unknown function. To characterize differentially expressed proteins in Citrus clementina leaves after infestation by the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a proteome comparison was carried out using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Different expression of mite responsive proteins were compared to expression pattern under MeJA treatment. MeJA is a compound recognized as playing a dominant role in promoting plant defense/response to many arthropod herbivores. Significant variations were observed for 110 protein spots after spider mite infestation and 67 protein spots after MeJA treatments. Of these, 50 proteins were successfully identified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry–tandem mass spectrometry. Most proteins of the differentially expressed proteins were involves in photosynthesis and metabolism pathway. Five were oxidative stress associated enzymes, including phospholipid glutathione peroxidase, a salt stressed associated protein, ascorbate peroxidase and Mn-superoxide dismutase. Defence-related proteins were seven such as the pathogenesis-related acidic chitinase, the protease inhibitor miraculin-like protein, and a lectin-like protein. In particular, analysis have been show the defence-related acidic chitinase II to be specifically induced in Citrus clementina leaves infested by the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae or treated with MeJA. Chitinases are considered pathogenesis-related proteins involved in viral infections, fungal and bacterial cell wall components, and also by more general sources of stress such as wounding, salicylic acid, ethylene, auxins and cytokinins. In the present study, changes in the mRNA profiles of two partially homologous chitinase forms were shown by RT-PCR. In particular, the appearance of an additional cDNA chitinase fragment in T. urticae-infested and MeJA-treated leaves was observed. This finding may indicate a specific regulatory mechanism of chitinase expression. Results report evidence for alternative splicing in T. urticae-infested C. clementina, where a premature stop codon after the first 135 amino acids was introduced. We observed inducible chitinase activity after MeJA treatment, indicative of a rapid plant response to infestation. Finally a protocol of in-gel activity <b>staining</b> of <b>antioxidant</b> enzyme was optimized for bidimensional gel electrophoresis. The use of this approach allowed to identify a Fe-SOD from activity-stained gel, by mass spectrometry.
