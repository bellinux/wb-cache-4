This is an FAO-sponsored pilot project. A major objective of the project is to focus on groups of the rural poor by organizing them to participate in rural development to improve their lives and achieve self-reliance. Rushinga District in Mashonaland Central Province was chosen as the project area. The district provides a balance between a poor area, which has hitherto been neglected and an area with good road connections with Harare that permit the access necessary for a pilot project to fulfil its demonstration function. 1 In January 1986 the Zimbabwe Institute of Development Studies was selected as the national consultants to carry out a series of studies pertaining to the project.

40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} October, 1984 It {{is widely}} acknowledged that self-help procedures produce housing (Harms, 1982), {{but there are}} differing perspectives on the contexts and motives leading {{to the emergence of}} the self-help housing phenomenon; and the significance of self-help housing action {{in the lives of the}} actors themselves (Martin, 1984). The first issue has been the focus of sustained debate elsewhere (Burgess, 1978; 1982; Harms, 1976; 1982; Lea, 1979; Turner, 1978; 1982), but the second has remained largely the domain of the supporters of self-help housing strategies. This discussion is a first attempt at focusing critical scrutiny on the impact of self-help housing among those who are most intimately involved in it, the self-help homebuilders. This is not a clear-cut task, because the existing self-help literature provides few leads. The bulk of critical work focusing on self-help is a response to the glowing descriptions of self-help enterprise that emerged from the pens of fieldworkers in the squatter settlements of Latin America (Burgess, 1978). Most of this criticism places the self-help squatter phenomenon within a class-based framework of domination and subjection. Here, the group is the unit of analysis, and self-help action is seen to be the collective response to structural poverty. We find this analysis useful, but somewhat unsatisfactory in the context of our own research. Firstly, having worked among self-help homebuilders, it is apparent, to us that self help means different thing to different people. Whatever the overarching principle behind the emergence of self help, it is clear that every <b>self-help</b> <b>scheme</b> incorporates winners and losers, opportunists and unwilling co-optees, developers and survivors (Martin, 1984). Secondly, self-help housing and squatting are by no means synonymous in South Africa. Around South African cities, controlled, state-sanctioned self-help has emerged in the wake of ailing mass housing schemes. Self-helpers in this situation are not squatters, but may be relocatees, refugees from chronic overcrowding elsewhere, or even speculators keen to grab new residential possibilities. All enter the self-help arena with different chances of making out, some determined by entry, and others by contextual and personal factors beyond this...|$|E

Using survey data for Dhaka, Bangladesh, where some neighborhoods have successfully organized {{an alternative to the}} municipal trash collection service, they examine why some communities or neighborhoods display such initiative, while others do not. Their results show that social capital - trust, reciprocity, and sharing - is an important determinant of whether alternative systems arise in Dhaka. More generally, public-private partnerships, or <b>self-help</b> <b>schemes</b> appear more likely to succeed in neighborhoods high in social capital. Other measures of homogeneity of interests are also important. So, interestingly, is the nature of associational activity. Finally, education levels are strongly, and robustly associated with the existence of collective action for trash disposal. How can policymakers encourage such activity?

40|$|The {{planning}} of housing for informal settlements and squatter camps In South Africa approximately 7 {{million people live}} in informal settlements and squatter camps. Constitutional provisions and moral considerations necessitate the urgent involvement of different segments of society to alleviate the plight of this hapless part of the South African population.

However, historians concede that such firms were untypical, as most businesses disappeared leaving liftle trace. Even so, all too little consideration {{has been given to}} the source material that is available, especially to assess the ability of partnerships to generate company finance, whilst aspects of the demand for capital that arose from urbanisation and transport development also remains under-researched. Concentrating on textile Lancashire, this thesis researches lesser-known entrepreneurs between 1770 and 1850 from little-used primary material, studying partnerships as important suppliers of capital. This original approach demonstrates the growing importance of partnerships, particularly amongst non-family firms, exploring the sources of funding they tapped, and comparing share allocations they made. Consideration is also given to investments partnerships made in establishing related enterprises and how they coped with capital withdrawal on a partner's retirement. Investment in Lancashire's infrastructure is analysed partly in relation to the construction and improvement of turnpike roads, matters of considerable importance to manufacturers in transporting products and raw materials and which required high levels of financing. It examines the levels of finance needed for improvements, the sources from which it was drawn, and the role of businessmen in financial management of turnpike trusts. Infrastructural development is also addressed in relation to the construction of the numerous handloom weavers' cottages that were built by terminating building societies. Identifying the membership of these societies reveals that they were not <b>self-help</b> <b>schemes</b> for artisans, but rather that they offered opportunities for those with surplus income to invest in tenanted properties {{at a time when the}} skills of the handloom weaver were at a premium. This provision was vital to Lancashire's burgeoning economy, and offered subscribers an additional source of income. In drawing together the threads of the discussion, new insights are presented to show that the kinds of associations open to them provided a range of investment opportunities for people at different levels of society, who can all be regarded as members of Lancashire's investing classes...|$|R

Based on data gathered from 263 face-to-face interviews we examine the financial sustainability of the underlying mortgage system and aim to identify the main drivers of mortgage default through multivariate logit analysis. Our statistical results indicate that it is mainly endogenous variables like the size and the age of the program which drive mortgage default. At the same time, typical poverty variables are not significantly correlated with mal-performance in mortgage repayment and therefore increased targeting of poorer population groups is unlikely to result in declining repayment rates...|$|R

40|$|As farm sizes decline due to {{population}} {{pressure in the}} central highlands, smallholder farmers {{find it difficult to}} intensify dairying due to competition for resources by alternative crop and other enterprise. However, very little is known the nature of trade-offs the smallholder farmers experience in making decisions about the alternative choices of enterprises and synergy levels available for smallholder farmers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop and evaluate a framework for guiding choices on alternative agricultural enterprises and enterprise mixes in order to enable farmers to make more informed intensification strategies under varying market access and resource availability. The mathematical model of the decision problem is formulated in terms of multi-objective programming. It is shown that crops are not likely to replace dairy income, at least in the near term, as farm sizes decline if market access for dairy enterprise is assured. The findings indicate various strategies for smallholder farmers with small land holdings such as land-augmenting (off-farm feed resources, more intensive cropping and dairy enterprises, and continuous as well as mixed cropping). Smallholder farmers with larger land holding can engage in more labour intensive and profitable dairy production technologies. Secondly, profitable crop enterprises, especially in relatively large holdings, and relatively small amounts of labour allocated to fodder production seemed to be critical factors associated with low dairy productivity.

40|$|Abstract: Globally, housing {{provision}} {{has always}} been a mammoth task for all spheres governments; whether national, provincial or local as they struggle to meet the ever soaring demand. The situation has however been grimmer in African, Asian and South American continents that lack mostly financial resources and advanced low cost technologies. The majority of the urban poor have perpetually been excluded from most land and housing projects, that religiously follow the traditional planning-servicing-building-occupation (PSBO) frameworks. Most often than not, rigidities in housing development sequences condemn and compel the urban poor to rely on the occupation-building-planning-servicing (OBPS) frameworks that give informal settlements as outcomes. This paper discusses an innovative and less costly housing development framework, the planning-occupation-building-servicing (POBS) sequence that was adopted by the Zimbabwean government in almost all the urban centres of the country in 2005, just after Operation Murambatsvina. The data were gathered through interviews with key informants and housing plots allottees. Observations and photographic surveys of the housing structures and community infrastructure services that have so far been developed incrementally were also conducted. The findings revealed that the allocating unserviced but formally planned and surveyed housing sites to the urban poor considerably improves targeting of the urban poor and makes housing more affordable. Such schemes not only contribute to housing supply by providing orderly and standard houses but also assist in eliminating or massively reducing down-raiding of aided <b>self-help</b> housing <b>schemes</b> by the middle and high income people. The paper concludes by observing the critical need for governments of developing countries to innovatively solve housing problems of the urban poor by adjusting the currently rigid housing infrastructure provision sequences and to make them affordable and flexible...|$|R
30|$|State {{provision}} of housing deteriorated {{when the state}} embarked on economic liberalization in the 1990 s in the program that was called the Economic Structural Adjustment Program (1991 – 1995). This has had {{a negative effect on}} the production of low-income housing in the urban centers. This development propelled low-income earners to pursue <b>self-help</b> housing <b>schemes.</b> There is always inherent politics of rural-land incorporation into urban; rural local authorities are not always willing to ‘let go’ their land. The process is also highly bureaucratic and cumbersome. Before the ‘nationalization’ of land with the fast-track land reform program of 2000, urban land incorporation involved serious dialoguing between the peri-urban farm owners who were not always willing to let go their land. Within the government, the process of negotiating for gazzetting of the land involved (and still involves) the different government ministries namely the ministry of land, the ministry of justice and the ministry of local government. These ministries always have different mandates, which tend to collide making the process clumsy and heavy. Meanwhile the pressure for housing land will be mounting and the housing backlog ballooning. Another handicap with the fast-track land reform program was its unpopularity with the western world, which predominantly had been the major donor in housing development. The international community blacklisted Zimbabwe and imposed sanctions on its leadership. The country also pulled out of the Commonwealth. These developments had negative bearings on the country’s access to critical resources. Economic doldrums that characterized the nation starting from 1997 and reaching climax in 2008 further exacerbated the situation. Such a situation continued until the setting up of the Government of National Unity (GNU) between the three major political parties ZANU-PF, MDC-T and MDC-M in 2009. The GNU lasted 4  years (March 2009 to July 2013) when ZANU PF won with the majority and reset itself as the ruling party again. The period of the GNU while characterized by stabilization of the economy, did not bring much to housing development given the constant bickering between the political parties of the matters of constitution making, elections and indigenization of the economy.|$|R
40|$|Dr Ekei U Etim is a Research Officer {{with the}} Council for World Mission. Apart from {{her work as}} a {{part-time}} Lecturer at the University of London she belongs to organizations such as the Institute for African Alternative, Akina Mama Wa Afrika and the Royal African Society. By 1991 Africa's foreign debt had reached US$ 280 billion - almost double its 1980 level and equivalent to over 90 % of the region's GDP. In servicing this debt African countries paid out US$ 23 billion in 1990, which was equivalent to 30 % of export receipts. Since these countries are highly dependent on imports for much of the resources they need for development, servicing the debt has directly taken away money needed for education, housing and health care services. Since 1981, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been the sole policeman of Third World debt. The result is that more than 33 African governments have implemented its Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs). A phenomenon which has emerged from this IMF role is that international commercial institutions are imposing similar conditionality with respect to the commercial loans that they make to Third World countries. In Africa spending on health care has declined by 50 % and on education by 25 % over the last decade. The deterioration of such services affects women, both as consumers of such services and indirectly, since it usually falls on female members of the households to compensate for changes in the provision of public services. Women often need greater access to health care services than do men, because of childbearing and their traditional role in child care. Women have had to bear the brunt of crumbling services at a time when debt-driven demands on them as producers have increased. SAPs have had negative effects on the quality and availability of education. A UNICEF Study, Adjustment with a human face, shows that reduction in public spending on primary education tends to affect adversely girls more than boys. For example, as school fees increase or schools close down, families often choose to invest more in their son's education than their daughter's. Furthermore, the increased domestic workload during hard times may fall more heavily on female children. Austerity measures have resulted in redundancies and women, whether single or married, are usually the first to lose their jobs. In most cases women are busy satisfying the needs of all members of their families to the extent that everyone takes this for granted and they forget that the women in question have needs too. As family incomes decline and prices increase, women must work harder outside the home. In some cases the pressure on debtor countries to expand their export production has increased the number of jobs available to women, but under extremely exploitative conditions. The crisis affects rural women differently than it does men. The debt-driven emphasis on cash crops has added to women's labour burden without increasing their incomes. Where jobs are difficult to come by, women are struggling to make ends meet by producing food and handicrafts to sell in the markets. This trend is part of the growing informal sector which has developed to respond to the economic crises. In Zimbabwe, most women have already started to feel the pinch of SAPs introduced in January 1991. Their daily incomes are failing to meet the 26. 5 % inflation rate. Moreover the women do not have a steady income to rely on. Vegetable markets, where onions, tomatoes and single cigarettes are sold, have sprouted at street corners and even in residential areas. Other women are now selling cooked foods in cooperatives. Women are responding with inventiveness and energy to the challenges of the economic crisis with the establishment of <b>self-help</b> <b>schemes</b> and cooperatives. Individual efforts of people like Professor Wangari Maathai in establishing the Green Belt Movement in Kenya and Dr Maryam Babangida, wife of the President of Nigeria, in establishing the Better Life for Rural Women Programme, are notable. Then there are many non-governmental agencies who have programmes to enhance women's participation in development. As a complement to individual and collective self-help efforts, women are joining forces to document the impact of the debt crisis on them through research, advocacy and popular education. The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the Institute for African Alternative (London) and the Association of African Women for Research and Development (AAWORD) are just three examples of organizations working for women's perspectives to promote alternative approaches to current debt and development policies which undermine the situation of poor women. Governments have to work towards the reduction of exploitation and burden on women.

40|$|This Project Report {{is about}} housing co-operatives in Tanzania. The {{case study of}} the project has been taken at Magohe Housing Co-operative Society. In this report the {{researcher}} has found that, there are housing co-operatives geared to reduce the problem of shortage of shelter through self-help organized approaches in Dar es Salaam City but they are all running their societies without proper guidance and project proposals. It is from this background that the researcher decided to work together with MHCS to lay proper procedures on how to run and make a follow-up of its activities. The author, in collaboration with MHCS members, managed to make a follow-up on land acquisition from buying a raw land, planning, surveying up to request of title at the MLHSD, which is under preparation. Further to that, the Project Proposal was prepared {{to be used for}} MHCS housing project implementation. This Project Report is arranged in six Chapters. The first Chapter deals with the background of MHCS. The second Chapter is a literature review on housing co-operative societies. The third Chapter is dealing with research methodologies used in carrying out the survey, data analysis and presentation. The fourth Chapter is about analysis of the case study area. In the fifth Chapter the author gives recommendations and conclusions, which flash the light on how a Self-help Housing Co-operative process could be a right doze in provision of shelter to most of lower income earners in Tanzania. The sixth Chapter is a prepared Project Proposal for the <b>Self-help</b> Co-operative Housing <b>Scheme</b> to be used for implementation of the MHCS Housing Project.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} into poverty coping strategies of microfinance and its social performance in crisis environments using empirical evidence from Zimbabwe. Microfinance has close association with informal microcredit, mainly <b>self-help</b> <b>schemes</b> and Government led rural agricultural credit, {{which was based on}} the idea of lending for the poor up to the 1960 s through to the early 1970 s. Whilst informal microcredit was viewed to be a success on many forms for some decades, it was clear that tailor-made changes were needed to respond specifically to the poor’s financial needs and help them fight poverty. Thus, it was seen as necessary to experiment on an institution based/formal financial service sector for the poor in the late 1970 s through to the 1990 s, which could perhaps tackle poverty reduction more systematically and effectively. In this, microcredit transformed into microfinance having incorporated more financial services on offer in addition to credit and was regarded as the new step forward and backed by several development agencies including the United Nations. In fact, microfinance was hailed as the most innovative poverty alleviation tool, able to deal with poverty whilst at the same time generating sufficient extra income to cover operating costs. Over four decades on since its inception, the microfinance sector has grown tremendously but, as is commonly acknowledged, the shackles of global poverty are just as visible as ever and in some cases are even stronger. This study critically explores and analyses the state of the microfinance sector in Zimbabwe following a recent political, economic and social crisis characterised by hyperinflation reaching six figure digits, which led to a revamp of the microfinance sector in 2009. The findings this study reflect a systematic departure of the original hopes and ideals of microfinance as a poverty-reduction centred programming to that of a profit-led business approach and {{the emergence of a new}} breed of microfinance institutions (MFIs). In this new world of “microfinance”, very poor social performance causing distressful situations for borrowers where in certain instances have been known to take their own lives (as In India) due to debt pressures has been witnessed. Ironically, also visible are the microfinance millionaires and successful MFI banks floating on the stock. Not surprisingly, as a result, microfinance has attracted a lot of public scrutiny particularly among academics and policy makers with its credibility as a poverty alleviation tool being seriously questioned. Consequently, both the supporters of microfinance wanting to prove that microfinance reduces poverty as well as the critics of microfinance wishing to discredit those results have carried out several randomised-control trials (RCT) impact studies. In some cases previous studies that had claimed that microfinance reduces poverty were revisited by opposing academics in an effort to refute findings. However, both supporters and critics each found just as much evidence for both positive impact in reducing poverty in some places as well as the negative impact on poverty elsewhere. Neither side could be conclusive about whether microfinance actually does help to reduce poverty. As discussed in the literature review, this resulted in a surge in the number of available studies on the subject of microfinance impact, prompting even more systematic reviews of such studies in an attempt to reconcile the critical question of the role of microfinance in poverty reduction. As before, the systematic reviews also confirmed just as much evidence in favour of microfinance positive impacts on poverty as those against in the negative impacts, thereby failing yet again to provide conclusive evidence on either side of the argument. Such arguments suggest that microfinance delivered in a certain way and under certain conditions can help reduce poverty, but may equally have little effect at all on poverty or can even worsen the poverty situation of individuals when delivered under certain conditions and in a certain way. To the best of my knowledge, no known previous studies have attempted to associate the model of microfinance delivery and conditions to ascertain whether different forms of microfinance operations can produce different impact on poverty even where conditions are similar in order to inform best practice for social performance and help poor individuals to cope with high income-risks. High income-risk is part of life for most people in Zimbabwe as in other developing countries. Zimbabwe was affected by frequent droughts, political turmoil, extreme economic challenges due to sanctions and questionable economic policies between 2000 and 2008, and finally the global financial crisis of 2007 / 8, creating extraordinarily harsh operating environment for microfinance institutions, characterised by depleted loan portfolio investment, skyrocketing inflation eroding the loan book value and growing default rates. The country’s GDP declined by about 40 percent during the period. Hyperinflation in 2007 - 2008 peaked at 500 billion percent leading to the collapse of the national currency in February 2009. The Zimbabwean dollar disappeared from circulation in instant literarily forcing MFIs and other financial institutions to freeze all balances in their books which was in local currency and raise new capital in the US dollar and South African Rand. The political and economic challenges negatively affected the Zimbabwean microfinance “industry,” causing the sector to suffer significantly. Both the number of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in the country and the quality and range of services were eroded. Capital, social performance, and viability concerns plagued the microfinance sector forcing the government to introduce sector specific regulation with immediate minimum capital requirement for MFIs resulting in small institutions leaving the market, increasing monopoly by large institutions. Within this uncertainty of the role and effectiveness of microfinance in poverty reduction, and the difficult political and economic circumstances that Zimbabweans have experienced recently, this study looked at the coping strategies of microfinance stakeholders including practitioners and regulators. It employed an exploratory inductive approach using mixed methods methodology. This included a survey questionnaire using both closed and open-ended questions randomly administered to 60 registered microfinance clients and potential clients collecting both qualitative and quantitative data. In addition, comprehensive case assessments were carried out on 3 MFIs. The assessments concluded that there exist two different approaches to microfinance: (1) the Capital Market Driven (CMD) approach characterised by private equity investments and (2) the Poverty Reduction Driven (PRD) approach characterised by emphasis on poverty alleviation and social performance. This thesis argues that the two approaches may have very different impact on poverty. Therefore, a clear distinction between the CMD and PRD are necessary in debates about microfinance impact, whether positive or negative...|$|R
