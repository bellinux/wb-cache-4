But there is only little knowledge of firms' perspective on this issue. This paper contributes to decrease this research gap with results on base of representative data from the German Job Vacancy Survey for the years 2004 until 2008 with up to 9000 participating firms yearly. It is the goal of this paper, to characterize and structure firms that use social networks in <b>staffing</b> <b>processes,</b> using information not only about the firm itself, but also about the position that has been filled. The results show a tendency that networks help to reduce search costs and are especially useful in difficult economic situations.

5000|$|GEN Byrnes (CG TRADOC) back in November 2003 {{determined}} the Army needed a single name to represent all tactical networks, both current and future. His assessment {{was based on}} the numerous questions asked of him at the JFCOM Component Commanders Conference (senior generals and admirals forum) during a discussion on Army networks. The task of finding the right name was given to the Battle Command and Awareness Division (BCAD) within TRADOC's Futures Center Directorate. There were numerous suggestions in the <b>staffing</b> <b>process,</b> but the name [...] "LandWarNet" [...] stood out. The name was inspired by the JTF WARNET Program under the Extending the Littoral Battlespace (ELB) Advanced Concept Technology Development (ACTD) at that time. From Nov 03 to Jan 04, the name [...] "LandWarNet" [...] initially represented all current and future tactical networks. The name caught on within a relatively short time with the other services and DoD during the Joint Battle Management Command and Control (JBMC2) document review process. In Feb 2004, the CIO/G6 for the Army incorporated the name to represent all current and future Army networks. The name had greater appeal and [...] "traction" [...] in military circles and at the Congressional level than the previous name for the Army network i.e. the Army Knowledge Enterprise (AKE).|$|E

40|$|Identifying and {{acquiring}} {{talent is}} one of the most important processes in human resource management. It is a key element in being competitive in a knowledge driven, talent constrained economy. In addition, it is often the first contact that potential employees have with the organization, so it can be the basis for the entire employment relationship. Increasingly, organizations recognize that a professionally excellent <b>staffing</b> <b>process</b> can be a source of competitive advantage. Moreover, the emergence of fundamentally new information technologies and communication processes – such as the Internet, virtual job fairs, online testing, and global job boards – increase the opportunities and the risks associated with <b>staffing</b> <b>process</b> management. Unfortunately, existing <b>staffing</b> <b>process</b> measurement systems typically fail to provide the information necessary to understand, evaluate and make rational decisions about investments in the staffing system, and fail to support decisions about staffing by HR professionals, line managers, applicants and employees. As a result, organizations often base decisions about their staffing systems solely on information about the volume of applicants or new hires, or the costs and time involved in staffing activities. This leads to potentially disastrous decisions, and opens the door for competitors. In this article, we propose a framework for a staffing measurement system that truly supports professional excellence, partnership and optimal investment decisions...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} on {{characteristics}} employers considered when selecting employees’. By studying the characteristics {{used in the}} <b>staﬃng</b> <b>process,</b> this thesis contributes to the sociological and economic debate on inequality and stratiﬁcation as results of job allocation and employer selection. Research shows that employers consider multiple characteristics during the <b>staﬃng</b> <b>process.</b> Examining individual characteristics (e. g., qualiﬁcations, which are {{the primary focus of}} the inequality and stratiﬁcation literature) is insuﬃcient for explaining the diﬀerences related to who obtains prestigious jobs (e. g., managerial jobs) and thus is insuﬃcient to explain diﬀerences in job allocation, inequality and stratiﬁcation. The characteristics frequently debated in the economic and sociological literature, such as educational qualiﬁcations, ﬁeld of study, social, cognitive and technical skills, personality, and eﬀort, constitute the main characteristics studied in this thesis. The thesis contributes seven points of progress to the debate on job allocation and stratiﬁcation {{in the context of the}} theoretical mechanism outlined in this monograph. The argument that the mechanisms explain a macro-level phenomenon brings into question the existence of the phenomena that purportedly underlie the macro explanations. The results in this thesis indicate a model with mixed mechanisms. The points of progress are organised around the use of characteristics and tools (the use of qualiﬁcations, cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics, and multiple characteristics and selection tools during the selection) and ﬁve mechanisms (a self-selecting, self-promoting, subjective, and organisational ﬁt in addition to the trainability mechanism) that complement and contradict the existing mechanisms...|$|E

At the recruitment stage, an employer’s goal is to “publicize the availability of openings to qualified applicants and assemble modest information about a pool of eligible persons” (Marsden 1994 b, 288).
