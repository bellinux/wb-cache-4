5|$|A {{road from}} the town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate border {{crossing}} originally opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County board of supervisors proposed moving rerouting the road to be <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> on more level ground, although there was opposition from local residents and businesses who favored the old road. However, the route of the road to Tecate has remained the same since then.|$|E
5|$|A wait {{of three}} years {{occurred}} between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get <b>shorter,</b> <b>and</b> mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation process can be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the romantic}} period, typified by Sylves (1927) and Volumes (1928), Rabearivelo's poems are <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> reflect a purer form of {{traditional}} models. He identified {{himself and his}} work as post-symbolist {{in the early part}} of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo's works from this period, editor Jacques Rabemananjara acknowledged the poet's evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self-expression.|$|E

He drew on {{rhythm and blues}} influences from {{early in his career}} for Of Human Feelings, which had <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> more distinct compositions than Dancing in Your Head. Coleman also applied free jazz principles from his music during the 1960s to elements of funk.|$|E

5|$|Pluteus aurantiorugosus is {{very similar}} to P.nevadensis in {{external}} appearance, and the two can only be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence.

P.aurantiorugosus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.|$|E
5|$|<b>Shorter</b> <b>and</b> quicker {{routes to}} the top of Helvellyn, though with less {{attractive}} scenery, begin from several points along the A591 road along {{the west side of the}} mountain.

5|$|The English and Danish editions {{differed}} in several significant ways. The English edition was somewhat <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> more concise, and included newer information that Heilmann had acquired {{by studying the}} actual fossils of Archaeopteryx in Berlin, {{as well as from}} foreign scientists who sent him photographs and plaster casts. It also contained considerably less harsh language towards Boas and others with whom he disagreed. Curiously, the English edition did not contain the transformational sequences inspired by D'Arcy Thompson, though Heilmann still briefly acknowledged the use of his methods in reconstructing his Proavis.|$|E

5|$|The {{depth and}} {{duration}} of each stop is calculated to reduce the inert gas excess in the most critical tissues to a concentration which will allow further ascent without unacceptable risk. Consequently, {{if there is not}} much dissolved gas, the stops will be <b>shorter</b> <b>and</b> shallower than if there is a high concentration. The length of the stops is also strongly influenced by which tissue compartments are assessed as highly saturated. High concentrations in slow tissues will indicate longer stops than similar concentrations in fast tissues.|$|E
