5|$|Classic {{genome-wide}} {{linkage analysis}} has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis.

Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis. Genome-wide association scans have identified other genes that are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.|$|E
