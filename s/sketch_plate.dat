60|$|Before {{explaining}} how atoll-formed reefs acquire their peculiar structure, we must {{turn to the}} second great class, namely, Barrier-reefs. These either extend in straight lines {{in front of the}} shores of a continent or of a large island, or they encircle smaller islands; in both cases, being separated from the land by a broad and rather deep channel of water, analogous to the lagoon within an atoll. It is remarkable how little {{attention has been paid to}} encircling barrier-reefs; yet they are truly wonderful structures. The <b>sketch</b> (<b>Plate</b> 94) represents part of the barrier encircling the island of Bolabola in the Pacific, as seen from one of the central peaks. In this instance the whole line of reef has been converted into land; but usually a snow-white line of great breakers, with only here and there a single low islet crowned with cocoa-nut trees, divides the dark heaving waters of the ocean from the light green expanse of the lagoon-channel. And the quiet waters of this channel generally bathe a fringe of low alluvial soil, loaded with the most beautiful productions of the tropics, and lying at the foot of the wild, abrupt, central mountains.|$|E

40|$|Laclos never {{commissioned}} illustrations for Les Liaisons dangereuses (1782). Nevertheless, a set {{of prints}} destined to be framed and four series of illustrations to accompany editions of the book came out during his lifetime. The artists – not all of whom can be identified – vary {{in the choice of}} scenes they represent. There are also two allegorical frontispieces which show that the text can be interpreted as a tragic moral tale. The engravings range from the libertine to the demure, from crudely <b>sketched</b> small <b>plates</b> to exquisitely delineated large prints.

50|$|Lemoine {{was born}} in Rouen. He {{declined}} to follow his father's precedent in becoming a notary, and instead began study at the École des Beaux-Arts in Rouen. Having moved to Paris by 1772, he studied under Jean-Jacques Lagrenée (1737-1821) and Maurice-Quentin de la Tour (1704-1788). He was attracted to Parisian theater and music, and {{early in his career}} often portrayed actors, singers, and musicians, using pastels and chalk. He also worked in oil, watercolor, and porcelain. In the late 1770s or early 1780s, he may have <b>sketched</b> for fashion <b>plates.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1790 he {{published}} his Account of London, which {{went through a}} large number of editions. It was written in the style of his previous works and contained information on things of historical interest in the parts of the capital to which his wanderings led him. By this stage of his life he preferred to make tours in his imagination rather than in reality and {{he published}} a second edition of his Indian Zoology. He also conceived the idea of publishing a work on a global scale and set to work on the first two volumes of what was planned to be a fourteen volume series. Each country was to have maps and <b>sketches,</b> colour <b>plates</b> and an account of the country's production with notes on its natural history. All this was to be gleaned from the writing of others who had seen these places themselves. The first two volumes appeared early in 1798 and covered most of India and Ceylon. Volumes three and four included the parts of India east of the Ganges, Malaysia, Japan and China but before these were published he suffered a gradual decline in health and vigour and died at Downing, in December 1798. These two volumes were edited and published posthumously by his son, David, as were also several other short papers and an autobiographical work, The literary life of the late Thomas Pennant, Esq. By himself..|$|R
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} White sought to leave Harveys was {{that the size of}} the kitchen was {{insufficient}} to allow him to expand the range of techniques in the dishes he served. With the move to The Restaurant, he added dishes with techniques such as confit, braising and en vessie highlighted. The move also saw an expansion to the number of different options served; while Harveys may have had a handful of main courses, this was increased to around 15 or more at The Restaurant. White's concept for the food was simplified versions of classical French cuisine.White was in the habit of creating new dish concepts late at night, sometimes drawing <b>sketches</b> of the <b>plating</b> directly into the pages of French cookbooks he had picked up during the course of his career, or at other times selecting a protein and writing a long list of potential accompaniments.

40|$|International audienceUltra-slow {{spreading}} ridges {{such as the}} South West Indian ridge or the Arctic ridge {{system are}} oddities amongst oceanic ridges. Conversely to faster oceanic ridges, petrographic and seafloor {{studies have shown that}} they are characterized by low melt supply and present low crustal thicknesses and heat flow; these features are interpreted as an evidence for a cooler sublithospheric mantle. In cartoonish <b>sketches</b> of <b>plate</b> tectonics, ridges open above upwellings, subduction zones occur over downwellings, and plates are riding over the mantle convection cells. In this study, we designed a simple yet dynamically consistent thermal convection model to test the impact of farfield forces on spreading ridges and show that this pattern is disrupted by plate tectonics. In particular, continental collisions modulate the spreading rates because resisting forces build up at plate boundaries. As a consequence, this modifies the surface boundary conditions and therefore the underlying mantle flow. We show that the ideal convection cell pattern quickly breaks down when plate motion is impeded by continental collisions in the far field. Not only the decreasing spreading rates are diagnostic, but in the same time, (i) the heat flow is decreasing at the ridge, (ii) the thermal structure of the cooling lithosphere no longer matches the cooling half-space model, and (iii) the mantle temperature beneath the ridge drops by more than 100 degrees. We compare our model predictions to available observables and show that this simple mechanism explains the atypical thermo-mechanical evolution of the South West Indian ridge and Arctic ridge system. Last, the recent S wave seismic tomography model of Debayle and Ricard (2012) reveals that only away from those two ridges does lithospheric thickening departs from the half-space cooling model, in accord with our model predictions...|$|R

40|$|Most of the {{materials}} in this collection relate to Gondor's professional career as an illustrator, creator of puzzles, photographer, and writer, primarily from his years in the United States. He worked {{on a wide range}} of publications, including books of manners, literature, children's stories, comic books, magazines, and newspapers. The items include working materials such as individual printed pages, drafts, transparencies, <b>sketches,</b> printing <b>plates,</b> proofs, correspondence, and reproductions of sketches. The collection also contains many finished products, such as published books, journals, and comic books. Additional material about Gondor's work in Germany and Austria in the 1920 s and early 1930 s is found in AR 25085 (Papers of Emery and Bertalan Gondor). The collection also contains a variety of other materials related to Emery Gondor's professional life as an artist, such as correspondence and photographs of his artwork. The personal documents in this collection include some educational documents, journalist identification cards and Hungarian passports, and some of Gondor's military documents. Also included are two expertly illustrated autograph books from the 1940 s. The materials relating to Emery Gondor's brother, artist Bertalan Gondor, include correspondence from Bertalan to his wife Lilly in 1944. A small amount of original work is found here, including drawings in newspapers and a handwritten poem. Some vital documents and scholarly work about Bertalan are also included. Emerich I. Gondor was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1896. He attended the Royal Hungarian University and received his diploma from the National Academy of Art. As a young art teacher, he observed many children who had suffered during and after World War I and was inspired to learn more about their afflictions and the ways in which art could be used to help them. This prompted a lifelong interest in the field of psychology. In Budapest, the psychoanalyst, Sándor Ferenczi introduced Gondor to the subject of psychoanalysis and therapy. When Gondor moved to Vienna in 1920, to attend the Academy of Industrial Arts, he learned of Professor Csizeck's pioneering work in the field of progressive art education for children. He began working at the Viennese University Clinic, drawing and playing with emotionally disturbed children. From 1925 to 1926, Gondor attended seminars in Berlin and participated in the work of the Individual Psychological Association. He exhibited his own oil paintings during those years, lectured and worked as an illustrator for children's books and several newspapers. He was also named to the post of art director at Ullstein, Europe's largest publishing house. Gondor immigrated to the United States in 1935 and became a citizen in 1941. During World War II, he worked for the War Department and was Chief of the Technical Operation Unit in the Overseas Service for France and Germany for two years. This unit performed classified work in counter-espionage. Gondor was also an instructor at the training schools in New York, France and Germany, where he taught about the psychological problems of counter-espionage as well as wrote several classified manuals on the subject. After the war, Gondor was named head of the art and play therapy groups at the Retarded Children's Clinic and the Psychiatric Child Guidance Clinic at New York Medical College. In addition, he wrote and illustrated several books and taught art to juvenile delinquents at Youth House. In 1959, Gondor received his diploma in Clinical Psychology from New York State University. He became director of the art program at the Institute for Mental Retardation at New York Medical College in 1968. Emery Gondor died in 1977. Bertalan Gondor was Emery Gondor's brother. Bertalan was born in 1908 in Hungary. He studied art in Budapest and Vienna. After the Hungarian White Terror (1919 - 1920), he moved from Budapest to Vienna. Bertalan finally returned to Budapest once Austria was annexed in 1938. There he worked as an artist and an illustrator. During World War II, he was deported and conscripted into forced labor service in eastern Hungary. In March of 1944, Germany invaded Hungary and took control of the Hungarian ghettos and camps. Bertalan was then deported to Poland and placed in a camp called Harka. He died in March 1945 in Mauthausen Concentration Camp.
