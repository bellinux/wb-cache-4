According to Jain texts, this infinity of nigodas {{can also be found}} in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies. Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub–sub categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within samsara.|$|E

50|$|The {{material}} of a magnetic core (often made of iron or steel) {{is composed of}} small regions called magnetic domains that act like tiny magnets (see ferromagnetism). Before the current in the electromagnet is turned on, the domains in the iron core point in random directions, <b>so</b> their <b>tiny</b> magnetic fields cancel each other out, and the iron has no large scale magnetic field. When a current is passed through the wire wrapped around the iron, its magnetic field penetrates the iron, and causes the domains to turn, aligning parallel to the magnetic field, <b>so</b> their <b>tiny</b> magnetic fields add to the wire's field, creating a large magnetic field that extends into the space around the magnet. The effect of the core is to concentrate the field, and the magnetic field passes through the core more easily than it would pass through air.|$|R
25|$|As {{suggested}} by its specific epithet reclusa (recluse), the brown recluse spider is rarely aggressive, and bites from the species are uncommon. In 2001, more than 2,000 brown recluse spiders {{were removed from}} a heavily infested home in Kansas, yet the four residents who had lived there for years were never harmed by the spiders, despite many encounters with them. The spider usually bites only when pressed against the skin, such as when tangled within clothes, towels, bedding, inside work gloves, etc. Many human victims report having been bitten after putting on clothes {{that had not been}} worn recently, or had been left for many days undisturbed on the floor. The fangs of the brown recluse are <b>so</b> <b>tiny</b> they are unable to penetrate most fabric.|$|E

Yet Andersen also wrote about elvere in The Elfin Hill. The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore, who were beautiful females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to death.

500|$|Writing for School Library Journal, Benjamin Russell {{criticized the}} series for being [...] "slow and formulaic" [...] with [...] "similarly formulaic" [...] {{character}} designs that made [...] "it seem staid".

Casey Brienza of Anime News Network heavily criticized the story, grading it as an [...] "F" [...] and calling it [...] "a pastiche {{of a large number of}} manga and anime clichés, not because it seems like it was intended to be a pastiche, but because the manga artist [...] flatly is unable to sustain a coherent, unified storyline that is his own, original creation." [...] However, Brienza did praise the artwork, grading it as an [...] "A" [...] and calling it rich and [...] "beautifully drawn".

Her death left Steffy [...] "despondent and nearly suicidal". Wood recalled filming the storyline as being tough: [...] "Being a newbie, I was {{up most of the}} night trying to memorize all those monologues." [...] Speaking of emotional scenes where Steffy visited her sister's body in the morgue, the actress noted [...] "She was <b>so</b> <b>tiny</b> and innocent, and to see this beautiful young girl in the morgue, I had to keep my emotions in check. It was challenging. It was such a sad story." [...] Months later, Steffy becomes romantically involved with Rick, who was also previously in a relationship with her mother, Taylor. Reflecting on her initial reaction to the storyline, Wood revealed [...] "Sometimes when you read a script, you're like, 'How am I going [...] do this? How is Steffy going {{to fall in love with}} Rick after he had sex with her sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, and maybe I am doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, and she could not talk to anyone. She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers." [...] Wood was [...] "completely shocked" [...] with the speed at which the couple were moving, and said that the romance happened through Phoebe's death because of Steffy's raw feelings. However, she still felt that Steffy was in love with Rick and wanted to give herself to him. Lowder said the couple came together at the [...] "height of their emotions when Phoebe died". While describing the romance as [...] "complete honesty and no games", Wood said Steffy felt if she was close to Rick she could be close to Phoebe.|$|E

2500|$|The genome of D. melanogaster (sequenced in 2000, and curated at the FlyBase database) {{contains}} four {{pairs of}} chromosomes: an X/Y pair, and three autosomes labeled 2, 3, and 4.

Determination of sex in Drosophila occurs by the [...] of X chromosomes to autosomes, {{not because of the}} presence of a Y chromosome as in human sex determination.

For fusion power experiments this mixture must be held at high temperatures for relatively lengthy times {{in order to have}} an efficient reaction.
