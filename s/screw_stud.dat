Tightening the fastener by turning it puts compression force on the materials or parts being fastened together, but no amount of force from the parts will cause the screw to untighten. This property is also the basis for the use of screws in screw top container lids, vises, C-clamps, and screw jacks.

40|$|Cold-formed Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) walls {{lined with}} plasterboards are {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} building industry as primary load bearing components. Gypsum plasterboard is a common LSF wall lining material used with cold-formed steel studs. In general, gypsum plasterboards are <b>screwed</b> to <b>studs</b> at 300 mm spacing along the height and provide lateral restraints to the studs. The design of these LSF wall panels does not fully utilize the strengthening effect of plasterboards <b>screw</b> fastened to <b>studs.</b> Therefore {{there is a need}} to fully understand the structural behaviour of both sides lined LSF wall panels and develop appropriate design rules. Hence an experimental study was conducted using cold-formed steel studs subject to both local and distortional bucking effects. LSF wall panels were tested with two different stud sections and plasterboard lining with two different screw spacings. Experimental ultimate capacities were compared with the predictions from the design rules in AS/NZS 4600, which showed that the current design rules are conservative. In order to fully understand the behaviour of both sides lined LSF wall panels, finite element models of tested panels were also developed and analysed.

50|$|A helical insert is {{an insert}} made of coiled wire. The {{helically}} formed coils of diamond shaped stainless steel or phosphor bronze wire screw into a threaded hole {{to form a}} mating internal thread for a <b>screw</b> or <b>stud.</b> These inserts provide a convenient means of repairing stripped-out threads and are also used to provide stronger threads in soft materials such as aluminium, zinc die castings, wood, magnesium etc. than {{can be obtained by}} direct tapping of the base metal involved. Another common generic name is screw thread insert (STI), although many users persist in calling them all by a prominent brand name, the registered trademark Heli-Coil. Applications include engine cylinder head repair after unintentional over-torquing or cross-threading of spark plugs strips the thread of the socket. Kits with matched tap and coil exist for this. The straight radial piece in the photo is the driver tang which is used as a key to grip with pliers for driving the coil into place and is discarded after installation.|$|R
40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Historically {{brick veneer}} houses have not {{performed}} well in earthquakes. However, modern construction using better brick-ties, which are <b>screwed</b> to <b>studs</b> {{and the use}} of bricks with internal holes allowing some mortar mechanical interlock, is expected to result in a better performance. BRANZ cyclically racked two large brick veneer rooms (including ceilings) using a system which allowed the total load carried by the brick veneer to be measured directly. One room incorporated windows and had a door opening, while the other had fully separated brick veneer elements. Brick veneer cracking patterns were identified and rationalised. It was determined that in-plane brick veneer slip was significantly resisted by perpendicular walls and the mortar in brick veneer holes acted as dowels which resisted slip along horizontal mortar cracks. Elemental tests were used to measured brick veneer tension bond and slip strengths and the in-plane brick-tie load versus deflection relationship. These were used to determine the theoretical veneer lateral load resisting strength and a model was calibrated by comparing with the measured room strengths. A new design philosophy is proposed. ...|$|R

50|$|Stationary magnet stud {{detectors}} {{use a small}} stationary magnet {{to detect}} the nails or <b>screws</b> placed into <b>studs</b> while putting up the walling material. The user must move the magnet around the wall until feeling the pull of magnetic attraction, and move {{in the direction of}} attraction. Since stationary magnetic stud detectors rely on the user to feel the attraction, they can be very erratic especially when the metal fasteners are located more deeply in the walling, which decreases the overall attraction. When fasteners are deep or buried under thicker walling material (as in most plaster walls) the effectiveness of stationary magnets is considerably lower.|$|R

50|$|Hoof {{boots are}} {{commonly}} {{seen as a}} substitute to horseshoes, either as a backup for a thrown shoe when a farrier is not available, or as an alternative form of hoof protection for a barefoot horse. Horse boots are used in all riding disciplines and are particularly popular for trail riding and endurance riding. They are also used on horses in parades and on police horses who work on hard pavement. Hoof boots may also be used when transitioning a horse from shod to unshod riding, or carried during a ride in case a horse throws a shoe. In areas with persistently slippery conditions in winter, hoof boots are often used in combination with <b>studs</b> <b>screwed</b> into the soles. This allows the horse to be ridden safely on slippery surfaces. This must be done with a hoof boot with a sufficiently thick and inflexible sole to avoid bruising of the hoof sole. Boots with soles that are too flexible are unsuitable for studding.|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel studs, {{though they}} are a {{relatively}} new building material, have become a mainstay in modern construction.

5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, stud bolts a.k.a studs are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded Stud Bolts", [...] "Tap End Stud Bolts", and [...] "Double End Stud Bolts".

Tap end studs have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end stud bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully threaded studs with chamfered ends, and double end studs with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For studs that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the <b>screw</b> thread. Undercut <b>studs</b> are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} input, and the {{one most}} identified with circuit bending, is the body contact, where the performer's touch causes the circuit to change the sound. Often metal knobs, plates, <b>screws</b> or <b>studs</b> are wired to these circuit points to give easier access to these points from the outside {{the case of the}} device. Since creative experimentation is a key element to the practice of circuit bending, there is always a possibility that short circuiting may yield undesirable results, including component failure. In particular, connecting the power supply or a capacitor directly to a computer chip lead can destroy the chip and make the device inoperable. Before beginning to do circuit bending, a person should learn the basic risk factors about working with electrical and electronic products, including how to identify capacitors (which can give a person a serious shock due to the electrical charge that they store), and how to avoid risks with AC power. For safety reasons, a circuit bender should have a few basic electronics tools, such as a multimeter (an electronic testing device which measures voltage, resistance and other factors). It is advised that beginner circuit benders should never [...] "bend" [...] any device that gets its power from mains electricity (household AC power), as this would carry a serious risk of electrocution. Circuit bending can also be carried out in interactive electronic audio games. People modify their electronic games to enhance the quality of recordings used for fan-made projects or to change the speed of the game which results in a pitch change. This makes the gameplay easier, especially if the game gets impossibly fast. Adding a knob or a switch to change the pitch of the game can lead to some disadvantages which include the game can change its pitch slightly when its lights are turned on, and it can cause the batteries to drain out quickly on high speeds.|$|R
50|$|Cold-formed steel (CFS) is {{the common}} term for {{products}} made by rolling or pressing steel into semi-finished or finished goods at relatively low temperatures (cold working). Cold-formed steel goods are created by the working of steel billet, bar, or sheet using stamping, rolling (including roll forming), or presses to deform it into a usable product. Cold-worked steel products, such as cold-rolled steel (CRS) bar stock and sheet, are commonly used {{in all areas of}} manufacturing of durable goods, such as appliances or automobiles, but the phrase cold-formed steel is most prevalently used to describe construction materials. The use of cold-formed steel construction materials has become more and more popular since its initial introduction of codified standards in 1946. In the construction industry both structural and non-structural elements are created from thin gauges of sheet steel. These building materials encompass columns, beams, joists, studs, floor decking, built-up sections and other components. Cold-formed steel construction materials differ from other steel construction materials known as hot-rolled steel (see structural steel). The manufacturing of cold-formed steel products occurs at room temperature using rolling or pressing. The strength of elements used for design is usually governed by buckling. The construction practices are more similar to timber framing using <b>screws</b> to assemble <b>stud</b> frames.|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Most {{research in the area}} of blast resistant and retrofit designs has focused on high threat levels to meet the DOD and DOS needs. This report shows the need for moderate blast threat level protection and proposes ways to achieve that protection. Cold-formed steel stud wall systems are already used in many applications and could be effectively adapted to meet these threat levels. The objective of this report is to increase the strength of the connection of cold-formed steel stud-track systems to allow the studs to utilize part or all of the inherent tensile membrane resistance. The proposed solutions of upgrading stud-track wall connections with extra screws, larger screws, larger track and thicker track, etc. are evaluated and compared against each other and the current typical connection design. To accomplish this evaluation, four-foot long samples are constructed and loaded using a four-point loading tree. The results are compiled and trends are developed which are used to develop a matrix of full-length (ten-foot) samples. This study concludes that adding extra <b>screws,</b> along with <b>stud</b> thickness, are practical and efficient methods of altering the failure mechanisms and increasing the blast resistant characteristics of these wall systems. With these upgraded connections, lighter gauge sample show some tensile membrane behavior. Also discussed are the United Facilities Criteria (UFC) limits on deflection and data to support revising those criteria. Includes bibliographical references (pages 69 - 70) ...|$|R
