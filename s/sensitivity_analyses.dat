25|$|A {{criticism}} of LCEA {{is that it}} attempts to eliminate monetary cost analysis; that is replace the currency by which economic decisions are made with an energy currency. It has also been argued that energy efficiency is only one consideration in deciding which alternative process to employ, and {{that it should not}} be elevated to the only criterion for determining environmental acceptability; for example, simple energy analysis {{does not take into account}} the renewability of energy flows or the toxicity of waste products; however the life cycle assessment does help companies become more familiar with environmental properties and improve their environmental system. Incorporating Dynamic LCAs of renewable energy technologies (using <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> to project future improvements in renewable systems and their share of the power grid) may help mitigate this criticism.|$|E

40|$|Most mission {{concepts}} that return sample material to Earth share one common element: an Earth entry vehicle (EEV). The {{primary focus of}} this paper is the examination of EEV design space for relevant sample return missions. Mission requirements for EEV concepts can be divided into three major groups: entry conditions (e. g., velocity and flight path angle), payload (e. g., mass, volume, and g-load limit), and vehicle characteristics (e. g., thermal protection system, structural topology, and landing concepts). The impacts of these requirements on the EEV design have been studied with an integrated system analysis tool, and the results will be discussed in details. In addition, through <b>sensitivities</b> <b>analyses,</b> critical design drivers that have been identified will be reviewed...|$|R

The conclusions from the received studies vary across the region or country studied and/or the methodology employed. Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia panel survey, this paper investigates the relationship between mental health and inequality in Australia. A variety of income inequality indices are calculated to test both the income inequality and relative deprivation hypotheses. We find that mental health is only adversely affected {{by the presence of}} relative deprivation to a very small degree. In addition, we do not find support for the income inequality hypothesis.

40|$|This {{working paper}} is {{a review of}} issues {{associated}} with measuring education and using educational measures in social science research. The review is orientated towards researchers who undertake secondary analyses of large-scale micro-level social science datasets. The paper begins with an outline of important context which impinges upon the measurement of education. The UK {{is the focus of}} this review, but similar issues apply to other nation states. We provide a critical introduction to the main approaches to measuring education in social survey research, which include measuring years of education, using categorical qualification-based measures and scaling approaches. We advocate the use of established education measures to better facilitate comparability and replication. We conclude by making the recommendation that researchers place careful thought into which educational measure they select, and that researchers should routinely engage in appropriate <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyse...</b>|$|R
50|$|However, most meta-analyses include between 2 and 4 {{studies and}} such a sample is {{more often than not}} {{inadequate}} to accurately estimate heterogeneity. Thus it appears that in small meta-analyses, an incorrect zero between study variance estimate is obtained, leading to a false homogeneity assumption. Overall, it appears that heterogeneity is being consistently underestimated in meta-analyses and <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> in which high heterogeneity levels are assumed could be informative. These random effects models and software packages mentioned above relate to study-aggregate meta-analyses and researchers wishing to conduct individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses need to consider mixed-effects modelling approaches.|$|E
50|$|An estimand {{is closely}} linked to the purpose or {{objective}} of an analysis. It describes what is to be estimated based on the question of interest. This is in contrast to an estimator, which defines the specific rule according to which the estimand is to be estimated. While the estimand will often be free of the specific assumptions e.g. regarding missing data, such assumption will typically have to be made when defining the specific estimator. For this reason, it is logical to conduct <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> using different estimators for the same estimand, in order to test the robustness of inference to different assumptions.|$|E

50|$|The National Academy of Sciences {{advisory}} panel instead recommended methods that provide valid type I error rates under explicitly stated assumptions taking missing data status into account, {{and the use}} of multiple imputation methods based on all the data available in the model.

It advised collecting auxiliary data believed to be associated with dropouts to provide more robust and reliable models, collecting information about reason for drop-out; and, if possible, following up on drop-outs and obtaining efficacy outcome data. Finally, it recommended <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> as part of clinical trial reporting to assess the sensitivity of the results to the assumptions about the missing data mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Computational expense is {{a problem}} in many {{practical}} <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses.</b> Some methods of reducing computational expense include the use of emulators (for large models), and screening methods (for reducing the dimensionality of the problem). Another method is to use an event-based sensitivity analysis method for variable selection for time-constrained applications. This is an input variable selection (IVS) method that assembles together information about the trace of the changes in system inputs and outputs using sensitivity analysis to produce an input/output trigger/event matrix that is designed to map the relationships between input data as causes that trigger events and the output data that describes the actual events. The cause-effect relationship between the causes of state change i.e. input variables and the effect system output parameters determines which set of inputs have a genuine impact on a given output. The method has a clear advantage over analytical and computational IVS method since it tries to understand and interpret system state change in the shortest possible time with minimum computational overhead.|$|E
50|$|For risk {{assessment}} for {{moderate to severe}} AKI, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) {{were found to be}} significantly superior to all previously described markers of AKI (p<0.002) including LCN2 (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1. During <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 remained significant and superior to all other markers regardless of changes in reference creatinine method. Both TIMP2 and IGFBP7 have been associated with the G1 cell cycle arrest phase noted to occur during the very early phases of kidney injury. Cell cycle arrest is a protective mechanism that cells use to avoid cell division when injured and induces the release of TIMP2 and IGFBP7 which is beneficial. Remote ischemic conditioning was used in a study to induce protection in the kidney prior to cardiac surgery. The study results indicate that remote ischemic preconditioning was effective in patients with increased NephroCheck levels prior to surgery. Increase levels during surgery predict development of acute kidney injury showing a potential use for NephroCheck, in conjunction with other therapies, to prevent or treat acute kidney injury in addition to assessing risk. In addition, TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 have been associated with death or renal replacement therapy only in subjects who developed AKI.|$|E

40|$|Good {{irrigation}} water management requires accurate, automated, non-destructive and simple techniques to measure crop water consumption. The actual evaporation from a cabbage crop was measured using the Bowen ratio energy balance technique (BREB), the surface temperature technique and the Penman-monteith method.

Four irrigations were applied and 17 rainfall events were recorded during the experiment. The soil at the experimental field was a clay loam. An attempt to detect and reduce measurement error that could result from using inaccurate sensors was performed by calibrating the sensors. Data from inaccurate sensors were not used to compute the latent heat. Error and <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyse</b> were performed, and the integrity of the weather data using the estimates of weather data from an appropriate model were checked.
