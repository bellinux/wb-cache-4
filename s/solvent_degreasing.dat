The treated surfaces were evaluated for surface energy, contact angle, surface topography, surface roughness and adhesive strength characteristics. The influence of surface pre-treatments on the variation of polar, dispersive and total surface energy of the surfaces is addressed. A wettability test was performed on the surfaces using an epoxy adhesive in order to assess the influence of the pre-treatment techniques on substrate/adhesive interaction. Theoretical work of adhesion values for the various pre-treated surfaces were calculated using the contact angle data and further tested experimentally by adhesive bond strength evaluation by tensile testing of a single lap aluminium-epoxy aluminium assembly. The method of surface pre-treatment showed a profound effect on the surface topography and roughness by AFM. This study reveals that a combination of high surface energy and high surface roughness of the substrate along with good wettability of the adhesive contributed to the highest joint strength for the aluminium alloy through the FPL etching pre-treatment.

The mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of some of the candidate chemicals, namely 1, 2 -dichloroethylene, 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane, 1, 3 -dichloropropane, 1, 2, 3 -trichloropropane and 1, 1, 3 -trichloropropene were evaluated in an in vitro micronucleus assay. The cytokinesis-block methodology was applied on human lymphocytes in the presence or absence of an external metabolic activation system (S 9 -mix). In the micronucleus assay, all test substances, except 1, 2, 3 -trichloropropane with and without S 9 -mix and 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane without S 9 -mix in the repeated experiment, exhibited a low but statistically significant mutagenic activity, compared to the concurrent control. However, none of the five chemicals was able to induce a clear and reproducible linear dose-dependent increase in micronucleus frequencies in this assay. Generally, mutagenic activity of the chemicals was found in the absence of severe cytotoxicity and/or cell cycle delay. The DNA breakage capacity and the cytotoxicity of these chemicals were also assessed in the alkaline single cell gel (SCG) electrophoresis test (comet assay) with and without S 9 -mix in isolated human lymphocytes. All chemical compounds induced DNA breakage, in the presence or absence of the metabolic activation system, at the doses tested. The data showed that the DNA reactivity of the chemicals increased with increasing degree of halogenation. The results of the present work suggested that the comet assay might be a more suitable and sensitive screening method than the micronucleus test for this particular class of compound.
