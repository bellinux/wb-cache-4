40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Hummingbird is a 15 () -lb. gross weight, remotely piloted helicopter (RPH) with a 50 -lb. payload and a rotor radius of 10. 25 ft. It {{is powered by}} a 25 h. p. air cooled two-cylinder Westlake engine. As such it represents one of the largest RPH's in the world. It was purchased from Gorham Model Products in 1992 to provide a suitable rotor craft research flight test platform for the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Naval Postgraduate School. The helicopter was delivered disassembled and was accompanied by an ample supply of replacement and spare parts. Also included was a second helicopter in a partially assembled condition that had been previously flown. Assemblies provided comprised the chassis, main rotor transmission, rotor head assembly and tailboom with tail rotor gear box and rotor. The task undertaken by this thesis was to fabricate one complete fully operable RPH and to design, fabricate and install whatever new assemblies that were required for its NPS mission and to make up for deficiencies in the previous design. The work completed required: (1) Design, fabrication and installation of a new skid-type landing gear system; (2) Redesign, and incorporation of a new engine mount system; (3) Modification of the engine and main rotor transmission coupling; (4) Upgrade of the electrical system and elongation of the nose section; and (5) Initial engine testing. Recommendations for future modifications to the helicopter and laboratory facilities, and development of a <b>static</b> hover <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> are also included[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Graphite-epoxy beams were {{subjected}} to an eccentric axial impact load in a drop tower <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in order to study their large displacement flexural behavior. The time history of the transient axial load exhibited a large magnitude occurring just after impact, which was many {{times greater than the}} static failure load. The damage caused by this peak dynamic load was measured by the reduction in energy absorption of the impacted beam relative to a virgin beam in <b>static</b> <b>tests.</b> For the thirty-ply specimens, the amount of damage increased with increasing axial stiffness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Unit {{testing in}} the {{presence}} of side effects requires the con-struction of a suitable <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> before each <b>test</b> run. We consider the problem of providing <b>test</b> <b>fixtures</b> for unit <b>testing</b> of client-side JavaScript code that manipulates its underlying web page. We propose using tech-niques from software transactional memory to restore the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> after each <b>test</b> run. ...|$|R
50|$|Test {{fixtures}} {{can be set}} up {{in three}} ways: in-line setup, delegate setup, and implicit setup. In-line setup is where the developer creates the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in the same method {{as the rest of the}} test and is the simplest <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> to create but can lead to duplication if multiple tests need to use the same initial data. Delegate setup is where the developer places the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in a separate standalone helper method that can be accessed by multiple test methods. Implicit setup is where the developer places the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in a setup method which is used to set up multiple test methods. This is different from delegate setup in that the overall setup of multiple tests is in a single setup method where the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> gets created instead of each test method having its own setup procedures and linking to an external <b>test</b> <b>fixture.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{considered}} bad practice when <b>test</b> <b>fixtures</b> are too general in implicit setup, {{or when the}} test method sets up a <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> and does not use it during the test. A more subtle issue is if the test methods ignore certain fields within the <b>test</b> <b>fixture.</b> Another bad practice would be a test setup that contains more steps than are needed for the test; {{this is a problem}} seen in in-line setup.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} paper, it evaluates the benefits achievable from <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> framework by analyzing and transforming the JUnit 3. 8 source code and static execution of transformed code. Static structure {{enables us to}} analyze the code statically during creation and execution of test cases. The concept of research is by now well established in <b>static</b> analysis and <b>testing</b> development. The research approach is also increasingly affecting the <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> process and such research oriented work has proved particularly valuable {{for those of us}} who want to understand the reflective behavior of JUnit 3. 8 Framework. JUnit 3. 8 Framework uses Java Reflection API to invoke core functionality (test cases creation and execution) dynamically. However, Java Reflection API allows developers to access and modify structure and behavior of a program. Â  Reflection provides flexible solution for creating test cases and controlling the execution of test cases. Java reflection helps to encapsulate test cases in a single object representing the test suite. It also helps to associate each test method with a test object. Where reflection is a powerful tool to perform potential operations, on the other hand, it limits static analysis. Static analysis tools often cannot work effectively with reflection. In order to avoid the reflection, <b>Static</b> <b>Testing</b> Framework provides a static platform to analyze the JUnit 3. 8 source code and transform it into non-reflective version that emulates the dynamic behavior of JUnit 3. 8. The transformed source code has possible leverage to replace reflection with static code and does same things in an execution environment of <b>Static</b> <b>Testing</b> Framework that reflection does in JUnit 3. 8. More besides, the transformed code also enables execution environment of <b>Static</b> <b>Testing</b> Framework to run test methods statically. In order to measure the degree of efficiency, the implemented tool is evaluated. The evaluation of <b>Static</b> <b>Testing</b> Framework draws results for different Java projects and these statistical data is compared with JUnit 3. 8 results to measure the effectiveness of <b>Static</b> <b>Testing</b> Framework. As a result of evaluation, STF can be used for static creation and execution of test cases up to JUnit 3. 8 where test cases are not creating within a test class and where real definition of constructors is not required. These problems can be dealt as future work by introducing a middle layer to execute <b>test</b> <b>fixtures</b> for each <b>test</b> method and by generating test classes as per real definition of constructors...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Advisors: Terri Fiez, Karti Mayaram. Committee members: Andreas Weisshaar, David Hackleman. At {{frequencies}} exceeding 1 - 2 GHz, {{the substrate}} network models used in substrate coupling simulation must {{account for the}} reactive nature of the substrate. Unlike at low frequencies, where the purely resistive substrate models can be validated through DC resistance measurements, these high-frequency models, comprising reactive components, must be validated through high-frequency network analyzer measurements. Accurately obtaining such measurements requires careful design of both a measurement <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> {{as well as a}} measurement deembedding procedure. A <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> has been fabricated and a deembedding procedure designed to enable high-frequency (up to 20 GHz) network parameter measurements of a silicon substrate. A test chip, containing a variety of substrate test structures has been fabricated in a 0. 35 Î¼m CMOS process on a heavily-doped substrate. The design of the <b>test</b> <b>fixture,</b> <b>test</b> chip, and deembedding procedure has been validated through extensive simulations in HFSS. Measurements have been made on the test chips mounted in the <b>test</b> <b>fixture.</b> The performance of the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> and measurement deembedding procedure has been evaluated, and suggestions for future improvements in this area are presented...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{test and}} {{theoretical}} aerodynamic {{data were obtained}} for a flight <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> mounted {{on the underside of}} an F- 104 G aircraft.

Pressure distributions generated by the codes for the flight <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> as well as boundary layer displacement thickness generated by the two dimensional code were compared to the flight test data. The two dimensional code pressure distributions compared well except at the minimum pressure point and trailing edge. Shock locations compared well except at high transonic speeds.

40|$|Abstract. An {{accurate}} and simple technique {{for measuring the}} input reflection coefficient and the fre-quency response of semiconductor laser diode chips is proposed and demonstrated. All the packaging parasitics could be obtained accurately using a calibrated probe, and the impedance of the intrinsic diode chip is deduced from the directly measured reflection coefficient. The directly measured impedance of a laser diode is affected strongly by the short bond wire. In the frequency response (S 21) measurements of semiconductor laser diode chips, the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> consists of a microwave probe, a submount, and a bond wire. The S-parameters of the probe could be determined using the short-open-match (SOM) method. Both the attenuation and {{the reflection of the}} <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> have a strong influence on the directly measured frequency response, and in our proposed technique, the effect of <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> is completely removed.

Aiming to solve the problem, at first, the paper adopts a standard called signal testing definition(STD), which is applied to describe simulating signals used for <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulation of guidance station of one antiaircraft missile; then those simulating signals for the <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulation are implemented based on the platform Labwindows/CVI, and D/A converters are employed for generating physical <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> signals, which are outputted through operational panels or interfaces of the <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulator.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{frequency}} limitation {{arising from the}} calibration of asymmetric and symmetric <b>test</b> <b>fixtures</b> has been investigated. For asymmetric <b>test</b> <b>fixtures,</b> a new algorithm based on the thru-short-match (TSM) method is outlined.
