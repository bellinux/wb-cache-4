5|$|It {{is crucial}} for these {{definitions}} that edges are only allowed to stay within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across the <b>spine</b> of the book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which <b>spine</b> crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of <b>spine</b> crossings per edge, and some graphs need this many <b>spine</b> crossings.|$|E
5|$|However, it is NP-complete {{to find a}} 2-page {{embedding}} when {{neither the}} <b>spine</b> ordering nor the edge partition is known.|$|E
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of Other Worlds but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. The <b>spine</b> also changed from a colored <b>spine</b> with pale lettering, which was similar to the <b>spine</b> style used by Other Worlds, to a white <b>spine</b> with red or blue lettering.|$|E

5|$|Though not aggressive, {{the common}} {{stingray}} can inflict an excruciating wound with its serrated, venomous tail <b>spine.</b> The ancient Greeks and Romans greatly feared its venom, with authors such as Aelian (175–235 AD) stating that stingray wounds were incurable. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), in his Natural History, asserted that its <b>spine</b> {{was capable of}} killing trees, piercing armor like an arrow, and corroding iron. Greek poet Oppian (172–210 AD) claimed that the touch of stingray venom could even dissolve stone. In Greek mythology, Hercules {{was said to have}} lost a finger to the bite of a stingray, and Circe was said to have armed her son Telegonus with a spear tipped with a stingray <b>spine,</b> with which he accidentally slew his father Odysseus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spines</b> {{in plants}} {{have evolved to}} reduce {{mammalian}} herbivory, and their main function may be to protect twigs more than photosynthetic tissue. Type and frequency of <b>spines</b> vary in different scales. We hypothesised that different types of <b>spines</b> affect animal foraging through different mechanisms. We studied feeding behaviour by twig browsing goats in relation to two types of <b>spines</b> of Acacia tortilis using experimental manipulation of the occurrence of <b>spines.</b> Feeding time, number of biting actions, number and diameter of bites on trees (post-trial) and total intake were recorded. The removal of either long straight <b>spines</b> or short hooked <b>spines</b> resulted in no feeding responses by goats. The removal of both types of <b>spines</b> tended to increase feeding time resulting in more and larger bites with larger bite diameters and in increased total intake and utilisation compared to control branches. The removal of <b>spines</b> gave no effects on feeding rate, expressed as biting actions/minute, number of twigs bitten/minute or intake rate (g/minute). Both types of <b>spines</b> reduced total intake and utilisation of browse, but the functional mechanisms were different with the long straight <b>spines</b> mainly influencing bite size and short hooked <b>spines</b> mainly affecting number of bites...|$|R
5|$|The <b>spines</b> of cacti {{are often}} useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, {{as well as}} in whether all the <b>spines</b> {{produced}} by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most <b>spines</b> are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened <b>spines</b> (e.g. Schlerocactus papyracanthus). Other cacti have hooked <b>spines.</b> Sometimes, one or more central <b>spines</b> are hooked, while outer <b>spines</b> are straight (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).|$|R

5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section <b>spine,</b> instead of the circular <b>spine</b> used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E
5|$|A <b>spine</b> is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like <b>spine</b> {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the <b>spine</b> does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the <b>spine.</b> Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{disorders}} such as ADHD, autism, intellectual disability, {{and fragile}} X syndrome, may be resultant from abnormalities in dendritic <b>spines,</b> especially the number of <b>spines</b> and their maturity. The ratio of matured to immature <b>spines</b> is important in their signaling, as immature <b>spines</b> have impaired synaptic signaling. Fragile X syndrome is characterized by an overabundance of immature <b>spines</b> that have multiple filopodia in cortical dendrites.|$|R
50|$|Cryosophila is {{distinguished}} from related genera by its long, branched <b>spines</b> which {{are derived from}} modified roots.

5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the <b>spine</b> within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the <b>spine</b> by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the <b>spine.</b> Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the <b>spine</b> there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{analyses}} {{had shown}} Kentrosaurus closer {{in the tree}} to Stegosaurus. Basal traits include a prominent paraquadratic foramen at the quadrate in the skull; maxillary teeth with only seven denticles at the margin; and a shoulder <b>spine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hedgehogs {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by their <b>spines,</b> which are hollow hairs made stiff with keratin. Their <b>spines</b> are not poisonous or ed {{and unlike the}} quills of a porcupine, do not easily detach from their bodies. However, the immature animal's <b>spines</b> normally fall out as they are replaced with adult <b>spines.</b> This is called [...] "quilling". <b>Spines</b> can also shed when the animal is diseased or under extreme stress.|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>spines</b> in zoea and other crustaceans {{have been documented}} in numerous studies {{as a form of}} anti-°©‐predatory behavior. This study examined the potential costs of having <b>spines</b> using three different methods. Drag forces on <b>spines</b> were calculated using hydrodynamic equations and compared between zoea models with long and short spines; clay models were used in corn syrup sinking rate experiments to measure drag coefficients; and zoea models were created in FreeCAD and ran through a shear simulation in MATLAB to examine their stabilities. The study found that the presence of <b>spines</b> increased the drag forces on the models both through calculations and through direct measurements in corn syrup. Moreover, the presence of <b>spines</b> made models more susceptible to tumbling under shear when the <b>spines</b> were flared. However, if long <b>spines</b> were held in typical positions, the zoea models were actually more stable than the short <b>spined</b> model. This study highlights some of the plausible costs associated with <b>spines</b> and further studies are needed to examine the relative importance between hydrodynamic costs in <b>spines</b> versus decreased risk in predation...|$|R

5000|$|Another unusual feature among {{rabbitfishes}} {{is their}} pelvic fins, which are formed from two <b>spines,</b> with three soft rays between them.

50|$|The {{green sea}} urchin has a {{globular}} test (shell) densely covered in <b>spines</b> and can reach {{a diameter of}} around 11 cm.

Green test with green <b>spines</b> or green test with white <b>spines</b> are the most common combinations found in the Caribbean. In between the <b>spines</b> are pedicellaria, pincer like structures. These are white which distinguishes the green sea urchin from the rather similar Lytechinus williamsi which has purple pedicellaria.|$|R
5|$|On 12 September, the University of Leicester team {{announced}} that the human remains were a possible candidate for Richard's body, but emphasised the need for caution.

25|$|The second general {{characteristic}} of Pachypodium is spinescence, or having <b>spines.</b> The <b>spines</b> come clustered in either pairs or triplets with these clusters often arranged in rings or whorls around the trunk. <b>Spines</b> emerge with leaves, and like leaves grow {{for a short}} period before stopping growth and hardening. <b>Spines</b> do not regenerate so weathering and abrasion can wear away all but the youngest <b>spines</b> from older specimens - leaving smooth trunks and branches.|$|R
50|$|General {{characteristics}} {{of family members}} include a compressed body, ridges and/or <b>spines</b> on the head, one or two <b>spines</b> on the operculum, and three to five <b>spines</b> on the preopercle. The dorsal fin has 11 to 17 <b>spines,</b> often long and separated from each other, and the pectoral fins are well-developed, with 11 to 25 rays. The <b>spines</b> of the dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins all have venom glands at their bases.|$|R
50|$|Leaves {{have been}} reduced to <b>spines,</b> 6 to 12 of which grow from each areole.
