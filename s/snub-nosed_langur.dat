He did not see active service abroad as he was injured in a bomb accident.He returned to the museum in 1919. He {{was a member of}} the panel of advisers to the British delegation to the 1933 International Conference for the Preservation of the Flora and Fauna of Africa, said to have been [...] "the high point of institutionalised global nature protection before the Second World War", and according to his obituary in The Times Dollman [...] "had a decisive voice on the animal species to be scheduled for total or partial protection".He travelled and wrote extensively with Walter Rothschild; their publications included New mammals from Dutch New Guinea (1932) and a study of tree kangaroos The Genus Dendrolagus (1936). He was also an accomplished artist, exhibiting pictures at the Royal Academy, and illustrated many of his own scientific writings.|$|E
40|$|Background: Infanticide by {{adult male}} occurs in many {{mammalian}} species under natural conditions, {{and it is}} often {{assumed to be a}} goal-directed action and explained predominately by sexual selection. Motivation of this behavior in mammals is limitedly involved. Methodology and Principal Findings: We used long-term reproductive records and direct observation in captivity and in the field of two <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>langur</b> species on the basis of individual identification to investigate how infanticide happened and to be avoided in nonhuman primates. Our observations suggested that infanticide by invading males might be more accidental than goal-directed. The invading male seemed to monopolize all the females including lactating mothers during takeovers. Multiparous mothers who accepted the invading male shortly after takeovers avoided infanticide in most cases. Our results conjectured primiparous mothers would decrease infanticidal possibility if they sexually accepted the invading male during or immediately after takeovers. In the studied langur species, voluntary abortion or mating with the invading male was evidently adopted by females to limit or avoid infanticide by takeover males. Conclusions and Significance: The objective of the invading male was to monopolize all adult females after his takeover. It appeared that the motherâ€™s resistance to accepting the new male as a mating partner was the primary incentive fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemokine}} receptor CCR 5 {{can serve}} as a coreceptor for M-tropic HIV- 1 infection and both M-tropic and T-tropic SIV infection. We sequenced the entire CCR 5 gene from 10 nonhuman primates: Pongo pygmaeus, Hylobates leucogenys, Trachypithecus francoisi, Trachypithecus phayrei, Pygathrix nemaeus, Rhinopithecus roxellanae, Rhinopithecus bieti, Rhinopithecus avunculus, Macaca assamensis, and Macaca arctoides. When compared with CCR 5 sequences from humans and other primates, our results demonstrate that:(1) nucleotide and amino acid sequences of CCR 5 among primates are highly homologous, with variations slightly concentrated on the amino and carboxyl termini; and (2) site Asp 13, which is critical for CD 4 -independent binding of SIV gp 120 to Macaca mulatta CCR 5, was also present in all other nonhuman primates tested here, suggesting that those nonhuman primate CCR 5 s might also bind SIV gp 120 without the presence of CD 4. The topologies of CCR 5 gene trees constructed here conflict with the putative opinion that the <b>snub-nosed</b> <b>langurs</b> compose a monophyletic group, suggesting that the CCR 5 gene may not be a good genetic marker for low-level phylogenetic analysis. The evolutionary rate of CCR 5 was calculated, and our results suggest a slowdown in primates after they diverged from rodents. The synonymous mutation rate of CCR 5 in primates is constant, about 1. 1 x 10 (- 9) synonymous mutations per site per year. Comparisons of K-a and K-s suggest that the CCR 5 genes have undergone negative or purifying selection. K-a/K-s ratios from cercopithecines and colobines are significantly different, implying that selective pressures have played different roles in the two lineages...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the world's largest population of homo sapiens, China {{is also home to}} a dozen other primate species including gibbons, macaques, leaf monkeys, gray <b>langurs,</b> <b>snub-nosed</b> monkeys and lorises. Unlike human beings, who number over 1.3 billion, most of China's other primate species are endangered. Both apes and monkeys, particularly gibbons and macaques are prominently featured in Chinese culture, folk religion, art and literature. Monkey is one of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac.|$|R
