5|$|The artbox {{design for}} Funimation's North American {{release of the}} School Rumble anime resembles a {{miniature}} metal locker, {{and each of the}} individually released DVDs comes with heavy duty magnets. The discs include subtitled interviews with the Japanese voice actors, which were compiled onto a third DVD for the full first season release. In 2007, Funimation ran a drawing contest prior to releasing the anime in North America. The grand prize included a new computer with software for developing anime and manga. The United Kingdom anime release by Revelation Films <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> limited edition box as Funimation, along with two standard editions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{practice}} session, Chip Ganassi Racing driver Scott Dixon recorded the fastest lap, ahead of Team Penske's Ryan Briscoe, the Andretti Autosport car of Tony Kanaan and Briscoe's teammate Will Power. Due to the slippery {{nature of the}} circuit, drivers were caught out and ended up inflicting damage to their cars. Defending series champion Dario Franchitti ventured down the escape road before damaging his suspension against the Turn 8 wall. He ended the session in seventeenth position. Other drivers to hit the wall included Romancini and Milka Duno. Incidents continued in the second practice session, with no less than five drivers spinning or making {{contact with the outside}} retaining walls. The session <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> top four drivers as the first session.|$|E

25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I said I could not. You will not believe this, but the day the film was released, I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} the 1906 season <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> opponents {{at the same}} venue as the last game of 1905, and Bailey did even better against Warwickshire than before: he took five for 59 in the first innings and then six wickets for six runs (in 8.4 overs) in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 65, the best match figures of his career. There were nine wickets in the next game against Sussex at Bath, {{including}} a first innings return of six for 118. But though Bailey remained in the side {{for the rest of}} the season, there were no further successes and he did not take five wickets in an innings again in the season. He finished with a total of 65 wickets at the relatively high average for the time of 26.29.|$|E
500|$|Pardo's online {{multimedia}} game, {{originally developed}} at the National Film Board {{in the summer of}} 1968, was centered on children playing in teams watching film loops - and based on their personal visual processing, making up questions (and multiple answer choices) to stump other players, who although watching the same imagery, naturally watched them from their personal perspective, history and emotional experience. [...] Exposure to the fact that everyone <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> visual information differently was a critically important learning process for the children.|$|E

500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe." ...|$|E
500|$|Jinks and Cohen {{involved}} Ball {{throughout the}} film's development, including casting and director selection. The producers met with about 20 interested directors, several {{of whom were}} considered [...] "A-list" [...] at the time. Ball was not keen on the more well-known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become [...] "nervous about the content". Nevertheless, the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert Zemeckis; neither accepted. In the same year, Mendes (then a theater director) revived the musical Cabaret in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall. Beth Swofford of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility. Mendes came across American Beauty {{in a pile of}} eight scripts at Swofford's house, and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make; early in his career, he had been inspired by how the film Paris, Texas(1984) presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> theme in American Beauty, as well as parallels with his own childhood. Mendes later met with Spielberg; impressed by Mendes' productions of Oliver! and Cabaret, Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of November 8, Bundy approached 18-year-old telephone operator Carol DaRonch at Fashion Place Mall in Murray, Utah, {{less than a mile}} from the Midvale restaurant where Melissa Smith was last seen. He identified himself as [...] "Officer Roseland" [...] of the Murray Police Department, told DaRonch that someone had attempted to break into her car, and asked her to accompany him to the station to file a complaint. When DaRonch pointed out that Bundy was driving on a road that did not lead to the police station, he immediately pulled to the shoulder and attempted to handcuff her. During their struggle, he inadvertently fastened both handcuffs to the same wrist, and DaRonch was able to open the car door and escape. Later that evening, Debra Jean Kent, a 17-year-old student at Viewmont High School in Bountiful, [...] north of Murray, disappeared after leaving a theater production at the school to pick up her brother. The school's drama teacher and a student told police that [...] "a stranger" [...] had asked each of them to come out to the parking lot to identify a car. Another student later <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> man pacing in the rear of the auditorium, and the drama teacher spotted him again shortly before the end of the play. Outside the auditorium, investigators found a key that unlocked the handcuffs removed from Carol DaRonch's wrist.|$|E

500|$|Back at Nico’s apartment, Bruno {{reveals that}} the stolen key was the Key of Solomon; Susarro would need it to access a special armillary in an ancient building, the {{location}} of which is unknown. Whilst looking at the Omega Stone, George realises he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> symbol, {{in exactly the same}} style as the key, in the Congo, leading him and Nico to travel there and investigate. [...] The pair quickly find another stone with the alpha symbol upon it, and manage to evade Petra, who had come after them and the site. [...] Upon returning to Paris, the pair learn that Bruno had been captured whilst Nico's apartment was ransacked, and taken to Prague, leaving Nico to find out where exactly by returning to the abandoned theatre and searching it for clues, quickly finding out that he was taken to a large castle owned by Susarro. [...] Whilst there, they manage to track down Bruno, along with the discovery that the armillary is in Egypt, and that the Key of Solomon was taken by the St. Stefan chapter of the Knights Templar - a surviving remnant of the Templars that still exist, and known to Susarro. He promptly returns to Paris to confront them, while Bruno is taken to Egypt. George decides to track the St. Stefan chapter as well, and returns to Paris and the Montfauçon where they are based, only to arrive too late to stop their base being invaded. Despite finding bodies, George manages to find survivors of the attack, including the Preceptor for the chapter's temple. The Preceptor tasks George with stopping Susarro, revealing the key was taken from them, before handing over a third stone key needed to pinpoint the armillary, bearing a psi symbol on it, and knighting George.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{moment in}} the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict {{between him and his}} father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a [...] "... callback to ..." [...] in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow. Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, [...] "... learned {{a little bit more about}} what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." [...] The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer. Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{concept was}} an idealistic wish to [...] "free" [...] Asia from European colonial powers, but soon, nationalists {{saw it as}} a way to gain resources to keep Japan a modern power, and militarists <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> resources as raw materials for war. Many Japanese nationalists were drawn to it as an ideal. [...] Many of them remained convinced, throughout the war, that the Sphere was idealistic, offering slogans in a newspaper competition, praising the sphere for constructive efforts and peace.|$|E

2500|$|Other notable premieres {{were given}} in Prague in 1899, and in Paris in 1909, with a Sergei Diaghilev {{production}} featuring Feodor Chaliapin as Galitsky and Maria Nikolaevna Kuznetsova as Yaroslavna. London <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> production in 1914 conducted by Thomas Beecham, again with Chaliapin as Galitsky. In 1915 the United States premiere {{took place at}} the Metropolitan Opera, but staged in Italian and conducted by Giorgio Polacco.

2500|$|In 1903 William G. Tight, a {{professor}} at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> type of valley and small stream running from Charleston to the Ohio River.

Professor Tight sought in vain to persuade the geological community that this valley once carried a mighty river that continued across Ohio, Indiana and Illinois through a valley now deeply buried under glacial deposits. He called it the Teays (pronounced taze) River, for a village in West Virginia.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the ordinance's vagueness {{there was}} a danger of [...] "arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement", Sprecher claimed.
