5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of <b>swarf</b> as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E

25|$|When milling metals, the {{material}} is relatively ductile, although remaining strong even at a small scale. A Type II chip is formed, and waste may be produced as continuous <b>swarf.</b> Cutter forces are high, so milling machines must be robust and rigid, usually substantial constructions of cast iron.|$|E

50|$|As {{material}} {{passes through}} the cutting area of a milling machine, the blades of the cutter take <b>swarfs</b> of material at regular intervals. Surfaces cut {{by the side of}} the cutter (as in peripheral milling) therefore always contain regular ridges. The distance between ridges and the height of the ridges depend on the feed rate, number of cutting surfaces, the cutter diameter. With a narrow cutter and rapid feed rate, these revolution ridges can be significant variations in the surface finish.|$|R

25|$|Long series {{drill bits}} are unusually long twist drill bits. However, {{they are not}} the best tool for {{routinely}} drilling deep holes, as they require frequent withdrawal to clear the flutes of <b>swarf</b> and to prevent breakage of the bit. Instead, gun drill bits are preferred for deep hole drilling.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} bore {{finishing}} is {{better suited for}} bores with relatively low length-to-diameter ratios, usually less than 2:1. However, if there are cross-holes, or other interruptions in the bore, then a ratio greater than 2:1 is possible, because <b>swarf</b> and fluids may be expelled via these routes. This process is also not well suited for surfaces that require cross-hatching.|$|E
25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no <b>swarf</b> and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|E

The players have one free gloved right hand, and a bladelike glove called a jak on their left.

40|$|Magnetic and {{structural}} studies {{were performed on}} Fe 50 Co 50 material. The samples (disk-shaped, diameter: 10 mm, thickness: 2. 5 mm) were fabricated by compaction of powder under pressure of 800 MPa for 5 min at temperatures 300 – 600 ◦C. The powder was obtained by milling of Fe 50 Co 50 alloy <b>swarfs</b> in high-energy planetary mill. The milling time varied from 1 h to 40 h. In the course of milling process the mean size of alloy pieces was decreasing from about 0. 5 mm to 0. 05 mm (scanning electron microscopy), which provided more compact structure after compression. The annealing process during compaction strongly reduces a coercive field of the samples. Parameters of conversion electron Mössbauer spectra are almost {{the same for all}} samples, which points to not significant changes of atomic and magnetic order after milling and compacting.

30|$|According to the DOE, the WQI {{is defined}} by six parameters, namely the {{biochemical}} oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, total suspended solids (TSS), and ammoniacal nitrogen. BOD is {{the most commonly used}} parameter for determining the oxygen demand on the receiving water of a municipal or industrial discharge. High BOD is an indication of poor water quality, while COD is an indicator of organics in the water, usually used in conjunction with BOD. COD test is commonly used to measure the amount of organic and inorganic oxydizable compounds in the water [8]. Generally, the BOD/COD ratio should be equal to or less than 1.0 [9]. The BOD/COD ratios for industrial waste water can be lower than 0.5 [10]. Oxygen is essential for all plants and animals to survive, whether they live on land or in water. Aquatic organisms rely on oxygen that is dissolved in the water. A low DO (less than 2 mg/l) indicates poor water quality and, thus, is not conducive for sustaining many sensitive aquatic lives. DO also depends on physiochemical parameters such as temperature, salinity, and pH [11]. The ammonia molecule is a nutrient required for life, but excess ammonia accumulates in the organism and causes alteration of metabolism or increase in body pH. TSS refers to the particles in the water that are larger than 0.45 μm. TSS includes pollutants such as minute metal <b>swarfs,</b> filings, and powdered chips [12], high concentrations of which can damage the habitats of fish and other aquatic organisms [13]. The presence of synthetic organic chemicals like solvents, paints, and detergents can impart offensive tastes, odors, and colors to fish and aquatic plants even if present in low concentrations [14]. Oil in the water also affects the lives of the aquatic beings by inhibiting the atmospheric oxygen from dissolving in the water. Free oil found in the effluent waste rises {{to the surface of the}} water and prevents the sunlight from reaching the depths of the water. Oil and grease also become chemically emulsified, primarily through the use of detergents and other alkalis [15]. pH is an indicator of the existence of biological life as most of them thrive in a quite narrow and critical pH range. The discharge of industrial effluents and urban wastes into the river water causes an increase in BOD, COD, and TSS [14, 15].|$|R
2500|$|Cutting is a {{collection}} of processes wherein material is brought to a specified geometry by removing excess material using various kinds of tooling to leave a finished part that meets specifications. [...] The net result of cutting is two products, the waste or excess material, and the finished part. [...] In woodworking, the waste would be sawdust and excess wood. [...] In cutting metals the waste is chips or <b>swarf</b> and excess metal.|$|E
2500|$|Bandsaws {{dedicated}} to industrial metal-cutting use, such as for structural steel in fabrication shops and for bar stock in machine shops, {{are available in}} vertical and horizontal designs. Typical band speeds range from 40 feet (12 meters) per minute to 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) per minute, although specialized bandsaws are built for friction cutting of hard metals and run band speeds to 15,000 feet per minute. [...] Metal-cutting bandsaws are usually equipped with brushes or brushwheels to prevent chips from becoming stuck in between the blade's teeth. [...] Systems which cool the blade with cutting fluid are also common equipment on metal-cutting bandsaws. [...] The coolant washes away <b>swarf</b> and keeps the blade cool and lubricated.|$|E
