The site had a long occupational history stretching right through from the Middle Preclassic to the Early Postclassic, with two phases of greater activity in the Early Classic around AD 350 and in the Late Classic from AD 650830. The Terminal Classic occupation was largely limited to the lake shore but was fairly dense.

30|$|Time and {{temperature}} {{are two of}} the most important extrinsic factors affecting microbial growth, and generally, milk should be cooled to 4  °C within two hours of milking (Jay et al. 2005). In this study, between production and secondary collection, milk was held at an ambient temperature of between 28 and 32  °C for up to 12  h. This substantially increases microbial counts of the milk and accounts for significant increase in microbial loads from production to the <b>secondary</b> collection <b>centre.</b> There was indeed a significant relationship between time and TVC between production and the <b>secondary</b> collection <b>centre</b> despite the result having a low adj. R 2 which can be attributed to transforming microbial counts to log 10. Since the <b>secondary</b> collection <b>centres</b> have cooling facilities, microbial growth could be curtailed if milk was delivered less than two hours after milking. Cooling the milk to 4  °C overnight at the <b>secondary</b> collection <b>centre,</b> then transporting it to Nairobi at ambient temperature, a journey of seven hours, compounds the problem of increased microbial counts. In this study, regressing microbial counts against temperature was not found to have a significant relationship because of a small range in the milk temperature from production to <b>secondary</b> collection <b>centres.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>centres</b> {{generally}} {{appear at}} the epiphysis. Secondary ossification mostly occurs after birth (except for distal femur and proximal tibia which occurs during 9th month of fetal development). The epiphyseal arteries and osteogenic cells invade the epiphysis, depositing osteoblasts and osteoclasts which erode the cartilage and build bone. This occurs {{at both ends of}} long bones but only one end of digits and ribs.|$|R

Most of the remainder of a total population was in suburban villages along the southern shore of Belfast Lough. The Borough is heavily suburbanised, railway links with Belfast are good and the area has been the domain of Belfast commuters since the mid-19th century.
