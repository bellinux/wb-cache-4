40|$|Abstract This master thesis {{revolves}} around The Danish National Gallerys new project “Særlige Søndage” {{which is the}} museums rebranding and attempt to rethink the traditional guided tours. The new tours are focused on aesthetic elements and seeks to create an experience that awakens the senses more through performative means and methods. In the thesis I am shedding light on requirements, expectations and dilemmas concerning modern cultural institutions and the strategies that are implied to build new long lasting relations and experiences with the visitors. The goal of the thesis {{is to make the}} audience experience more prominent in the field and discussions of audience development. Therefore I have used quantitative and qualitative methods including survey, observations and a focusgroup in the search of knowledge about the actual audience experience that Særlige <b>Søndage</b> leads to. By the use of theory about participation, theatricality, performativity, involvement and experience economy I have made an analysis and discussion about the audience engaging piece Særlige <b>Søndage</b> and how it is experienced. The analysis shows that the experience is complex and contains many facets of both performative, educational, participatory, dialogical, entertaining and relationbuilding character with the potential to reach new visitors...|$|R

5000|$|S. Puglisi {{performed}} the first archaeological excavation in this area, excavating a 3 x 5 meter <b>sondage</b> {{with the intent}} of revealing its stratification. The next excavations in this area were conducted in 1966-8 by Francis Anfray, who uncovered a dwelling 250 meters west of Puglisi's trench that he described as a [...] "château", inhabited by one of the city's elite. Based on the evidence from these excavations, Butzer dated Anfray's dwelling to the seventh century; he pointed out that the masonry was similar to the base of St Mary of Zion church (which is part of the original structure that dated from Axumite times), while the floor plan was similar to the layout of the central block of the Ta'akha Maryam palace.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{discovered}} {{in the spring of}} 1925 by the local school teacher E. Thiersch. In the process of extending an existing storage yard adjacent to the mill, large numbers of bones had already been discovered and discarded since the autumn of 1924. First <b>sondages</b> by H. Hess von Wichdorff and A. Götze took place in 1925 and large scale archaeological excavations exposing 400 square meters were conducted by N. Niklasson and F. Wiegers in 1927. Unusual for the time, Niklasson and Wiegers employed a grid system, which allows for a reconstruction of the horizontal find distribution. A smaller geological sondage took place in 1962, followed by a small archaeological campaign in 2004. Since 2009 a collaborative effort headed by the MONREPOS Archaeological Research Center and Museum for Human Behavioral Evolution of the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz, the State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology of Saxony-Anhalt and Leiden University has resumed large scale excavations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{camp was}} {{discovered}} in 1985 by the Aerial archaeologist, [...] <b>Sondages</b> and especially magnetometer research during the investigations in the period 1986 to 1993 by the Landesamt für Denkmalpflege in Würzburg revealed an older, smaller camp, roughly nine hectares in area, and a larger, more recent camp, roughly 37 hectares in size. Of the smaller camp, only the ditch has survived; of the larger one there is a 2.8-metre-wide earth and wood wall and remains of the interior buildings. An architectonic feature is a praetorium (commandant's residence) oriented axially and joined to the principia (staff building). Such a central staff building {{is found in the}} Roman camp at Haltern. Along with the irregular ground plan and the design of the gate areas, this detail enables it to be dated to the time of Augustus. Six Roman coins and a terra sigillata stamp give a more precise date of 5 to 9 AD. In addition, soldiers' accommodation blocks (contubernia), defences and gate systems have been investigated.|$|E

40|$|Protekle sezone je na položaju Igrišče (k. č. 233, k. o. Kalnik) izvedena pretposljednja faza radova u sondi II, dimenzija 5 x 12 metara u tlocrtu (60 m 2). Ove su godine arheološka istraživanja u sondi II završena, a nakon završetka radova terenski je pregledan dio južnih obronaka brda Kalnik u dužini od 1, 6 km, na nadmorskoj visini od 480 do 600 metara. Terenski pregledom locirani su novi lokaliteti koji do sada nisu bili poznati. This year in <b>sondage</b> II, a {{thick layer}} of erosion was defined into which posts were dug. At this time these posts cannot be {{connected}} into groups which could serve to reconstruct the structure more precisely. A field survey covered 1. 6 km of the southern slopes of Mount Kalnik at 480 - 600 m above sea level. An extensive field survey in a forest is quite a demanding endeavour, made worse by the erosion amply present in this area. The preliminary results of the field survey indicate the western rim of the site, which can be placed on the position of a small and large meadow, where the <b>sondage</b> did not yield traces of archaeological material. The area east of the Igrišće site was surveyed up to the position of the old town of Kalnik, that is, the meadow beneath the town where ceramic material was discovered. In certain places it was possible to define the site 2 ̆ 7 s northern boundary, which spreads right along the cliffs at 600 m or more above sea level. Nevertheless, {{at the very top of}} the Kalnik ridge a few smaller plateaus can be seen where ceramic material from prehistory and antiquity was found (Pl. 1). The most numerous are finds from the Bronze Age, and there are also finds from the Late Iron Age, Antiquity and the Middle Ages...|$|R
40|$|Arheološka istraživanja na položaju Kalnik – Igrišče nastavljena su i 2013. godine, no u znatno manjem opsegu. Istraživanja su bila usmjerena na lokaciju gdje je terenskim pregledom 2012. godine prvi put otkrivena zidana konstrukcija s nalazima antičke i prapovijesne keramike. Osim arheoloških iskopavanja na položaju Kalnik – Wilhelm, na Igrišču su napravljena geofizička mjerenja. The archaeological {{excavations}} {{were carried}} out at the position first discovered in the 2012 field survey. The excavation was expanded {{at the place where}} the field survey ascertained the presence of a built structure with the remains of ancient and prehistoric pottery. The position lies 350 m east of the position of <b>sondage</b> II, next to a mountain house known as Wilhelm 2 ̆ 7 s House. The discovered built structure is aligned N-S, that is, follows the orientation of the terrace. The wall, which consists of irregular stones bound with mortar, descends in steps down the slope. It presently appears that the wall is 120 cm wide. The wall cut through a Bronze Age cultural layer into the virgin soil. Due to the exceptional value of the Kalnik-Igrišče position and the complexity of the stratigraphic layers, the archaeological excavations in the continuation of the 2012 <b>sondage</b> pit were not carried out. It transpired that other methods were more suitable in this phase of the investigation. We conducted geophysical measurements at two positions using the georadar method (GSSI SIR 3000, 400 MHz antena), the geoelectrical resistivity method (Geoscan RM 15) and the magnetic method (Geometrics G- 858). The measurements {{were carried out}} at two places, and the preliminary results of the processed data corroborate certain assumptions and offer new guidelines for the organization of archaeological excavations, but also point to new positions with distinct anomalies whose shape points to a thermoremanent type of magnetisation...|$|R

40|$|This paper gives {{account of}} two <b>sondages</b> which were {{conducted}} to add some concrete evidences to the hypotesis {{of the existence of}} a new Forum in the unexcavated area beyond the Decumanus of Sabratha, North to the Temple of Hercules. The chronological hiatus between the Ist and the VIth Century A. D. could confirm the hypothesis of a change {{in the use of the}} area from a block of private houses to an open public space in direct connection with the construction of the Temple of Hercules. A conspicuos alteration of the stratigraphic sequence was caused by the three burials. A cippus with a cross would have marked a christian zone of the cemetery. The chronology of the tombs (VI-VII Century A. D.) is the same of the three tombs exavated along the Temple of Hercules’ west precint wall. The new tombs confirm the hypothesis about the use of the Temple after his collapse: a christian building with a cemetery arranged among the ruins. The review of all the data coming from the <b>sondages</b> into some of the subterranean rooms of the “Casa della piscina” provide some relevant evidences to refine the house’s chronology, rejecting the erroneous definition of this building as a suburban villa of the I st Century A.

50|$|The {{resulting}} solution {{revolved around}} the method of single context recording. The practice involves drawing each feature individually in plan and then relating its position to the site grid rather than planning large areas at once. Each drawing is made on a square piece of translucent film representing a 5-metre x 5 metre grid square. The site is excavated down to the first significant layer of archaeology and features excavated and recorded as normal but also planned as single contexts. The site is then reduced to the next layer of archaeology and the process begins again. The excavation and recording can continue until natural deposits are reached. A small, deep trench known as a <b>sondage</b> is often excavated at first to provide {{a view of the}} entire stratigraphy at once and give an indication of the quantity of material to be excavated.|$|R

Beneath the filling, there are earlier construction phases of the naves. The recent <b>sondage</b> shows traces of an arched foundation on both sides. Possibly the second floor was carried on this. These vaults were subsequently filled and the columns of the Optimus phase erected on this filled surface. Three gates {{were added to the}} north wall of which the central one is 4 m wide and two were added to the south wall. The northern entrances open onto the central ceremonial court which is surrounded with an L - shaped portico. All the material of this court is reused from earlier buildings. In the north of the court a baptistery pool was added to the basilical complex and the foundations of a mosaic paved building beside the pool may possibly be a bishops residence.|$|R
