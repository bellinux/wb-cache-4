2500|$|The {{production}} aircraft were further modified with new TF33-P-11A engines that delivered even greater thrust {{than those of}} the prototypes. Foil systems developed in 1962 for the WC-130B to collect particulate debris from nuclear tests were installed in the bomb bay and the fuselage beside the cockpit. The wings had four hard points on which to mount the J60 engines and air particulate sampling pods, a gaseous <b>sampling</b> <b>system</b> was housed in the fuselage, and a KA-56 downward-looking panoramic camera mounted in the nose. Two aircraft were additionally modified to carry the Bulova 707-1000 long range camera, which had a 240-inch (608mm) focal length that resulted in its reference designation of Big Item. These high-altitude side-looking cameras, secured by a roll-stabilized mount, could take oblique shots at 5 to 15 degrees below the horizon up to [...] range from the aircraft and provide 30-inch (76cm) high resolution images. The electronics were also updated on the standard F model. The nose of the aircraft was lengthened to house sophisticated navigational equipment along with sensitive detection equipment for gathering SIGINT/ELINT intelligence. The cockpit was provided with a modified Lear MC-1 autopilot. [...] The average cost of each RB-57F conversion approximated $1.5 million.|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we shall lay bare {{the theory and}} {{implementation}} details of hexagonal <b>sampling</b> <b>systems</b> and hexagonal quadrature mirror filters (HQMF). Hexagonal <b>sampling</b> <b>systems</b> are of particular interest because they exhibit the tightest packing of all regular two-dimensional <b>sampling</b> <b>systems</b> and for a circularly band-limited waveform, hexagonal sampling requires 13. 4 percent fewer samples than rectangular sampling [1]. In addition, hexagonal <b>sampling</b> <b>systems</b> also lead to nonseparable quadrature mirror filters in which all basis functions are localized in space, spatial frequency and orientation [2]. This chapter is organized in two sections. Section I describes the theoretical aspects of hexagonal <b>sampling</b> <b>systems</b> while Section II covers important implementation details...|$|R

The IPM project has proposed the development of several new <b>sampler</b> <b>systems.</b> These systems include a 0. 5 -l supernatant sampler, 3 -l and 25 -l supernatant and sludge samplers, and a 4, 000 -l <b>sampler</b> <b>system.</b> The 0. 5 -l sampler will support IPM sampling needs in the 1 to 3 l range starting in late fiscal year 1995.
