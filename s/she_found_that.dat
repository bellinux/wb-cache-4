5|$|Despite {{favorable}} {{reviews of}} her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening {{health and the}} failure of her most recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that she could no longer dance. The news was devastating to her.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{dangerous}} {{days of the}} passage to Alexandria the passengers subsisted on oranges and wine. On board with the Smiths were the novelist Robert Liddell, the Welsh poet Harold Edwards, and their wivesâ€“ the Smiths shared a cramped cabin with the Edwardses. Mrs. Edwards had brought with her a hat box full of expensive Parisian hats, which Manning kept placing in the passageway outside the cabin, and from whence Mrs. Edwards kept returning it. The two were not on speaking terms {{by the end of}} the voyage, but Manning had the last word: when Mrs. Edwards later opened her hatbox <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Manning had crushed the hats with a chamberpot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began {{systematic}} studies on the mechanisms of the mosaic color patterns of maize seed and the unstable inheritance of this mosaicism. She identified two new dominant and interacting genetic loci that she named Dissociator (Ds) and Activator (Ac). <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the Dissociator did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the Activator was also present, which included making certain stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both Dissociator and Activator could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, weiss {{declares}} that while she's not a [...] "street poet" [...] {{in the traditional}} sense, her work resonates most in [...] "street" [...] settings or other unexpected places. <b>She's</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> her work is often most acclaimed, connected with and called for in places ranging from streets to pizza places to gay bars, drawing a large, diverse crowd.|$|R
5|$|The {{last time}} Riefenstahl saw Hitler {{was when she}} married Peter Jacob on 21 March 1944. Riefenstahl and Jacob {{divorced}} in 1946. As Germany's military situation became impossible by early 1945, Riefenstahl left Berlin and was hitchhiking {{with a group of}} men, trying to reach her mother, when she was taken into custody by American troops. She walked out of a holding camp, beginning a series of escapes and arrests across the chaotic landscape. At last making it back home on a bicycle, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> American troops had seized her house. She was surprised by how kindly they treated her.|$|E
5|$|These {{findings}} were contested {{a few years}} later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed Triceratops material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, although the distinctive skull of T. ("Nedoceratops") hatcheri differed enough to warrant a separate genus. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> T. horridus and several other species belonged together, and T. prorsus and T. brevicornus stood alone, and since there were many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant the two groups were two species. It is still possible to interpret the differences as representing a single species with sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old {{teacher at}} Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, found that her ninth-grade {{students}} {{were unable to}} read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook. She thought that, because her students were more familiar with television than poetry or short stories, she would have more success in teaching her students if she taught them {{by way of a}} television series. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> her students liked Bewitched, Room 222, and Julia, so she contacted the corresponding television studios to tell them about her idea. Only Bewitched responded. Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband William Asher, Saunders told the couple that most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that; less than 1% were reading at a ninth grade level. Saunders added that Bewitched was the students' favorite television series.|$|E
5000|$|Blessed Anna Maria Katherina Scherer (31 October 1825 - 16 June 1888) was a Swiss Roman Catholic professed {{religious}} and the {{co-founder of the}} Sisters of Mercy of the Holy Cross. <b>She</b> <b>founded</b> <b>that</b> order alongside the Capuchin priest Theodosius Florentini.

5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
5|$|Rohayah (also {{known by}} the pseudonyms Nyonya Eni and Siti Hayati; {{abbreviated}} Yah) is Tono's childhood friend and later lover, {{as well as a}} popular kroncong singer. After Tono, who is three years her elder, graduated from elementary school, Yah was forcibly married to a man twenty years her senior and brought from Bandung to Palembang. After escaping him and returning to Bandung, where <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> her parents had died, she moved to Batavia and became a prostitute; she also became a popular kroncong singer under the pseudonym Siti Hayati. When she discovers that Tono has become a doctor in Batavia, she pretends to be a patient and seduces him. Although the two fall deeply in love, Yah decides to leave Tono and move to New Caledonia because she feels that society would view the doctor poorly if he married a former prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Sharpeville {{massacre}} in 1960, Makeba {{learned that her}} mother had died. When she tried to return home for the funeral, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> her South African passport had been cancelled. Two of Makeba's family members were killed in the massacre. The incident left her concerned about her family, many of whom were still in South Africa, including her daughter: the nine-year-old Bongi joined her mother in the US in August 1960. During her first few years in the US, Makeba had rarely sung explicitly political music, but her popularity had led to an increase in awareness of apartheid and the anti-apartheid movement. Following the Sharpeville killings, Makeba felt a responsibility to help, as she had been able to leave the country while others had not. From this point, she became an increasingly outspoken critic of apartheid and the white-minority government; before the massacre, she had taken care to avoid overtly political statements in South Africa.|$|E

50|$|Merloni later {{joined the}} Figlie di Santa Maria della Divina Provvidenza - the order that Saint Luigi Guanella founded - {{and while there}} amongst the {{congregation}} in Como realized a call to form an order that would be devoted to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ. <b>She</b> <b>founded</b> <b>that</b> order - on 30 May 1894 - in Viareggio.

5|$|The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's {{suffrage}} activist from New York City, {{to investigate}} the lynching. She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there. After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May, she began her assignment in Waco, posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> almost all residents were reluctant to discuss the event. She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially reluctant to provide them. Although she feared for her safety, she enjoyed {{the challenge of the}} investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman convinced them that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north. Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents not to talk to outsiders. Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{and many}} {{concerned}} reformers had been attempting {{to improve the}} housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been in existence for twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban well-being, and {{the first of many}} tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed. From Hill's point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> their landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that the tenants were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves. She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself. John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her. As an aesthete and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of the slums. In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for Â£750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, Marylebone.|$|E

60|$|And then, from a {{word here}} and a word there, by horrified guesses and {{by a kind of}} instinctive surmise, she {{realised}} presently the whole truth of her father's life. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> Hamlyn's Purlieu was mortgaged for every penny it was worth, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> there was a bill of sale on the furniture, that money had been raised on the pictures; and, at last, that her mother's money, left in her father's trust to her and George, had been spent. And still Fred Allerton lived with prodigal magnificence.|$|R
25|$|Also in The Daily Telegraph, Rosa Prince {{singled out}} the film's lead character, Judy Hopps, as {{a welcome change}} for Disney {{animated}} feature film heroines, such as the Disney Princess franchise. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> unlike those characters' focus on romance or family loyalty, Hopps' focus is on her dream career {{as a police officer}} and serving her city.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, {{sociologist}} Harriet Presser {{analyzed the}} 1965 Master Sample Survey of Health and Welfare in Puerto Rico.

25|$|Wellington (1991) updated Brown et al.'s {{research}} with data through 1986 to provide new estimates encompassing {{a period when}} the real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) value of the minimum wage was declining, because it had not increased since 1981. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a 10% {{increase in the minimum}} wage decreased the absolute teenage employment by 0.6%, with no effect on the teen or young adult unemployment rates.|$|E
