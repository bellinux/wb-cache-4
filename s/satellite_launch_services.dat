40|$|Hu Jintao’s 2004 New Historic Missions {{highlighted}} the importance for China {{to protect its}} interests in Outer Space. The recognition {{of the importance of}} the Space operational domain has been subsequently reinforced in declaratory biannual Chinese White Papers, the PLA Military Strategic Guidelines and in PLA doctrine as a key element of China’s military strategy for fighting and winning local wars under informationized conditions. China is rapidly building sophisticated dual-use (military and civilian) space capabilities, including advanced counter-space systems that have been tested by the PLA since January 2007. However, as China adopts a greater regional role and begins to operate its military forces in the Far Seas, particularly in the Indian Ocean in support of the 21 st Century Maritime Silk Road, ensuring global C 4 ISR connectivity will demand the expansion of China’s dual-use space operations and capabilities. It will also reinforce a requirement for an expanded and more sophisticated PLA counter-space capability. This paper argues that expanding Chinese space capabilities will generate intensifying competition in Space between China and some of its neighbours across Asia, as well as the United States. However it also explores the possibility that China is likely to exploit a ‘space dimension’ of its proposed Asia-Pacific Dream to reinforce regional integration with like-minded neighbours through provision of space capabilities including <b>satellites,</b> <b>launch</b> <b>services,</b> and support infrastructure, suggesting the potential for a ‘Space Silk Road’ to emerge in the future. In this regard, China can be a provider of ‘public goods’ within the Space global commons to states along its periphery. Yet at the same time it will build a capability to contest access to that commons to its likely adversaries in the event of a conflict. China’s role in Space may therefore generate increasing contradictions and dilemmas that will reinforce strategic uncertainty in Asia...|$|R

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{increasing}} need for launch opportunities for CubeSats, SSC has initiated project Rainbow, a European launch capability for small <b>satellites</b> from its <b>launching</b> facility Esrange Space Center. Project Rainbow {{is part of}} a bigger project with the aim to establish Esrange as a center of excellence providing a multitude of <b>services,</b> including CubeSat <b>launch</b> <b>services,</b> to the scientific community as well as commercial customers. Today, there is already a queue of CubeSats looking for launch opportunities and a further increase is expected in the future. As the CubeSats and their applications become more sophisticated, the need to launch them into carefully designed orbits arises. Thus, {{there is a need for}} dedicated launchers for CubeSats which regularly launch into standardized orbits. Esrange is located in the very north of Sweden, above the Arctic Circle (68 °N, 21 °E) and has access to a vast, unpopulated recovery area. The facility has been operated since 1966 and is presently used for sounding rocket and balloon launches. It also hosts one of the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest civilian satellite ground stations. Esrange is undergoing a major modernization and upgrade to become a European center of excellence. Apart from the <b>launch</b> <b>service</b> for CubeSats, coordinated measurements using satellites, sounding rockets, balloons and/or ground instrumentation will be possible. The <b>launch</b> <b>service</b> from Esrange will enable a standardized orbit suitable for most CubeSats; sun-synchronous orbit at 500 km altitude (inclination = 97. 4 °) with the ascending node at 0600, 2200, and 1400 (2 ̆ 2 dawn-dusk 2 ̆ 2 orbit) Local Solar Time. By using the <b>launch</b> <b>service</b> on three consecutive launches a constellation of satellites covering every local time can be established. The launch periods, one to three per year, will be fixed. The total payload mass per launch is 150 kg. A phase A study with the aim to investigate if a <b>satellite</b> <b>launch</b> <b>service</b> can be implemented at Esrange shows that it is technically feasible. A phase B 1 study has recently been finalized which aimed for political endorsement, mainly in Sweden as well as obtaining data for the different launch vehicle options. As a result, a space investigation ordered by the Swedish government, published in 2015, recommends that a national coordinator is appointed with the task to, on behalf of the government, negotiate with relevant national and international stakeholders on the possibility of establishing a launch capability at Esrange. The evaluation of the launch vehicle options resulted in choosing the Brazilian/German VLM launcher as the base case. However, the final decision has not yet been taken and other launcher alternatives might be considered. The B 2 phase will commence in 2016 and will include flight safety risk assessment, design of infrastructure at Esrange and orbit raiser design (concept and main engine) if the need for an orbit raiser is verified. A preferable choice for an orbit raiser will be based on ECAPS 2 ̆ 7 High Performance Green Propulsion. Esrange will be a 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 launch site meaning that Hydrazine and other highly toxic substances will be banned. The goal is to <b>launch</b> the first <b>satellite</b> in 2020...|$|R

In the perspective of these emerging developments, it is therefore, felt that national space legislation should be enacted with the goal of building and implementing a vibrant and transparent legal framework at the national level to hasten investments and to ensure growth in this capital intensive - highly yield strategic sector.
