5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the Milky Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of the Milky Way.

5|$|As Roman {{troops were}} spread {{increasingly}} thin over its long border, the Empire's territory continued to dwindle in <b>size</b> <b>as</b> {{the population of}} the empire declined. Barbarian war bands increasingly began to penetrate the Empire's vulnerable borders, both as settlers and invaders. In 451, the Romans defeated Attila the Hun, but only with assistance from a confederation of foederatii troops, which included Visigoths, Franks and Alans. As barbarian incursions continued, some advancing as far as the heart of Italy, Rome's borders began to collapse, with frontier forces swiftly finding themselves cut off deep in the enemy's rear.|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain <b>size.</b> <b>As</b> brain size increased, this altered {{the size and shape of}} the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E

5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} the same <b>size</b> <b>as</b> the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only {{a small percentage of}} these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E

5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} from China to Britain {{for the first}} time. Superficially similar in appearance to an Aylesbury duck, a Pekin is white with orange legs and bill, with its legs near the rear, giving it an upright stance while on land. Although not thought {{to have such a}} delicate flavour as the Aylesbury, the Pekin was hardier, a more prolific layer, fattened more quickly, and was roughly the same <b>size</b> <b>as</b> an Aylesbury at nine weeks.|$|E

The combination of ditch and net-covered hoops is known as a pipe.|$|E

5|$|Muqarnas are elaborately carved {{ceilings}} to semi-domes, {{often used}} in mosques. They are typically made of stucco (and thus {{do not have a}} structural function), but can also be of wood, brick, and stone. They are characteristic of Islamic architecture of the Middle Ages from Spain and Morocco in the west to Persia in the east. Architecturally they form multiple tiers of squinches, diminishing in <b>size</b> <b>as</b> they rise. They are often elaborately decorated.|$|E

It is located on an 83cm (2.7ft) high platform, has three front doors and one central back door, and features a single-eave hip gable roof. The interior of the hall has only four support pillars. In order to support the large roof, diagonal beams are used. On each of the four walls are murals of arhats painted in 1429 during the Ming dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the time}} of its {{discovery}} in 1905, there have been many attempts to estimate the population size of this species. Results varied greatly, but the more recent ones suggest a very reduced number of individuals. This coupled with a very restricted distribution have led to the listing of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as an endangered or threatened species. Humans frequently invade its habitat, though such disturbances have been greatly reduced by preventive measures. Recent efforts in conservation include perpetuating the extant population at a baseline <b>size</b> <b>as</b> well as maintaining captive populations.|$|E
