500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Naomi sold a {{valuable}} painting to Paul {{in order to}} pay off her debts. However, the painting was given to her by Charles Tranner (David Whiteley), the married man she had an affair with, and his wife, Polly (Michelle O'Grady), soon turned up to reclaim the artwork. O'Reilly explained that as Charles was away on business, there was definite answer as to who the painting belonged to. She continued, [...] "Naomi says it was a gift, and belongs to her â€“ but Polly argues that Charles used family money to buy it, so she is the owner." [...] Polly and Naomi later ended up in a <b>scrag</b> fight, which had to be broken up the police. O'Reilly enjoyed filming the fight, saying she had [...] "a great time". The police eventually confiscated the painting and Paul demanded his money back. When Naomi was unable to pay him back, Paul asked her to spend the night with him and he would forget the debt. O'Reilly said while Naomi was not amused, part of her admired Paul's tenacity.|$|E

The whale categories he identifies are: BC 2A-Possible Odobenocetops, BC2B, Atlantic gray whale or <b>Scrag</b> Whale, BC 4B, as being similar to an unidentified large-finned beaked whale otherwise reported in the Pacific, and BC 5, the large Father-of-All-the-Turtles, as a humpback whale turned turtle.|$|E

40|$|Property {{modification}} {{factors have}} been introduced into the AASHTO Guide Specification for Seismic Isolation Design to account for likely variations in isolation bearing properties {{over the life of}} a seismically isolated bridge. The design of an isolated bridge in the United States must now account for variations in temperature, ageing, velocity (strain rate), travel, contamination, and <b>scragging.</b> In the absence of elastomer compound test data, the Guide Specification provides de facto values for likely variations in temperature, ageing, and <b>scragging</b> for use in design. Experimental data from tests of high-damping and lead-rubber bearings were analyzed to assess the de facto values listed in the Specification. The AASHTO values for the <b>scragging</b> factor should be increased from 1. 2 to between 1. 5 and 2. 0 for HDR-A elastomeric bearings and left unchanged for lead-rubber bearings. Full recovery of virgin (unscragged) properties following <b>scragging</b> should be assumed. No change in the AASHTO ageing factors for high-damping and lead-rubber bearings are recommended at this time. The data support the listing of a velocity (strain rate) factor in the Guide Specification with a value equal to 1. 2 for high-damping elastomer compounds...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{magnitudes}} of inelastic and viscoelastic {{effects in}} filled rubbers are small relative {{to that of}} the elastic response, these effects are nevertheless critical in applications such as gaskets, seals and dampers. This study investigates the role of deformation history on relaxation of rubber through time-dependent experiments following a range of deformation histories. Two grades of carbon-black filled EPDM were subjected to uniaxial tensile deformation followed by stress-relaxation or stress memory at fixed deformation. Stress relaxation was found to be highly dependent on strain levels following a single loading. When an additional load-unload cycle was added to the history, the rubbers relaxed an approximately constant fraction of stress after a given time, provided that the strain at stress relaxation was smaller than the historical maximum. This fraction was independent of both the applied strain and of the maximum strain, and suggests that the relaxation process is independent of <b>scragging</b> procedures used to control the modulus. Stress memory observed following load-unload cycles was also approximately independent of strain history...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, a coupled-mode {{technique}} {{is applied to}} the transformation of ship's waves over variable bathymetry regions, characterised by parallel depth-contours, without any mild-slope assumption. This method can be used, in conjunction with ship's near-field wave data in deep water or in constant-depth, as obtained by the application of modern (linearised or non-linear) ship computational fluid dynamic (CFD) codes, or experimental measurements, to support the study of wave wash generated by fast ships and its effects on the nearshore/coastal environment. Under the assumption that the ship's track is straight and parallel to the depth-contours, and relatively far from the bottom irregularity, the problem of propagation-refraction-diffraction of ship-generated waves in a coastal environment is efficiently treated in the frequency domain, by applying the consistent coupled-mode model developed by Athanassoulis and Belibassakis [J. Fluid Mech. 1999; 389] to the calculation of the transfer function enabling the pointwise transformation of ship-wave spectra over the variable bathymetry region. Numerical results are presented for simplified ship-wave systems, obtained by the superposition of source-sink Havelock singularities simulating the basic features of the ship's wave pattern. The spatial evolution of the ship-wave system is examined over a smooth but steep shoal, resembling coastal environments, both in the subcritical and in the supercritical case. Since any ship free-wave system, either in deep water or in finite depth, can be adequately modelled by wavecut analysis and suitable distribution of Havelock singularities e. g. as presented by <b>Scrags</b> [21 st Int. Conf. Offshore Mech. Arctic Eng., OMAE 2002, Oslo, Norway, June 2002], the present method, in conjunction with ship CFD codes, supports the prediction of ship wash and its impact on coastal areas, including the effects of steep sloping-bed parts.

40|$|This work employs five {{commercial}} carbon-black filled elastomers {{made from}} ethylene-propylene-diene, nitrile, butyl and natural rubber compounds to study different {{manifestations of the}} stress-softening phenomenon known as the Mullins effect. The structure of the materials was characterised using density, hardness, thermal analysis and microscopy. Cyclic tensile deformations under uniaxial, constant-width and equibiaxial models were used to study the mechanical response following different strain histories. The mechanical response and the energies stored and dissipated were both dependent on the strain history. Elastomers with no strain history exhibited a relatively constant dissipated energy fraction, which reduced to a lower constant fraction when the historical maximum strain was higher than the current maximum strain. A physically based modelling approach with a simple representation {{of the evolution of}} bound rubber was proposed to account for this. The approach was able to qualitatively reproduce the energy maps observed in the experimental data. A set of time-dependent test protocols were developed in both uniaxial and biaxial modes of deformation to investigate the effect of strain history on stress-relaxation and stress-memory following cyclic loading. All filled rubbers relaxed an approximately constant fraction of the stress after a given time when the applied strain during stress relaxation was smaller than the historical maximum. Under these circumstances the relaxed fraction was independent of both the strain history and the current strain, with important implications for <b>scragging.</b> An empirical function involving just five parameters was proposed to predict the fraction of unrelaxed stress for an arbitrary strain history. Stress memory was observed following unloading, with a recovered stress magnitude approximately independent of history. Anisotropy was investigated through linear dimensional swelling measurements. A degree of anisotropy was observed specific to the manufacturing process: compression moulding led to transverse isotropy, while sheet-rolling led to full anisotropy. Following a strain history, the anisotropy was shown to evolve further...|$|R
