5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth <b>simple</b> closed curve move in this way, the curve remains <b>simple</b> and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous curve evolution. If the curve is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint <b>simple</b> smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{is a more}} complex retrovirus, coding for several accessory proteins {{in addition to the}} structural proteins (Gag, Pol, and Env) that are found in all retroviruses. More complex retroviruses have not been isolated from birds, and <b>simpler</b> retroviruses have not been isolated from humans. However, the proviruses of many endogenous <b>simpler</b> retroviruses are present in the human genome. These observations suggest that humans can mount a successful protective response against <b>simpler</b> retroviruses, whereas birds cannot. Thus, humans might be able to mount a successful protective response to infection with a <b>simpler</b> HIV- 1. As a model, a <b>simpler</b> bovine leukemia virus which is capable of replicating has been constructed; a <b>simpler</b> HIV- 1 could be constructed in a similar fashion.

5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group {{can be dealt with}} the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of <b>simple</b> connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the <b>simple</b> framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected <b>simple</b> Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of <b>simple</b> connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of general relativity is that it {{can be applied to the}} universe as a whole. A key point is that, on large scales, our universe appears to be constructed along very <b>simple</b> lines: all current observations suggest that, on average, the structure of the cosmos should be approximately the same, regardless of an observer's location or direction of observation: the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. Such comparatively <b>simple</b> universes can be described by <b>simple</b> solutions of Einstein's equations. The current cosmological models of the universe are obtained by combining these <b>simple</b> solutions to general relativity with theories describing the properties of the universe's matter content, namely thermodynamics, nuclear- and particle physics. According to these models, our present universe emerged from an extremely dense high-temperature state –the Big Bang– roughly 14 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.|$|E
