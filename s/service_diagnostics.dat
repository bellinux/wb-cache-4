40|$|The {{technical}} service system of automobiles and its territory have been existing for almost hundred years since automobiles began to appear. This system {{was developed to}} ensure optimal usage of automobiles, their no-failure operation and longevity. The system envisages also optimal application of automobiles based on costs. Increasing the mileage between servicing, for instance, from 15000 km to 30000 km, {{it is possible to}} save resources for servicing two times. Nevertheless, according to the theory as well as practical provisory research repair costs of automobiles essentially increase, especially for car mileage exceeding five runs between servicing, for instance, 15000 km. The aim of the research is to compare the total sums of expenses for two {{technical service}}s of automobiles and the current repair in two different cases of technical service scenarios if the mileage is 210000 km: ♦ technical servicing is done after every 15000 km; ♦ technical servicing is done after every 30000 km. The object of the research is Dacia XXX (Sondero) with a 1. 4 l gasoline motor and Renault Laguna with a 1. 9 l Diesel motor. In both automobiles original spare parts will be used and they will be serviced at the dealers of these automobiles in Latvia. For the automobile Renault Laguna at more infrequent servicing (after every 30000 km) at the mileage 21000 additionally a turbine has to be replaced, full head repair including the replacement of valves, valve carriers has to be performed, the valves and the head have to be ground, the EGR valve has to be replaced. The basic reasons for these faults are too infrequent technical servicing and changing of oil. Additional costs for elimination of these faults in total comprise 1300 LVL. Savings from the omitted technical services for this automobile will be 7 * 75 = 525 LVL For the automobile Dacia Logan with more infrequent technical servicing at 21000 km mileage additionally the valves have to be changed, the head and the valves have to be ground that costs extra 360 LVL. Savings from the omitted technical services for this automobile will be 7 * 75 = 385 LVL Due to this it can be concluded that for automobiles with Diesel motors it is efficient to use less mileage in between servicing, for instance, 15000 – 20000 km, but for automobiles with gasoline motors without a turbine the mileage in between servicing can be also 30000 km at medium hard operation conditions.
