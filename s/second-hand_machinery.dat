2500|$|Church End Mill {{was built}} by William Redington, a miller from Harlow in 1822 for [...] John Fuller. It {{incorporated}} <b>second-hand</b> <b>machinery</b> from a smock mill [...] from an unknown location and {{the total cost of}} the mill was £564 10s 6d. In 1840, a new cast iron windshaft and Patent sails were fitted, but the windshaft snapped during a gale on 13 November, less than three months after it had been fitted. The sails landed on the outbuildings connected with the mill. The mill remained in the ownership of John Fuller until his death in 1887.|$|E

50|$|The Snake River Valley Sugar Company was a rival company presided by D. H. Biethan, a Utah egg merchant. With $700,000 {{in capital}} stock and based in Blackfoot, Idaho and the {{surrounding}} Bingham County, the stockholders were C. F. Hotchkiss from the East Coast, Blackfoot ranchers and businessmen, and European investors. They built a factory in Blackfoot with <b>second-hand</b> French <b>machinery</b> originally used in a factory in Binghamton, New York. The factory was completed November 1904 by Kilby Manufacturing Company from Cleveland, Ohio, using their experience building plants in Windsor, Colorado and Eaton, Colorado. The superintendent of the new plant was Henry Vallez, who had been chief chemist at the Utah Sugar plant in Lehi.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1807, Samuel Blodget {{completed}} a canal and lock system beside the Merrimack River at Derryfield. His enterprise allowed boats traveling between Concord and Nashua to bypass Amoskeag Falls, opening {{the region to}} development. Blodget envisioned here [...] "the Manchester of America," [...] a water-powered textile center comparable to the Industrial Revolution English city he had recently visited. The name stuck, and in 1810 Derryfield was changed to Manchester. That same year, Benjamin Prichard and others incorporated the Amoskeag Cotton & Woolen Manufacturing Company. He and three brothers—Ephraim, David and Robert Stevens—had purchased land and water power rights the year before {{on the west bank}} of the Merrimack near Amoskeag Bridge, where they built a mill. From Samuel Slater they bought <b>second-hand</b> mill <b>machinery,</b> but it didn't work well. In 1811, new machinery was built to spin cotton into yarn, the currency with which factory wages and dividends were paid. Weaving became a cottage industry for local women, who earned between 2 and 7 cents per yard, depending on the type of fabric. A good weaver could average 10 to 12 yd per day.|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{techniques}} {{were developed to}} quantify the probability of Tilletia indica entering and establishing in Western Australia (WA), and to simulate spread, containment, and {{the economic impact of}} the pathogen. Entry of T. indica is most likely to occur through imports of bulk grain or fertilizer (0. 023 ± 0. 017 entries per year and approximately 0. 009 ± 0. 009 establishments per year). Entry may also occur through straw goods, new or <b>second-hand</b> agricultural <b>machinery,</b> and on personal effects of travelers who have visited regions with infected plants. The com- bined probability of entry and establishment of T. indica, for all pathways of entry, is about one entry every 25 years and one establishment every 67 years. Alternatively, sensitivity analysis does show that increases in quarantine funding can reduce the probability of entry to about one entry every 50 years and less than one establishment every 100 years. T. indica is spread efficiently through contaminated farm machinery, seed and soil, rain, air currents, and animals. Depending on the rate of spread of the pathogen and the amount of resources allocated for detection, the time until first detection could range from 4 to 11 years and the econormc impact could range from 8 to 24 % of the total value of wheat production in WA...|$|R

There is a demand for high quality <b>second-hand</b> <b>machinery</b> in Iran.To date, doing business in Iran has had political overtones. In this regard, countries which can maintain a neutral and impartial political image in the Middle East are advantaged.|$|E
50|$|The {{fixed assets}} {{purchased}} may nowadays include substantial used assets traded on second-hand markets, the quantitatively most significant items being road vehicles, planes, and industrial machinery. Worldwide, this growing trade is worth {{hundreds of billions}} of dollars, and countries in Eastern Europe and Latin America, Russia, China, India and Morocco use large quantities of <b>second-hand</b> <b>machinery.</b> Often it is bought from Europe, North America and Japan, where fixed assets are on average scrapped more quickly.|$|E
5000|$|... ‘…Leeds {{is just as}} {{tranquil}} {{as though}} no Strike had ever been, and as though no ‘yeos’, ‘blues’ or bayonetteers had been imported…The bells ring and the shops open, and mill tyranny goes on, {{and those who have}} any employment go to it, and those who have none starve quietly and patiently in the streets…’. But the economic situation remained difficult for the manufacturers too. The Leeds Mercury in the late 1830s and early 1840s carried many public notices of auctions of the equipment of bankrupt firms, which showed that they had been using - and so were now dumping on the <b>second-hand</b> market - <b>machinery</b> made by Taylor Wordsworth and Co, among others. Wordsworth was one of six machine-makers who were reported by the Mercury to have gone to London in February 1843, to the Board of Trade, to ask Lord Ripon for the law to be changed to allow the export of English-made flax and tow machines - in view of ‘the depressed state of the trade in that important branch of manufacturing industry’. [...] This was a complete turn-around in the manufacturers' position; in January 1827 Taylor Wordsworth and Co had joined many other Leeds manufacturers in publicly lobbying against a planned Bill to legalise the export of machinery, noting that 'great Danger may accrue to the Manufacturing Interests of the Kingdom if such Bill passed into a Law'. [...] Times were hard. A 'calamitous fire' at the company's works in February 1844 didn't help; but the firm had invested in a Leeds Water Works Company 'Fire Plug' (an early sort of hydrant, located in the factory), which averted complete disaster and which the company warmly recommended to others in the newspaper's account. Joshua Wordsworth had been appointed a Director of the Leeds Water Works in 1841.|$|R

By 1907 it was being used as a studio and during World War II was used as an observation post, the cap having been removed by then. A new cap was fitted in 1974 by millwright Philip Barrett-Lennard. The mill has been house converted, with no machinery remaining inside.|$|E
40|$|The {{high cost}} of {{purchasing}} high technology and severe sanctions imposed on Iran {{over the last decade}} are the reasons why economical alternatives should be assessed, {{such as the use of}} second hand technology. There is evidence to show that in Iran the use of second-hand equipment in the petrochemical industry has become commonplace in recent years. Polypropylene (PP) and Methyl Tertiary-Butyl Ether (MTBE) are produced using second hand machinery purchased from a German company and recently used machinery transferred from an Indian company was utilized in the production line of Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK). In this research the three above-mentioned projects were evaluated to determine whether or not the use of <b>second-hand</b> <b>machinery</b> was economically justifiable. The method of research is descriptive analysis and output data will be estimated with Comfar software. The conclusion is that PP and MTBE projects could be justified from an economic perspective, but the MEK project failed in terms of profitability in the examined years...|$|E
