40|$|Genetic {{variability}} {{of a set}} of 81 accessions of ?<b>sweet?</b> <b>cassavas</b> (Manihot esculenta) collected mostly in the North region of Brazil was investigated with nine microsatellite loci. All loci were polymorphic, with mean of 6. 33 alleles per locus. Analyses indicated that 35 multiloci profiles were represented by a single accession, and 46 showed non-unique profiles, represented by eleven genotypes. Forty-six different multiloci profiles were detected. Most of the putative duplicated accessions were collected in different locations. After the removal of putative duplicated genotypes, genetic parameters were estimated and expected heterozygosity was high (HE= 0. 73), indicating genetic variability. Structure analysis of this set of ?<b>sweet?</b> <b>cassavas</b> divided the 46 genotypes into two clusters (K= 2), and a few genotypes had mixed ancestry.

50|$|Cassava, {{like other}} foods, also has antinutritional and toxic factors. Of {{particular}} concern are the cyanogenic glucosides of cassava (linamarin and lotaustralin). On hydrolysis, these release hydrocyanic acid (HCN). The presence of cyanide in cassava {{is of concern}} for human and for animal consumption. The concentration of these antinutritional and unsafe glycosides varies considerably between varieties and also with climatic and cultural conditions. Selection of cassava species to be grown, therefore, is quite important. Once harvested, bitter cassava must be treated and prepared properly prior to human or animal consumption, while <b>sweet</b> <b>cassava</b> can be used after simple boiling.|$|E

As to pathogen survival, four identical assays were installed in the microcosms, with four independent exposure periods (7, 14, 21 and 28 days). To identify volatile compounds, assays were performed under the same survival conditions, but using amber glass bottles and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and flame ionization detectors (GC-FID), and adopting the Solid-Phase Microextraction Technique - SPME. The treatments soil+plant materials, over the tested periods, reduced the survival of resistance structures for all fungi. In general, expressive results were found for broccoli and bitter cassava, as well as <b>sweet</b> <b>cassava</b> against S. rolfsii.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} the agro - industrial income and {{evaluating the quality of}} cassava minimally processed in minitolete and rubiene shapes. The assays were performed at the Academic Unit of Serra Talhada/ Federal Rural University of Pernambuco. Roots of <b>sweet</b> <b>cassava</b> cv.

Agroindustrial income, accumulated fresh weight, pH, soluble solids, soluble sugars and cooking time were evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomized in 2 x 6 factorial design, referring to shapes (minitolete and rubiene) and refrigerated storage times (0, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 days), respectively, with 3 replications. The agroindustrial income for each shape was calculated only at the end of minimal processing. The cooking time was measured at 0 and 11 days in 2 x 2 factorial design.

As {{an alternative to the}} expensive and energy demanding conventional hydrolysis process, the low-temperature hydrolysis is being studied. Granular Starch Hydrolysing Enzyme (GSHE) was used in the process to degrade starch into reducing sugar at 30 °C and pH 4. The substrates included bitter cassava flour, <b>sweet</b> <b>cassava</b> starch, and gadung flour. Starch concentrations studied were 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 g/L, respectively, while concentration of enzyme was 1. 5 % (w/w). The optimum condition of the process was hydrolysis using 200 g/L of substrate concentration and enzyme  concentration of 1. 5 % for 12 h. It was found that the reducing sugar was   49. 3   g/L and the productivity of reducing sugar (Qrs) was 4. 11 (gL- 1 h- 1).    Lineweaver-Burk plot of Michaelis-Menten equation was used to study the inhibition kinetics.

Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas, Super Taiwan variety), and cassava (Manihot esculenta) were used as test foods while white bread was used as the control food. Fifty-nine apparently healthy human adults were fed with the test foods for 90 days and grouped into three: Control, <b>Sweet</b> potato and <b>Cassava.</b> After an overnight fast, 10 mL blood samples were taken from the study partici pants for total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, glucose and hemoglobin A 1 C measurements. Height/weight and percent fat mass were also determined. The groups given <b>sweet</b> potato and <b>cassava</b> significantly increased HDL-C (P 0. 05).
