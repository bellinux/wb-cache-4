25|$|Finally, {{the basic}} oxygen process was {{introduced}} at the Voest-Alpine works in 1952; a modification of the basic Bessemer process, it lances oxygen from above the steel (instead of bubbling air from below), {{reducing the amount of}} nitrogen uptake into the steel. The {{basic oxygen process}} is used in all modern steelworks; the last Bessemer converter in the U.S. was retired in 1968. Furthermore, the last three decades have seen a massive increase in the mini-mill business, where <b>scrap</b> <b>steel</b> only is melted with an electric arc furnace.

500|$|The Port of Sheerness is a {{significant}} feature of the Isle of Sheppey's economy. Covering more than 1.5million square metres, {{it is one of}} the largest foreign car importers in the UK, and it handles thousands of tonnes of fruits and meat products from all over the world. Inexpensive land and good infrastructure, including a rail network that branches off the main passenger line, have attracted industries to the port area, including producers of pharmaceuticals, steel, sausages and garden gnomes. The major employers are HBC Engineering Solutions, Sheerness Steel, Regis Furniture and The Bond Group - although HBC has closed and the Steel plant is currently closed but is currently being changed and upgraded ready for reopening. The steel mill was established in 1972, designed to recycle <b>scrap</b> <b>steel</b> into rods and coils. It survived a number of closure threats and changes of ownership; from 2003 it was operated by Thamesteel. Thamesteel went into administration in January 2012, with the loss of 350 jobs.

40|$|The {{results from}} this study show that it is {{possible}} to obtain data series on the <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> collection based on mass balance model on the crude steel production figures by steelmaking reactor type and additional knowledge on process metallurgy as well as information on inputs and outputs into the reactors with an area correlation coefficient of 0, 91 compared to data obtained from trade statistics. Furthermore, the study shows that based on a new method it is possible to calculate the time duration of mass flows on a continuous basis. Furthermore, two complementary statistical dynamic material flow models that can be used to calculate the societal recycling rates of steel was constructed. These statistical models contribute to a standardized way of obtaining consistent results. The new models are able to segregate the non-recirculated amounts of steel into the hibernating steel stock available for future collection from the amounts of losses based on statistics. The results show {{that it is possible to}} calculate the amounts of <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> available for steelmaking at a given point in time. In addition, based on the new models it is possible to calculate recycling trends in society. Also, the models are able to calculate robust forecasts on the long-term availability of <b>steel</b> <b>scrap,</b> and test if forecast demand of <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> exceeds a full recovery. This due to that the <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> generation is a function of the collection rate of <b>steel</b> <b>scrap.</b> Also, a method for obtaining representative samplings on the alloy content in <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> called random sampling analysis (RSA) was developed.
