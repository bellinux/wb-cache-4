5|$|According to Peter Woolley, {{director}} of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, {{the situation of}} the election was similar to the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known <b>Senator</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Bradley</b> due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded that the tax increase had had no effect on Menendez's re-election chances.|$|E

500|$|New Jersey <b>Senator</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Bradley</b> {{published}} {{a volume of}} memoirs, Time Present, Time Past in 1996. [...] In it, the Democrat mentioned having written a high-school report on Hanna—his history teacher, Bradley related, {{told him that the}} lesson of the 1896 campaign is that money is power. [...] Bradley, a former basketball player, mentioned that when he was being interviewed in high school, he stated that Hanna was one of his heroes. [...] By the time he wrote the book, however, Bradley had come to believe in limits on campaign spending and blamed Hanna for a sharp escalation in campaign costs. [...] Bradley also stated what Horner terms mischaracterizations of Hanna: that he was the Republican boss of Ohio, and that he did his best to disrupt Roosevelt's presidency. [...] Bradley alleged that since 1896, Republicans have raised money easily from the rich. [...] Despite his condemnation of Hanna, Bradley wrote that he regretted that he could not find a Hanna-like figure who could play an analogous role in advancing his political career.|$|E
500|$|Gore {{faced an}} early {{challenge}} by former New Jersey <b>senator</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Bradley.</b> Bradley {{was the only}} candidate to oppose Gore and was considered a [...] "fresh face" [...] for the White House. Gore challenged Bradley {{to a series of}} debates which took the form of [...] "town hall" [...] meetings. Gore went on the offensive during these debates leading to a drop in the polls for Bradley. In the Iowa caucus the unions pledged their support to Gore, despite Bradley spending heavily in that state, and Bradley was much embarrassed by his two to one defeat there. Gore went on to capture the New Hampshire primary 53-47%, which had been a must-win state for Bradley. Gore then swept all of the primaries on Super Tuesday while Bradley finished a distant second in each state. On March 9, 2000, after failing to win any of the first 20 primaries and caucuses in the election process, Bradley withdrew his campaign and endorsed Gore. Gore eventually went on to win every primary and caucus and, in March 2000 even won the first primary election ever held over the Internet, the Arizona Presidential Primary. By then, he secured the Democratic nomination.|$|E
