500|$|New York {{magazine}} writer Steve Kendell said [...] "Jerry's Painting" [...] was {{an excellent}} episode, and that he appreciated seeing Leslie portrayed in a sexier and more confident way than previous episodes had. Joel Keller of TV Squad said the main story with Leslie was funny, but the subplot was even better. He said it showcased the deadpan comedic talents of Adam Scott, and that April and Andy continue to be an excellent pairing. The A.V. Club writer Claire Zulkey called the episode [...] "a pretty simple episode that got funnier and more quotable as the episode rolled on". She particularly praised Adam Scott's performance, but said <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> forward to the romantic pairing of Scott and Amy Poehler because she feels they lack chemistry. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said the episode featured great scenes about government inaction and the way small-time media can make a frenzy out of any minor thing. He also praised the subplot with April and Andy, which he said demonstrated how the two characters getting married hasn't at all changed who they are.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Dan Martin of The Guardian {{called it}} [...] "actually the best Christmas Special since 'The Christmas Invasion'" [...] {{and the first}} to be [...] "actually scary", with [...] "everything we like" [...] about Doctor Who and Christmas. He praised Coleman's introduction as Clara and the gang of Vastra, Jenny, and Strax. IGN's Matt Risley gave [...] "The Snowmen" [...] a score of 9.4 out of 10, describing it as [...] "a rollicking, riveting masterclass in storytelling" [...] which [...] "refreshingly" [...] lacked traditional Christmas references [...] "in favour of some sparkling dialogue, gorgeous set design and fascinating characterisation". While he felt that Grant and McKellen were underused, he was very positive towards Coleman's [...] "unpredictable" [...] Clara. Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was pleased with the return of the Great Intelligence despite an inconsistency in the timeline he found, and praised the [...] "lovely images" [...] and direction of the special, though he felt the variation of the theme music [...] "lacks the menace" [...] of the original. While he was positive towards Clara, he was [...] "unmoved by her death" [...] as it was [...] "plainly silly" [...] that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> injured.|$|E
500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Genie moved in, Marilyn {{taught her}} to direct her frustrations outward by {{generally}} [...] "having a fit." [...] Because Genie sought compliments on her appearance Marilyn began to paint Genie's fingernails and told her <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> good when she scratched herself, and when situations came up which especially upset Genie Marilyn tried to verbally deescalate her. Genie gradually gained more control over her responses and with prompting could verbally express frustration, although she never entirely ceased to have tantrums or engage in self-harm, and on occasion could indicate her level of anger; depending on whether she was very angry or merely frustrated, she either vigorously shook one finger or loosely waved her hand.|$|E
2500|$|As Jordan, Price was {{famed for}} her surgically {{enhanced}} breasts. At 19 {{she had the}} first in a succession of breast-enhancement surgeries, increasing her natural 32B to a 32FF. Unhappy with her breasts from an early age and despite her family's objections, she went ahead with the procedure because she felt that, as a glamour model, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> [...] "as sexy or [...] womanly" [...] as other models. She has since had many enhancements, as well as reductions, on her breasts in addition to later having liposuction on her hips and thighs, fat implanted into her lips to boost her pout, and a nose job. She told a reporter, [...] "Some people may be famous for creating a pencil sharpener. I'm famous for my tits." [...] Price was later barred from Page Three in The Sun with their adoption of a policy to only use [...] "all natural" [...] models.|$|E

50|$|When a young {{minstrel}} {{with a clean}} shaven face {{appears in}} the palace the next day, the king offers his daughter's hand in marriage.

However, he notes the poor cannot be choosy and agrees to marry her. She opposes vehemently because he is a commoner, but the king has given his word.
