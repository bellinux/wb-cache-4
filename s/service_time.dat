40|$|Queueing {{models have}} been used {{extensively}} {{in the design of}} call centres. In particular, a queueing model will be used to describe a help desk which is a form of a call centre. The design of the queueing model involves modelling the arrival an service processes of the system. Conventionally, the arrival process is assumed to be Poisson and <b>service</b> <b>times</b> are assumed to be exponentially distributed. But it has been proposed that practically these are seldom the case. Past research reveals that the log-normal distribution can be used to model the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> in call centres. Also, services may involve stages/tasks before completion. This motivates the use of a phase-type distribution to model the underlying stages of service. This research work focuses on developing statistical models for the overall <b>service</b> <b>times</b> and the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> by job types in a particular help desk. The assumption of exponential <b>service</b> <b>times</b> was investigated and a log-normal distribution was fitted to <b>service</b> <b>times</b> of this help desk. Each stage of the service in this help desk was modelled as a phase in the phase-type distribution. Results from the analysis carried out in this work confirmed the irrelevance of the assumption of exponential <b>service</b> <b>times</b> to this help desk and it was apparent that log-normal distributions provided a reasonable fit to the <b>service</b> <b>times.</b> A phase-type distribution with three phases fitted the overall <b>service</b> <b>times</b> and the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> of administrative and miscellaneous jobs very well. For the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> of e-mail and network jobs, a phase-type distribution with two phases served as a good model. Finally, log-normal models of <b>service</b> <b>times</b> in this help desk were approximated using an order three phase-type distribution...|$|R

5|$|Not {{only was}} the Dutch Army poorly equipped, it was also poorly trained. There had {{especially}} been little experience gained in the handling of larger units above the battalion level. From 1932 until 1936, the Dutch Army did not hold summer field manoeuvres in order to conserve military funding. Also, the individual soldier lacked many necessary skills. Before the war {{only a minority of}} young men eligible to serve in the military had actually been conscripted. Until 1938, those who were enlisted only served for 24 weeks, just enough to receive basic infantry training. That same year, <b>service</b> <b>time</b> was increased to eleven months. The low quality of conscripts was not compensated by a large body of professional military personnel. In 1940, there were only 1206 professional officers present. It had been hoped that when war threatened, these deficiencies could be quickly remedied but following the mobilisation of all Dutch forces on 28 August 1939 (bringing Army strength to about 280,000 men) readiness only slowly improved: most available time was spent constructing defences. During this period, munition shortages limited live fire training, while unit cohesion remained low. By its own standards the Dutch Army in May 1940 was unfit for battle. It was incapable of staging an offensive, even at division level, while executing manoeuvre warfare was far beyond its capacities.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study single-server tandem queues with general <b>service</b> <b>times</b> and finite buffers. Jobs are served {{according}} to the Blocking-After-Service protocol.

40|$|Motivated by {{large-scale}} service systems, {{we consider}} an infinite-server queue with batch arrivals, where the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> are dependent within each batch. We allow the arrival rate of batches to be time varying {{as well as}} constant. As regularity conditions, we require that the batch sizes be i. i. d. and independent of the arrival process of batches, and we require that the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> within different batches be independent. We exploit a recently established heavy-traffic limit {{for the number of}} busy servers to determine the performance impact of the dependence among the <b>service</b> <b>times.</b> The number of busy servers is approximately a Gaussian process. The dependence among the <b>service</b> <b>times</b> does not affect the mean number of busy servers, but it does affect the variance of the number of busy servers. Our approximations quantify the performance impact upon the variance. We conduct simulations to evaluate the heavy-traffic approximations for the stationary model and the model with a time-varying arrival rate. In the simulation experiments, we use the Marshall–Olkin multivariate exponential distribution to model dependent exponential <b>service</b> <b>times</b> within a batch.
