50|$|In {{telecommunication}} and horology, a <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> is a {{clock that}} depends for its accuracy on another clock, a master clock. Many modern clocks are synchronized, either through the Internet or by radio time signals, to a worldwide time standard called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) {{based on a}} network of master atomic clocks in many countries. For scientific purposes, precision clocks can be synchronized to within a few nanoseconds by dedicated satellite channels. <b>Slave</b> <b>clock</b> synchronization is usually achieved by phase-locking the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> signal to a signal received from the master clock. To adjust for the transit time of the signal from the master <b>clock</b> to the <b>slave</b> <b>clock,</b> the phase of the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> may be adjusted {{with respect to the}} signal from the master clock so that both clocks are in phase. Thus, the time markers of both clocks, at the output of the clocks, occur simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|These older {{styles of}} <b>slave</b> <b>clocks</b> either keep time by themselves, and are {{periodically}} corrected by the master clock, or require impulses from the master clock to advance. Many <b>slave</b> <b>clocks</b> {{of these types}} remain in operation, most commonly in schools.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{proposes to}} combine the IEEE 1588 {{protocol}} and the adaptive oscillator correction method (AOCM) to improve master-slave synchronization. This is done by extending the AOCM to a <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> to train a model using the IEEE 1588 synchronization updates from a master clock. The model corrections are applied to the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> during the waiting period in between the synchronization updates and when the slave-master network experiences an outage. The NS- 2 {{results indicate that the}} slave accuracy improves up to 10 times for no traffic networks depending on the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> training period. In traffic scenarios, the slave accuracy is affected by the asymmetric delays such that the degree of accuracy is one half of the asymmetric latencies. During network congestion, the slave accuracy improves because the delays are less asymmetric. During an outage in a traffic scenario, the solution only improves the <b>slave</b> <b>clock</b> stability. iii Acknowledgements I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Thomas Kunz fo...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two prime contributions. First, digital filters {{for both}} intermediate and base band filtering for mobile communication are presented. Second, a local clock for on-chip clock generation is introduced. The intermediate frequency filter is a digital alternative to today's analog filters. It is a narrow band filter {{designed for the}} American digital mobile telephone system according to the IS- 54 specification. The digital base band filters are designed for use in some wide band research systems. Both the narrow band and the wide band filters use a wave digital lattice structure realized with bit-serial arithmetic. The <b>clock</b> <b>generator</b> is developed to increase the throughput in bit-serial designs such as the intermediate and the wide band filters above. It is a counter based <b>clock</b> <b>generator</b> i. e the counter stops a ring oscillator after the correct number of cycles has been generated. The generator is a digital alternative to analog on-chip generators as for instance PLL's. The clock is local and occupies only a small area. Several <b>clock</b> <b>generators</b> can, therefore, be used on the same die. All work presented in this thesis is fabricated and tested in a standard 5 volt CMOS processes. The IS- 54 filter is a a twelfth order narrow band filter with 20 kHz band width and a center frequency of 95 kHz. The wide-band filters are designed for two different systems; the first system is designed for 20 MHz modulated band width {{and the second is}} designed for 2 MHz modulated band width. The <b>clock</b> <b>generator</b> is used in all the filter designs and it is also tested separately in a 385 MHz <b>clock</b> <b>generator.</b> The power consumption is low. Another more important property with respect to the power consumption is that the <b>clock</b> <b>generator</b> is suitable for low supply voltage applications.
