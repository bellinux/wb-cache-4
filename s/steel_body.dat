5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> panels.|$|E

25|$|While {{most parts}} of the Komodo are made locally in Indonesia such as the frame, body and design, Pindad has {{publicly}} stated that they used imported components such as Hino for machinery parts and Michelin for the tires. Its diesel engines were imported directly from Renault. The Komodo's monocoque <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> was made locally by Krakatau Steel. The Indonesian Army's Research and Development Department or Dislitbang TNI AD has officially certified the Komodo as a road worthy vehicle after Pindad conducted static and dynamic tests.|$|E
25|$|The Audi V8 had a {{galvanized}} <b>steel</b> <b>body,</b> with a 10-year anti-perforation warranty (against corrosion). The Audi V8 {{was specifically}} {{designed to be a}} top of the range 'flagship' car and included a number of luxury features as standard equipment, including leather seating and Audi's quattro all wheel drive system (see standard features list). The Audi V8 created a new elevated image for the company, providing a viable alternative to established competitors such as Mercedes-Benz. In this regard, the car was a cornerstone in developing the history of the Audi marque as it is today.|$|E

25|$|Fitch went on {{to design}} and build a {{prototype}} of the Fitch Phoenix, a Corvair-based two-seat sports car, superficially resembling a smaller version of the Mako Shark based Corvette. With a total weight of , even with a <b>steel</b> <b>body,</b> and with the Corvair engine modified with Weber carburetors to deliver , the car delivered spirited performance for $8,760. The ability to produce automobiles on a small scale, along with Chevrolet's decision to terminate production of the Corvair, meant the end of Fitch's plan. He still retained the prototype, and occasionally exhibited it at car shows until his death. One June 1, 2014, the Fitch Phoenix when to auction at Bonhams in the Greenwich Concours and sold for 230,000 US dollars. The car is still in Connecticut with the new owner.|$|E
25|$|The Land Rover was {{designed}} to only be in production {{for two or three}} years to gain some cash flow and export orders for the Rover Company so it could restart up-market car production. Once car production restarted, however, it was greatly outsold by the off-road Land Rover, which developed into its own brand that remains successful today. Many of the defining and successful features of the Land Rover design were in fact the result of Rover's drive to simplify the tooling required for the vehicle and to use the minimum amount of rationed materials. As well as the aluminium alloy bodywork (which has been retained throughout production despite it now being more expensive than a conventional <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> due to its ideal properties of light weight and corrosion resistance) other examples include the distinctive flat body panels with only simple, constant-radius curves (originally used because they could be cut and formed by hand from aluminium sheet on a basic jig) and the sturdy box-section ladder chassis, which on Series vehicles was made up from four strips of steel welded at each side to form a box, thus cutting down on the complex welding operations required when making a more conventional U- or I-section frame.|$|E

[...] The lightweight construction introduced to mainline service by the Zephyr trainsets became the standard for new railcars used with the new EMC-powered Diesel streamliners such as the AT Super Chief.|$|E
500|$|Ten months later, 4876 was {{returned}} to service, repainted in Tuscan red. It stayed in service until 1983 when she was retired and donated for preservation. Originally planned for donation to the Smithsonian Institution, it was ultimately donated to the B Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. Initially, the museum planned on restoring 4876 and putting it on display, however, these plans were placed on hold indefinitely when the museum's roundhouse roof collapsed in 2003, and the museum is currently focusing its efforts on restoring the equipment damaged by the collapse. [...] The locomotive has been stored outside since it was acquired by the museum, has become defaced with graffiti and parts of its <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> are corroded.|$|E

50|$|The {{business}} environment for Europe's luxury car makers had changed fundamentally {{by the end}} of the Second World War. The principal auto-makers for whose cars Vanvooren had built bespoke bodies in the 1930s had either withdrawn completely from the car business, as was the case of Hispano-Suiza who were now focused on aircraft engines, or were beginning to offer customers complete cars, producing <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> themselves. That was the case with Rolls-Royce-Bentley whose Bentley Mark VI appeared in 1946, no doubt drawing on lessons supplied by Vanvooren's <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> supplied to Rolls-Royce in the 1930s.|$|R
2500|$|To achieve maximum body {{stiffness}} with controlled deformation crumple zones, the B7 RS4 features {{laser beam welding}} of major seams of the high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> shell, which helps improve overall structural rigidity, particularly in the [...] "passenger cell", over traditional spot welding methods.|$|E

5000|$|In 1923, Citroën {{returned}} to United States, where {{this time he}} began a business relationship with American engineer Edward Gowen Budd. [...] From 1899, Budd had worked to develop stainless <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> for railroad cars, for the Pullman in particular. Budd went on to manufacture <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> for many automakers, Dodge being his first big auto client. In Europe the Citroën B10 was the first car to use an [...] "all-steel" [...] ("tout-acier") body. [...] Although individual flat sheets of steel were structurally weak and prone to deform under pressure, once a steel sheet was stamped into a three-dimensional shape it became much more rigid, and by welding {{a number of these}} three-dimensional sheets together it became possible to create a car body stronger than a traditional timber framed car body, but one that weighed much less, so that the cars that used all <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> could be powered by smaller cheaper engines, or else provide more speed and better fuel economy.|$|R
