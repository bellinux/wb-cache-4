5|$|The series {{concerns}} Phineas's {{attempts to}} avoid boredom by finding <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> do {{for each day}} of his summer vacation. His sister's name is Candace Flynn, who tries to reveal their outrageous creations, but to no avail. He does this with his less-talkative stepbrother Ferb, and often with many other neighborhood children. The activities they devise usually involve outlandish contraptions, including roller coasters, haunted houses, roller rinks, and a backyard beach etc. which Phineas designs and Ferb builds.|$|E
5|$|Pick had {{not been}} well for some years. The {{stresses}} of his war work took a further toll on his health and he lost two stone during his travels {{around the country to}} research his report on the canal industry. Although exhausted {{at the end of the}} tour, he wrote to friends that he was struggling with the idleness and was hoping for <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> do. He died at his home, 15 Wildwood Road, Golders Green, on 7 November 1941 from a cerebral haemorrhage. His funeral was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 11 November 1941 and a memorial service was held at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square on 13 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Lathbury, {{comprised}} the 1st, the 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, the 1st(Parachute) Squadron, Royal Engineers and the 1st(Airlanding) Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery. The airlanding anti-tank battery were {{equipped with the}} 1st Para Brigade's only anti-tank guns, the British 6pounder. Despite the formation being a parachute brigade, {{the only way to}} transport the anti-tank guns and the jeeps required to pull them when they had landed, was by glider. Transporting artillery by air was <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the British or any other army, and this would be the first time that any artillery guns had ever been flown into combat.|$|E

25|$|A {{stranger}} is {{far enough}} away that he is unknown but close enough {{that it is possible}} to get to know him. In a society there must be a stranger. If everyone is known then there is no person that is able to bring <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> everybody.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, <b>something</b> <b>new</b> {{happened}} <b>to</b> Karin Swanström: {{she got her}} own {{comedy series}} at Oscarsteatern (The Oscars Theater) in Stockholm and it lasted from 1926 until 1931.|$|R
5000|$|Rock {{historian}} Michael Uslan {{has stated}} that songs similar to [...] "Doggie" [...] led to the [...] "fervent embrace of rock & roll" [...] two years after its release. [...] "A lot of songs at that time were extremely bland, squeaky-clean stuff. The music field was ripe for <b>something</b> <b>new,</b> <b>something</b> vibrant <b>to</b> shake the rafters." ...|$|R

25|$|In the {{particular}} example of Sardar-e Bozorg ab anbar in Qazvin, the storage space was built {{so large that}} it {{became known as the}} largest single domed ab anbar of Iran. Doming the square plan was not an easy task, yet dome construction was not <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> these architects as is evident from the numerous domed masterpieces such as Soltaniyeh.|$|E
25|$|While {{receiving}} {{input from}} the listeners, the winner is picked solely by the XR4TI and is announced in the last segment of the show. There is no strict time limit, but Rome will run a caller if they start rambling too long. The winning criteria is subjective, as there are no set rules or criteria. However, the winning call is typically the person who comes up with some original smack for the other top callers, mixes in some sports takes, and brings <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the event.|$|E
25|$|The European Super Cup {{was created}} in 1971 by Anton Witkamp, a {{reporter}} and later sports editor of Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. The idea came {{to him in a}} time when Dutch total football was Europe's finest and Dutch football clubs were living their golden era (especially Ajax). Witkamp was looking for <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> definitely decide which was the best team in Europe and also to further test Ajax's legendary team, led by their star player Johan Cruyff. It was then proposed that the winner of the European Cup would face the winner of the European Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

25|$|DreamWorks began {{production}} in 2001, which was actually {{before the first}} film was even completed. DreamWorks made sure there was <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> see in Shrek 2 by putting more human characters in the film than there were in its predecessor and improving their appearance, {{with the use of}} a few systems that dealt with hair and fur to improve its appearance and movement. The set up for all the characters was done in the first three years of production. Puss in Boots required a whole new set of tools in the film to handle his fur, belt and feather plume in his hat. The character also required an upgrade in the fur shader for his introduction in the film.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{the damage}} {{incurred}} in the Battle of the Yellow Sea led the NTC to another incorrect conclusion. The NTC tacticians noted that a single artillery hit in the mast of Tsesarevich nearly knocked it down; a fallen mast would, most likely, disable the secondary artillery turrets of its central citadel. Lattice masts, introduced with the American s, {{seemed to be a}} robust solution. However, they required substantial deck area to fit their wide bases. Instead of clearing deck space, the NTC designed the masts too narrow to be stable. Instead of Shukhov's hyperboloid profile, their structural beams were arranged in a weaker conical shape. Their deficiency was evident from the start, but the Navy needed <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> dispel the curse of Tsushima, and eagerly accepted the flawed novelty.|$|E
500|$|The {{audience}} reacted immediately; Charles {{could feel}} the room shaking and bouncing as the crowd was dancing. Many audience members approached Charles {{at the end of}} the show to ask where they could purchase the record. Charles and the orchestra performed it again several nights in a row with the same reaction at each show. He called Jerry Wexler to say he had <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> record, later writing, [...] "I don't believe in giving myself advance notices, but I figured this song merited it".|$|E

500|$|Gilbert {{oversaw the}} designs of sets and costumes, and he {{directed}} the performers on stage. He sought realism in acting, shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity. Gilbert insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions, which was <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> many actors of the day. Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation. The result was a new crispness and polish in the English musical theatre. As Jessie Bond wrote later: ...|$|E
500|$|The English {{courts have}} held {{that there is nothing}} wrong with a public {{authority}} adopting a policy to base its decisions on as long as the authority does not refuse to listen at all to anyone who has <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> say. Both the English and Singapore positions are similar in that they both regard consideration of exceptional cases as the benchmark for whether discretion has been fettered. In R. v. Port of London Authority, ex parte Kynoch, Ltd. (1918), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that: ...|$|E
500|$|The House of Lords {{agreed with}} ex parte Kynoch in British Oxygen Co. Ltd. v Minister of Technology (1970). The {{court held that}} there was nothing to stop the Minister from {{requiring}} the operation of some limiting rule if that is what policy or good administration requires. It also reiterated that for discretion to be unfettered, consideration must be given to exceptional cases. [...] "What the authority must not do is to refuse to listen at all. There can be no objection to , provided the authority is always willing to listen to anyone with <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bradley [...] "Brad" [...] Cooper, {{played by}} Parry Shen, was {{introduced}} to the series on February 13, 2013. However, Parry Shen took over the role in May 2013. The role was originated by an unknown actor on February 13, 2013. Shen stepped into the role on May 3, 2013. [...] "I was kind of getting bored and looking for <b>something</b> <b>new.</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> challenge me and get me scared," [...] Shen said of his reason for taking the role. When he auditioned, Shen was told that the role was recurring and didn't expect it to last long.|$|R

500|$|Critics commended {{various aspects}} of the gameplay. Calvert enjoyed the wide {{customization}} options and large number of piñata variations, stating that the gameplay itself was [...] "silky smooth". Brudvig noted that there was a [...] "ton to do"; he praised the encouragement of discovery and stated that it was [...] "constantly filled with moments where you find <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> do". Tuttle commended the large number of piñatas, stating that finding managing all of the resources is [...] "a lot of work". Villoria praised the [...] "surprisingly deep" [...] strategic gameplay, saying {{that it was one of}} the most [...] "entertaining and fulfilling" [...] experiences for the Xbox 360.|$|E
500|$|Chuck Campbell {{from the}} California Chronicle {{felt that the}} main [...] "trick" [...] adopted by the {{producers}} behind The Remix, was to preserve the integrity of Gaga's nuances in her songs, {{at the same time}} bringing <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> her music. The second song in the track list, the [...] "LLG vs GLG Radio Mix" [...] of [...] "Poker Face", features a computerized chanting of the [...] "mum-mum-mum-mah" [...] hook of the song. Stuart Price remixed [...] "Paparazzi" [...] into an electronic version, changing the original mid-tempo composition of the song. New vocals were added on top of the song, giving it a jungle-like vibe, according to Nicki Escuerdo from Phoenix New Times. She also felt that the remix of [...] "LoveGame" [...] featuring Manson, changed the original composition by [...] "giving the originally innocent and fun song an almost demonic quality".|$|E
500|$|The central premise {{behind the}} story of [...] "The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor" [...] was to {{showcase}} both the true danger posed by the Flood and {{the inner workings of}} the Covenant military machine, to dispel the image that the Covenant [...] "simply stand around waiting for the Chief to blast them". The story was written by Lee Hammock with art provided by Simon Bisley. Hammock described the process of writing the story as a [...] "heady task" [...] since he had to respect Halo fans' knowledge of the characters and canon, ensuring that [...] "characters that [...] know as a part of themselves are portrayed aptly". These difficulties were mitigated by the knowledge that fans were not as intimately connected to the history of the character of Rtas as they were to the likes of the Master Chief; this allowed ample room to expand 'Vadumee's background in sync with the Halo canon while permitting the writer to [...] "bring <b>something</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the table".|$|E
5000|$|In De Homine XII, Hobbes {{discussed}} the “joy” of “admiration” again contrasting humans to other animals. Hobbes argues that [...] "...this passion is almost peculiar to men." [...] He {{pointed out that}} [...] "even if other animals, whenever they behold <b>something</b> <b>new</b> or unusual, admire {{it as far as}} they behold <b>something</b> <b>new</b> or unusual" [...] so that they can determine if it dangerous or harmless, men on the other hand, [...] "when they see <b>something</b> <b>new,</b> seek <b>to</b> know whence it came and to what use they can put it." ...|$|R
