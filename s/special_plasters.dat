50|$|In 1956 the Archaeological Department {{found out}} some {{remnants}} of frescoes belong to 3rd century AD on vaulted ceiling of a cave in Gonagolla temple. The frescoes {{have been drawn}} on a <b>special</b> <b>plastered</b> surface and depict a scene of young female dancer {{and a man who}} is alleged to be a Bodhisattva. The female figure is almost identical to famous Sigiriya maidens (5th century) and both figures have been painted using red, yellow, green and white colors with sharp margins. Due the frescoes, this temple is called Punchi Sigiriya (Little Sigiriya) by locals. Except these frescoes there are some pre-historic paintings drawn by Vedda people can be seen in few rock caves of temple premises.|$|R

As a new self-Insulation wall material, the {{autoclaved}} {{aerated concrete}} block has many advantages such as lightweight, thermal insulation, waste recycling, low energy consumption, friendly to environment, etc. It is gaining favors in the construction market day by day, and has been more and more widely used in construction engineering program. However, aerated concrete block faces disadvantages, e. g. large volume deformation coefficient, high water absorption, low strength, brittle character, etc. When aerated concrete block is used in combination with plain mortar, many problems may appear due to the incompatibility between them, for example crevices on the wall, large cracking, hollowing and exfoliation on the plaster layer, which become more serious on the north-facing wall in the cold region. These problems greatly hinder the wide application of aerated concrete block. Therefore, {{it is critical to}} develop a <b>special</b> <b>plaster</b> mortar that is compatible with the aerated concrete block. This paper concentrates on the chemical admixtures such as polymer and fiber, and studies their influences on the performance of the <b>special</b> <b>plaster</b> mortar. The experimental results show that polymer powder can significantly improve the properties of plaster mortar such as bonding strength, absorption performance and cohesive quality. Also, it prevents the bleeding and segregation of the paste, prevents the hollowing and exfoliation of plaster mortar layer on aerated concrete block wall. Polypropylene fiber has been revealed to increase the fracture toughness and cracking resistance of plaster mortar, thus preventing the cracking of plaster mortar layer on aerated concrete block wall. Additionally, this paper presents the microstructure of plaster mortar and discusses the working mechanism of admixtures in the mortar...|$|R

The results demonstrate {{that in the case}} of coatings with high gloss values leads to a linear increase of chroma depending on the lightness values in the case of measuring devices fitted diffusion geometry. Conversely, if the angle-measuring instrument fitted geometry values of specific purity correlated with values of specific brightness. Analysis BRDF, respectively BSRDF function showed that the previously used dichromatic spectral reflectance model must be extended by an additional parameter explaining the correlation between chroma and lightness at the di: 8 measurement geometry...|$|R
40|$|The best {{currently}} available transparent insulation materials (TIM) are characterised by a diffuse radiation transmission value of around 75 % and a thermal conductivity value below 1 W/(qmK). As an additional transparent cover (glass, <b>special</b> <b>plaster)</b> {{is needed for}} potection against the weather in outdoor applications, the radiation transmission decreases. However, the U-value is simultaneously improved by resulting airgaps and devices for temporary thermal insulation (mechanical blinds, etc.). In a series of demonstration projects, the first TIM facade systems were tested in operation and their functionality was confirmed. The shading devices guaranteed thermal comfort in summer but improvements are necessary for higher reliability for particular application conditions. By using TIM, together with conventional measures, in the renovation of an existing building in Freiburg, a specific heating energy consumption of 43 kWh/(qma) was achieved, a reduction of about 80 % relative to the o riginal consumption of the building. The "self- sufficient solar house" in Freiburg, which is being built at present, will demonstrate that with TIM and the latest technology for energy saving and solar energy use, a residential building can meet all its energy needs by the solar radiation incident on its outer surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} models for making removable partial dentures. Methods: In this Study, 140 models were analysed in 05 dental prosthesis laboratories {{in the city of}} Teresina, Piauí, Brazil, registered with the Conselho Regional de Odontologia. A form containing 14 closed questions was applied, and the data collected were submitted to statistical analysis using the SPSS program. The models were analysed under natural or artificial light and photographed for record and illustration purposes. Results: The results showed that in 100 % of the cases the molding material used was alginate, and 93. 43 % of the models were poured by the dentist. Of these, 64. 47 % were poured in stone plaster and 36. 43 % in <b>special</b> <b>plaster.</b> According to criteria such as surface quality, reproduction of details, presence of bubbles and/or nodules, adequate reproduction of the edentulous area, 78. 57 % of the models were considered inadequate. The majority of the models (96. 43 %), were mounted in an articulator by the Dental Laboratory Technician, but only 1 dentist sent the record for mounting the models. The hinge type articulator was used in 97. 14 % of the mountings. In 94. 29 % of the cases, the planning and design were not executed by the dentist and in 87. 86 % of the cases no evidence of mouth preparation was found. In 80 % of the cases, communication between the dentist and the Dental Laboratory Technician was done by telephone. Conclusion: Thus it was verified that the removable partial denture continues to be neglected as regards its clinical and laboratorial fabrication, through an excessive transfer of responsibilities from the dentist to the Dental Laboratory Technician and an inefficient communication between the two...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of experimental tests on full-scale one-bay, one-storey reinforced concrete (RC) frames, filled with non-load-bearing clay masonry walls. The infill walls were made with clay masonry units characterized by a high percentage of voids and low strength. Such ‘light’ infill walls have shown fragile behaviour during recent earthquakes, due to the combined effects of damage produced by out-of-plane seismic action, together with in-plane deformation of the RC frame. In this context, various solutions to the problems involved in external reinforcement of ‘light’ infill walls, typically found in existing RC buildings but still used in common construction practice, have recently been developed. These solutions are: i) <b>special</b> lime-based <b>plaster</b> with geo-polymer binder; ii) bidirectional composite meshes applied with inorganic matrices, i. e., Textile Reinforced Mortars (TRM); iii) TRM improved by anchorage of the mesh to the RC frame. For these construction elements, a special set-up for combined in-plane/out-of-plane cyclic testing, already used for other infill wall types at the University of Padova, was used. In particular, this work describes: a) materials and systems for strengthening infill walls; b) experimental results of infill walls under in-plane loads; c) effects of out-of-plane loads on previously in-plane damaged infi ll walls. The final aim was to achieve complete mechanical characterization of infill walls in both original and strengthened conditions, and to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strengthening systems...|$|R
40|$|Many {{walls of}} ancient {{buildings}} {{are covered with}} plaster layers. Amongst the most recurrent causes of damage of plasters and substrates are moisture and salt decay processes. To combat these salt problems, <b>special</b> salt resistant <b>plasters</b> {{have been developed for}} application on salt loaded substrates. However, experience in the field has shown that failures regularly occur on these special mortars, making the situation little transparent for end-users. A European project called COMPASS has addressed this particular problem in a large number of plasters and renders in terms of their performance under severe salt load. This paper describes in more detail the relation that has been observed between salt transport and salt crystallization versus the microstructure (both permeability and composition) of both the plaster and the substrate. Field samples and laboratory tests are discussed. It is shown that the microstructure of both the plaster and the substrate do {{play a significant role in}} the transport and crystallization of salt...|$|R
40|$|Located {{on a low}} coastal hill (locally {{known as}} the Buffos or Kefali) only 4 km east of Malia, the Minoan {{settlement}} and cemetery of Sissi have been under exploration by the Belgian School at Athens since 2007. The strategic location of the hill along overland communication routes, {{as well as its}} proximity to Malia, make the settlement an important barometer to understand the relationship between a palatial center and its assumed hinterland. During the last weeks of the 2011 campaign, the possible presence of a Neopalatial court-centered building on the southeast summit of the hill was noted of which Building F would have formed the east wing. The new five-year program allowed further investigation. Preceded by GPR, geomagnetic, and geoelectric surveys undertaken by IMS-FORTH, excavations west of Building F revealed a large trapezoidal court of approximately 250 m 2, made of white tarazza. Facing it on the northwest, a short stretch of an ashlar facade was seen to have a fine square room (ca. 3. 0 x 2. 5 m) behind it. This room shows a degree of architectural elaboration that is reminiscent of palatial architecture (low bench coated in red-painted plaster, “mosaico” floor in ironstone, rectangular plaster floor partition). Immediately south of this room and accessible from it was found a collapsed stepped structure built of finely cut sandstone blocks. The square room and stepped platform form an isolated unit built against an imposing Prepalatial terrace wall above which Early Minoan II rooms are quite well preserved, largely untouched by later construction activities. South of the stepped structure, an ashlar facade with a different orientation from the ashlar wall flanking the square paved room was found. There was at least one plastered room behind it. Moreover, large rooms with <b>special</b> architectural features (<b>plaster,</b> pavings) were also found {{to the north of the}} court. A sunken building to the south comprises a massive ashlar tumble. Although the complex was found largely empty, preliminary examination of the pottery suggests that it was abandoned early in the Neopalatial period (Late Minoan IA) and that it collapsed soon afterward...|$|R
