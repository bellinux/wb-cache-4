40|$|A central {{assumption}} {{in quantum}} key distribution (QKD) is that Eve has no knowledge about which rounds {{will be used for}} parameter estimation or key distillation. Here we show that this assumption is violated for iterative <b>sifting,</b> a <b>sifting</b> procedure that has been employed in some (but not all) of the recently suggested QKD protocols in order to increase their efficiency. We show that iterative <b>sifting</b> leads to two security issues: (1) some rounds {{are more likely to be}} key rounds than others, (2) the public communication of past measurement choices changes this bias round by round. We analyze these two previously unnoticed problems, present eavesdropping strategies that exploit them, and find that the two problems are independent. We discuss some <b>sifting</b> protocols in the literature that are immune to these problems. While some of these would be inefficient replacements for iterative <b>sifting,</b> we find that the <b>sifting</b> subroutine of an asymptotically secure protocol suggested by Lo et al (2005 J. Cryptol. 18 133 - 65), which we call LCA <b>sifting,</b> has an efficiency on par with that of iterative <b>sifting.</b> One of our main results is to show that LCA <b>sifting</b> can be adapted to achieve secure <b>sifting</b> in the finite-key regime. More precisely, we combine LCA <b>sifting</b> with a certain parameter estimation protocol, and we prove the finite-key security of this combination. Hence we propose that LCA <b>sifting</b> should replace iterative <b>sifting</b> in future QKD implementations. More generally, we present two formal criteria for a <b>sifting</b> protocol that guarantee its finite-key security. Our criteria may guide the design of future protocols and inspire a more rigorous QKD analysis, which has neglected sifting-related attacks so far. Comment: Published version. 14 + 22 page...|$|R
