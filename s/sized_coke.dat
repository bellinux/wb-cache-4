40|$|Large, uniform <b>sized</b> <b>coke</b> is {{desirable}} for blast furnace use. It {{has previously been}} shown that the coke oven flue temperature {{in the first few}} hours of coking is a key determinant of coke size. In this paper, the authors present a new programmed heating approach, which is called pulsed heating,aiming to increase coke mean size at a given average flue temperature. The approach takes into account the charging sequence in coke oven batteries and the authors demonstrate how existing operating practice can be modified in batteries with suitable heating systems to achieve the desired heating programme. A mathematical model of fissure formation provides a prediction of the increase in coke mean size using pulsed heating, compared with standard heating. Pilot scale experiments have also been performed to validate the modelling approach. The results of the modelling indicate that the mean coke size can be increased by several millimetres in some cases, although results from the pilot scale show that pulsed heating increases coke size, but by a smaller amount than that predicted by the model. The potential advantages and limitations of pulsed heating are discussed, as well as opportunities for further investigation of the approach...|$|E

40|$|Coke breeze is {{the main}} fuel used in the {{sintering}} process. The value of - 3 + 1 mm. represents the most favorable particle <b>size</b> for <b>coke</b> breeze in the sintering process. About 20 % of total coke fines (- 0. 5 mm) are produced during different steps of preparation. Introducing these fines during the sintering process proves to be very harmful for different operating parameters. Thus,this study aims at investigating the production of granules resulting from these fines using molasses as organic binder and its application in sintering of an iron ore. The {{results showed that the}} granules having the highest mechanical properties were obtained with 14. 5 wt % molasses addition. The sintering experiments were performed by using coke breeze in different shapes (- 3 + 1 mm in <b>size,</b> <b>coke</b> breeze without sieving and coke breeze granules - 3 + 1 mm).

The results revealed that, all sinter properties (such as shatter test, productivity of sinter machine and blast furnace, reduction time and chemical composition) for produced sinter by using <b>coke</b> breeze with <b>size</b> - 3 + 1 mm and coke breeze granules were almost the same. The iron ore sinter which was produced by using coke breeze without sieving yielded low productivity for both sinter machine and blast furnace.

40|$|Fundamental pore {{formation}} mechanisms in iron ore sinter and pellets were investigated. The study was first conducted with tablets made from iron ore and limestone particles, {{with and without}} addition of coke, {{and the results were}} then tested and proved in real pellets made with a laboratory ball mill and in real sinter made with a sintering pot. It was found that pores were formed at sites of limestone and coke particles and that a number of factors had a significant influence on the {{pore formation}} and the final pore structure, such as limestone particle <b>size,</b> <b>coke</b> particle <b>size,</b> iron ore particle size, amount of limestone, temperature and initial porosity, etc. It was also found that the air flow through the sintering bed was very unlikely to cause any pores to form in sinter. Different types of pores were classified in terms of their origins. The results have shown that an open or close to open pore structure may be achieved by controlling the temperature and using proper amounts and particle <b>sizes</b> of limestone, <b>coke</b> and probably other additives. The results have also shown that porosity and limestone particle size had a strong effect on reducibility and {{it might be possible to}} achieve high reducibility and high strength simultaneously with an open or close to open pore structure at low porosity.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically study whether China could achieve strong export market power {{considering}} its highly decentralized coke production and trade. Design/methodology/approach – By using time series data, this paper econometrically estimates the coke export market power with the Hall model; then, through analyzing micro trade data and public policy, tries to explain the co-existing dilemma of China's highly decentralized coke production/export and its strong market power in the world market; lastly, by using Stigler's survival technique, it explores the optimum <b>size</b> of China's <b>coke</b> production and export. Findings – The paper finds that the market power of Chinese coke export is quite strong, even if its micro market structure is highly decentralized; the main explanation for the expanding of China's coke export market power comes from its oligopolistic position in the world coke market, its strong industry policy and trade policy restriction. Also it is found that the optimum <b>size</b> in the <b>coke</b> industry should be the market share below 0. 5 percent, or in 1 - 10 percent, while other market sizes are of diseconomies of scale. Practical implications – Such findings provide evidence for China's policy adjustment regarding maintaining strong coke export market power, while eliminating economic distortions and negative production externality. Originality/value – This paper highlights the co-existing issues of micro competitive structure and nationally oligopolistic position in an industry. This study is the first try to combine market power and economies of scale, through empirical analysis and optimum size estimation, to generate implications for optimal government public policy.

To generate the categories contained within the VDC parameter, only blends were considered. As a modification to the approach described by North et al. (2017), additional new data was added to extend the training set. Data that had previously been filtered due to low measured CSR was also reintroduced. This change was adopted as it was considered that provided the V-group data itself was acceptable, then the CSR, and conditions under which the coke was produced would not affect the SOM itself. This extended the data set for the VDC parameter generation from 401 to 638 instances.|$|R

In situ UV–vis and confocal fluorescence micro-spectroscopy techniques are applied in a comparative study {{for each individual}} light naphtha component. Optical microphotograph image analysis shows how crystal coloration depends on the reactant molecule. The corresponding absorption measurements confirm that olefinic hydrocarbons generate a pronounced coke deposition. Two main UV–vis bands, located at around 420 and 500 nm, thereby shape the absorption spectrum profile and are assigned to aromatic and poly aromatic species. Increasing reactant chain length results in more extended coke deposits, while the introduction of methyl branching generates conjugated carbonaceous species of similar confined <b>size.</b> The larger <b>coke</b> deposits predominantly locate within the straight channels of the H-ZSM- 5 zeolite catalyst, as demonstrated by polarization-dependent UV–vis micro-spectroscopy. In situ confocal fluorescence microscopy reveals spatial heterogeneities of photo-excited coke species between the olefin and paraffin reactants. Paraffinic reactants convert mainly at the crystal boundary region, while olefinic hydrocarbons cause the build-up of fluorescent coke compounds within the crystal core.

30|$|The {{quality of}} coke affects the {{performance}} of the blast furnace, factors affecting coke quality include coal properties, coal charge granulometry and carbonization conditions. The coke properties include the size analysis, cold strength (Micum Indices-M 40, M 10) and hot strength (Coke Reactivity Index-CRI, Coke Strength after Reaction-CSR) properties and structural properties such as coke structure and texture. Structural properties comprise the porosity, pore-cell wall thickness and pore sizes, while textures consist of the carbon forms in the coke. In present work, advanced method such as image analysis method was used to interpret coke microstructure. Conventional methods such as determination of coke porosity by measurement of real and apparent density and mercury porosimetry have a number of limitations. <b>Coke</b> <b>size,</b> magnification, number of image frames captured, process of pellet preparations and coke properties such as M 40, M 10, CRI and CSR (low, medium and high values) were taken as variables for experimental purposes. The coke structure parameters such as porosity, length, perimeter, breadth, roundness, pore-wall thickness and pore size distribution of the pores were determined by image analysis method. This method provided average porosity in addition to pore-wall thickness and pore-size distribution. The pore wall thickness measurement by image analysis method provided significant correlations with M 40, CRI and CSR values.

The catalyst was characterized using XRD, TEM, XPS, BET analyzer and TGA/DTA techniques. The TEM analysis showed that Ni nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on TiO 2 surface with a narrow size distribution. The catalyst prepared via this approach exhibited excellent activity and stability for both the reactions compared to the reference catalyst prepared from the conventional wet impregnation method. For dry reforming, 86 % CH 4 conversion and 84 % CO 2 conversion was obtained at 700 degrees C. Nearly 92 % CH 4 conversion and 77 % CO selectivity was observed under a H 2 O/CH 4 ratio of 1. 2 at 700 degrees C for the steam reforming reaction. In particular, the present catalyst is extremely active and resistant to coke formation for steam reforming at low steam/carbon ratios.

40|$|In an {{iron ore}} {{sintering}} bed, the combustion behaviour of coke particles together with {{velocity of the}} flowing gas stream determines the temperature, width and speed of the traversing flame front. A bed heat treatment mathematical model was formulated in an earlier study to describe this complex relationship. An area of improvement in the model is {{the description of the}} coke combustion process, which is highly dependent on the resistances controlling the flow of gases to and from the coke particles. These vary for different coke particles because of the prior coarsening of the sinter mix by granulation. The characteristic structure of granules – nuclear particle with an adhering fines layer – indicates that gases have better access to finer coke particles. In this study, an available granulation model is integrated into the heat treatment model to provide a novel description of coke positioning within granules. In addition to this change, two endothermic reactions were introduced into the model. Using the previous and modified models, predicted bed temperature–time profiles as a function of position down the bed, were compared against embedded thermocouples results from seventeen laboratory sinter tests. Generally, the modified definition of coke combustion behaviour resulted in improved comparison with experimental results. In the sintering literature, studies have been reported on: the use of charcoal/biomass char to replace coke, the preferential placement of coke particles on the outside of granules, and varying the size distribution of the coke particles. Improving the access of gases to coke particles and decreasing <b>coke</b> <b>size</b> are comparable to using more reactive fuels.

40|$|The {{blast furnace}} consumes {{a large amount}} of high quality {{metallurgy}} <b>coke</b> (<b>size</b> 35 - 80 mm) in addition to ore in the form of pellets and sinter. This coke is the coarse fraction, derived from the coke plant. The fine fraction (8 - 35 mm), arise after sieving, named nut coke, can’t be directly used in blast furnace. The fraction of smaller than 8 mm is used in the sinter plant. Therefore, a large fraction of coke around 20 % from coking plant/process is not used for iron ore reduction. Recent research indicates that usage of nut coke will be economic if properly used. Nut coke cannot be directly mixed with normal coke because it will decrease the permeability of the coke layer in the blast furnace. However, mixing nut coke into the ferrous burden layer could be an effective way to use the coke resource economically. This mixed charging could improve softening and melting behaviour, reduction kinetics and permeability and also make full use of the coke resource. It may, however, also worsen the layer permeability and even deteriorate the whole blast furnace process. The mechanism of the effect of mixing nut coke into the ferrous burden on the performance of the blast furnace is still not clear, and thus the usage of nut coke is still limited. To investigate the effect and mechanism of using nut coke in the ferrous burden on the performance of the blast furnace, cold flow model experiments and high temperature experiments have been conducted.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{weathering}} on the modification of chemical, petrological and rheological properties of four metallurgical coals in different rank and geology was investigated. And that of coke qualities of these coals was investigated by 25 kg pilot coke oven. Weathering tests {{were carried out}} by storing coal in 20 ton pile on an open industrial yard for up to 208 days. Coal characteristics and coke qualities were monitored over an interval of one month. The mixture of four metallurgical coals was used to investigate the effect of weathering duration on the modification of coal blending as well. With increasing weathering, oxygen concentration was increased as expected, and calorific values were marginally decreased. This study confirmed the adverse effect of weathering on the caking properties of coals such as fluidity, dilation and swelling behaviours as well as coal melting temperature range. The study illustrated that effect of short term and long term weathering on the modification of rheological properties of coals is significantly different. Unlike general idea like low rank coals normally get greater impact of weathering than high rank coals, {{this study suggests that}} long term weathering may have a strong impact on the modification of rheological properties of relatively higher rank coals with high ash yield. With increasing weathering time, inert textures and small pores increased, while calorific values of all cokes marginally decreased. The coke cold strength from weathered coals decreased as well as their size. However the rank of coals and fluidity loss didn't show clear relationship with this quality drop. On the other hand, the <b>coke</b> <b>size</b> decreased in accordance with the fluidity drop. The fluidity of coal blending remained stable for a while, and then it dropped seriously according to weathering time with narrowed fluid ranges of individual coals. Coke strength of coal blending in both cold and hot state decreased significantly and continuously. Therefore, this study suggests that even though the individual coals may not be affected seriously by weathering, the weathering effects can be severe when different rank coals are use together...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The size distribution and strength of metallurgical coke are factors vital for the steady and high-efficiency operation of a blast furnace, since these factors govern stack penneability. Coke strength influences the <b>size</b> of lump <b>coke</b> {{not only because of}} size degradation by impact and abrasion during transfer to and descent in the blast furnace, but also because of its influence on the fracture which takes place in the coke layer during carbonisation and the effect this has on the initial mean size and size distribution of the feed coke. Therefore, the elucidation of the relationship between coke strength and the fissure fonnation phenomena is significant. In this study, therefore, the coke strength development during carbonisation has been examined in conjunction with various parameters, such as the degree of carbonisation of the coal, namely the extent or fraction of pyrolytic reaction, and the degree of graphitisation of the coke, as well as carbonisation temperature and heating regime. The porous structure of coke has also been examined with a view to establishing a relation between the porous structure and the coking properties of the coal carbonised. The quality of coke porous structure was evaluated by parameters introduced in this study, i. e., the pore size distribution and pore rugosity factors. A poor porous structure is shown to be associated with high proportion of small pores and pores with a rough surface. These features are considered to stem from poor coking properties and the consequent poor adhesion between coal particles. An attempt has also been made to establish a mathematical model capable of predicting the degree of fissuring of coke during carbonisation by utilising the understandings obtained in this study of the coke strength development during carbonisation and the effect of coal properties on coke strength. Coke samples large enough to facilitate the observation of the degree of fissuring in relation to various coal properties and heating conditions, were made to evaluate the mathematical model and introduce the concept. The concept that fissuring takes place when developing thennal stress exceeds the developing coke strength is demonstrated to be capable to evaluate the effects of coal properties and heating conditions on the degree of fissuring observed...|$|R
40|$|Core-drilling {{into the}} coke bed of raceway and hearth has been {{performed}} in the LKAB Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF®) during short stoppages aiming to characterize raceway conditions corresponding to different operational conditions. All coke operation, injection of pulverized coal and injection of a mixture of coal and blast furnace flue dust (BFD) were evaluated and compared. The samples have been studied regarding particle <b>size</b> and distribution, <b>coke</b> have been evaluated with chemical composition and thermal history, i. e. coke graphitization degree. In addition, {{the results have been}} compared to drilled raceway core samples from SSAB industrial blast furnace in Luleå. Coke in drill-cores consists of bosh, raceway and deadman coke. In comparison with charged coke this coke has changed characteristics depending on the exposed conditions which vary along the radius of each drilled core. Coke in raceway area has increased ash content due to gasification of C and the ash composition is altered due to both reduction and gasification of ash minerals as e. g. SiO 2 and alkalis in raceway and oxidation/condensation of gaseous compounds and uptake of compounds from the melt. Coke exposed to highest temperatures in the raceway area have increased the most in graphitization degree, and subsequent bird’s nest and deadman cokes graphitization degrees decreases. K 2 O-content in coke correlates to the graphitization degree as well as the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 quotient which decreases at higher temperatures. Presence of slag and coke aggregates indicates the formation of bird’s nests {{at the end of the}} raceway. The end of raceway and position of a significant bird's nest in the industrial samples are indicated by the increasing content of K 2 O and increasing ratio of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 in coke. In the industrial BF the pronounced formation of a bird’s nest redirect the gas from moving towards the BF center. As a result the coke in deadman cannot be heated and the temperature indicated by the graphitization degree decreases. Injection of BFD influences the raceway conditions as the combustion peak is moved further into the raceway when BFD and PC mix are injected. Analyze of fines shows remaining unreacted BFD, which contains iron oxide with oxidation degree between FeO and metallic Fe. Increased FeO-content in raceway will decrease the melting point of tuyere slag and therefore improve the permeability at raceway end and the fact that the core when drilled could be pushed further into the EBF than for the other cores indicates higher permeability after injection of PC and BFD mixture.

40|$|Carbon {{required}} for the reduction of alumina by electrolysis in the Hall-Héroult process is supplied by the anode. Anodes are produced from a mixture of petroleum coke with coal tar pitch as the binder. The minimum theoretical carbon consumption is 0. 334 kg C/kg Al. But due to current efficiency and oxidation losses the consumption is typically 400 kg C/kg Al. Petroleum coke is a by-product from crude oil refineries, but as its value represents only about 2 per cent of the overall production it has a limited interest to the producers. Mechanical and physical properties of coke {{are influenced by the}} crude oil, processes within the refineries and calcining of the coke. Continuous high demand for calcined coke by aluminium smelters has created a difficult situation with respect to quality and availability, leading to the use of lower quality coke in aluminium smelters and potential disturbances in the production. Understanding the consequences of varying calcined coke qualities is crucial for to possibly compensate and adjust process parameters in the subsequent use of the coke, in order to obtain economical production of aluminium. In the present work, the subject of study was four different petroleum coke types, where three were derived from a single source (SSA, SSB and SSC) and one was from a blend of different cokes. All of the cokes had different chemical and physical properties. Single source cokes have homogenous chemical and physical composition in the whole size range while the blended coke had heterogeneous composition due to the mixture of different coke types used. The blended coke consisted of several different coke types (25) {{in order to meet the}} required specification. This work also describes new characterisation/measurement methods which can contribute to a better understanding of variations in material properties due to physical and mechanical changes in the calcined coke feed materials. Each step in the production of pilot scale anodes is described. A new method was developed for the characterisation of the mechanical strength of calcined coke. This method, the drop test, originates from the study of materials for road construction for the determination of the grain stability of rock materials. The method determines the coke grain strength in the entire size distribution. On the other hand, established measuring methods for calcined coke, HGI (ASTM D 5003 - 95) and grain stability (ISO 10142), determine only the mechanical strength in a specific size range, + 0. 6 - 1. 18 mm and + 4 - 8 mm, respectively. In other words, both methods give limited information about coke mechanical strength distribution throughout the whole size range, which is especially important when blended cokes are used. Additionally, the results from the drop test are expressed in volume reduction, size reduction, impact force and amount of fines below 148 μm generated during the test. A good correlation between ISO 10142 and the drop test was found. The results show good correlation between the size and volume reduction and the specific grinding energy. The method can also determine the grain strength of a specific size fraction which might be critical to further processing during anode production. Totally, about 8 tons of four calcined coke types were processed during this work. The majority of this material was ground in the air swept ball mill, for production of the finest fraction, dust. The pilot scale air swept ball mill circuit is identical to the equipment used in industry today. This investigation showed the importance of process optimisation for the stable production of dust with the required specification (particle size and Blaine). Each coke exhibited different behaviour in the grinding circuit, due to different mechanical strengths, which is reported as a specific grinding energy. The mechanically weakest coke produced dust with the lowest specific grinding energy. The particle size variation in the coke used in the mill produced a significant disturbance in the product quality. It was found that the sweeping speed through the mill influences the particle size distribution in terms of the proportion of the finest particles. It also affected the particle roundness of the produced dust, which can influence the flowability of the coke when mixed with pitch. The ratio of ball sizes and the rotational speed of the mill influenced the particle size distribution, Blaine and specific grinding energy. On-line particle size control was utilised during the dust production. This system allowed continuous control of the product size by regulation of the air classifier rotor speed. Three different dust sizes were produced in the air swept ball mill, which were all below about 200 μm but contained different proportions of material below 63 μm. Sieved coke fractions together with dust were weighed according to a specified recipe and blended in a sigma blade mixer together with coal tar pitch. A vibration compactor was used for the production of green anodes under optimal conditions. The anodes were produced with three different pitch contents (15, 18 and 20 wt%) and three different dust sizes (45, 63 and 94 %, - 63 μm). Core samples of green anodes were investigated in an improved dilatometer for the determination of thermal expansion and shrinkage during baking. Improvements made to the dilatometer during this work contributed to better reproducibility, increased precision and a healthier working environment. An increase in the heating rate influenced the initial expansion, shrinkage and baking loss of the anode. The heterogeneous pitch distribution throughout the anode due to the forming force, friction between coke particles and between the paste and mould showed the importance of selecting a consistent sampling position. The results showed that the bottom samples have greater expansion due to a thicker pitch bridge layer while the top samples have reduced expansion. The sample packing material contributed to a higher initial expansion due to the reduced free surface area for binder volatiles release, and the shrinkage was reduced because of the radial thrusts from the packing material. Thermal dilation results showed differences between samples with varying pitch, dust <b>size</b> and <b>coke</b> type, which can be used to indicate the final properties of baked anodes. A good correlation was found between the thermal dilation after the pitch expansion and the dust content. Green anodes were baked under controlled conditions and then characterised. The baked apparent density showed a good correlation with the pitch content and dust size. The results showed that 18 % pitch content and 63 % - 63 μm produced the highest baked densities. The variation in coke type exhibited differences in baked density, specific electrical resistance, air permeability, CO 2 and air reactivity and modulus of elasticity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{is part of}} a {{research}} program carried out in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Castilla-La Mancha, focused in the preparation, characterization and evaluation of catalysts that can be applied in industrially relevant reactions. In this way, the PhD work reported here was aimed to study and improve nickel catalysts applied to the tri-reforming process, evaluating the role of support, precursor and promoter and optimizing the catalyst preparation. Furthermore, the influence of feed composition and temperature in the catalytic behaviour have been also analyzed, developing in a final step a model in order to fit the experimental data. The influence of different support materials (alumina, ceria, ¿-silicon carbide and yttria-stabilized zirconia) on the catalytic behaviour of Ni catalysts for the dry reforming reaction and the tri-reforming process has been studied in chapter 1. The influence on the catalytic performance of the composition of the atmosphere surrounding the Ni/YSZ catalyst during the calcination step was also analysed. Temperature-programmed reduction experiments showed remarkable differences in the reduction profile and the degree of reduction of the catalysts as a function of both the support used and the calcination conditions. Ni/YSZ-O 2, the catalyst calcined under an oxygen-poor atmosphere, presented a higher reducibility {{as a consequence of the}} higher number of oxygen vacancies in the surface of the support. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst gave the lowest CH 4 and CO 2 reaction rates as a consequence of its low reducibility due to the formation of Ni aluminate. The Ni/CeO 2 catalyst showed the lowest H 2 /CO molar ratio for the tri-reforming process. This result can be explained on considering the higher basicity of this catalyst, as shown by CO 2 -TPD experiments. Ni/YSZ-O 2 showed the higher reaction rate of CH 4 and CO 2 in the dry reforming experiments, showing the Ni/CeO 2 and Ni/¿-SiC slightly lower values. The CeO 2 and ¿-SiC catalysts had the best characteristics as catalytic supports for the tri-reforming process. The aim of the work described in chapter 2 is to evaluate the catalytic performance in the tri-reforming process of Ni/CeO 2 and Ni/¿¿SiC catalysts prepared by using four different nickel salts (nitrate, acetate, chloride and citrate). Metal particles supported over ceria had bigger particle sizes (leading to lower metal-support interactions) than those supported on ¿¿SiC. It was also demonstrated that the metal salt used in the preparation of Ni-based catalysts had a marked influence on the size of the nickel particles. Larger particles with a worse catalytic behaviour were obtained when nickel chloride and nickel citrate were used as the precursors of Ni supported species. Methane consumption rate and H 2 /CO ratio in the effluents were influenced by the type of support and salt precursor used in the preparation of the catalysts. CO 2 -TPD proved that catalysts based on ceria as the support presented more basic sites, which was related to a decrease of the H 2 /CO molar ratio in the effluents coming from the reactor. High methane consumption rate and good catalytic stability were obtained when nickel nitrate and nickel acetate were used to prepare Ni/¿¿SiC catalysts. The results showed that these latter catalysts can be considered as promising ones for the tri-reforming process. Tri-reforming of methane has proved to be a highly efficient process for obtaining synthesis gas suitable for use in the Fischer Tropsch process and methanol synthesis. In chapter 3 the influence of the feedstock composition on methane conversion, the H 2 /CO molar ratio of the synthesis gas obtained by tri-reforming of methane and the heat released or supplied to the system with a Ni/¿¿SiC catalyst are all described. Firstly, a factorial plus central composite design of experiments was chosen in order to optimize the independent variables selected. Then, using the experimental data obtained, a quadratic model was built. It was observed that the effect of both water and oxygen volume flow on the H 2 /CO molar ratio was positive while that of methane and carbon dioxide volume flow was negative. Finally, in order to obtain an energetic optimum inside the target region, the influence of the independent variables studied previously on the overall reaction heat was calculated. The influence of alkaline (Na, K) and alkaline earth (Mg, Ca) cocations on the behaviour of Ni/¿¿SiC catalyst for the tri-reforming of methane has been evaluated in chapter 4. The cocations were loaded by co-impregnation with Ni, using different cocation/Ni ratios. Catalysts were characterized by AAS, TPR, N 2 adsorption, CO 2 -TPD and XRD after calcination, as well as by XRD and TPO after reaction. It was analyzed the effect of the cocations on the ¿¿SiC oxidation rate, which was increased when Na or K were loaded. The presence of Mg led to a high catalytic performance and stability (with a lower coke formation) since it provoked a decrease of Ni particle size and an increase of both the interaction between nickel and promoter and the catalyst basicity. Catalysts with Ni:Mg molar ratios of 2 / 1 and 1 / 1 showed the best performance in terms of activity and stability and formation of coke. These catalysts were considered good candidates for the tri-reforming of methane. The influence of the order of Ni and Mg impregnation has been analyzed in terms of catalytic activity and stability of ¿-SiC supported catalysts for the tri-reforming of methane in chapter 5. Catalysts were characterized using different techniques such as Temperature Programmed Reduction, X-Ray Diffraction, Transmission Electron Microscopy and Temperature Programmed Oxidation. The addition of Mg clearly changed the reduction profile, increasing the temperature required to obtain Ni 0. Higher reduction temperatures were needed when Mg was firstly loaded or when both metals, Ni and Mg, were simultaneously loaded, which was attributed to the occurrence of interactions between Ni and Mg. Catalyst prepared by first Ni impregnation showed the worst catalytic behaviours, probably due to a poor interaction between Ni and Mg, a possible blockage of Ni particles by Mg ones and the occurrence of Ni 2 Si after reaction. Catalysts prepared with the highest Mg/Ni molar ratio (1 / 1) showed smaller Ni particle <b>sizes,</b> lower <b>coke</b> rate formation and higher basicity and Ni-Mg interaction. Ni-Mg/SiC 1 / 1 was selected as the best catalyst due to its high catalytic activity and stability and low coke generation. In chapter 6, the influence of the temperature and feed composition on the catalytic behaviour of a Ni-Mg/¿-SiC catalyst was analyzed and modelized. This catalyst was characterized by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS), Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR), N 2 adsorption, Temperature Programmed Desortion of CO 2 (TPD) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). 36 catalytic experiments at different temperatures and feed compositions were performed. The predominance of each one of the reactions that took place during the tri-reforming process was evaluated as a function of the temperature, finding at low temperatures a higher contribution of both the steam reforming and the water gas shift reactions. On the contrary, at higher temperatures, a higher contribution of the dry reforming was detected. Finally, a kinetic model was raised and experimental data were fitted to it. Steam reforming, dry reforming and water gas shift reactions were considered as the kinetically relevant equations. A good agreement between experimental and predicted data was observed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} the fundamental behaviour of granular flow in hoppers and blast furnace discharging system. Although extensive researches {{have been carried}} out for many years, most of them are empirical, they are limited by numbers of constraining assumptions, and even the most basic flow mechanisms of granular materials are not well understood. In recent years, the researches of granular flow mechanisms have been developing and improving rapidly worldwide, which benefit from the powerful computer technology and the appearance of discrete particle simulation technique. Discrete element method (DEM) has been used increasingly in particulate research in the past three decades, which can provide micro-dynamic information of particles which is extremely difficult to be obtained by physical experiments. Despite all these contributions, the fundamental mechanism of granular flow still has not been fully understood and the information obtained from experiment and simulation is still scrappy, resulting in lacking of coherence. In this project, the mechanism of granular flow in hopper is studied using DEM simulation, the micro variables are analysed in steady and unsteady flows, such as velocity, force, coordination number and porosity. The micro information generated by DEM simulation is used to analyse the macro dynamics of granular flow by using a proper averaging method. The results show that the distribution of macro variables such as velocity, mass density and stress are highly related to that of micro variables. These analyses should be useful for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamic behaviour of the granular flow. In addition, these analyses are applied to a series of hoppers with different sizes in order to study the size effects on hopper flow. Hopper size relative to particle size indeed has some effects, however, the ratio between particle-packed bed height and hopper length plays an important role. By a proper value, the micro and macro dynamic information can be well obtained from a small hopper. The previous studies on the granular flow in hoppers are mainly focused on the steady flow stage. However, the dynamic behaviour of the granular flow in a hopper in the early stage before the steady state stage is formed, has not been well understood. The start up stage happens {{in a very short time}} period, and is therefore difficult to detect by physical experiments. However, very fewer studies are found related to the start up stage. In this work, the DEM simulation method is applied to study the granular flow in a hopper at the start up stage. The discharge rate, velocity changes and the force propagation are studied, and the outlet size effects are examined. In the start-up stage before a steady state is reached, the discharge rate firstly increases dramatically until its maximum, and then decreases to a constant. After the outlet opening, particles change the state from static to flowing and a curve surface is formed between these two particle states. A force arch on which the particles have very small forces is formed below the switch curve. The switch curve and force arch propagate into the bed with the discharge of particles, and reach the top of the bed when a steady state is achieved. There are no significant effects of outlet sizes on the propagation velocity of the switch curve, however, the vertical force at the switch curve inclines with the increase of the outlet sizes, but decrease with the propagation. The simulation and analyzing methods are then applied to the granular flow in industrial processes. First, the P-W discharge system is selected to study the micro and macro dynamics of granular flow. The results show the different trend with that in a cuboid hopper with flat bottom. Secondly, the discharge rate of granular flow is investigated at different gate openings in the material bins of blast furnace system. The factors which may influence the flow rate are analysed, including rolling friction coefficient, sliding friction coefficient and damping coefficient. The results show that there is a critical gate opening beyond which, further increase in the gate opening will not result in any change of the flow rate. However, this can be solved by changing the location of the material gate to the bin neck area. Lastly, a full model of charging process simulator of blast furnace was developed in this work, which is an important step to decrease the gap between simulation and the real industrial process. Some micro-dynamic variables are analysed during charging process, such as velocity and contact force, a stagnant zone is found in discharge funnel, particles in this area keep stable until all particles are discharged from the material bin. <b>Size</b> segregations of <b>coke</b> and ore particles are studied in each part of the blast furnace. These are not only spatially-distributed but also exist in the discharging process. After filling the material bin, larger particles are more likely to distribute at the side wall with opposite direction of charging particles, smaller particles are more likely concentrate on the other side of the wall. Smaller ore particles discharge slower from discharge funnel through the DCD gate because many are located at stagnant zone...|$|R
