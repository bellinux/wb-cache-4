5000|$|Lord Nugent is {{recorded}} in Hansard as saying: [...] "The {{history of the}} airfield {{is that it was}} originally requisitioned in wartime in 1943 for wartime purposes and from that time there has been a clear undertaking that when it was no longer required for these purposes it would be returned for its pre-war agricultural use. Over the intervening years this undertaking has been re-stated from time to time by various Government departments who have been responsible for authorising this <b>special</b> <b>occupancy.</b> The local authorities, the Surrey County Council and the Guildford Borough Council, insisted that when the property was sold back to its pre-war owner, Lord Lytton, all the buildings and hard standings, including the runway, must be removed to ensure a return to its agricultural use before the war and to preserve the general policy of conserving the green belt. More recently, after a good deal of discussion, these conditions were confirmed and a letter was sent by the Property Services Agency (PSA) on 15th November 1977 to the effect that Wisley Airfield would not be sold until both the buildings and the runway had been removed. Further letters were written in 1978 confirming this and, finally, there was a letter from the junior Minister of the Department of the Environment Mr. Ken Marks, on 6th March last year (1979) to the Dorking Member of Parliament, Sir George Sinclair, making the same confirmation. It was thus a great surprise to everybody when the axe fell on 13th July last year with a letter from the PSA stating that the sale would be made with the runway still in situ. This decision by the PSA makes the site available for future use as a commercial airport, in direct breach of all the undertakings over the previous 36 years and in direct breach of the major conservation considerations for the green belt. My noble friend Lord Onslow will deal in more detail with the particular villainies of the breach." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{storm surge}} is the sudden rise of sea {{water over the}} astronomical tides, {{generated}} by an approaching storm. This event poses {{a major threat to}} the Philippine coastal areas, as manifested by Typhoon Haiyan on 8 November 2013. This hydro-meteorological hazard {{is one of the main}} reasons for the high number of casualties due to the typhoon, with 6300 deaths. It became evident that the need to develop a storm surge inundation map is of utmost importance. To develop these maps, the Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST-Project NOAH) simulated historical tropical cyclones that entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility. The Japan Meteorological Agency storm surge model was used to simulate storm surge heights. The frequency distribution of the maximum storm surge heights was calculated using simulation results of tropical cyclones under a specific public storm warning signal (PSWS) that passed through a particular coastal area. This determines the storm surge height corresponding to a given probability of occurrence. The storm surge heights from the model were added to the maximum astronomical tide data from WXTide software. The team then created maps of inundation for a specific PSWS using the probability of exceedance derived from the frequency distribution. Buildings and other structures were assigned a probability of exceedance depending on their occupancy category, i. e., 1 % probability of exceedance for critical facilities, 10 % probability of exceedance for <b>special</b> <b>occupancy</b> structures, and 25 % for standard occupancy and miscellaneous structures. The maps produced show the storm-surge-vulnerable areas in Metro Manila, illustrated by the flood depth of up to 4 m and extent of up to 6. 5 km from the coastline. This information can help local government units in developing early warning systems, disaster preparedness and mitigation plans, vulnerability assessments, risk-sensitive land use plans, shoreline defense efforts, and coastal protection measures. These maps can also determine the best areas to build critical structures, or at least determine the level of protection of these structures should they be built in hazard areas. Moreover, these will support the local government units' mandate to raise public awareness, disseminate information about storm surge hazards, and implement appropriate countermeasures for a given PSWS...|$|E
50|$|The NEC is {{composed}} of an introduction, nine chapters, annexes A through I, and the index. The introduction sets forth the purpose, scope, enforcement and rules or information that are general in nature. The first four chapters cover definitions and rules for installations (voltages, connections, markings, etc.), circuits and circuit protection, methods and materials for wiring (wiring devices, conductors, cables, etc.), and general-purpose equipment (cords, receptacles, switches, heaters, etc.). The next three chapters deal with <b>special</b> <b>occupancies</b> (high risk to multiple persons), special equipment (signs, machinery, etc.) and special conditions (emergency systems, alarms, etc.). Chapter 8 is specific to additional requirements for communications systems (telephone, radio/TV, etc.) and chapter 9 {{is composed}} of tables regarding conductor, cable and conduit properties, among other things. Annexes A-I relate to referenced standards, calculations, examples, additional tables for proper implementation of various code articles (for example, how many wires fit in a conduit) and a model adoption ordinance.|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{robotics}} and robot navigation is {{a growing}} area of scientific research. Robot simulators are useful designing and analizing tools of this domain. Webots ([1]) is a well-known representant of these programs, a three-dimensional mobile robot simulator. Various guidance principles can be developed in C/C++ or Java programming language {{with the use of}} Webots controller programs. In this paper a short overview is given about the problems arising in the process of the navigation, and a short taxonomy is presented about the possible problem solving methods ([2]). A brief introduction to the probabilistic navigation techniques concerning Kalman filter and expectation maximization is included with a <b>special</b> focus on <b>occupancy</b> grid. Formerly I presented a metric navigation method based on occupancy grid working in the Webots simulation environment ([3]). As a continuation of that research I created an enhancement of the former processes, a hybrid metric-topological navigation mechanism. A topologic layer is introduced in the environment exploration phase replacing the older value iteration ([4]). The implementation of a topologic graph of the explorable places using the metric map enables the robot to navigate in a more efficient manner. A comparison of the pure metric and the new hybrid methods is also given...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 106 - 107) The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to determine the}} need for a medical office building in close proximity to a hospital. The project attempts to measure and determine the need by examining the following: A) If the need exists for additional medical office space in the service area. B) If there are enough physicians interested in leasing or ownership alternatives in the medical office building. C) Determination of ownership alternatives available to the hospital. D) How to insure interest from the physicians in the project. The paper clearly specifies that the hospital desires to enhance the financial situation of the organization. This can be accomplished by encouraging additional physicians to admit more of their patients to the hospital, and to increase the use and, thus, the revenues of the hospital???s ancillary services. The author believes that a positive approach towards this objective is the hospital based medical office building. The following surveys were developed to obtain the necessary information for the feasibility study: A) Physician Survey ??? to quantify interest level in the project, either ownership or lease arrangements. Seventy-five physicians were interviews and asked their opinions about the M. O. B. project. B) Medical Office Building Survey ??? to quantify all properties, year built, number of stories, square footage, distance to the nearest hospital, average square footage per physician, <b>special</b> facilities, elevators, <b>occupancy,</b> and lease rates and terms. This survey covered approximately twenty-three square miles, containing approximately 614, 000 square feet of gross area in medical-dental space. The two surveys were designed to assist in the entire M. O. B. process. Information obtained in the surveys, in addition to the above will be necessary for the formulation of the gross square footage required, and economic feasibility of the entire building project. The general findings of the project may be described as follows: A) the physicians were interested in leasing or ownership alternatives. B) The majority of physicians preferred the office space in close proximity to the hospital. C) The overall vacancy factor in the area surveyed is estimated to be between 3 % and 5 % for completed buildings. D) The most advantageous time frame to complete the proposed project was determined to be in the summer of 1980 (July or August). This was determined from the survey of lease expirations falling due during this period. (A majority of leases would expire within 18 months). E) Physician ownership was determined to be approximately 78 % of the physicians. The remained did not want the investment because of a variety of reasons, including investment interests in other areas, poor investment, financially tied to one hospital in one location...|$|R
40|$|The Standard Model {{is a well}} {{established}} theory for elementary particle physics that describes all known elementary particles and their interactions. Except for gravity all known forces are included: the electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear force. ATLAS {{is one of the}} two general-purpose experiments at the LHC accelerator at CERN, which is a proton-proton collider with an unprecedented nominal center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. One of its main goals is to study the Standard Model and look for possible new physics beyond this model. Especially searched for, will be the Higgs particle, the last not-measured particle predicted by the Standard Model. Extensions to the Standard Model will be tested, e. g. supersymmetry and theories with extra dimensions. In many of the searches muons with a high transverse momentum will be crucial due to their clean signature in the detector. In this thesis the performance of the muon spectrometer of ATLAS has been studied. Four detector technologies are deployed; the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) and the Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) provide the trigger in respectively the barrel and the endcap regions; the precision measurements to measure the momentum are performed by three layers of the Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers and for the inner forward regions by the Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC). An eight-fold toroidal superconducting magnet system provides a magnetic field of typically 0. 5 T. With these detectors the muon spectrometer will provide a momentum dependent muon trigger and measure the muon momenta with a resolution between 4 % for 10 GeV < pT < 500 GeV and better than 10 % for transverse momenta up to 1 TeV. For each muon traversing the muon spectrometer these detectors will produce a number of position measurements. From this set of measurements, the trajectory can be reconstructed. The reconstruction is performed in several steps, first an initial pattern recognition is performed, after which the measurements in the individual chambers are locally fitted into so-called segments. From these segments track candidates are built, which are then fitted. For the initial pattern recognition, an algorithm consisting of a family of global pattern searches based on the Hough transform has been developed. All detector technologies provide a precise measurement for two dimensions (xy or Rz), while the position in the other dimension is less precise. Therefore, the algorithm performs a search in each of the two precision planes, xy and Rz. The resulting two-dimensional patterns are then combined into a three-dimensional pattern. For the Rz-hits a transform is used that accounts for the curvature of the tracks. The algorithm applies several techniques to distinguish patterns in the high background environment of ATLAS. The algorithm assigns a weight to each measurement, depending on the likelihood of it being a noise hit. Depending on the <b>occupancy,</b> <b>special</b> weighting is applied to reduce the cpu usage. It is shown that the algorithm has an excellent efficiency over a wide range of momenta and a low cpu usage in high background. The pattern recognition algorithm is part of the highly modular and recently revised MOORE reconstruction program, which is, besides Muonboy, one of the two muon standalone reconstruction programs in ATLAS. The whole chain of MOORE modules, including the segment reconstruction, segment combining and tracking has been described in detail. Its performance is demonstrated on simulated dimuon decays of Z 0 -bosons and J/ψ mesons. The performance metrics include efficiency, fake rates and momentum resolution. The total track efficiency and momentum resolution are well understood and competitive to the Muonboy programme. Misidentified track rates have been discussed and are shown to be under control. For the commissioning of the ATLAS detectors, cosmic muons are deployed. To utilise the possibilities of these muons completely, the tracking needs to be changed and optimised. In particular the initial pattern recognition needs to be altered to account for non-pointing tracks. For this, dedicated Hough transforms have been developed. Furthermore, several adaptations have been made to the MOORE reconstruction programme to achieve a similar efficiency as the collision muons. On simulated cosmic muon samples {{it has been shown that}} the reconstruction is well understood for different categories of events. For each of these categories, it has been shown that MOORE has a better performance than Muonboy, especially for muons with large impact parameters with respect to the interaction point. Cosmic muons have been recorded in the cavern since 2005 and the setup has been gradually extended. In 2008 all ATLAS detectors were present in the readout. For the muon spectrometer, differences between simulated and real cosmic ray muon data have been explained, with a focus on the reconstruction strategy. It has been shown that the MDT detector performance and MOORE segment and tracking reconstruction are robust and efficient for real cosmic muon data. Furthermore, it is shown that MOORE is currently the best reconstruction programme for cosmic muon data...|$|R
