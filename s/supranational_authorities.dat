This suggests that different sets of countries (or regions) should differ in the extent to which their regulators cooperate across border.

The contemporary International Criminal Law envisages the most severe forms of punishment and penal measures for these criminal offences. The perpetrators of these crimes are, in certain cases, subject to the primary jurisdiction of one of international criminal court (<b>supranational)</b> <b>authorities,</b> such as the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.

40|$|Two multidirectional vectors remain {{simultaneously}} valid {{within the}} domestic policy of European Union: {{the integration of}} European community in a single unit and the increasing regionalization of the EU countries-members.

The deepening of regionalization and partial loss of the autonomy by national govern ments of countries-members of EU is instrumental in the acceleration of the European community integration. The mechanisms of the parallel moved forward integration and regionalization must resolve territorial conflicts both among the “old” members of EU (so called “interdynastic” type of conflicts) and between the “old” and “new” EU members (“post-colonial” type of conflicts).
