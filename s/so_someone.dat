25|$|Another {{theme in}} the show is Sam's {{confusion}} about police work in 1973, as he often mistakenly mentions techniques and technologies that were not used in 1973, such as two-way mirrors.

When he does <b>so,</b> <b>someone</b> around him usually points out that he is giving the warning incorrectly.|$|E
25|$|Residents and {{businesses}} identify their locations mostly by building number, and occasionally {{by the name}} of a prominent structure. Residents know where in the city certain series of building numbers are located; numbers tend to be aggregated in blocks, <b>so</b> <b>someone</b> might say that they live in the 2600s. Around 2003, street names were developed, although there were delays in finalizing them and posting the signs. Street numbers have not been assigned, and building numbers continue to be used. Iqaluit is the only Canadian capital city not to have traffic signals.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is famous}} for a New Year celebration where lighted tar barrels are carried on the heads of revellers called guisers. This {{tradition}} dates back to 1858. It appears to have originated from the lighting of a silver band that were carolling at New Year. They were unable to use candles to light their music due to the strong winds, <b>so</b> <b>someone</b> suggested a tar barrel be used. Having to move from place to place, {{it would have been}} easier to carry the barrels upon the guisers' heads, rather than rolling them. There have been claims that it is a pagan festival, however, these claims are unfounded.|$|E

25|$|The {{purchase}} of lottery tickets cannot {{be accounted for}} by decision models based on expected value maximization. The reason is that lottery tickets cost more than the expected gain, as shown by lottery mathematics, <b>so</b> <b>someone</b> maximizing expected value should not buy lottery tickets. Yet, lottery purchases can be explained by decision models based on expected utility maximization, as the curvature of the utility function can be adjusted to capture risk-seeking behavior. More general models based on utility functions defined on things other than the lottery outcomes can also account for lottery purchase. In addition to the lottery prizes, the ticket may enable some purchasers to experience a thrill and to indulge in a fantasy of becoming wealthy. If the entertainment value (or other non-monetary value) obtained by playing is high enough for a given individual, then the {{purchase of}} a lottery ticket could represent a gain in overall utility. In such a case, the disutility of a monetary loss could be outweighed by the combined expected utility of monetary and non-monetary gain, thus making the purchase a rational decision for that individual.|$|E
500|$|The station {{also served}} as the department's {{headquarters}} from 1910–1920, and the home for every fire chief from 1910 to 1928, including chief Ralph J. Scott. [...] Chief Scott's wife, Addie Scott, lived {{with him on the}} third floor and later recalled the station's early days: [...] "I remember the horses. [...] They really knew what to do.

500|$|Following {{the high}} mintage of the Bicentennial piece, {{the number of}} pieces struck per year declined. [...] However, in 1979, Mint Director Stella B.

[...] They do go somewhere, though, <b>so</b> <b>someone</b> must want them." [...] By then, more than 2.5billion Kennedy half dollars had been struck, more than all previously struck half dollars combined. [...] The New York Times numismatic columnist Ed Reiter suggested that hoarding had continued even into the base-metal era, accounting for the shortage of pieces in commerce. [...] 1979-80 saw the destruction of many early Kennedy half dollars, as record high silver prices caused extensive melting of silver coins for their [...] metal content.|$|E

500|$|Through a Glass Darkly is a long, complex {{narrative}} that {{features more than}} 60 characters and at least 15 subplots. The title of the novel comes from the Bible verse 1 Corinthians 13. Before she began writing it, Koen envisioned creating {{a story about the}} relationship between a young woman and an older man, a plot element riddled with emotional tension that required much planning and foresight. Koen also sought to create a story that featured issues relevant to contemporary women, such as the non-existence of [...] "legal rights. If a husband wanted to beat his wife to death he could do it, and if her parents didn't care... No birth control. If you had any normal sexual urges you were pregnant all the time, and half the women died in childbirth. Life was very violent and short and I just wanted to show how it was without getting up on a soapbox, <b>so</b> <b>someone</b> reading it would say, 'I'm glad I live now.'" [...] According to Koen, another consistent theme throughout Through a Glass Darkly is how vital family is to our well-being, family in this case being a loose term that does not necessarily equate to being biologically-related. She was also interested in writing how people are connected to each other.|$|E
500|$|Further {{discussing}} the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as [...] "the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [...] {{were all about}} these weird visuals", as well as [...] "a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher". Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from [...] "a bunch of experimental, fractal videos from YouTube" [...] that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game Monument Valley. Derrickson's [...] "ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects {{to do things that}} are fresh and new—to not just blow things up." [...] Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them [...] "to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, <b>so</b> <b>someone</b> throws another bolt of lightning..." [...] Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action [...] "in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we’ve seen in any other movies." [...] On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on The Oath comic, while adding that the end fight was [...] "an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork" [...] from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take Inception [...] "to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie." [...] Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of [...] "a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing [...] "which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder".|$|E

2500|$|Modern Hungarian orthography is {{slightly}} simpler {{than that of}} the 18th and 19th centuries, but many Hungarians still use the older spelling for their names. For example, the letter 'c' is often written as 'cz'. Letters such as Q, W, X, or Y, which are usually only seen in foreign words, can also be seen in these older spellings of names, especially in old noble family names which stem from the Middle Ages. Some family names refer to a place of origin, and may be written ending in [...] "Y" [...] instead of [...] "I". <b>So</b> <b>someone</b> from Szolnok may spell his family name [...] "Szolnoky" [...] instead of [...] "Szolnoki" [...] but only if the chosen Y variant of the family name is not a protected name of a historically documented noble family.|$|E

2500|$|Abbott {{was born}} in Arlington, Texas on August 20, 1966, the son to Carolyn and Jerry Abbott, a country {{musician}} and producer. Before he wanted a guitar, Abbott asked his parents for a BMX bike. He took up the guitar when he was twelve, with his first being a Hondo-style Les Paul along with a small amplifier. At age 14, Darrell entered a cassette tape of his playing into a Dallas-area, guitar competition. [...] Darrell's tape was selected from over 150 entries, {{to be in the}} top 15. [...] Each finalist was invited to the Agora Ballroom in Dallas, TX to play for the grand prize, a new Dean ML Guitar. [...] Darrell's mother had to accompany him to the club because he was not old enough to get in. [...] A quiet, almost shy, Darrell easily won the event. [...] Months later, when the contest ran again, Darrell entered & [...] won that contest also, causing the contest sponsors to ask him not to enter the next time <b>so</b> <b>someone</b> else could win. [...] He would then sell the Dean ML guitar to luthier Buddy Blaze, who installed a Floyd Rose bridge and emblazoned it with Abbott's signature lightning bolt paint job; Blaze returned it some years later. Coincidentally, his father had also bought him a Dean ML the morning before the aforementioned competition, but one with a cherry sunburst finish instead. Abbott met his long-time girlfriend Rita Haney at a young age around the third grade.|$|E
