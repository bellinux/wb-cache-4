Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> master and control women's orgasms.|$|E

25|$|Wallsten {{analyzed}} the data {{derived from a}} detailed content analysis of print, broadcast and blog discussions during the last five weeks of the 2008 campaign. Rather than the broad impact posited by professional political observers, Wallsten found that, even on issues where the site <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have its largest impact, the stories highlighted on the Drudge Report exert a fairly inconsistent influence over what traditional media outlets chose to cover. Specifically, the time series analysis presented by Wallsten shows evidence of a “Drudge effect” on print and broadcast coverage for only five of the 10 political scandals that received the most attention on the Drudge Report between September 30 and November 3, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Since P. exigua colonies {{consist of}} many queens, wasps {{within a given}} colony <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have low {{relatedness}} among one another. However, cyclical oligogyny seems to help colonies maintain {{a higher level of}} relatedness. In cyclical oligogyny, new queens are only conceived after most of the colony’s queens have died. This late production of new queens guarantees that only a few queens from the previous generation participate. The relatedness among workers in P. exigua is 0.39, which is sufficient for wasps to exhibit worker behavior. Among queens from the same colony, 0.82 are genetically related. Therefore, queens demonstrate a significantly greater genetic relatedness than do workers from their same colony. Thus far, every epinonine species studied exhibits high relatedness among queens. This outcome of relation seems to {{play a crucial role in}} the wasp’s social behavior and in the colony’s success.|$|E

500|$|After placement, {{implants}} need to {{be cleaned}} (similar to natural teeth) with a Teflon instrument to remove any plaque. Because of the more precarious blood supply to the gingiva, care should be taken with dental floss. Implants will lose bone at a rate similar to natural teeth in the mouth (e.g. if someone suffers from periodontal disease, an implant can be affected by a similar disorder) but will otherwise last. The porcelain on crowns <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> discolour, fracture or require repair approximately every ten years, although there is significant variation in the service life of dental crowns based on the position in the mouth, the forces being applied from opposing teeth and the restoration material.

His body was taken back to Washington state and interred at New Tacoma Cemetery in Tacoma. Campbell had kept a journal throughout his life; Angie Lewis arranged for the journal to be donated to the UCSF Archives and Special Collections.|$|E
500|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson used the programming language BASIC {{to create the}} game, which Kimmo called noteworthy: it was considered impossible to write big programs in BASIC, and The Cottage was [...] "gigantic". The reason for their choice in programming language {{was that it was}} the only one all three knew beforehand; Kimmo said that they would no longer have chosen BASIC if they had programmed The Cottage in 1986, as they had access to many more programming languages by that time. According to Johansson, another reason was [...] "pure defiance" [...] towards the Eriksson brothers' father, who had told them they {{would never be able to}} get the game running if they programmed it in BASIC. Johansson said that the most challenging aspect of the development was getting the game to understand the Swedish language; to keep the size of the game's command interpreter [...] "reasonable", they decided to limit it to two-word commands. Acknowledging that different people use different words for things, they play-tested it with friends and family, writing down all attempted commands and deciding what the game <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> understand. During a short period of the game's development, the developers also logged all actions players at QZ had taken that the command interpreter had not understood; based on this data, they improved the interpreter and changed the outcomes to certain actions. At one point, the Eriksson {{brothers and}} Johansson took a two-year break from the game, but eventually returned to it and finished it in 1979. At this point, the only ways to play the game were by using a computer terminal in a university or by connecting to Oden via a modem.|$|E

Menger also developed the law of diminishing marginal utility. Menger's work found a significant and appreciative audience.|$|E
2500|$|In Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council (2008), the High Court {{questioned}} if proceedings {{held without}} legal representation {{would be subject}} to a different standard of natural justice. An example was whether the tribunal <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> warn an unrepresented individual of the legal implications if he or she fails to cross-examine witnesses. Judge of Appeal V. K. Rajah concluded that additional duties are not foisted on a tribunal merely because the individual is unrepresented. The main question in any alleged cases of breach of natural justice is whether the individuals concerned were given the opportunity to present their cases and if they suffered any prejudice as a result of any unfairness in the conduct of the proceedings. In the above case the appellant, a doctor who had been found guilty of professional misconduct, had been given the opportunity to present his case, cross-examine the witnesses, and also make a mitigation plea. Thus, the Court held that [...] "there was simply no basis to suggest that fairness had been compromised".|$|E

They did not give, militarily, a worth-while return for the resources in men, material and time that they absorbed. ... were usually formed by attracting the best men ... The result of these methods was undoubtedly to lower the quality of the rest of the Army". He makes several other arguments against special forces, about the danger of ordinary battalions thinking that some tasks could only be performed by special forces, and that special forces can only stay in the field for relatively short periods compared to regular battalions. He sums up that [...] "Anything, whatever the short cuts to victory it may promise, which thus weakens the Army spirit is dangerous". [...] To underline his point he suggests that [...] "This cult of special forces is as sensible as to form a Royal Corps of Tree Climbers and say that no soldier, who does not wear its green hat with a bunch of oak leaves stuck in it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> climb a tree".
