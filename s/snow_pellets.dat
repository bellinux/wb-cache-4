50|$|Freezing rain is {{the name}} given to rain that falls when surface {{temperatures}} are below freezing. Unlike sleet, a mixture of rain and <b>snow,</b> ice <b>pellets,</b> or hail, freezing rain is made entirely of liquid droplets. The raindrops become supercooled while passing through a sub-freezing layer of air hundreds of meters above the ground, and then freeze upon impact with any surface they encounter, including the ground, trees, electrical wires, and automobiles. The resulting ice, called glaze, can accumulate to a thickness of several centimeters and cover all exposed surfaces. The METAR code for freezing rain is FZRA.|$|R

At AMIL, freezing rain, freezing drizzle, icing fog and in-cloud icing {{as well as}} frost, <b>snow,</b> ice <b>pellets</b> and icing clouds can be simulated {{in a variety of}} cold chambers of different heights and with different wind conditions using specialized spraying systems and temperature set-ups. Freezing rain is simulated using a 9 m high vertical chamber capable of supercooling water droplets from 100 to 1000 μm, so they freeze not long after impact. The freezing drizzle is simulated in a 4 m high chamber where supercooled droplets from 50 to 250 μm freeze on impact. Icing fog and in-cloud icing are simulated {{with the help of a}} pneumatic spray nozzle system which allows for a finer water spray, in the 20 μm diameter range. The frost is simulated by saturating a cold room with humidity generated from a heated, temperature controlled water bath. Snow is simulated with a fine pneumatic water spray which forms a soft rime simulating the effect of natural <b>snow.</b> Ice <b>pellets</b> are made in the 9 m high vertical cold chamber using strong turbulent wind that increases the air residency and convective air cooling of water droplets so they freeze before impact. Finally, icing wind tunnels allow for the simulation of an object iced through a passing supercooled cloud.

5000|$|Graupel ( [...] ; [...] ), {{also called}} soft hail or <b>snow</b> <b>pellets,</b> is {{precipitation}} that forms when supercooled droplets of water are collected and freeze on falling snowflakes, forming 2 - 5 mm balls of rime. The term graupel {{comes from the}} German language.|$|E

5000|$|Like other precipitation, hail {{forms in}} storm clouds when {{supercooled}} water droplets freeze on contact with condensation nuclei, such as dust or dirt.

Snow, which is virtually unheard of, is officially on the record books of the past 200 years as having occurred in January 1858 (widespread snowfall), March 1877 (light snow without accumulation), February 1895 (snow squalls without accumulation), January 1905 (flurries without accumulation), March 1949 (snow recorded in the interior of the island), and 31 January 1962, On 31 December 2014 [...] "snow" [...] was reported at various locations. however the Malta Met Office has now confirmed these were showers of soft hail or graupel sometimes also called <b>snow</b> <b>pellets,</b> but they are actually small lumps of ice.

These storms can produce strong easterly driven winds that fetch additional moisture from Lake Ontario. They frequently come with a volatile mix of <b>snow,</b> ice <b>pellets,</b> freezing rain and sometimes just ordinary rain, all of which can disrupt transportation, and in severe cases, interrupt power supply.

The ice itself is not black, but visually transparent, allowing the often black road below to be seen through it. The typically low levels of noticeable ice <b>pellets,</b> <b>snow,</b> or sleet surrounding black ice means that areas of the ice are often practically invisible to drivers or people stepping on it. There is, thus, a risk of skidding and subsequent accident due to the unexpected loss of traction. A similar problem is encountered with diesel fuel spills on roads.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the types of winter precipitation that occur near 0 °C, specifically rain, freezing rain, freezing drizzle, ice pellets, <b>snow</b> <b>pellets,</b> and wet snow. It follows from a call by M. Ralph et al. for more attention {{to be paid to}} this precipitation since it represents {{one of the most serious}} wintertime quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF) issues. The formation of the many precipitation types involves ice-phase and/or liquid-phase processes, and thresholds in the degree of melting and/or freezing often dictate the types occurring at the surface. Some types can occur simultaneously so that, for example, ensuing collisions between supercooled raindrops and ice pellets that form ice pellet aggregates can lead to substantial reductions in the occurrence of freezing rain at the surface, and ice crystal multiplication processes can lead to locally produced ice crystals in the subfreezing layer below inversions. Highly variable fall velocities within the background temperature and wind fields of precipitation-type transition regions lead to varying particle trajectories and significant alterations in the distribution of precipitation amount and type at the surface. Physically based predictions that account for at least some of the phase changes and particle interactions are now in operation. Outstanding issues to be addressed include the impacts of accretion on precipitation-type formation, quantification of melting and freezing rates of the highly variable precipitation, the consequences of collisions between the various types, and the onset of ice nucleation and its effects. The precipitation physics perspective of this article furthermore needs to be integrated into a comprehensive understanding involving the surrounding and interacting environment...|$|E
40|$|Deicing and {{anti-icing}} fluids {{are used}} to remove and prevent ice formation on aircraft before takeoff. Holdover times (HOT) published by the FAA are used by pilots as guidelines indicating the amount of effective time of a fluid under certain freezing precipitation types. However, the times on these tables are based on endurance time tests involving a visual estimate of failure on a flat plate [1]: when 30 % of the fluid is covered with white snow under snow precipitation, although the times have been correlated to aircraft wing tests [2] they do not address the mechanism of fluid failure. To measure and understand the fluid mechanisms conducting to failure, the Anti-icing Materials International Laboratory (AMIL) developed a simplified test with a generic deicing propylene glycol-based fluid. The test consisted of pouring 400 mL of the generic deicing fluid on a 5 dm by 3 dm level flat plate where the plate edges were rimmed with insolated walls to make a waterproof open box. The flat plate covered with deicing fluid was submitted to snow precipitation {{in the form of}} regular snow and simulated <b>snow</b> <b>pellets.</b> The snow precipitation intensities and temperatures tested were based on ARP 5485. The standard test method for testing snow indoors includes using a heating pad to compensate for the lack of thermal equilibration which occurs in outside with wind and the larger air mass. It was the energy solicited by the fluid melting the snow from the heat pad that was used to develop a model for fluid failure. Three precipitation intensities and eight temperatures with the generic deicing fluid and commercial Type I and Type IV fluids were studied. At fluid failure, snow mass, and energy provided to melt the snow were independent of snow intensity and type of snow, however endurance time and supplied power were dependent on snow intensity but independent of snow type. Visual observations showed that {{only a fraction of the}} falling snow in contact with the fluid covering the aluminium plate melts, the unmelted snowflakes descend by gravity into the fluid and accumulate on the aluminium plate surface. The energy to melt the snow was provided by a heating system. The proposed model assumes that enough energy is available to melt all the snow that a deicing fluid is able to absorb under water form and that the water can diffuse rapidly into the deicing fluid due to multiple diffusion sites resulting in an uniform propylene glycol concentration and predicted well the endurance time and the snow mass at fluid failure for a generic deicing and Type I fluid with an error of 7 %. A semi-empirical relation was used in the model to evaluate the melting fraction; this relation, based on a phase diagram, can be used to estimate the propylene glycol concentration, the power and the energy as a function of time at the fluid failure. However, the model could not predict the endurance time of Type IV anti-icing fluids...|$|E
40|$|Icing {{wind tunnel}} tests were {{conducted}} at the National Research Council Canada's 3 m x 6 m Propulsion and Icing Wind Tunnel (PIWT) located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada early in 2011 and 2012. These tests were {{a continuation of the}} work performed in 2010 on a generic supercritical airfoil representative of a regional-jet type aircraft wing section. Tests nominally consisted of coating the wing with de/anti-icing fluid, applying various levels of precipitation (e. g., <b>snow,</b> ice <b>pellets,</b> freezing rain, or combinations thereof), and simulating a take-off condition in the wind tunnel by accelerating the wind speed and pitching the wing through a desired pitch-profile. The wing performance was evaluated primarily by the measured lift-loss relative to the lift generated by a clean wing. The second phase of testing consisted of test cases similar to the 2010 tests in order to expand the scope of the data sets at various temperatures, while also investigating the effects of the rotation speed and ramp time on lift-loss and the effects of fluids and precipitation on stall. The experimental results were used as guidance for regulators in determining holdover and allowance times for aircraft operating in winter precipitation. 9 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

50|$|WSR-88D sites {{across the}} nation have been {{upgraded}} to polarimetric radar, which adds vertical polarization to the horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern what is reflecting the signal. This so-called dual polarization allows the radar to distinguish between rain, hail and snow, something the horizontally polarized radars cannot accurately do. Early trials showed that rain, ice <b>pellets,</b> <b>snow,</b> hail, birds, insects, and ground clutter all have different signatures with dual polarization, which could mark a significant improvement in forecasting winter storms and severe thunderstorms.

5000|$|Both areas {{receive more}} than 500 in of {{snowfall}} per year, due to lake-effect enhancement from the Great Salt Lake, making them the second snowiest ski {{areas in the}} United States (after {{the ones in the}} Cascades). In contrast to the humid and wet conditions in the Cascades near the Pacific Ocean, the arid condition of the Great Basin produces very dry and powdery snow, making Snowbird and Alta top global destinations for powder-skiing aficionados. Another benefit of being East of the great salt lake is that salt from the lake provides the condensation nuclei that creates ice <b>pellet</b> <b>snow</b> that doesn't pack like normal snowflakes. Loose powder for days after a snowfall is common. On very windy days the salt is lifted thousands of feet and has been known to coat the windshield of airplanes flying into Salt Lake City.|$|R
40|$|The Hyperspectral Microwave Atmospheric Sounder (HyMAS) {{is being}} {{developed}} at Lincoln Laboratories and accommodated by the Goddard Space Flight Center for a flight opportunity on a NASA research aircraft. The term "hyperspectral microwave" is used to indicate an all-weather sounding that performs equivalent to hyperspectral infrared sounders in clear air with vertical resolution of approximately 1 km. Deploying the HyMAS equipped scanhead with the existing Conical Scanning Microwave Imaging Radiometer (CoSMIR) shortens the path to a flight demonstration. Hyperspectral microwave is achieved {{through the use of}} independent RF antennas that sample the volume of the Earth s atmosphere through various levels of frequencies, thereby producing a set of dense, spaced vertical weighting functions. The simulations proposed for HyMAS 118 / 183 -GHz system should yield surface precipitation rate and water path retrievals for small hail, soft hail, or <b>snow</b> <b>pellets,</b> snow, rainwater, etc. with accuracies comparable to those of the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder. Further improvements in retrieval methodology (for example, polarization exploitation) are expected. The CoSMIR instrument is a packaging concept re-used on HyMAS to ease the integration features of the scanhead. The HyMAS scanhead will include an ultra-compact Intermediate Frequency Processor (IFP) module that is mounted inside the door to improve thermal management. The IFP is fabricated with materials made of Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology integrated with detectors, amplifiers, A/D conversion and data aggregation. The IFP will put out 52 channels of 16 bit data comprised of 4 - 9 channel data streams for temperature profiles and 2 - 8 channel streams for water vapor. With the limited volume of the existing CoSMIR scanhead and new HyMAS front end components, the HyMAS team at Goddard began preliminary layout work inside the new drum. Importing and re-using models of the shell, the scan head computer, and the slip rings developed for CoSMIR was the starting point. The next step was to modify the antenna faceplate to accommodate the dimensions of the three dual polarization Gaussian Optics Antenna (GOA) assemblies. Two mechanical concepts for the core technology, the hyperspectral IFP, were captured in a design tradeoff. Connector models considered minimum bend radii for the IFP analog connectors. Hyperspectral imaging is accomplished by strategically using a short wavelength intermediate frequency of 18 - 29 GHz, and thus reducing the size of components in the connection of the front end to the IFP. The SMK (2. 92 mm) Series connector will lay near the hinge line to minimize its flexing. The digital output of the IFP will use a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) that must be accommodated by the scan head computer. To make that computer more reliable, maintainable, and forward compatible with the 52 HyMAS channels, a testbed of the scan head, calibration, and archive computers and the PIC 24 microprocessor that resides on the IFP is in development. The computers will be programmed using a new framework application called Interoperable Remote Component (IRC). This software allows flexibility to program computers that communicate with each other and can adapt easily to the emerging HyMAS requirements for data format, algorithms, and graphical user interface (GUI). It is expected that the CoSMIR instrument will cut over to the IRC after it is adapted on an updated CoSMIR testbed...|$|E

Analyses of Austrian C‑band polarimetric weather radar data reveal cloud microphysical insights {{in the internal}} structure of such systems accompanied by the transition from <b>snow</b> toward ice <b>pellets</b> and subsequent freezing rain and warm rain. Polarimetric radar data are exploited using a recently suggested quasi-vertical profiles (QVP) technique.

Because the QVP polarimetric radar data are represented in a height vs time format which is fully compatible with the format the data from vertically pointing remote sensors such as cloud radars or wind profilers are displayed, their combined use is very efficient for understanding and monitoring microphysical processes leading to precipitation formation. This is demonstrated by the joint analysis of the polarimetric and profiler data at the Vienna airport. The QVP methodology is particularly effective for monitoring weather in the terminal areas of airports because of its local coverage and high precision as well as its potential for nowcasting.

40|$|Colonies of N- 2 -fixing {{cyanobacteria}} are {{key players}} in supplying new nitrogen to the ocean, but the biological fate of this fixed nitrogen remains poorly constrained. Here, we report on aerobic and anaerobic microbial nitrogen transformation processes that co-occur within millimetre-sized cyanobacterial aggregates (Nodularia spumigena) collected in aerated surface waters in the Baltic Sea. Microelectrode profiles showed steep oxygen gradients inside the aggregates {{and the potential for}} nitrous oxide production in the aggregates' anoxic centres. N- 15 -isotope labelling experiments and nutrient analyses revealed that N- 2 fixation, ammonification, nitrification, nitrate reduction to ammonium, denitrification and possibly anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) can co-occur within these consortia. Thus, N. spumigena aggregates are potential sites of nitrogen gain, recycling and loss. Rates of nitrate reduction to ammonium and N- 2 were limited by low internal nitrification rates and low concentrations of nitrate in the ambient water. Presumably, patterns of N-transformation processes similar to those observed in this study arise also in other phytoplankton colonies, marine <b>snow</b> and fecal <b>pellets.</b> Anoxic microniches, as a pre-condition for anaerobic nitrogen transformations, may occur within large aggregates (>= 1 mm) even when suspended in fully oxygenated waters, whereas anoxia in small aggregates (= 0. 1 mm) may only arise in lowoxygenated waters (1. 5 mu M), O- 2 -depleted water layers, for example, in the chemocline of the Baltic Sea or the oceanic mesopelagic zone, aggregates may promote N-recycling and -loss processes...|$|R
40|$|Effective and {{efficient}} removal {{of snow and}} ice from public roadways is a key outcome for winter road maintenance operations. This outcome depends on {{the severity of the}} wintry weather as well as {{the quality and quantity of}} resources used to treat the roadways. Wintry weather conditions vary substantially from hour-to-hour, storm-to-storm, and season-to-season. Many different transportation departments have used empirical statistical models and machine learning methods based upon weather parameters to develop indices to estimate the severity of winter weather. Many of these previous studies used summary statistics, such as the number of days with certain events (snowfall, freezing rain, frost), to provide a seasonal index of winter severity. While summarizing the winter severity for the entire season is quite useful, providing information over shorter time periods will allow for more precise evaluation of maintenance performance during a winter season. A winter weather severity index has been developed that can be used to evaluate the performance of winter weather maintenance. This project involves the development of a physically-based analysis of winter severity, using estimates of the hourly rate of deposition of new snow/ice and the energy required melt it. The “Road Weather Severity Based on Environmental Energy” (RWSBEE) index can be considered an accumulation of energy, beyond that which is available from the environment, needed to melt snow/ice that has been deposited on the road surface on an hourly basis. The energy not provided by the environment that would be required to melt new snow can be thought of as a measure of the work required to remove the new snow from the road surface. We expect that RWSBEE will provide a clearer understanding of the severity of the weather, allowing INDOT to better evaluate their performance, assist with after-action review of recent storms, and improve the reaction to future weather events. Measurable improvements in the winter maintenance decision-making process are expected as a result. Winter weather conditions that occur across different regions vary substantially from hour-to-hour, storm-to-storm, and season-to-season. The methods of road maintenance for fighting snow and ice can also vary between different maintenance units. It is important for organizations that perform road maintenance to be able to quantify the severity of the winter weather conditions, for purposes of monitoring, planning, and evaluating their performance. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) currently uses estimates of winter weather hours to quantify the severity of winter weather. The definition of a “weather hour” is fairly straightforward: any hour when wintry precipitation (<b>snow,</b> ice <b>pellets,</b> freezing rain) is falling with air temperatures below 35 °F. While this definition is reasonable, it does not take into account numerous factors that can strongly affect road conditions and subsequent efforts needed for road treatment, such as: precipitation rate, wind speed, and availability of sunshine. Consequently, INDOT has determined that the information provided by the weather hour estimates result in wide variations in roadway treatment expenses across Indiana. In order to more accurately and effectively evaluate the performance of winter maintenance, it is important to have detailed data related to winter weather conditions that provide useful information regarding the impact of winter weather on road conditions. State-of-the-art weather information can provide a clearer understanding of the severity of the weather, allowing INDOT to better evaluate their performance, assist with after-action review of recent storms, and improve the reaction to future weather events...|$|R
