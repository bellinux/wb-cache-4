5000|$|As {{photography}} {{became more}} ubiquitous, geological surveys began enlisting {{the help of}} full-time photographers as well as community volunteers. A Nature article from 1889 requests [...] "photographs of localities, sections, or other features of geological interest in the United Kingdom" [...] to be [...] "placed before the Geological Section of the British Association" [...] {{in an effort to}} unify the photographic surveys completed by miscellaneous and sundry local societies and expand any existing archives. The article also asks for [...] "the names of local Societies, or persons who are willing to arrange for a photographic survey for geological purposes in their district." [...] This marked the primitive beginning of the type of large-scale <b>survey</b> <b>photography</b> that would go on to manifest itself in the realms of aerial photography, which was used as a survey tool by the USGS beginning just before World War I, and eventually satellite imagery.|$|E
40|$|An unusual, highly modified, Baker reflector-corrector class {{telescope}} {{has been}} adapted for wide field <b>survey</b> <b>photography</b> {{in the near}} infrared. This optical system uses a full field corrector plate and a field flattening lens to provide a flat field subtending about 4. 5 deg on the sky. The small aperture telescope (20 inch primary) has been modified {{for use in the}} Newtonian focus configuration while preserving the optical elements of the Prime focus configuration. The telescope has been further modified to accept a very large format (146 mm diameter photocathode) image intensifier camera to serve as a detector. The camera output is recorded photographically on film rather than glass plates. This unique instrument system is used in a program of sky <b>survey</b> <b>photography</b> in the optical infrared (8000 - 9000 A bandpass) supplemented by visual bandpass photography. The photographs obtained with this system are of value not only for the extreme redness of the band but also because of their high resolution and their freedom from hydrogen emission...|$|E

40|$|This volume {{explores the}} origins, {{formulation}} and eventual {{failure of the}} National Photographic Record Association which was founded by Stone, its driving force. It emerged from the wider photographic survey movement in which amateur photographs were encouraged to record and archive the antiquities and customs of the British Isles photographically, and deposit {{the results for the}} public good in the British Museum. Based on detailed and new archival research the volume brings a fresh and more nuanced reading to Stone’s photography, positioning it not in terms of individual vision but in the wider cultural processes of both amateur photography and the preservationist movement as an expression of historical consciousness. It argues that, contrary to earlier readings, <b>survey</b> <b>photography</b> cannot be reduced to a middle class nostalgia but is concerned with a dynamic vision of the place of the past in the future {{and the creation of a}} collective memory bank for the nation. The volume comprises a scholarly essay, bibliography and selection of photographs, made specifically to demonstrate those arguments...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages [151]- 156. The {{impact of}} {{documentary}} photography on photojournalism {{has been an}} ongoing process since photography's first introduction in 1839. This historical study follows the association between documentary photography and photojournalism from 1839 to present. Chapter 1 discusses and defines the issue of documentary photography and identifies it as an underlying force {{in the development of}} photojournalism. Chapter 2 is an examination of the development of the photograph as a document and covers the period of the 1800 's. It describes the early years of portraiture, of landscape and <b>survey</b> <b>photography,</b> of war photography, and goes into detail on documentary photography's first use as a tool for social change. The turn of the century was a critical period of aesthetic development for photography and for photographers. Chapter 3 presents the arguments surrounding "Pictorialism" and "Realism" and {{takes a look at the}} individuals who brought photography into the Twentieth Century. Chapter 4 covers the 1930 's and 1940 's. It discusses the Farm Security Administration project, the photography of World War II, the birth of the photo magazines, and the post-war effort to keep documentary photography alive. The 1950 's and 1960 's are commonly regarded as being the formulative years of modern documentary photojournalism. Chapter 5 elaborates on the aesthetic conditions of this era and highlights the individuals who played key roles. The maturation of documentary photography and modern photojournalism is discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. Also part of these chapters are observations on current trends and comments on future possibilities. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|E
