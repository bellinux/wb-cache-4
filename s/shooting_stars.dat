5|$|On {{the right}} flank, {{north of the}} road, the North Koreans overran the {{battalion}} observation post and B Company's outpost line. This high ground changed hands three times during the day. While the infantry fight was in progress, and shortly after the first tank penetration, five more T-34s came around the road bend toward the US 71st Tank Battalion. Check had called for an air strike when the first tanks appeared. Three F-80 <b>Shooting</b> <b>Stars</b> arrived and immediately dived on the approaching group of tanks, destroying three of them with 5-inch rockets. Altogether, bazooka, artillery, and air strikes knocked out six North Korean tanks during the morning, either within or {{on the edge of}} the 1st Battalion position. In its first engagement with American troops, the NK 2nd Division lost all but two of the eight tanks that had been attached to it a few days earlier at Chongju.|$|E
5|$|Having {{established}} that the North Koreans held the high ground, Green ordered Morrison to withdraw across the bridge {{in order to allow}} an airstrike to take place from 17:15, with the platoon bringing 10 North Korean prisoners with them as they did so. Two United States Air Force (USAF) F-80 <b>Shooting</b> <b>Stars</b> subsequently strafed the North Korean positions across the river until 17:30. A and B Companies were then instructed to prepare to assault the North Korean positions on the western bank; however, the approach of dusk prevented a second airstrike and a fire plan was subsequently arranged by the American artillery and the battalion mortars before a more substantial thrust across the river was launched by the Australians. In the meantime Green had also sent D Company into Pakchon to clear the town {{in order to protect the}} Australian right flank, and under the command of Major Walter Brown they reported entering the town at 17:00. D Company subsequently returned at 18:30, bringing 225 prisoners with them after leaving a platoon to guard the American engineers which had begun constructing a ford from a damaged underwater bridge for use the following day. Meanwhile, a North Korean machine-gun sporadically engaged the Australians on their left, while strong concentrations of North Korean troops were detected on the west bank.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other games}} in the genre, the player plays the main portion of Shiny Festa gameplay, Stage mode, {{as he or she}} listens to a {{selected}} song. Each song's performance is limited to a predetermined idol or group of idols, unlike the franchise's previous games. During a song, a predetermined sequence of note icons scroll along several lines, called Melody Lines, toward a central target icon. To complete a song, the player must press buttons that correspond to the direction from which the notes originate from—the buttons on the console's left and right halves for the PlayStation Portable version, and the left and right halves of the screen for the iOS version—as they pass over the target icon. The player is scored by these presses' accuracy in timing and direction, for which he or she is given one of four ratings: Perfect, Good, Normal, and Bad. The player's performance is also represented by the Sparkle Meter, which increases or decreases as the player successfully or fails to hit a note. Throughout the song, new target icons and lines may spawn at predetermined times in different locations of the screen to supersede or accompany old ones. The note sequences may also include Long Icons, which are streaks of notes that need to be continuously held down; Simultaneous Icons, which are pairs of icons that pass over the target icon simultaneously; and <b>Shooting</b> <b>Stars,</b> which appears once the Sparkle Meter is filled, and causes a Shining Burst that raises the player's score and changes the song's accompanying music video when it is hit. The complexity of the song's sequence varies based on the player's selected difficulty for the song; there are four difficulty levels: Debut, Normal, Pro, and Master from the easiest to the hardest.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shooting</b> <b>Star's</b> {{identity}} was {{at some point}} taken over by an unnamed demon in the employ of Master Pandemonium, who believed Firebird {{to be one of}} the possessors of his fragmented soul. To keep the Rangers from meeting regularly and perhaps posing a threat to him before he had completed his study of Firebird, Pandemonium dispatched the demon to take <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star's</b> place. Firebird nevertheless believed the demon to be hiding among the Avengers' West Coast branch and with her guidance the Rangers confronted the heroes, only to flush the demon in <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star</b> out of hiding. The demon claimed that <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star</b> was a human guise it had taken long before, that there never was a Victoria Star. The Avengers imprisoned the demon at their Compound and began an investigation of Master Pandemonium, but the Texas Twister, demonstrating a curious lack of concern, did not accompany them. Soon, however, Texas Twister returned to the Avengers Compound at a time when Hawkeye was alone, demanding to see the captive demon. Twister declared his love for the demon, which turned back into <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star.</b> Texas Twister went on to explain that the demon had come to him months ago when Twister's powers seemed to be fading, making him afraid that he would lose <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star</b> if their rodeo act broke up on account of his lost powers. The demon offered to augment the Twister's powers in exchange for his soul, and the Twister agreed, but after his powers were restored he begged to be spared, so the demon possessed <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star</b> instead, casting a spell that prevented Twister from telling anyone about this. Twister studied the occult until he found a means to expel the demon from Star. The demon then possessed Twister himself and battled Hawkeye and <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star.</b> Ultimately, Star threatened to kill the demon rather than allow the possession to continue, and the demon reluctantly imprisoned itself in a statue. Texas Twister and <b>Shooting</b> <b>Star</b> were reunited.|$|R

In the senton variation, this move is called the <b>shooting</b> <b>star</b> senton.|$|R
