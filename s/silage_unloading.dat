40|$|Oxygen (O 2) {{concentration}} {{inside the}} substrate {{is an important}} measurement for silage-research and-practical management. In the laboratory gas chromatography is commonly employed for O 2 measurement. Among sensor-based techniques, accurate and reliable in situ measurement is rare because of high levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2) generated {{by the introduction of}} O 2 in the silage. The presented study focused on assessing three types of commercial O 2 sensors, including Clark oxygen electrodes (COE), galvanic oxygen cell (GOC) sensors and the Dräger chip measurement system (DCMS). Laboratory cross calibration of O 2 versus CO 2 (each 0 – 15 vol. %) was made for the COE and the GOC sensors. All calibration results verified that O 2 measurements for both sensors were insensitive to CO 2. For the O 2 in situ measurement in silage, all O 2 sensors were first tested in two sealed barrels (diameter 35. 7 cm; height: 60 cm) to monitor the O 2 depletion with respect to the ensiling process (Test-A). The second test (Test-B) simulated the <b>silage</b> <b>unloading</b> process by recording the O 2 penetration dynamics in three additional barrels, two covered by dry ice (0. 6 kg or 1. 2 kg of each) on the top surface and one without. Based on a general comparison of the experimental data, we conclude that each of these in situ sensor monitoring techniques for O 2 concentration in silage exhibit individual advantages and limitations...|$|E

Bottom silo unloaders are utilized at times but have problems with difficulty of repair.|$|R
