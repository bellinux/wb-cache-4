40|$|The {{interfacial}} reaction between electroless Ni(P) under-bump metallization (UBM) {{and solders}} is studied. A P-rich layer {{forms in the}} UBM along the <b>solder</b> <b>side</b> after reflow and thermal aging. Crack formation inside the P-rich layer can sometimes penetrate throughout the entire UBM layer structure. The Ni(P) UBM degradation occurs earlier in the Sn 3. 5 Ag solder than in Sn 37 Pb because of its higher reflow temperature. Despite {{the formation of a}} P-rich layer and cracks inside the UBM, it still keeps its original function within the high-temperature storage period in this study. Explanations for the formation of the P-rich layer and cracks in the UBM are outlined along with explanations for the Ni(P) UBM degradation process...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{metallization}} chemistry on the solid state growth kinetics of intermetallics formed {{in an industrial}} metallization/solder/metallization arrangement during isothermal ageing has been studied. During isothermal ageing of the Cu/Sn-Ag-Cu/Cu arrangement at temperatures lower than 125 °C, Cu was the main mobile element and diffused either through or along interfacial Cu 6 Sn 5 grain boundaries to react with Sn on the <b>solder</b> <b>side</b> of the Cu 6 Sn 5 layer; while for temperatures greater than 125 °C, both Cu and Sn were relatively mobile. Isothermal ageing of the Cu/Sn-Ag-Cu/Ni-Au asymmetric arrangement showed a concentration gradient of Ni and Cu across the entire ball in the solder joints leading to an inhomogeneous precipitation of (Cu, Ni) 6 Sn 5 {{in the vicinity of}} the Ni metallization. Ni alloying of the interface reaction products also occurred {{in the vicinity of the}} Cu metallization, reducing the growth rate of Cu 6 Sn 5 and Cu 3 Sn by 20 % and 70 % respectively when compared with symmetric Cu/Sn-Ag-Cu/Cu arrangement. Growth rate studies and microscopy suggested the presence of the Cu 6 Sn 5 η' → η transformation during extended ageing in the region of 150 - 175 °C, which is generally under-reported in these important commercial systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.

50|$|Normally {{pin headers}} are pin through hole (PTH) devices, but surface-mount {{technology}} (SMT) versions {{of one and}} two row pin headers also exist. In the latter case the <b>solder</b> <b>sides</b> of the pins are simply bent on a 90 degree angle {{so as to be}} soldered to a solder plane. On single row pin headers the pins are bent alternating to one side or the other, on dual row pin headers the pins are simply bent outwards. If pin headers are optional, the PTH variant is often chosen for ease of manual assembly. Pin headers can be either straight or angled. The latter form is often used to connect two boards together.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the effects of adding Ni {{nanoparticles}} to a Sn– 3. 8 Ag– 0. 7 Cu solder. The nanocomposite was prepared by manual blending of SAC solder paste with various percentages of Ni particles. Results showed that the addition of Ni nanoparticles did not bring any significant change in the onset melting temperature of the solder. An increase in the weight percentage of nanoparticles in the solder caused an increase of the wetting angle and a decrease of spreading rate. Moreover, the addition of Ni nanoparticles changed the interfacial intermetallic compound morphology from a scalloped structure into a planar type structure, enhanced the growth of (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 and suppressed that of Cu 3 Sn. The concentration of Ni in (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 was higher at the <b>solder</b> <b>side</b> compared with the substrate side. No nickel was detected in the Cu 3 Sn phase. Ni nanoparticle additions caused an increase in the interdiffusion coefficient in (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5, but a reduction in Cu 3 Sn. All these effects found in the Ni nanoparticle doped solder are similar to the case when Ni is added as an alloying element. Hence, it is suggested that Ni nanoparticles dissolve into the molten solder and influence the intermetallic compound formation through conventional alloying effects...|$|E

But, so far, these alloys have not been tested in the industrial environment. In this study, Zn-Al-Ge alloy solder wire was used for Si die attachment on Cu substrate in an automatic die attach machine. The {{back side of the}} die was metalized with Ti/Ni/Ag layers. Die attachment was performed in a forming gas environment at temperatures ranging from 370 oC to 390 oC. Interfacial structure at the Si die and Cu substrate interfaces, and the bulk solder microstructure were investigated using an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). Wetting characteristics and die shear strength were also studied. Cross sectional microstructural investigation revealed that as many as three intermetallic (IMCs) layers form at the solder/copper interface. A CuZn intermetallic layer forms close to copper, a scallop shaped CuZn 4 forms at the <b>solder</b> <b>side,</b> while Cu 5 Zn 8 forms at the middle. At the Si die-solder interface, with Ti/Ni/Ag metallization, no IMC layer was detected. Microstructural evidence suggests that Ni layer did not react with the Zn-Al-Ge solder. The microstructure of the bulk solder consists of mainly two phases: one with a lighter contrast and the other one being darker under the SEM. The phase with lighter contrast is a zinc rich phase containing an average of about 70. 9...|$|E

40|$|Au-Ge-Ni solder {{was chosen}} for brazing of the Cu-Cr-Zr alloy {{cylinder}} and a part with a cylindrical hole (sleeve) below 550 °C.

50|$|Nanofoil is {{frequently}} used for soldering and brazing, as a heat source. When sandwiched between the components to be joined, either with a foil of <b>solder</b> on each <b>side,</b> using <b>solder</b> precoated components, or using solder-coated NanoFoil, it uniformly delivers {{significant amount of}} heat energy across the entire area, melting the solder and only locally heating {{the surface of the}} substrates, lowering the heat load on the component in comparison with soldering/brazing in a furnace. An externally applied even pressure during reaction and cooling serves to ensure a good homogeneous joint without voids. This process is known as NanoBond. Significantly dissimilar materials can be bonded without cracking: semiconductors, metals, ceramics, and polymers. The energy is deposited very locally, without significant heating of the bulk of the substrates, which reduces problems with mismatched thermal expansion coefficients between the materials and allows their joining at room temperature.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that lead-free solder underperforms conventional leaded solder in reliability under dynamic impact. Common failures observed on ball-grid-array (BGA) solder balls on chip under board level impact include bulk solder ductile failure, intermetallic (IMC) layer crack and pad-lift. In this work, a finite element modeling approach was proposed to model bulk solder ductile failure and intermetallic layer crack. The use of beam elements and connector elements to represent the bulk <b>solders</b> and board/component <b>side</b> intermetallic layers, respectively, offers the advantage of simplicity {{over the use of}} continuum elements and cohesive elements for solder joints. This approach enables the modeling of assembly level impact with significantly less computational resources. The model was verified by comparing its prediction of BGA solder reliability against actual test results in a dynamic four-point bend test. The physical tests consist of ball impact at varying heights on a board with a mounted chip, and the subsequent analysis of the failure modes of the BGA solder joints. Simulation results were in good agreement with test results. The study shows that it is feasible to model BGA solder joint ductile failure and intermetallic layer crack under impact with simple elements with reasonable accuracy...|$|R
40|$|A {{system is}} {{proposed}} for packaging material samples {{on a remote}} planet (especially Mars) in sealed sample tubes in preparation for later return to Earth. The sample tubes (Figure 1) would comprise (1) tubes initially having open tops and closed bottoms; (2) small, bellows-like collapsible bodies inside the tubes at their bottoms; and (3) plugs to be eventually used to close {{the tops of the}} tubes. The top inner surface of each tube would be coated with <b>solder.</b> The <b>side</b> of each plug, which would fit snugly into a tube, would feature a solder-filled ring groove. The system would include equipment for storing, manipulating, filling, and sealing the tubes. The containerization system (see Figure 2) will be organized in stations and will include: the storage station, the loading station, and the heating station. These stations can be structured in circular or linear pattern to minimize the manipulator complexity, allowing for compact design and mass efficiency. The manipulation of the sample tube between stations is done by a simple manipulator arm. The storage station contains the unloaded sample tubes and the plugs before sealing as well as the sealed sample tubes with samples after loading and sealing. The chambers at the storage station also allow for plug insertion into the sample tube. At the loading station the sample is poured or inserted into the sample tube and then the tube is topped off. At the heating station the plug is heated so the solder ring melts and seals the plug to the sample tube. The process is performed as follows: Each tube is filled or slightly overfilled with sample material and the excess sample material is wiped off the top. Then, the plug is inserted into the top section of the tube packing the sample material against the collapsible bellowslike body allowing the accommodation of the sample volume. The plug and the top of the tube are heated momentarily to melt the solder in order to seal the tube...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design technique {{that has been}} adopted for packaging of Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nasal sensor for biomedical applications. The PVDF film with the dimension of length 10 mm, width 5 mm and thickness 28 mu m was firmly adhered {{on one end of}} plastic base (8 mmx 5 mmx 30 mu m) {{in such a way that}} it forms a cantilever configuration leaving the other end free for deflection. Now with the leads attached on the surface of the PVDF film, the cantilever configuration becomes the PVDF nasal sensor. For mounting a PVDF nasal sensor, a special headphone was designed, that can fit most of the human head sizes. Two flexible strings are <b>soldered</b> on either <b>side</b> of the headphone. Two identical PVDF nasal sensors were then connected to either side of flexible string of the headphone in such a way that they are placed below the right and left nostrils respectively without disturbing the normal breathing. When a subject wares headphone along with PVDF nasal sensors, two voltage signals due to the piezoelectric property of the PVDF film were generated corresponding to his/her nasal airflow from right and left nostril. The entire design was made compact, so that PVDF nasal sensors along with headphone can be made portable. No special equipment or machines are needed for mounting the PVDF nasal sensors. The time required for packaging of PVDF nasal sensors was less and the approximate cost of the entire assembly (PVDF nasal sensors + headphone) was very nominal...|$|R
40|$|Each {{system is}} {{designed}} to fulfill the desired purpose. It is defined by its inputs, outputs, structure, environment, boundary, and the including elements (subsystems). Due to the ongoing miniaturization and integration the complexity of subsystems increases continuously. This paper is intended to demonstrate the build-up of modular Microsystems. By using the embedding technology, each subsystem (module) is interchangeable and stackable. Therefore, the functionality of the entire system depends solely on the selected modules. Moreover, the enhancement, expansion or redesign {{can be accomplished by}} replacing existing or adding new modules. The communication between the individual modules is based on the standardized I²C bus. Additionally, a USB interface has been implemented to manage the data transmission between the embedded camera module and a computer. The whole system recognizes each module and performs accordingly. The user can access sensor values, watch the video stream, and change the parameters of each module via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on his computer. To achieve the build-up of the modular Microsystems we only used packaged active and passive components. Depending on the complexity of each module a core of up to eight layers is build up. The components are then <b>soldered</b> onto both <b>sides</b> of the core. At this point the components are embedded using a laminating press.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of {{freezing point depression}} {{as a method of}} determining osmotic potentials in solutions has been used for some time. Re-cently, this same principle has been applied to the determination of moisture stress in plant leaves. The advent of efficient solid state Pettier cooling units has made possible the construction of portable field freezing-point meters of rela-tively low cost and acceptable accuracy (1). Some problems still exist with these units. The first is that the temperature control circuit for the Peltier battery is relatively complex, requiring some skill {{on the part of the}} person constructing its. Next is the fact that the units are not, strictly speaking, portable since they require a large 12 -volt DC current and so are restricted to use in a relatively small area around a vehicle whose battery can supply this current. Lastly, the price of parts for these units varies from $ 200 to $ 250, which becomes prohibitive if a number of units is desired. The unit described here eliminates these problems by use of a different cooling method. The Peltier cooling battery is replaced by a can of pressurized Freon 33 3 refrigerant.

40|$|Flip-chip hybridization, {{also known}} as bump bonding, is a {{packaging}} technique for microelectronic devices that directly connects an active element or detector to a substrate readout face-to-face, {{eliminating the need for}} wire bonding. In order to make conductive links between the two parts, a solder material is used between the bond pads on each <b>side.</b> <b>Solder</b> bumps, composed of indium metal, are typically deposited by thermal evaporation onto the active regions of the device and substrate. While indium bump technology {{has been a part of}} the electronic interconnect process field for many years and has been extensively employed in the infrared imager industry, obtaining a reliable, high-yield process for high-density patterns of bumps can be quite difficult. Under the right conditions, a moderate hydrogen plasma exposure can raise the temperature of the indium bump to the point where it can flow. This flow can result in a desirable shape where indium will efficiently wet the metal contact pad to provide good electrical contact to the underlying readout or imager circuit. However, it is extremely important to carefully control this process as the intensity of the hydrogen plasma treatment dramatically affects the indium bump morphology. To ensure the fine-tuning of this reflow process, it is necessary to have realtime feedback on the status of the bumps. With an appropriately placed viewport in a plasma chamber, one can image a small field (a square of approximately 5 millimeters on each side) of the bumps (10 - 20 microns in size) during the hydrogen plasma reflow process. By monitoring the shape of the bumps in real time using a video camera mounted to a telescoping 12 magnifying zoom lens and associated optical elements, an engineer can precisely determine when the reflow of the bumps has occurred, and can shut off the plasma before evaporation or de-wetting takes place...|$|R
