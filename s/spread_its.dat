5|$|In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly {{from its}} birthplace in Florence {{to the rest}} of Italy and soon {{to the rest of}} Europe. The {{invention}} of the printing press by German printer Johannes Gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As it <b>spread,</b> <b>its</b> ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.|$|E
5|$|John Fine, on {{the other}} hand, {{suggests}} that the first peace between Athens and Persia was concluded in 450–449BC, due to Pericles' calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was undermining Athens' ability to <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> influence in Greece and the Aegean. Kagan believes that Pericles used Callias, a brother-in-law of Cimon, {{as a symbol of}} unity and employed him several times to negotiate important agreements.|$|E
5|$|Male Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders {{are known}} to exhibit {{elaborate}} courtship displays. As a male approaches a female, it will typically raise and <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> first pair of legs and vibrate its abdomen. If the female is receptive, it will often vibrate its abdomen as well. The specific patterns of courtship behavior, however, vary between individuals.|$|E

5|$|The Morris Academy is {{entitled}} {{to be called a}} pioneer institution because of its 'open door' policy in coeducation. It was not the first in the United States, not even in Connecticut, but none of the other early academies opened their doors as wide and kept them open as long. No other coeducational academy <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> influence so far.|$|E
5|$|Christian church {{organizations}} {{known as}} Christlicher sängerbunds adapted the sängerfest for religious gatherings and helped <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> popularity throughout Europe, North America and Australia. They became popular in late 19th century Russia among Mennonite congregations. On 30 May 1893, a sängerfest of seven choirs {{was held in}} Rückenau in Molotschna, Ukraine. On Sunday, 29 May 1894, the all-day Russische Saengervereinigung was held in Rückenau {{under the direction of}} Polish conductor Friedrich Schweige with assistance from Aron Gerhard Sawatsky, director of the Andreasfeld Mennonite Brethren Church. Beginning on 3 May, Schweiger traveled across Russia rehearsing choirs. On 29 May there were breakfasts for attendees, an estimated 50 vocal presentations by individual choirs, prayer services and sermons, lunch for 2,000 people and afternoon snacks.|$|E
5|$|During the 1959 revolt in Lhasa, Sera monastery {{suffered}} severe damage, {{with its}} colleges destroyed {{and hundreds of}} monks killed. After the Dalai Lama took asylum in India, many of the monks of Sera who survived the attack moved to Bylakuppe in Mysore, India. After initial tribulations, they established a parallel Sera Monastery with Sera Me and Sera Je colleges and a Great Assembly Hall on similar lines to the original monastery, {{with help from the}} Government of India. There are now 3000 or more monks living in Sera, India and this community has also <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> missionary activities to several countries by establishing Dharma centres, propagating knowledge of Buddhism.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} the band were raised in Bayonne, a city on the south west coast of France (Pyrénées-Atlantiques/French Basque Country). The {{surrounding}} scenic countryside and rugged coastline inspired Gojira's interest in nature and the earth. Gojira use their lyrics to <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> spiritual beliefs and concerns for the environment. They also cooperate with Sea Shepherd Conservation Society to protect marine animals, especially dolphins, whales, and sharks. Members from Sea Shepherd Conservation Society are allowed to run a merchandise booth at Gojira gigs. In addition, Gojira {{is working on the}} Sea Shepherd EP with well-known musicians from the metal scene, including Devin Townsend. All proceeds from the project go to the organization, though as of June 2016 the current status of this project is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl was a weak system, {{and unlike}} Alberto, its rapid motion up the Eastern Seaboard <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> heavy {{rainfall}} across a large area. Beryl caused inland flooding {{as it moved}} through Georgia, across the Carolinas, {{and all the way}} to Connecticut. Property damage reached at least $74.22 million, with $40 million in damage in South Carolina, $15 million in Virginia, $12 million in New York, $5.9 million in Florida, and at least $1.32 million in Georgia. Five deaths were reported, while {{a large number of people}} ndash& 37 in Lexington County, South Carolina, alone ndash& were injured by the tornadoes Beryl produced as it weakened.|$|E
5|$|With the {{disintegration}} of the Vijayanagara Empire in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the centres of Kannada literature moved to the courts of the emerging independent kingdoms, the Kingdom of Mysore and the Keladi Nayakas. Writers in these courts, many of whom were Veerashaiva by faith, were not only adept in Kannada but often also in Sanskrit and/or Telugu. Two such writers were Kalale Nanjaraja and Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bangalore. This multi-linguality was perhaps a lingering legacy of the cosmopolitan Vijayanagara literary culture and the emerging social responsibilities of the Veerashaiva monastic order which no longer confined itself to a Kannada only audience, but rather sought to <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> influence across southern India.|$|E

5|$|First {{inhabited}} for a {{short period}} {{in the second half of}} the fourth millennium BC, it was repopulated around 2800 BC and continued to grow. By 2000 BC, it became the capital of a regional kingdom that <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> authority over large swathes of the central and southern Levant. The kingdom enjoyed good relations with Mari, but was engaged in constant warfare against Yamhad. By the 15th century BC, Qatna lost its hegemony and came under the authority of Mitanni. It later changed hands between the former and Egypt, until it was conquered and sacked by the Hittites in the late 14th century BC. Following its destruction, the city was reduced in size before being abandoned by the 13th century BC. It was re-inhabited in the 10th century BC, becoming a center of the kingdoms of Palistin then Hamath until it was destroyed by the Assyrians in 720 BC, which reduced it to a small village that eventually disappeared in the 6th century BC. In the 19th century AD, the site was populated by villagers who were evacuated into the newly built village of al-Mishrifeh in 1982. The site has been excavated since the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Hall saw {{the double}} {{dissolution}} {{as an opportunity}} to capture senate seats in all the states across the nation, and the LM sought to create bases outside South Australia. On 18 November, a LM rally was held at Melbourne Town Hall to launch a branch in Victoria. A branch was formed in Queensland and Hall travelled to Western Australia to oversee the formation of a state branch. Generally, the LM's attempts to <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> message failed owing to the dramatic and highly polarising effects of Whitlam's dismissal and the constitutional crisis, which produced angry demonstrations around the country. Amid the tumult, the media was almost completely focused on the two main parties, giving other groups almost no opportunities to capture the public imagination. The LM also found it difficult to establish a connection with the populace outside South Australia owing to its formation within a state-specific backdrop.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{was founded}} in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became {{involved}} in the environmental movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's biosphere and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.|$|E

5|$|When the WHA ceased {{operations}} in 1979, the NHL absorbed {{four of the}} league's teams, which brought the NHL to 21 teams, a figure that remained constant until the San Jose Sharks were added as an expansion franchise in 1991. Since then, the league has grown from 22 teams in 1992 to 31 today as the NHL <b>spread</b> <b>its</b> footprint across the United States. The league has withstood major labour conflicts in 1994–95 and 2004–05, the latter of which saw the entire 2004–05 NHL season canceled, {{the first time in}} North American history that a league has canceled an entire season in a labour dispute. Wayne Gretzky passed Gordie Howe as the NHL's all-time leading scorer in 1994 when he scored his 802nd career goal. Mario Lemieux overcame non-Hodgkin lymphoma to finish his NHL career with over 1,700 points and two Stanley Cup championships. Increased use of defence-focused systems helped cause scoring to fall in the late 1990s, leading some to argue that the NHL's talent pool had been diluted by 1990s expansion. In 1998, the NHL began awarding teams a single point for losing in overtime, hoping {{to reduce the number of}} tie games; after the 2004–05 lockout, it eliminated the tie altogether, introducing the shootout to ensure that each game has a winner.|$|E

It was only in 2005 that Syria opened its first cultural center in Iran, which has become popular with Iranians seeking to learn Arabic.|$|R
