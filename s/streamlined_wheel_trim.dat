50|$|The New Zealand Avenger {{initially}} {{was similar to}} the British line but there was just one engine and trim level to start: the 'Super' (two headlights, vinyl trim, 1.5 L single carburettor engine, manual 4-speed gearbox.). In 1971 Todd's added a unique-to-NZ, sporty, 1.5-litre twin-carburettor 'TC' model with all-black interior trim, dashtop rev counter, side striping, high-back 'tombstone' front seats, special bright paint colours and new <b>wheel</b> <b>trims,</b> among other detail changes. This was loosely based on the UK GT but lacked that car's 'Rostyle' wheels, using locally-made, look-alike pressed aluminium <b>wheel</b> <b>trims</b> instead.|$|R

Cable ties are also sometimes used to prevent hubcaps (also known as <b>wheel</b> <b>trims)</b> from falling off a moving vehicle, and some are sold specifically for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|The new C1 {{features}} a new front bumper incorporating a new grille, {{in keeping with}} Citroën's family look. Trim levels were also refreshed - basic Vibe models became 'VT', and Rhythm became 'VTR'. Seat fabrics and ventilation controls were also changed, and all models received colour coded front bumpers and new <b>wheel</b> <b>trims.</b>|$|R

An automobile hubcap is used to cover the wheel hub and the wheel fasteners to reduce the accumulation of dirt and moisture. It also has the function of decorating the car.|$|R
5000|$|... 70 series sedan, {{wagon and}} panel van {{variants}} {{were introduced in}} October 1981 with a 1.3-litre engine.

The fans then attacked the police, pelting them with missiles including bottles, cans and <b>wheel</b> <b>trims.</b> Some sources attributed these clashes to a resurgence {{in the conflict}} between the Gremlins and Seaburn Casuals.|$|R
5000|$|Specialty {{wheels of}} {{magnesium}} or aluminum alloy had come onto the market, and wheel covers were a cheap means of imitating their styling. Plastic wheel covers (known in the UK as <b>wheel</b> <b>trims)</b> {{appeared in the}} 1970s and became mainstream in the 1980s. The first domestic automobile to use a full plastic wheel cover was the Chevy Monza that featured a [...] "wind blade" [...] design and came in several colors.|$|R
5000|$|The Furio, VTR and VTS are {{the sports}} models {{which made the}} C2's predecessor, the Saxo, famous as an affordable, sporty looking and very fast 'pocket rocket'. The Furio has the same sports body kit as the more {{expensive}} VTR and VTS models but lacks their alloy wheels. Earlier models of the Furio had 15" [...] Coyote alloys, but these were later replaced with <b>wheel</b> <b>trims</b> {{from the end of}} 2003 onwards.|$|R
2500|$|It first flew on 3 February 1928, {{turning in}} a respectable {{performance}} and garnering Boeing {{a contract for}} 73 more.

The aircraft remained in first-line service to 1932 and were then retained as [...] "hacks" [...] (command and staff transports) for several more years.|$|R
50|$|The XW also {{gained a}} GS ('Grand Sport') option, {{which could be}} optioned with the 188 cuin L, 221 cuin L six-cylinder, or 302 cuin L Windsor V8 engines, but not the 351 cuin L Windsor V8 on Falcon 500, Futura, and Fairmont. It offered the same dash as the GT with sports instruments, sport <b>wheel</b> <b>trims,</b> and stripes. The GS lasted until the 1978 XC series I model, longer than the GT, which {{finished}} with the XB.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, the Argenta was facelifted. The grille was renewed {{with the}} then {{corporate}} 5-bar grille, new front end, new bumpers and an anti-roll-bar was {{mounted on the}} rear axle. The front axle was widened by 60 mm, and new wheels with flat <b>wheel</b> <b>trims</b> & chrome embellishers used. Some minor changes were made inside the car, most notably to the seat/door/rooflining trim and a new steering wheel. The radio antenna moved from inside the windscreen to the roof.|$|R
50|$|Released in July 2002, these series (also {{known as}} TJ II and KJ II) {{comprised}} further and final incremental updates until {{the launch of}} the redesigned TL and KL series. Sports Mode was introduced to the four-speed automatic for the Executive and Advance models—making this function standard on all Magna automatics. Executive and Advance also gained new <b>wheel</b> <b>trims,</b> new grey-only interior trim and body-coloured grille surrounds. The 3.0-litre V6 engine for the Executive was dropped in favour of the 3.5-litre version.|$|R
50|$|Plastic has now largely {{replaced}} steel as {{the primary}} material for manufacturing hubcaps and trims, and where steel wheels are still used, the wheels are now generally painted black so the wheel is less visible through cutouts in the <b>wheel</b> <b>trim.</b> On modern automobiles, full-wheel hubcaps are most commonly seen on budget models and base trim levels, while upscale and performance-oriented models use alloy wheels. Modern aluminum alloy wheels generally use small removable center caps, similar in size to the earliest hubcaps.|$|R
50|$|The Alpine, though well equipped, {{was less}} sporty in style than the Rapier. It had a wooden {{dashboard}} with fewer instruments, {{instead of the}} Rapier's cowled plastic one, and wood instead of metal on the transmission tunnel. There were also different <b>wheel</b> <b>trims,</b> no aluminium sill finishers (nor the polished ones of the H120) and no vinyl trim on its C pillars. Above all at £1086 in the UK it was significantly (for the time) cheaper than the £1200 Rapier.|$|R
5000|$|The last Calibra Turbos were {{produced}} {{in the beginning of}} 1997, before a final run of Calibra Turbo Limited Editions were rolled out. These were all finished in jet black paintwork with Irmscher spoiler, BBS RX 16" [...] alloys and colour-coded body fittings. This final incarnation was also lowered by 35mm on Irmscher springs and dampers. The interior was heated cream leather, with a steering <b>wheel</b> <b>trimmed</b> in grey leather and a plaque showing the build number mounted on the centre console.|$|R
50|$|The V.4 had widely spaced main {{landing gear}} with <b>streamlined</b> <b>wheel</b> spats. It was moved to Istres in December 1933 to try and achieve a French Air Ministry prize for a French {{aircraft}} to beat the world speed record before January 1934. It was due to make an attempt to fly on 27 December 1933 but strong winds kept the aircraft grounded. Further attempts in February 1934 to fly were thwarted by engine problems and lack of government finance. The project was abandoned without the aircraft have flown.|$|R
