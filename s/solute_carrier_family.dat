The phenotype produced by this gene is valued by many horse breeders, but {{can be difficult to}} distinguish from the effect produced by the Cream coat color dilution gene (CR). Three sires and their families segregating for CH were tested by genome scanning with microsatellite markers. The CH gene was mapped within a 6 cM region on horse chromosome 14 (LOD = 11. 74 for h = 0. 00). Four candidate genes were identified within the region, namely SPARC [Secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich (osteonectin) ], SLC 36 A 1 (<b>Solute</b> <b>Carrier</b> 36 <b>family</b> A 1), SLC 36 A 2 (<b>Solute</b> <b>Carrier</b> 36 <b>family</b> A 2), and SLC 36 A 3 (<b>Solute</b> <b>Carrier</b> 36 <b>family</b> A 3). SLC 36 A 3 was not expressed in skin tissue and therefore not considered further. The other three genes were sequenced in homozygotes for CH and homozygotes for the absence of the dilution allele (ch). SLC 36 A 1 had a nucleotide substitution in exon 2 for horses with the champagne phenotype, which resulted in a transition from a threonine amino acid to an arginine amino acid (T 63 R).

40|$|Abstract Background The drug/metabolite {{transporter}} superfamily comprises {{a diversity}} of protein domain families with multiple functions including transport of nucleotide sugars. Drug/metabolite transporter domains are contained in both <b>solute</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>families</b> 30, 35 and 39 proteins {{as well as in}} acyl-malonyl condensing enzyme proteins. In this paper, we present an evolutionary analysis of nucleotide sugar transporters in relation to the entire superfamily of drug/metabolite transporters that considers crucial intra-protein duplication events that have shaped the transporters. We use a method that combines the strengths of hidden Markov models and maximum likelihood to find relationships between drug/metabolite transporter families, and branches within families. Results We present evidence that the triose-phosphate transporters, domain unknown function 914, uracil-diphosphate glucose-N-acetylglucosamine, and nucleotide sugar transporter families have evolved from a domain duplication event before the radiation of Viridiplantae in the EamA family (previously called domain unknown function 6). We identify previously unknown branches in the <b>solute</b> <b>carrier</b> 30, 35 and 39 protein families that emerged simultaneously as key physiological developments after the radiation of Viridiplantae, including the " 35 C/E" branch of EamA, which formed in the lineage of T. adhaerens (Animalia). We identify a second cluster of DMTs, called the domain unknown function 1632 cluster, which has non-cytosolic N- and C-termini, and thus appears to have been formed from a different domain duplication event. We identify a previously uncharacterized motif, G-X(6) -G, which is overrepresented in the fifth transmembrane helix of C-terminal domains. We present evidence that the family called fatty acid elongases are homologous to transporters, not enzymes as had previously been thought. Conclusions The nucleotide sugar transporters families were formed through differentiation of the gene cluster EamA (domain unknown function 6) before Viridiplantae, showing {{for the first time the}} significance of EamA. </p...|$|R
40|$|Transport of {{inorganic}} phosphate (P(i)) is mediated by proteins belonging to two <b>solute</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>families</b> (SLC 20 and SLC 34). Members of both families transport P(i) using the electrochemical gradient for Na(+). The {{role of the}} SLC 34 members as essential players in mammalian P(i) homeostasis is well established, whereas that of SLC 20 proteins is less well defined. The SLC 34 family comprises the following three isoforms that preferentially cotransport divalent P(i) and are expressed in epithelial tissue: the renal NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc are responsible for reabsorbing P(i) in the proximal tubule, whereas NaPi-IIb is more ubiquitously expressed, including the small intestine, where it mediates dietary P(i) absorption. The SLC 20 family comprises two members (PiT- 1, PiT- 2) that preferentially cotransport monovalent P(i) and are expressed in epithelial as well as nonepithelial tissue. The transport kinetics of members of both families have been characterized in detail using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. For the electrogenic NaPi-IIa/b, and PiT- 1,- 2, conventional electrophysiological techniques together with radiotracer methods have been applied, as well as time-resolved fluorometric measurements that allow new insights into local conformational changes of the protein during the cotransport cycle. For the electroneutral NaPi-IIc, conventional tracer uptake and fluorometry {{have been used to}} elucidate its transport properties.

40|$|Polyamine {{transport}} {{activities have}} been described in diverse multicellular systems, but their bioenergetic mechanisms and molecular identity remain unclear. In the present paper, we describe a high-affinity spermine/spermidine transport activity expressed in Drosophila S 2 cells. Ion-replacement experiments indicate that polyamine uptake across the cell membrane is Na+-, K+-, Cl−- and Ca 2 +-independent, but pH-sensitive. Additional experiments using ionophores suggest that polyamine uptake may be H+-coupled. Pharmacological experiments show that polyamine uptake in S 2 cells is selectively blocked by MGBG {methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) or 1, 1 ′-[(methylethanediylidine) -dinitrilo]diguanidine} and paraquat (N,N-dimethyl- 4, 4 ′-bipyridylium), two known inhibitors of polyamine uptake in mammalian cells. In addition, inhibitors known to block the Slc 22 (<b>solute</b> <b>carrier</b> 22) <b>family</b> of organic anion/cation transporters inhibit spermine uptake in S 2 cells.

Its closest reported homologue, zebrafish prestin (zprestin), shares ∼ 70 % strong amino acid sequence similarity with mammalian prestin, predicting an almost identical protein structure. Immunohistochemical analysis now shows that zprestin is expressed in hair cells of the zebrafish ear. Similar to mammalian prestin, heterologously expressed zprestin is found to generate voltage-dependent charge movements, giving rise to a non-linear capacitance (NLC) of the cell membrane. Compared with mammalian prestin, charge movements mediated by zprestin display a weaker voltage dependence and slower kinetics; they occur at more positive membrane voltages, and are not associated with electromotile responses. Given this functional dissociation of NLC and electromotility and the structural similarity with mammalian prestin, we anticipate that zprestin provides a valuable tool for tracing the molecular and evolutionary bases of prestin motor function...|$|R

In parallel, we present the first crystal structure of a prestin STAS domain from a non-mammalian vertebrate prestin (chicken) that behaves as a 'full' transporter. Notably, in chicken STAS, the anion-binding site is lacking because of a local structural rearrangement, indicating that the presence of the STAS anion-binding site is exclusive to mammalian prestin. © 2016 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited...|$|R
