50|$|The roller-locked bolt {{assembly}} {{consists of a}} bolt head, two rollers, a striker <b>sleeve,</b> bolt <b>body,</b> and a large return spring, {{which is responsible for}} pushing the {{bolt assembly}} into battery (the locked position) and returning it there when it is unlocked and pushed backwards by the recoil of firing or by the charging handle. As the striker sleeve is movable back and forth within the bolt assembly, the return spring is also responsible for pushing the striker sleeve forward during locking (described below). The bolt assembly locks with the barrel's breech (the end the cartridge is loaded into) via a prong type barrel extension behind the breech. As it is recoil-operated and fired from an open bolt, the weapon must be manually charged with the side-mounted charging handle.|$|R

50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a roller locked bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of rollers, the striker <b>sleeve,</b> bolt <b>body</b> and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the rollers outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|R
40|$|Textiles are {{ubiquitous}} to us, enveloping {{our skin}} and surroundings. Not {{only do they}} provide a protective shield or act as a comforting cocoon but they also serve esthetic appeal and cultural importance. Recent technologies have allowed the traditional functionality of textiles to be extended. Advances in materials science have added intelligence to textiles and created ‘smart’ clothes. Smart textiles can sense and react to environmental conditions or stimuli, e. g., from mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, or magnetic sources (Lam Po Tang and Stylios 2006). Such textiles find uses in many applications ranging from military and security to personalized healthcare, hygiene, and entertainment. Smart textiles may be termed ‘‘passive’’ or ‘‘active. ’’ A passive smart textile monitors the wearer’s physiology or the environment, e. g., a shirt with in-built thermistors to log body temperature over time. If actuators are integrated, the textile becomes an active, smart textile as it may respond to a particular stimulus, e. g., the temperature-aware shirt may automatically roll up the <b>sleeves</b> when <b>body</b> temperature rises. The fundamental components in any smart textile are sensors and actuators. Interconnections, power supply, {{and a control unit}} are also needed to complete the system. All these components must be integrated into textiles while still retaining the usual tactile, flexible, and comfortable properties that we expect from a textile. Adding new functionalities to textiles while still maintaining {{the look and feel of}} the fabric is where nanotechnology has a huge impact on the textile industry. This article describes current developments in materials for smart nanotextiles and some of the many applications where these innovative textiles are of great benefit...|$|R
40|$|A novel test {{apparatus}} {{used to measure}} the pressure distribution of spool valve with notches has been designed, thus the mechanism of the noise differences related to the different notches can be investigated. Some small holes used to detecting pressure were arranged on a sleeve that can be shifted and rotated in preset locations. Several ways are introduced to minimize the internal leakage, which include the hydraulic force used to close the gaps between the <b>sleeve</b> and valve <b>body,</b> the large distance between the small holes and a high requirement of small clearances between the body, the spool and the sleeve. The effect of this {{test apparatus}} on the flow field inside the valve is limited to the minimum to improve the accuracy of the method proposed. The experimental results of pressure distribution are agreed well with the CFD results as a whole, particularly in diverging flow direction in notch (called ‘FLOW-OUT’). In converging flow (call ‘FLOW-IN’), the correspondence between the experiment and CFD results is not good as the former due to the numerical errors in CFD. The CFD and experimental results of two typical notches, the sloping notch (V-notch) and the notch with a passage of same cross-section areas (U-notch), was presented in this paper. As a result, it is revealed that the U-notch has a two-stage orifice characteristic that can be helpful to suppress the cavitation noise...|$|R
40|$|A ictiofauna acompanhante na pesca de camarão sete-barbas foi estudada mensalmente entre agosto 1996 a julho 2003 nas áreas de atuação da pesca artesanal na Armação do Itapocoroy, Penha. Foram utilizadas duas redes-de-arrasto com portas, malha de 3, 0 cm na manga e corpo e de 2, 0 cm no ensacador, tracionada por baleeira com velocidade média de 2, 0 nós. A temperatura e salinidade média da água de fundo mantiveram um padrão uniforme de flutuação sazonal, sem diferença significativa entre os anos de coleta. Das 60 espécies capturadas, 22 foram comuns ao longo do período de coleta. As famílias Sciaenidae, Carangidae e Clupeidae apresentaram o maior número de espécies contribuindo com 92, 0 % das capturas, onde Stellifer spp., Paralonchurus brasiliensis e Isopisthus parvipinnis foram mais abundantes nas coletas, apresentando ocorrência regular ao longo dos anos. Ocorreram flutuações sazonais na abundância e diversidade da ictiofauna com diferença significativa entre os anos de coleta e biomassa, bem como em número de exemplares. O monitoramento da pesca de arrasto direcionada ao camarão sete-barbas poderá contribuir na manutenção dos estoques e assegurar a subsistência das comunidades tradicionais no litoral catarinense.

5000|$|Men {{continued}} to wear both {{short and long}} tunics with a girdle; however the slit up the front was removed. A new style was introduced in this era in which the <b>sleeves</b> and <b>body</b> were cut from one piece of material. A wide armhole, which extended to the waist, was left open and the sleeves were cut in order to, as C. Cunnington states, “slope off to a narrow tight cuff at the wrist”. [...] The super tunic of the 11th century {{continued to}} be worn by the less fashionable, the lower classes of society, and the girdle was optional. Five new styles of the super tunic were introduced in this era. The first consisted of a front and back panel which extended from the shoulders to the calf level. The two panels were sewn together or clasped together near the waist, where they were met by a slit up the front. The neck opening was large so that the tunic could be put on over the head and a belt was not usually worn with this tunic. The second new style was more “voluminous” as C. Cunnington describes, and hung in folds to a length between the knees and the ankles. The sleeves gathered at the shoulders and extended beyond the hands. A vertical slit was cut in the upper arm of the sleeve to allow unrestrained movement. This garment, like the previous, was put on over the head and a hood was often attached. The third style was much looser than the previous ones. The sleeves could extended to just below the elbow or could be worn short and wide. A buckled belt was optional. The fourth super tunic, or garnache, was knee length and the material was cut wide at the shoulders to allow the material to “fall down on each side, predicting cape-like sleeves,” as C. Cunnington describes. The sides of this tunic could be clasped at the waist, sewn from the waist to the hem, or left open and was traditionally beltless. The last style was simply sleeveless and worn with a belt. [...] For these cloaks and hoods red, Irish cloth was popular. Fitchets, resembling modern day pockets, also appeared in the 13th century. Vertical slits were cut in the super tunic, which {{did not have any}} side openings, to allow access to purse or keys slung from the girdle of the tunic.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} analysis of wall thickness of medical balloons and tubing of all sizes using a revolutionary white light interferometry system. Measurements can be taken at all critical dimensions of medical balloons including the balloon <b>sleeves,</b> main balloon <b>body,</b> the shoulder or cone. For main body and tube thickness, values are given for both top and bottom walls, outside and inside diameter. In operation, infrared light (1310 nm) is directed through a measurement probe via optical fiber to the material to be measured. At each juncture of refractive index, some portion of the transmitted light will be reflected back into the probe and some portion will continue through the material. In {{the case of a}} catheter, some IR energy will be reflected back to the device at the top and bottom surfaces of the tubing walls, generating measurements of not only the thickness of the walls themselves, but also the inside diameter distance between the walls. Accurate measurements can be obtained from almost any flat or formed material that allows passage of 1310 nm infrared light. Glass, plastic, silicone, or molded parts that are clear, translucent, dyed, and possibly opaque are good candidates for this measurement approach. This presentation will illustrate advances in measurement of thinner materials than previously reported and discuss measurement of various medical and industrial components such as silicone implants, medical adhesives, capillary flow cells, and medical liquid (blood, saline, etc.) handling bags that can benefit from this new technology. There will be discussion of Research & Development, Quality Assurance, and online process monitoring and control applications. 2...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} {{consideration of the}} late sixteenth/early seventeenth century gilt and silk knitted jackets, based on close examination of seventeen examples held in various collections in North America and Europe. Little is known about them, so that mostly speculation has been published as fact. They {{have been identified as}} jackets for men, created on knitting frames and on knitting machines, and in the past, were almost always identified as of Italian origin or manufacture. My argument, having closely examined seventeen, is that • they were in fact handknitted: the technology simply did not exist in the early seventeenth century for two-color knitting, nor for reverse stockinette and garter stitch, nor were the frames capable of knitting with the metal - covered yarns. Too, a few of the jackets have sleeves knit in the round, also impossible in frame knitting in the seventeenth century. The range of gauge in this sample is 13 to 20 stitches to the inch. Knitting frames were limited to no more than eight stitches to the inch until well into the seventeenth century, and ribbing attachments were not invented until the 1730 s. • they were made for women. The largest one I 2 ̆ 7 ve examined is from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art [AC 1995. 1. 1], which has a 36 inch chest. The average of twelve jackets is 30 inches. The smallest has a 27 inch chest, from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts [06. 2397], but the garments are not easy to measure in hard and fast terms. Despite the small circumferences, most have long <b>sleeves</b> and <b>bodies,</b> and would not suit children. • More importantly, the cut of most of the jackets follows ladies 2 ̆ 7 fashion of the period much more than that of men. • At least some were made in England. Although they are often referred to as Italian, I would argue this is {{based on the fact that}} many of the floral patterns are Italianate, which were readily available in the popular pattern books all over Europe. There is at least one jacket in a Scandinavian collection with an English export seal. according to Santina Levey. Many of the motifs, including those in Scandinavia, appear on the sixteenth century Burato sampler from Little Morton Hall. • They were independently made by different people, although the knitting of the majority was done in consistently the same fashion: a rectangle for the back, two narrower rectangles for the fronts, and two rectangles for the sleeves, all knitted flat and sewn together. All shaping was done in the construction; by taking larger seam allowances, folding under edges, etc [...] There are very few similarities in actual construction: i. e., one is fully lined, one has lined sleeves, another has only lined cuffs. It 2 ̆ 7 s possible that separate elements of one garment were made by different knitters, and assembled by another. This might account for the flat knitting, as it would allow more people to work on one garment, and possibly speed up production. As mentioned above, a few have sleeves knit in the round. Some fasten with buttons in buttonholes, others have various types of loops. Some have no apparent fasteners, and made have been simply pinned shut. One, in the Museum of Costume at Nottingham [# 22], has paper, printed with medieval black letter type, as the interlining of the button band...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: The {{number of}} obese {{individuals}} is increasing rapidly, {{leading to a}} global obesity epidemic. Only bariatric surgery has demonstrated long-term therapeutic effects, {{and the use of}} these procedures is extensive. Considering the large number of obese patients, the risk of surgical complications and high surgery-related cost, development of new, minimally invasive procedures to treat obesity is urgently needed. The principal objective of this thesis was to better understand the physiological mechanisms of bariatric surgery in order to develop minimally or non-invasive obesity treatments using experimental animal models. To this end, specific objectives were i) to evaluate the vagus nerve and the muscarinic acetylcholine M 3 receptor as possible therapeutic targets, ii) to investigate the potential of ileal interposition alone and combined with sleeve gastrectomy as bariatric and metabolic surgery, and iii) to investigate the underlying mechanisms of gastric bypass and duodenal switch. Materials and Methods: A total of 229 animals (rats and mice) were used. Seven different surgical procedures or genetic manipulation have been tested, i. e., vagus nerve stimulation/blocking (VNSB), gastric botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, gene knockout of the muscarinic acetylcholine M 3 receptor (M 3 KO), ileal interposition, ileal interposition with sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass, and duodenal switch. Physiological variables measured included body weight development, body composition, food intake, eating behavior, metabolic parameters, gastric acid secretion, energy-balance regulating genes in the brain, gut hormones, gastric emptying, fecal energy content, pancreatic and ileal glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), pancreatic insulin, and cytokines. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, open circuit indirect calorimeter, gastric fistula model, taqman array, in situ hybridization, RNA sequencing, radioimmunoassay, acetaminophen absorption assay, adiabatic bomb calorimeter, western blot, immunohistochemistry, and multiplex cytokine assay were used. Results: VNSB reduced body weight by 10 % in normal chow-fed rats, which was associated with reduced food intake, increased expression of anorexigenic neuropeptides in brainstem and hippocampus, and increased expression of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides. Botox injection reduced body weight by 20 - 30 % in normal chow-fed rats, diet induced obese (DIO) rats and DIO rats that had underwent <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy. The <b>body</b> weight loss was associated with reduced food intake, increased energy expenditure, and increased expression of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides. M 3 KO mice had a lean phenotype and displayed increased energy expenditure, increased expression of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides but unchanged total food intake. Ileal interposition and sleeve gastrectomy did not reduce body weight, but increased GLP- 1 expression in the ileum and pancreatic islets, respectively. Gastric bypass increased energy expenditure and reduced body weight by 15 %, while duodenal switch reduced food intake, altered eating behavior, increased energy expenditure, and caused malabsorption, leading to a 54 % body weight loss. Conclusions: The brain-gut axis {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of body weight, which makes it an ideal target for obesity treatments. Blocking the gastric vagus nerve, by VNSB or Botox injection, can be used as non- or minimally invasive obesity treatment, and muscarinic acetylcholine M 3 receptor antagonists might have potential as obesity treatment. Combining ileal interposition and sleeve gastrectomy would be beneficial to maximize GLP- 1 secretion, and holds potential as a metabolic surgery. Duodenal switch induces greater body weight loss than gastric bypass through different mechanisms. PhD i molekylærmedisinPhD in Molecular Medicin...|$|R
