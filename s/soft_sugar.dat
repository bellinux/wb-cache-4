[...] she said, and going up to an Indian, coolly drew from its sheath his scalping-knife, with which she cut Tolly's bonds. The savage evidently {{believed}} that such a creature could not possibly do evil, for he made no motion whatever to check her. Then, without a word more, {{she went to the}} saddle-bags on the obstinate horse, and, opening one of them, took out some <b>soft</b> <b>sugar.</b> The savage who held the horse made no objection. Indeed, from that moment the whole band stood silently by, observing the pretty maiden and the active boy as they moved about, regardless of everything but the work in hand.|$|E
6000|$|Several {{leaves were}} left for 4 hrs. 30 m. in a {{solution}} of one part of white sugar to 146 of water, and no aggregation ensued; on being placed {{in a solution}} of this same strength of carbonate of ammonia, they were acted on in 5 m.; as was likewise a leaf which had been left for 1 hr. 45 m. in a moderately thick solution of gum arabic. Several other leaves were immersed for some hours in denser solutions of sugar, gum, and starch, {{and they had the}} contents of their cells greatly aggregated. This [page 52] effect may be attributed to exosmose; for the leaves in the syrup became quite flaccid, and those in the gum and starch somewhat flaccid, with their tentacles twisted about in the most irregular manner, the longer ones like corkscrews. We shall hereafter see that solutions of these substances, when placed on the discs of leaves, do not incite inflection. Particles of <b>soft</b> <b>sugar</b> were added to the secretion round several glands and were soon dissolved, causing a great increase of the secretion, no doubt by exosmose; and after 24 hrs. the cells showed a certain amount of aggregation, though the tentacles were not inflected. Glycerine causes in a few minutes well-pronounced aggregation, commencing as usual within the glands and then travelling down the tentacles; and this I presume may be attributed to the strong attraction of this substance for water. Immersion for several hours in water causes some degree of aggregation. Twenty leaves were first carefully examined, and re-examined after having been left immersed in distilled water for various periods, with the following results. It is rare to find even a trace of aggregation until 4 or 5 and generally not until several more hours have elapsed. When however a leaf becomes quickly inflected in water, as sometimes happens, especially during very warm weather, aggregation may occur in little over 1 hr. In all cases leaves left in water for more than 24 hrs. have their glands blackened, which shows that their contents are aggregated; and in the specimens which were carefully examined, there was fairly well-marked aggregation in the upper cells of the pedicels. These trials were made with cut off-leaves, and {{it occurred to me that}} this circumstance might influence the result, as the footstalks would not perhaps absorb water quickly enough to supply the glands as they continued to secrete. But this view was proved erroneous, for a plant with uninjured roots, bearing four leaves, was submerged in distilled water for 47 hrs., and the glands were blackened, though the tentacles were very little inflected. In one of these leaves there was only a slight degree of aggregation in the tentacles; in the second rather more, the purple contents of the cells being a little separated from the walls; in the third and fourth, which were pale leaves, the aggregation in the upper parts of the pedicels was well marked. In these leaves the little masses of protoplasm, many of which were oval, slowly changed their forms and positions; so that a submergence for 47 hrs. had not killed the protoplasm. In a previous trial with a submerged plant, the tentacles were not in the least inflected. [page 53] ...|$|E

The pulp is cooked until liquid, then strained to remove the seeds.

Skins are retained to improve the flavor, texture, and color. Once the fruit is <b>soft,</b> <b>sugar</b> may be added, if desired. Prune and apricot butter generally require no added sugar. The fruit butter then is cooked slowly, adding water {{so that it does}} not burn, until both thickened and macerated to the desired extent.

Most varieties were packaged in two stacks of six large cookies, and wrapped in clear cellophane with a freshness code printed on the front label. Many varieties, such as Ruth's Golden Oatmeal, were 'state fair winning' recipes, selected from among entries of company-sponsored baking competitions. Archway's product line quickly expanded to several dozen varieties, including many classic and unique selections; Peanut Jumble, Rocky Road, Mississippi Mud Cake, Fudge Nut Bar, German Chocolate, Black Walnut Ice Box, Date Nut Bar, Iced Spice, New Orleans Cake, Pineapple Filled, Sour Cream, <b>Soft</b> <b>Sugar,</b> and Cookie Jar Hermit.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently the use {{of brown}} sugar has {{increased}} due to its nutritional characteristics, thus requiring a more rigid quality control. The development of a method for water content analysis in <b>soft</b> brown <b>sugar</b> is carried {{out for the first}} time by TG/DTA with application of different statistical tests.

The validation study showed that thermo gravimetry presents good accuracy and precision for water content analysis in <b>soft</b> brown <b>sugar</b> samples. This technique offers advantages over other analytical methods as it does not use toxic and costly reagents or solvents, it does not need any sample preparation, and it allows the identification of the temperature at which water is completely eliminated in relation to other volatile degradation products.
