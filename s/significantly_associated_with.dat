40|$|ABSTRACT: This study assesses whether eleven factors <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> higher impact research: individual, {{institutional}} and international collaboration; journal and reference impacts; abstract readability; reference and keyword totals; paper, abstract and title lengths. Authors {{may have some}} control over these factors and hence this information may help them to conduct and publish higher impact research. These factors have been previously researched but with partially conflicting findings. A simultaneous assessment of these eleven factors for Biology & Biochemistry, Chemistry and Social Sciences used a single negative binomial-logit hurdle model estimating the percentage change in the mean citation counts per unit of increase or decrease in the predictor variables. The journal Impact Factor was found to <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> increased citations in all three areas. The impact {{and the number of}} cited references and their average citation impact also <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> higher article citation impact. Individual and international teamwork give a citation advantage in Biology & Biochemistry and Chemistry but inter-institutional teamwork is not important in any of the three subject areas. length <b>significantly</b> <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> increased citations but the number of keywords, title length and paper length are insignificant or of no practical significance. In summary, at least some aspects of collaboration, journal and document properties <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> higher citations. The results provide new and particularly strong statistical evidence that the authors should consider publishing in high impact journals, ensure that they do not omit relevant references, engage in the widest possible team working, when appropriate, and write extensive abstracts. A new finding is that whilst is seems to be useful to collaborate and to collaborate internationally, {{there seems to be no}} particular need to collaborate with other institutions within the same country...|$|R
40|$|Pre-operative kidney {{volume is}} an {{independent}} predictor of glomerular filtration rate in renal cell carcinoma patients. Compensatory renal growth (CRG) can ensue prior to nephrectomy in parallel to tumor growth and benign parenchyma loss. We aimed to test whether renal metabolite abundances <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> CRG, suggesting a causative relationship. Tissue metabolomics data from 49 patients, with a median age of 60 years, were previously collected and the pre-operative fold-change of their contra to ipsi-lateral benign kidney volume served as a surrogate for their CRG. Contra-lateral kidney volume fold-change within a 3. 3 +/- 2. 1 years follow-up interval {{was used as a}} surrogate for long-term CRG. Using a multivariable statistical model, we identified metabolites whose abundances <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> CRG. Our analysis found 13 metabolites in the benign (e. g. L-urobilin, Variable Influence in Projection, VIP, score = 3. 02, adjusted p = 0. 017) and 163 metabolites in the malignant (e. g. 3 -indoxyl-sulfate, VIP score = 1. 3, adjusted p = 0. 044) tissues that <b>significantly</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> CRG. Benign/tumor fold change in metabolite abundances revealed three additional metabolites <b>with</b> that <b>significantly</b> positively <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> CRG (e. g. p-cresol sulfate, VIP score = 2. 945, adjusted p = 0. 033). At the pathway level, we show that fatty-acid oxidation is highly enriched with metabolites whose benign tissue abundances strongly positively <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> CRG, both pre-operatively and long term, whereas in the tumor tissue significant enrichment of dipeptides and benzoate (positive association), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, lysolipid and nucleotide sugar pentose (negative associations) sub-pathways, were observed. These data suggest that specific biological processes in the benign {{as well as in the}} tumor parenchyma strongly influence compensatory renal growth...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{novel and}} traditional biomarkers {{as well as}} hemodynamic parameters <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in nondiabetic patients with hypertension. Nondiabetic patients with hypertension (n 86) were evaluated for lipids, glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), adiponectin, aldosterone, renin, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and endothelin. Arterial elasticity was evaluated using pulse wave contour. The LVH para-meters were assessed echographically. Adiponectin was <b>significantly</b> and inversely <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> left ventricular mass (LVM; P. 032).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the association between CRP and both carotid and femoral IMT in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The present cross-sectional study is nested in the Sevelamer hydrochloride and ultrasound-measured femoral and carotid intima media thickness progression in end stage renal disease (SUMMER) clinical trial. Carotid (common, internal and bifurcation) and femoral arteries were visualized in B-mode ultrasonography. CRP was measured in serum. The study cohort included 177 HD patients (39. 5 % female, mean age 67. 8 ± 11. 5 years). All measures of both carotid and femoral IMT were <b>significantly,</b> positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> CRP. Compared to subjects without, subjects with PVD, coronary revascularization and hypertension had significantly higher CRP levels. Conversely, subjects treated with sevelamer hydrochloride had significantly lower CRP levels than those not exposed to this medication. CRP was <b>significantly,</b> positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> serum phosphorus, calcium and PTH, and <b>significantly</b> inversely <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> HDL. In conclusion, CRP is <b>significantly,</b> positively <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> both femoral and carotid IMT and suggests an association between inflammation and atherosclerosis in HD patients...|$|R

This also suggested the activation of the innate immune system, notably through the IFN system, B-cell activation through CXCR5-directed recruitment to lymphoid follicles and B-cell receptor (BCR) activation involving BLK, and T-cell activation owing to HLA susceptibility and the IL-12-IFN-γ-axis.|$|E
40|$|We {{explored}} whether teams develop shared perceptions {{regarding the}} quantity and quality of information and the extent of participation in decision making provided in an environment of continuous change. In addition, we examined whether change climate strength moderated relationships between change climate level and team outcomes. We examined relationships among aggregated change information and change participation and aggregated team outcomes, including two role stressors (i. e., role ambiguity and role overload) and two indicators of well-being (i. e., quality of worklife and distress). Questionnaires were distributed in an Australian law enforcement agency and data were used from 178 teams. Structural equation modelling analyses, controlling for a marker variable, were conducted to examine the main effects of aggregated change information and aggregated change participation on aggregated team outcomes. Results provided support for a model that included method effects due to a marker variable.

Similar pathways are involved in drug treatment responses for both humans and dogs, offering more research that the two creatures exhibit symptoms and respond to treatment in similar ways. This data can help scientists to discover more effective and efficient ways to treat OCD in humans through the information they find by studying CCD in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Dysmenorrhea is {{estimated}} to affect approximately 25% of women. Reports of dysmenorrhea are greatest among individuals {{in their late teens}} and 20s, with reports usually declining with age.
