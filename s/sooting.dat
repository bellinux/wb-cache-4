50|$|Many {{alternative}} solutions, {{particularly those}} based upon an AC Switch Disconnect design which use bridge contacts, have been modified and rated for DC operation. These types of product have a switching speed that is {{directly linked to}} the operator speed, therefore slow operation of the handle results in slow contact separation of the contacts which can produce arcing times of 100ms or more. Additionally in these switches, the contact surface is also the surface upon which electrical arcs tend to form; therefore any surface damage or <b>sooting</b> caused by arcing {{is likely to have}} a detrimental effect on the isolators contact resistance and its longevity.TRUE DC Solar Isolators use a rotary knife contact mechanism so when the unit is operated, the handle movement gives a double make/break per contact set. As DC load switching creates electrical arcing, the design is such that this only occurs on the corners of the switching parts meaning that the main contact is made on an area where no arcing has occurred. The rotary contact mechanism methodology used in TRUE DC solar isolators means that when the isolator is operated, a self-cleaning action occurs on the arcing points and contact surfaces thereby producing good high-vibration resistant contact integrity, with reduced contact resistance. This contact system ensures that power loss per pole is kept as low as possible, and consistent {{over the life of the}} product, unlike conventional style isolators where entrapment of contaminants, and then subsequent compression on lateral operation, can lead to variable and increasing contact resistance, and hence per pole losses.|$|E

40|$|The {{idea that}} low soot {{propensity}} of high-energy-density (HED) liquid <b>sooting</b> fuels and cost reduc-tion of a multicomponent energetic fuel {{can be achieved}} by doping a less expensive, less <b>sooting</b> liquid fuel with HED is tested through numerical simulations. The model represents an axisym-metric, polydisperse, dense cluster of binary-fuel (solvent/solute) spherical drops embedded into a vortex. The partial density of the evaporated fuels which is symptomatic of <b>sooting</b> propensity is compared for uncharged and electrostatically charged drops; charging is here usecl m an effective way to increase dispersion and reduce <b>sooting</b> propensity. Results from the simulations show that while the solvent soot propensity indeed decreases with drop charging, contrary to simplistic expec-tations, addition of HED a [...] a solute increases <b>sooting</b> propensity of the solute with increased drop dispersion. This is due to the additional dispersion maintaining the slip velocity at the drop sur-face and preferentially evaporating the solute. These counterintuitive but correct physical effects are independent of the initial solvent/solute mass ratio and decrease with decreasing solute volatil-ity. Based upon these results, blending strategies are suggested for minimizing <b>sooting</b> propensity and decreasing fuel costs. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Hydrocarbon {{combustion}} at fuel – air {{equivalence ratio}} (φ) greater than 1 results in incomplete combustion and formation of black flaky substance, soot. Soot is found responsible for health ailments, {{global warming and}} degradation of combustor performance in aircrafts. The study aims at determining the <b>sooting</b> threshold for various fuel samples and correlation of fuel chemical composition with <b>sooting</b> threshold. Premixed laminar combustion of fuel samples is observed on the Meker burner setup for varying fuel – air equivalence ratio (φ). The air flow rate and pressure are kept constant while the flow rate of liquid fuel through the plane jet atomizer assembly is varied with a flow control in – line rotameter and a constant feed pressure. By varying the fuel flow rate, φ is varied which causes changes in the flame. At rich φ, a bright yellow streak of soot is observed which vanishes when the fuel supply is reduced. This allows in determining the exact value of φ at which the <b>sooting</b> begins, called incipient <b>sooting</b> or <b>sooting</b> threshold. Aromatic compounds show a lower soot threshold due to their ease of forming poly – aromatic hydrocarbons which are the base constituent of soot particulate matter. In succession to aromatic compounds, dicyclic paraffins also lead to lower <b>sooting</b> thresholds. Iso – paraffins, cyclo – paraffins and n – paraffins have a comparatively higher <b>sooting</b> threshold. Experimental results show HRJ – tallow to have the highest <b>sooting</b> threshold with a φ of ~ 1. 61 and Gevo jet blend a close second with φ ~ 1. 53...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sooting</b> {{limits in}} {{counterflow}} diffusion flames of propane/ethylene fuels {{have been studied}} experimentally using a light scattering technique, including the effects of dilution, fuel mixing, and strain rate. The results are discussed {{in view of the}} threshold soot index (TSI). In soot-formation (SF) flames, where the flame is located on the oxidizer side of the stagnation plane, the <b>sooting</b> limit depends critically on fuel type and subsequently on flame temperature. The <b>sooting</b> limit has a non-linear dependence on the fuel-mixing ratio, which is similar to the non-linear mixing rule for TSI observed experimentally in rich premixed flames, where soot oxidation is absent for both SF and rich premixed flames. In soot-formation-oxidation (SFO) flames, where the flame is located on the fuel side, the <b>sooting</b> limit depends critically on flame temperature, while it is relatively independent on fuel type. This result suggests a linear mixing rule for <b>sooting</b> limits in SFO flames, which is similar to the TSI behavior for coflow diffusion flames. Soot oxidation takes place for both types of flames. The aerodynamic strain effect on the <b>sooting</b> limits has also been studied and an appreciable influence has been observed. Under <b>sooting</b> conditions, soot volume fraction was measured using a light extinction technique. The soot loadings in SF flames of the mixture fuels demonstrated a synergistic effect, i. e., soot production increased for certain mixture fuels as compared to the respective singlecomponent fuels. © 2012 The Combustion Institute...|$|E

Continuous records of <b>soot</b> temperature and relative <b>soot</b> concentration within individual engine cycles are evaluated from images of <b>soot</b> radiation at two wavelengths (650 and 750 nm). Combustion is followed simultaneously by imaging OH* chemiluminescence (306 nm). The spatially and temporally resolved data allow {{the two most important}} <b>soot</b> sources to be quantified separately for a typical part-load operating condition. (1) <b>Soot</b> first forms in partially premixed flame propagation through rich zones, but the high <b>soot</b> temperatures (_ 2000 â€“ 2400 K) and rapid mixing with surrounding hot lean regions lead to rapid <b>soot</b> oxidation and burnout. (2) <b>Soot</b> formation in pool fires (diffusion flames fed by thin films of liquid fuel on the piston) begins later and continues until late in the cycle, when further significant <b>soot</b> oxidation is unlikely (<b>soot</b> temperatures have dropped to _ 1500 K, and OH* chemiluminescence is no longer detectable).

40|$|Formation and {{emission}} of <b>soot</b> and {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PCAH) from a turbulent continuous flow combustor have been studied. Measurements included mass concentration of both <b>soot</b> and PCAH, composition of individual PCAH, and size distribution of <b>soot</b> particles, {{as a function of}} mixing intensity, fuel equivalence ratio and type of fuel (kerosene or benzene). Both <b>soot</b> and PCAH concentrations reach maxima early in the flame, after which PCAH decays rapidly and <b>soot</b> decays much slower. The maximum PCAH concentration always preceded that of <b>soot</b> in agreement with the concept that certain PCAH may serve as intermediates in <b>soot</b> formation. An approximate calculation based on the assumptions of local equilibrium with respect to <b>soot</b> formation and a Gaussian distribution of air-fuel mixedness gave satisfactory correlations of the data on <b>soot</b> formation at the higher cold gas velocity.
