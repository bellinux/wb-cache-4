40|$|Abstract- A U-shaped {{defected}} {{ground structure}} (DGS) with shaped microstrip line is proposed for compact low pass filter (LPF) implementation. Inset feed and stub matching techniques are used to enhance the filter charactristics. The proposed filter is composed of double U-shaped DGS units at the ground plane and a shaped microstrip line on the top. This structure allows sharp cutoff frequency response and high harmonics suppression. Furthermore, it provides compact filter size {{without the need for}} cascading periodic DGS structures. The stop band attenuation is controlled by adjusting the depth of the inset feed and the length of the <b>stub</b> <b>sections.</b> It has a 3 dB cutoff frequency at 2. 7 GHz and it is as small as 20 mm × 19 mm.

The proposed routing started appearing around 1971, going south from a <b>stub</b> freeway <b>section</b> of US 21, from the North Carolina state line, to US 21/SC 5, near Rock Hill; by 1975, the entire proposed route on all state and federal maps.|$|R
40|$|A {{contactless}} {{transition from}} a high-permittivity microstrip line (e_r= 9. 9) to an air-filled waveguide (WG) has been impedance-matched over a large simulated relative bandwidth of 38 % (W-band, 75 - 110 GHz). The transition couples the EM fields directly from the MMIC's microstrip line via an SIW and an off-chip <b>stub</b> <b>section</b> to a ridge WG section. The novel structure is low loss and suits pick-and-place assembly techniques of mm-Wave MMICs inside metal WGs. The design process is detailed and manufacturing tolerances of the Alumina prototype PCB are discussed. The measured back-to-back structure retains an appreciable insertion loss smaller than 0. 8 dB for a single transition and a fractional bandwidth of 28 % (72 - 95 ~GHz) over which the return loss is greater than 10 dB...|$|E
50|$|An {{elevated}} stub {{line from}} the station is a remnant of a connection into the former Buena Interchange Yard, where freight was exchanged with the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway. The CTA stopped carrying freight in the early 1970s and the stub was demolished south of Montrose Avenue. The Lakewood Avenue branch of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway is now operated by the Soo Line Railroad, but no longer exists north of Diversey Avenue. In 2010, further demolition split the remaining <b>stub</b> into two <b>sections</b> to allow for new Truman College construction.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe axial {{compressive}} strength capacity of concrete-filled {{light gauge steel}} composite columns was assessed through an experimental program involving twelve long and fourteen stub columns with width-to-thickness ratio of 125 for the encasing steel section. A comparison between concrete-only and confined stub columns demonstrated that the stub column experiences an increase of strength of up to 16 % due to confinement. The {{compressive strength}} contribution of the light gauge steel section was limited by local buckling. Specifically, the steel-only <b>stub</b> column <b>sections</b> lacking the concrete core experienced, on average, approximately 33 % of its full compressive strength. The full-scale composite columns illustrated that the axial compressive strength capacity was controlled by end bearing capacity and local buckling of the light gauge steel. The axial compression strength capacity of the full-scale composite columns was satisfactorily predicted based on end bearing resistance of the concrete core and local strains in the light gauge steel. Furthermore, the 33 % strength contribution established from the steel-only sections provided a satisfactory lower bound estimate for the calculation of axial compressive strength...|$|R
40|$|The test 2 {{specimen}} {{consisted of}} a composite connection configuration utilizing shear stud connectors placed on the outside the pile section which was inserted into a larger <b>stub</b> pile <b>section</b> that contained a matching pattern of shear studs as shown in Figure 4. The annular space formed between the two components was filled with flowable grout allowing for composite action to develop the moment connection by transferring forces from the pile to the cap beam via the stub pile, while avoiding inelasticity in critical welded regions. The results of experimental testing showed the connection capable of successfully developing a flexural hinging mode of failure {{in the form of}} pile wall local buckling at the intended region. All regions which were considered to be in critical need of remaining elastic were shown through data analysis to remain within the intended elastic range as the full flexural hinging capacity of the piles developed. Ultimately, the limit state of pile wall local buckling was shown to control at a reliable displacement ductility level of 3 associated with 8. 44 ” of displacement or 8. 1 % drift. Although associated with large levels of damage and loss of strength, the specimen was able to remain in-tact at a displacement ductility of 6 associated with 16. 88 ” of displacement. ...|$|R
40|$|A planar {{broadband}} {{phase shifter}} with {{wide range of}} differential phase is proposed. To achieve this performance, the design uses quarter wavelength parallel coupled lines combined with two L-shape networks. The L-shaped network includes a short-ended <b>stub</b> and a <b>section</b> of transmission line as an impedance transformer. The value of the differential phase can be adjusted through varying the coupling coefficient of the coupled lines along with the length and impedance of the short-ended stubs and transformer. The theory of operation for the proposed design is explained. To validate the theory, a phase shifter is designed and manufactured to realize 180 ° differential phase. The simulated and measured results agree well with the theory and show less than b° phase deviation and 1. 3 dB insertion loss across the band 1 - 3 GHz...|$|R
40|$|Similar to past specimens, {{the test}} 6 steel pier {{connections}} were composite configurations utilizing shear stud connectors {{placed on the}} outside of the pile sections which were inserted into larger diameter <b>stub</b> pile <b>sections</b> that contained a matching pattern of shear studs, as shown in Figure 3. The annular space formed between the two components was filled with flowable grout allowing for composite action to develop the moment connection by transferring forces from the pile to the cap beam via the stub pile, while avoiding inelasticity in critical welded regions. Unlike previous tests, test 6 was subjected to applied vertical dead load in addition to lateral loading to evaluate the effects of superstructure weight on system response. It was shown that the connection was capable of developing a flexural hinging mode of failure in the form of pile wall local buckling at the intended region, as was the case for previous tests without additional applied vertical dead load. However, when compared to prior experimental tests the presence of applied dead load was shown to induce pile wall local buckling earlier in the response and to increase the rate of post buckling strength degradation of the pier, particularly at the ductility 3 level. Consequently, the test 6 specimen was shown to be limited to an ultimate displacement ductility capacity of 2 or 3 depending on the exact level of allowable strength loss. These limit states correspond to 5. 63 ” and 8. 44 ” of lateral displacement, respectively, or 4. 2 % and 6. 3 % drift and are a reduction of one ductility level when compared to the ultimate limit state of prior tests with no applied vertical dead load. ...|$|R
40|$|Thin-walled steel {{sections}} {{made from}} high strength thin cold-reduced G 550 steel to Australian Standard AS 1397 - 1993 under compression are investigated experimentally and theoretically in this thesis. This thesis describes three series of compression tests performed on box-section stub columns, box-section long columns and lipped channel section columns cold-formed from {{high strength steel}} plates in 0. 42 mm or 0. 60 mm thickness with nominal yield stress of 550 MPa. The tests presented in this thesis formed part of an Australian Research Council research project entitled: Compression Stability of High Strength Steel Sections with Low Strain-Hardening. For the fix-ended stub column tests, a total of 94 lipped-square and hexagonal <b>section</b> <b>stub</b> columns were tested to study the influence of low strain hardening of G 550 steel on the compressive section capacities of the column members. For the pin-ended long column tests, a total of 28 box-section columns were tested to study the stability of members with sections which undergo local instability at loads significantly less than the ultimate loads. For the fix-ended lipped channel section columns, a total of 21 stub and long columns were tested to study the failure resulting from local and distortional buckling with interaction between the modes. A numerical simulation on the three series of tests using the commercial finite element computer program ABAQUS is also presented {{as part of this}} thesis. The post-buckling behaviour of thin-walled compression members is investigated. The effect of changing variables, such as geometric imperfections and end boundary conditions is also investigated. The ABAQUS analysis gives accurate simulations of the tests and is in good agreement to the experimental results. Theoretical studies using finite strip methods are presented in this thesis to investigate the buckling behaviour of cold-formed members in compression. The theoretical studies provide valuable information on the local and distortional buckling stresses for use in the interaction buckling studies. The finite strip models used are the semi-analytical and spline models. As expected for the stub columns tests, the greatest effect of low strain hardening was for the stockier sections where material properties play an important role. For the more slender sections where elastic local buckling and post-local buckling are more important, the effect of low strain hardening {{does not appear to be}} as significant. The pin-ended and fix-ended long column tests show that interaction, which is between local and overall buckling in the box sections, and between local and distortional buckling in the open channel sections, has a significant effect on their member capacities. The results of the successful column tests and ABAQUS simulation have been compared with the design procedures in the Australian & New Zealand Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structures AS&NZS 4600 and the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members prepared by the American Iron and Steel Institute. The stub column tests show that the current design rules give too conservative predictions on the compressive section capacities of the column members; whereas the long column tests show that the current column design rules are unconservative if used in their current form for G 550 steel. Three design proposals are presented in this thesis to account for the effects of high strength thin steels on the section and member capacities...|$|R
