5|$|Many {{species of}} slug caterpillar, Limacodidae, have {{numerous}} protuberances and <b>stinging</b> spines along their dorsal surfaces. Species that possess these <b>stinging</b> spines suffer less predation than larvae that lack them, and a predator, the paper wasp, chooses larvae without spines when given a choice.|$|E
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a <b>stinging</b> wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where <b>stinging</b> bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E

5|$|Freshly cut onions often cause a <b>stinging</b> {{sensation}} {{in the eyes}} of people nearby, and often uncontrollable tears. This is caused by the release of a volatile gas, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which stimulates nerves in the eye creating a <b>stinging</b> sensation. This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism: chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases. These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the lacrimatory factor synthase, producing the syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant.|$|E
5|$|Queen {{and worker}} {{bumblebees}} can <b>sting.</b> Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's <b>sting</b> lacks barbs, so the bee can <b>sting</b> repeatedly without injuring itself; {{by the same}} token, the <b>sting</b> is not left in the wound. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may <b>sting</b> in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and <b>sting</b> the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.|$|R
40|$|<b>STING</b> is an {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) -associated transmembrane protein that turns on and quickly turns off downstream signaling as it translocates from the ER to vesicles. How <b>STING</b> signaling is attenuated during trafficking remains poorly understood. Here, {{we show that}} trafficking-mediated <b>STING</b> degradation requires ER exit and function of vacuolar ATPase complex. Late-stage <b>STING</b> vesicles are sorted to Rab 7 -positive endolysosomes for degradation. Based on analysis of existing structures, we also identified the helix amino acid 281 (aa 281) – 297 as a motif required for trafficking-mediated <b>STING</b> degradation. Immuno-electron microscopy (EM) reveals the size and clustering of <b>STING</b> vesicles and topology of <b>STING</b> on the vesicle.  Importantly, blockade of trafficking-mediated <b>STING</b> degradation using bafilomycin A 1 specifically enhanced cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) -AMP (cGAMP) -mediated immune response and anti-tumor effect in mice. Together, our findings provide biochemical and imaging evidence for <b>STING</b> degradation by the lysosome and pinpoint trafficking-mediated <b>STING</b> degradation as a previously unanticipated therapeutic target for enhancing <b>STING</b> signaling in cancer therapy...|$|R
5000|$|Among arthropods, a <b>sting</b> or <b>stinger</b> is a sharp organ, often {{connected}} with a venom gland and adapted to inflict a wound by piercing, as with the caudal <b>sting</b> of a scorpion. <b>Stings</b> are usually located {{at the rear of}} the animal. Animals with <b>stings</b> include bees, wasps (including hornets) and scorpions.|$|R

5|$|A {{large number}} of species of {{families}} Saturniidae, Limacodidae and Megalopygidae have <b>stinging</b> caterpillars which have poisonous setae, also called urticating hairs, {{and in the case}} of Lonomia – a Brazilian saturniid genus – can kill a human due to its potent anticoagulant poison. Caterpillars of many taxa that have sequestered toxic chemicals from host plants or have sharp urticating hair or spines, display aposematic colouration and markings.|$|E

50|$|Queen {{and worker}} {{bumblebees}} can <b>sting.</b> Unlike honey bee stingers, a bumblebee's <b>stinger</b> lacks harpoon-like barbs {{on the end}} of the <b>stinger,</b> so B. ternarius can <b>sting</b> repeatedly without risk of disemboweling itself and dying. B. ternarius is not normally aggressive, but will <b>sting</b> in defense of its nest or when threatened or provoked.|$|R

5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. Wearing closed footwear such as boots and shoes {{can reduce the}} risk of getting stung; these ants are capable of <b>stinging</b> through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings occur when someone is gardening and is unaware of the ants' presence. Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E
5|$|Müllerian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Fritz Müller. When a distasteful animal comes {{to resemble a}} more common distasteful animal, natural selection favours individuals that even very slightly better resemble the target. For example, many species of <b>stinging</b> wasp and bee are similarly coloured black and yellow. Müller's explanation of the mechanism for {{this was one of}} the first uses of mathematics in biology. He argued that a predator, such as a young bird, must attack at least one insect, say a wasp, to learn that the black and yellow colours mean a <b>stinging</b> insect. If bees were differently coloured, the young bird would have to attack one of them also. But when bees and wasps resemble each other, the young bird need only attack one from the whole group to learn to avoid all of them. So, fewer bees are attacked if they mimic wasps; the same applies to wasps that mimic bees. The result is mutual resemblance for mutual protection.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being {{in close proximity to}} the <b>stinging</b> cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E

40|$|Stimulator of {{interferon}} genes (<b>STING,</b> {{also known}} as MITA and ERIS) is critical in protect-ing the host against DNA pathogen invasion. However, the molecular mechanism underly-ing the regulation of <b>STING</b> remains unclear. Here, we show that PPM 1 A negatively regulates antiviral signaling by targeting <b>STING</b> in its phosphatase activity-dependent man-ner, and in a line with this, PPM 1 A catalytically dephosphorylates <b>STING</b> and TBK 1 in vitro. Importantly, we provide evidence that whereas TBK 1 promotes <b>STING</b> aggregation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, PPM 1 A antagonizes <b>STING</b> aggregation by dephos-phorylating both <b>STING</b> and TBK 1, emphasizing that phosphorylation is crucial for the effi-cient activation of <b>STING.</b> Our findings demonstrate a novel regulatory circuit in which <b>STING</b> and TBK 1 reciprocally regulate each other to enable efficient antiviral signaling acti-vation, and PPM 1 A dephosphorylates <b>STING</b> and TBK 1, thereby balancing this antiviral signal transduction.

50|$|Although {{for most}} people a bee <b>sting</b> is painful but {{otherwise}} relatively harmless, in people with insect <b>sting</b> allergy, <b>stings</b> may trigger a dangerous anaphylactic reaction that is potentially deadly.

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, accompanied by three light cruisers and several colliers, sailed across the Pacific Ocean—in the process evading the various Allied naval forces sent to intercept them—before arriving off the southern coast of South America. On 1 November 1914, Scharnhorst {{and the rest of}} the East Asia Squadron encountered and overpowered a British squadron at the Battle of Coronel. The <b>stinging</b> defeat prompted the British Admiralty to dispatch two battlecruisers to hunt down and destroy von Spee's flotilla, which they accomplished at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{attack and}} defend {{themselves}} by biting and, in many species, by <b>stinging,</b> often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid {{in the case}} of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, {{scientists}} and doctors studied the smog's impact. It {{became clear that the}} smog had been a major environmental disaster with severe public health effects. One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered adverse health effects, such as <b>stinging</b> eyes, coughing, and respiratory distress. City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog. Another study found that the smog had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E

Vadimezan was shown to target the <b>STING</b> pathway, however, this effect is mouse specific; it has no effect on human <b>STING.</b> A single amino acid difference at position 162 (S162A) of the cyclic-dinucleotide-binding site of <b>STING</b> makes mouse <b>STING</b> sensitive to the drug, whereas human <b>STING</b> remains insensitive.|$|R
500|$|Myrmecia {{workers and}} queens possess a <b>sting,</b> {{which can be}} fatal to {{sensitive}} human beings. The <b>sting</b> {{has been described as}} [...] "sharp in pain with no burning", and the pain may last for several minutes. In the Starr <b>sting</b> pain scale, a scale which compares the overall pain of hymenopteran <b>stings</b> on a four-point scale, Myrmecia <b>stings</b> were ranked from 2–3 in pain, described as [...] "painful" [...] or [...] "sharply and seriously painful". Unlike in honeybees, the <b>sting</b> lacks barbs, and so the <b>stinger</b> is not left in the area the ant has stung, allowing the ants to <b>sting</b> repeatedly without any harm to themselves.

5|$|Polyps feed on {{a variety}} of small organisms, from {{microscopic}} zooplankton to small fish. The polyp's tentacles immobilize or kill prey using their nematocysts. These cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism. A dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby prey touching the trigger (cnidocil). A flap (operculum) opens and its <b>stinging</b> apparatus fires the barb into the prey. The venom is injected through the hollow filament to immobilise the prey; the tentacles then manoeuvre the prey to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Predatory wasp species {{normally}} subdue {{their prey}} by <b>stinging</b> it, and then either {{lay their eggs}} on it, leaving it in place, or carry it back to their nest where an egg may be laid on the prey item and the nest sealed, or several smaller prey items may be deposited to feed a single developing larva. Apart from providing food for their offspring, no further maternal care is given. Members of the family Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites and lay their eggs in the nests of unrelated host species.|$|E
