25|$|Prior to Guitar Hero and Rock Band, Harmonix {{had already}} {{established}} {{itself as a}} company that made game products that focused on music interactivity. Born out of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab, the first product made by Harmonix was The Axe: Titans of Classic Rock for DOS-based computers, challenging the player to use four keys on the keyboard to match notes in several songs. Looking {{to find a place}} for this type of game, Harmonix' founders Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy looked to Japan where music games like PaRappa the Rapper were becoming popular. This {{led to the creation of}} Frequency and its sequel Amplitude for the PlayStation 2; both games featured the concept of matching notes for <b>specific</b> <b>instrument</b> tracks along lanes. However, in retrospect, Harmonix found that players had initially difficulty understanding the game, as the presentation was an abstract concept that did not immediately connect the gameplay to the music. The idea of making an easy connection between the game and the music was used as a basis for their Karaoke Revolution games, which including using avatars singing and dancing in time to the music to strengthen the connection; this series was financially successful and helped grow the company.|$|E
500|$|Forensic chemists {{rely on a}} {{multitude}} of instruments to identify unknown substances found at a scene. [...] Different methods {{can be used to}} determine the identity of the same substance, and {{it is up to the}} examiner to determine which method will produce the best results. [...] Factors that forensic chemists might consider when performing an examination are the length of time a <b>specific</b> <b>instrument</b> will take to examine a substance and the destructive nature of that instrument. They prefer using nondestructive methods first, to preserve the evidence for further examination. [...] Nondestructive techniques can also be used to narrow down the possibilities, making it more likely that the correct method will be used the first time when a destructive method is used.|$|E

500|$|Bright {{describes}} {{the development of}} the note track for a given song once it has been licensed for the game as a parallel effort, a process that they have found to be more efficient than their previous work on the Tony Hawk games. Once the song was mixed for use by the development team, a [...] "tempo map" [...] was created by one developer; this map denotes the beats in the music which then can be used {{by the rest of the}} development team. Once the tempo map was complete, the song was then distributed to the various teams, such as the <b>specific</b> <b>instrument</b> teams or to the animators, to complete the song. Note-for-note tracking from the song was then performed, and in some cases, changes were made to account for sections that cannot be replicated on the game controllers; the final track represented the note track for the Expert difficulty of the song. [...] Note tracks were then reduced and adjusted to create the note tracks for the lower difficulties in the game. A difficulty assessment was made using the final note tracks to determine where the songs were to be placed in the soundtrack progression. [...] The difficulty model is based on that from , which was adjusted from the Guitar Hero III model after the team received negative feedback from players regarding a [...] "brick wall" [...] in the difficulty progression in that game.|$|E

Many older sousaphones were pitched in the key of E, but current production of sousaphones in that key is limited.|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, a {{recording}} of [...] "Flowing Water" [...] (Liu Shui, as performed by Guan Pinghu, {{one of the best}} qin players of the 20th century) was chosen {{to be included in the}} Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated LP recording containing music from around the world, which was sent into outer space by NASA on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft. [...] It is the longest excerpt included on the disc. [...] The reason to select a work played on this <b>specific</b> <b>instrument</b> is because the tonal structure of the instrument, its musical scale, is derived from fundamental physical laws related to vibration and overtones, representing the intellectual capacity of human beings on this subject.

2500|$|These pieces {{contain some}} unusual features. [...] J'ayme bien celui, a rondeau, {{includes}} the unusual direction [...] "contra tenor trompette" [...] {{for the lowest}} voice, indicating that {{it was to be}} performed on a slide trumpet, an instrument related to the trombone (by the late 15th century, this instrument had been named the sackbut). [...] Not only is this a rare case of a <b>specific</b> <b>instrument</b> being required in an early 15th-century composition, but the piece contains notes outside of the gamut, the range of pitches to which most music of the time was restricted: [...] the part for [...] "contra tenor trompette" [...] goes down to D below the bass staff. [...] It has been suggested that Fontaine may not have written this part, since it appears only in one of the sources in which the rondeau survives, the Escorial V.III.24 manuscript.|$|E
2500|$|The Nintendo DS {{version of}} Lego Rock Band {{is similar to}} the PlayStation Portable game Rock Band Unplugged and the Nintendo DS version of Rock Band 3. During each song, the player {{switches}} between the various instruments, trying to keep all four members of the band [...] "happy"; this is done by successfully completing a series of notes for the <b>specific</b> <b>instrument,</b> and then correctly hitting a final, purple note to increase that band member's happiness. Band members' happiness will fall over time, requiring the player to continually switch between band members to maintain the band's overall mood and score multiplier. The game uses the touchpad, stylus, and face buttons of the DS, and does not require or support additional peripherals like the console versions do. Up to four people can play at a time, each using a separate DS and playing their own instrument.|$|E

2500|$|A {{noise gate}} sets a {{threshold}} where {{if it is}} quieter it will not let the signal pass {{and if it is}} louder it opens the gate. [...] A noise gate's function is in a sense the opposite to that of a compressor. [...] Noise gates are useful for microphones which will pick up noise which is not relevant to the program, such as the hum of a miked electric guitar amplifier or the rustling of papers on a minister's lectern. Noise gates are also used to process the microphones placed near the drums of a drum kit in many hard rock and metal bands. [...] Without a noise gate, the microphone for a <b>specific</b> <b>instrument</b> such as the floor tom will also pick up signal from nearby drums or cymbals. [...] With a noise gate, the threshold of sensitivity for each microphone on the drum kit can be set so that only the direct strike and subsequent decay of the drum will be heard, not the nearby sounds.|$|E
