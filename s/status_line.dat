50|$|The sidebar is a {{graphical}} {{control element}} that displays {{various forms of}} information to the right or left side of an application or desktop user interface. <b>Status</b> <b>lines</b> are similar elements displaying data on top or bottom edges.|$|R
50|$|This method {{does not}} connect the {{bidirectional}} data {{lines of the}} two devices, {{in order to avoid}} both lines being active at the same time. The <b>status</b> <b>lines</b> ERROR, SLCT, PAPOUT, ACK and BUSY on one device are connected to data pins d0 through d4 respectively on the other.|$|R
50|$|Arie Luyendyk's {{qualifying}} run of 223.881 mph {{made him}} the third fastest car in the field, but his second-day <b>status</b> <b>lined</b> him up 14th. Emerson Fittipaldi finally made the field, qualifying 15th at 223.065 mph. The three cars of the 5th row (Bettenhausen, Luyendyk, Fittipaldi) ended up qualifying faster than the three cars of the front row.|$|R

50|$|Compatibility Mode, {{also known}} as Centronics {{standard}} or SPP, is a uni-directional implementation {{with only a few}} differences from the original Centronics design. This mode is almost exclusively used for printers. The only signals that the printer can send back to the host are some fixed-meaning <b>status</b> <b>lines</b> that signal common error conditions, such as the printer running out of paper.|$|R
50|$|Nibble Mode is an {{interface}} {{that allows}} the device to transmit data four bits (a nibble) at a time, (re)using four of the <b>status</b> <b>lines</b> of Compatibility Mode for data. This is the Bi-tronics mode introduced by HP and is generally used for enhanced printer status. Although never officially supported with these, Nibble Mode works {{with most of the}} pre-IEEE-1284 Centronics interfaces as well.|$|R
50|$|Both PAL and NTSC have {{provision}} for some data pulses {{contained within the}} video signal used to signal the aspect ratio (See ITU-R BT.1119-1 - Widescreen signaling for broadcasting). These pulses are detected by television sets that have widescreen displays and cause the television to automatically switch to 16:9 display mode. When 4:3 material is included (such as the aforementioned commercial), the television switches to a 4:3 display mode to correctly display the material. Where a video signal is transmitted via a European SCART connection, one of the <b>status</b> <b>lines</b> is used to signal 16:9 material as well.|$|R
50|$|Some tiling window {{managers}} provide title bars {{which are}} purely for informative purposes and offer no controls or menus. These window managers {{do not allow}} windows to be moved around the screen by using a drag action on the titlebar and may also serve {{the purpose of a}} <b>status</b> <b>line</b> from stacking window managers.|$|E
50|$|The mouse has two buttons like Windows, {{but unlike}} Windows {{pressing}} {{and holding the}} right button replaces the system <b>status</b> <b>line</b> {{at the top of}} the screen with a Maclike menu bar. As with Apple's Mac OS prior to Mac OS 8, menu options are selected by releasing the button over that option, not by left clicking.|$|E

[...] "AA34 with you at one one thousand," [...] the <b>status</b> <b>line</b> will display this in text, voice of the calling pilot will play, and the icon will persistently flash. If ignored, the aircraft will circle and hold at the radio fix identified as the beginning-point in the player's sector.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{designed}} to find out how public school workers nearing retirement perceived retirement counselling and their attitude to its programme. It was assumed that their perception that would be reflected in their attitude would not differ across age, sex, qualification, occupational level and professional status. The result, which however, showed a significant relationship between perception and attitude, revealed that public school workers in Nigeria showed less optimistic perception of retirement counselling and less favourable attitude towards its programme. Also, significant differences were shown to exist along qualifications and <b>status</b> <b>lines</b> in terms of their perception of pre-retirement counselling. The implications for retirement counselling were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fall-through FIFOs provide {{high data}} {{throughput}} {{with a small}} overhead for control but also yield a latency dependent {{on the size of}} the FIFO. Nonfallthrough FIFOs remove this latency dependency by adding more complex control to allow data to bypass stages. An organization achieving low latency folds the FIFO in half and uses arbitration to choose between passing data along the top half or bypassing directly to the bottom half. Current implementations of the folded FIFO require non-local communication via daisy chained full/empty <b>status</b> <b>lines,</b> and hence are not quasi-delay-insensitive. In this paper, we describe an asynchronous non-fallthrough folded FIFO which is quasi-delay-insensitive but still exhibits reasonable throughput and latency. ...|$|R
5000|$|The SPI 4.2 {{interface}} {{is composed}} of high speed clock, control, and data lines and lower speed FIFO buffer <b>status</b> <b>lines.</b> The high speed data line include a 16-bit data bus, a 1 bit control line and a double data rate (DDR) clock. The clock can run up to 500 MHz, supporting up to 1 GigaTransfer per second. The FIFO buffer status portion consists of a 2 bit status channel and a clock. SPI 4.2 supports a data width of 16 bits and can be PHY-link, link-link, link-PHY or PHY-PHY connection. The SPI 4.2 interface supports up to 256 port addresses with independent flow control for each.|$|R
5000|$|The C {{language}} defines {{white space}} characters to be [...] "space, horizontal tab, new-line, vertical tab, and form-feed". The HTTP network protocol requires {{different types of}} white space {{to be used in}} different parts of the protocol, such as: only the space character in the <b>status</b> <b>line,</b> CRLF at the end of a line, and [...] "linear white space" [...] in header values.|$|E
5000|$|... growisofs has a {{built-in}} dd, which is the low-level process for sending data to the writer. This uses two buffers, the Ring Buffer (the growisofs program's software buffer) and the Unit Buffer (the drive's internal hardware buffer), and to prevent buffer underrun, these buffers must be kept filled. This is monitored and displayed in the <b>status</b> <b>line</b> as the RBU ("Ring Buffer Utilisation") and UBU ("Unit Buffer Utilisation").|$|E
50|$|A {{status bar}} {{can also be}} text-based, {{primarily}} in console-based applications, in which case {{it is usually the}} last row in an 80x25 text mode configuration, leaving the top 24 rows for application data. Usually the status bar (called a <b>status</b> <b>line</b> in this context) displays {{the current state of the}} application, as well as helpful keyboard shortcuts. One example is the 'vi' text editor of UNIX (from the 1970s) or newer Linux systems.|$|E
50|$|This {{agreement}} {{established a}} <b>status</b> quo border <b>line</b> {{based on the}} effective possession of territory that each country had in the Amazon region at the time. This border was {{very similar to that}} established by the Rio de Janeiro Protocol 5 years later. To Ecuador, the <b>status</b> quo <b>line</b> simply demonstrated how much territory Peru had taken from Ecuador in the preceding century. Ecuador never considered this agreement a final treaty of borders, and continued its aspirations which were based on Gual-Larrea and Pedemonte-Mosquera.|$|R

50|$|The Election Act of 2008 {{provides}} {{for the formation of}} political parties, provided they register and operate within, and swear to uphold, the Constitution and sovereignty of Bhutan. Registration requires an application process similar to incorporation, disclosing the essentials of the party leadership, membership, charter, and requirements including symbols and particular name and logo. Parties are required to promote democracy, and are forbidden to organize along <b>status</b> <b>lines,</b> including region, gender, language, or religion. The Election Commission denies applications of parties based on status, business concerns; of those with military or paramilitary structures; and of others within its discretion. Those that are accepted are registered and overseen by the Secretariat of the Election Commission.|$|R
50|$|The {{left-hand}} {{side of the}} status bar shows running processes. The leftmost one will be visible on the screen; the others (if any) are running in the background. The right-hand side shows the keyboard layout in use (UK8 in the above example), the printer port assignment, the keyboard caps lock and num lock status, and the current time. If a DOS program is running, the <b>status</b> <b>line</b> is not shown. DOS programs cannot be run in the background.|$|E
5000|$|In HTTP/1.0 and since, {{the first}} line of the HTTP {{response}} is called the <b>status</b> <b>line</b> and includes a numeric status code (such as [...] "404") and a textual reason phrase (such as [...] "Not Found"). The way the user agent handles the response primarily depends on the code and secondarily on the other response header fields. Custom status codes can be used since, if the user agent encounters a code it does not recognize, it can use the first digit of the code to determine the general class of the response.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Zork Implementers {{who formed}} Infocom included Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, and Dave Lebling. As the company grew, the title Implementor became {{a badge of}} status. Infocom frequently promoted from within, and in particular a number of game testers, including Steve Meretzky, rose {{to the rank of}} Imp. Meretzky was publicly referred to as an Implementor, both in the [...] "About the Author" [...] section of the Planetfall manual and in a few issues of Infocom's customer newsletter, The New Zork Times (later renamed The <b>Status</b> <b>Line).</b>|$|E
