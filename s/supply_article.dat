40|$|This paper {{describes}} a method {{which was used}} to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three different ways of <b>supplying</b> periodical <b>articles</b> in an academic library.

The operational costs of the alternatives are obtained by taking a management accounting approach and are examined in relation to the provision of the services within the library of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, Ireland. The cost-per-use of owning a periodical title is calculated based on the operational costs of the Periodicals Department of the library, its subscription price and a lifetime use determined by examination of the current requests for articles made through the library's Inter-Library Loans Department. The cost-per-use for the other services are also calculated based on their operational costs and document delivery charges...|$|R
