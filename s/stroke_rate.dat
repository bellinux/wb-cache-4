25|$|The next rower ('seven' in an eight) sits {{directly}} behind stroke and is typically both fit and skilled: this rower {{acts as a}} buffer between the stroke {{and the rest of}} the crew. They closely follow the rhythm set by the stroke and help transmit this rhythm to the rest of the boat, and particularly to the rowers rowing on the same side as seven, since rowers tend to look at the blades on their side of the boat to check their timing. If the strokeman increases or decreases the <b>stroke</b> <b>rate</b> it is essential that seven follows this change so that it is translated to the rest of the crew. Number seven usually watches the back of stroke so that they can time when to move up the slide and copy their rhythm. The job of seven is to emulate the rhythm of the strokeman.|$|E

Cases were identified from lists of discharge diagnoses provided by hospitals serving the target population. Age-adjusted, sex-specific <b>stroke</b> attack <b>rates</b> {{were computed for}} each survey year by using 5 different diagnostic definitions: 2 based purely on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD- 9) codes and 3 including clinical and neuroimaging criteria. <b>Stroke</b> <b>rates,</b> as measured by a highly specific clinical definition, remained stable from 1980 to 2000 for women. For men, these rates declined modestly from 1980 to 1990 and leveled off during 1990 – 2000. In contrast, use of stroke-related ICD- 9 discharge codes declined significantly from 1980 to 2000 : 35 % among men and 16 % among women. Neuroimaging use increased significantly from 75 % of cases in 1980 to 98 % in 2000. Short-term (28 -day) stroke survival improved significantly, by 16 % for women and 12 % for men, from 1980 to 2000. The decline in stroke ICD- 9 code usage reflects the influence of increased neuroimaging on discharge coding.

40|$|SUMMARY An {{epidemiological}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the geographical variations in stroke mortality among three U. S. areas. They were Savannah, Georgia (high <b>stroke</b> <b>rates),</b> Hagerstown, Maryland (intermediate <b>stroke</b> <b>rates)</b> and Pueblo, Colorado (low <b>stroke</b> <b>rates).</b> In each area samples were drawn of the population in the 35 - 54 age group. The subjects were interviewed and examined to obtain the information required on medical conditions and/or living habits which would characterize each area. A brief medical and family history, as well as demographic and personal data, were obtained by interview. The medical examination included blood pressure, ECG, blood and urine chemistry, height and weight. In all three cities the response rate in the final sample selected was 90 % (2375 individuals) interviewed and 74 % (1, 939 individuals) ex-amined.

40|$|Background: Studying <b>stroke</b> <b>rates</b> {{in a whole}} {{community}} is a rational way to assess the quality of patient care and primary prevention. However, there are few studies of trends in <b>stroke</b> <b>rates</b> worldwide and none in Brazil. Objective: Established study methods were used to define the rates for first ever stroke in a defined population in Brazil compared with similar data obtained and published in 1995. Methods: All stroke cases occurring {{in the city of}} Joinville during 2005 - 2006 were prospectively ascertained. Crude incidence and mortality rates were determined, and age adjusted rates and 30 day case fatality were calculated and compared with the 1995 data. Results: Of the 1323 stroke cases registered, 759 were first ever <b>strokes.</b> The incidence <b>rate</b> per 100 000 was 105. 4 (95 % CI 98. 0 to 113. 2), mortality rate was 23. 9 (95 % CI 20. 4 to 27. 8) and the 30 day case fatality was 19. 1 %. Compared with the 1995 data, we found that the incidence had decreased by 27 %, mortality decreased by 37 % and the 30 day case fatality decreased by 28 %. Conclusions: Using defined criteria we showed that in an industrial southern Brazilian city, <b>stroke</b> <b>rates</b> are similar to those from developed countries. A significant decrease in <b>stroke</b> <b>rates</b> over the past decade was also found, suggesting an improvement in primary prevention and inpatient care of stroke patients in Joinville.

These predictions were then tested using a MATLAB model of the rowing stroke. The model simulates an eight man oared rowing shell and determines average shell speed, <b>stroke</b> <b>rating,</b> power per <b>stroke,</b> and time over a 2000 meter race. Several parameters of the rowing model are manipulated {{to determine the effects}} of each source of inefficiency on shell speed. Of the sources tested, three can be attributed to the shell manufacturer, and the others can be attributed to the rowers themselves. The sources of inefficiency tested are wetted surface area, coefficient of friction, dynamic and static weight, stroke length, slide acceleration, and <b>stroke</b> <b>rating.</b> The effects on shell velocity were normalized to determine which sources resulted in the greatest inefficiencies.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Stroke {{mortality}} rates declined {{for much of}} {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, but recent trends and their relation to other organ- and disease-specific causes of death have not been characterized. Methods—Using the National Center for Health Statistics mortality data, leading organ- and disease-specific causes of death were assessed for the most recent 10 -year period (1996 to 2005) in the United States with a specific focus on stroke deaths. Results—Age-adjusted <b>stroke</b> death <b>rates</b> declined by 25. 4 %; as a result, lung cancer (which only declined by 9. 2 %) surpassed stroke as the second leading cause of death in 2003. Despite a 31. 9 % decline in age-adjusted ischemic heart disease death rates, it remains the leading cause of death. Stroke is now the fifth leading cause of death in men and the fourth leading cause of death in whites but remains the second leading cause of death in women and blacks. Conclusions—With <b>stroke</b> death <b>rates</b> decreasing substantially in the United States from 1996 to 2005, stroke moved from the second to the third leading organ- and disease-specific cause of death. Women and blacks may warrant attention for targeted stroke prevention and treatment because they continue to have disproportionately high <b>stroke</b> death <b>rates.</b> (<b>Stroke.</b> 2010; 41 : 499 - 503.)

40|$|AbstractObjective: Carotid {{angioplasty}} and stenting (CAS) {{has been}} advocated as a minimally invasive and inexpensive alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, a precise comparative {{analysis of the}} immediate and long-term costs associated with these two procedures has not been performed. To accomplish this, a Markov decision analysis model was created to evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of these two interventions. Methods: Procedural morbidity/mortality rate for CEA and costs (not charges) were derived from a retrospective review of consecutive patients treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell (n = 447). Data for CAS {{were obtained from the}} literature. We incorporated into this model both the immediate procedural costs and the long-term cost of morbidities, such as stroke (major stroke in the first year = $ 52, 019; in subsequent years = $ 27, 336 /y; minor stroke = $ 9419). We determined long-term survival rate in quality-adjusted life years and lifetime costs for a hypothetic cohort of 70 -year-old patients undergoing either CEA or CAS. Our measure of outcome was the cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: The immediate procedural costs of CEA and CAS were $ 7871 and $ 10, 133 respectively. We assumed major plus minor <b>stroke</b> <b>rates</b> for CEA and CAS of 0. 9 % and 5 %, respectively. We assumed a 30 -day mortality rate of 0 % for CEA and 1. 2 % for CAS. In our base case analysis, CEA was cost saving (lifetime savings = $ 7017 /patient; increase in quality-adjusted life years saved = 0. 16). Sensitivity analysis revealed major <b>stroke</b> and death <b>rates</b> as the major contributors to this differential in cost effectiveness. Procedural costs were less important, and minor <b>stroke</b> <b>rates</b> were least important. CAS became cost effective only if its major <b>stroke</b> and mortality <b>rates</b> were made equivalent to those of CEA. Conclusion: CEA is cost saving compared with CAS. This is related to the higher <b>rate</b> of <b>stroke</b> with CAS and the high cost of stents and protection devices. To be economically competitive, the mortality and major <b>stroke</b> <b>rates</b> of CAS must be at least equivalent if not less than those of CEA. (J Vasc Surg 2003; 37 : 331 - 9. ...|$|R
