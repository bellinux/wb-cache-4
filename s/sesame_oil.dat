Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entrées for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, oil, <b>sesame</b> <b>oil,</b> salt, and vinegar.|$|E
5|$|After {{decades of}} upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans {{attempted}} to reassert centralized {{control over the}} Arab vilayets. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab sipahi officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, {{as part of a}} broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and <b>sesame</b> <b>oil</b> presses.|$|E

Low-field (LF) proton (1 H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry and ultra-violet (UV) visible spectroscopy are used to detect adulteration {{of olive oil}}. Three different olive oil with different oleoyl acyl contents were mixed with almond, castor, corn, and <b>sesame</b> <b>oils</b> with three volumetric ratios, respectively.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this research work {{was to determine the}} characteristic features of the oil content and composition of nutrients of sesame seeds grown in Morocco. Characteristic features of the seed oil revealed a high degree of unsaturation and as determined by gas chromatography reported herein, the major unsaturated fatty acids were linoleic acid (46. 9 %) followed by oleic acid (37. 4 %), while the main saturated fatty acid was palmitic acid (9. 1 %). <b>Sesame</b> seed <b>oil</b> was also found to be rich in tocopherols with a predominance of γ-tocopherol (90. 5 %). The phytosterol marker β-sitosterol accounted for 59. 9 % of total sterols contained in <b>sesame</b> seed <b>oil.</b> This oil, therefore, has a potential for its use in human nutrition or industrial applications. Compositional analysis revealed that the sesame seeds contained considerable amounts of protein (22 %) and high amounts of lipids (52 %).

40|$|Abstract: The {{addition}} of vegetable oils to the diets of dairy goats {{is an alternative}} to supplemental feeding during the dry period and improves the lipid profile of milk and by-products. Cheeses were produced using milk from cross bred goats (Saanen×Alpina) fed diets enriched with 4 % vegetable <b>oil</b> (faveleira, <b>sesame</b> or castor), the fatty acid profile of cheeses was studied. Supplementation with vegetable oils did not increase the total fat percentage of the cheese (p? 0. 05) but did increase the percentage of CLA isomers, long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA); in addition, the index of desirable fatty acids (DFA [...] expressed as the sum of unsaturated fatty acids plus stearic acid) was increased for cheese made from milk from goats fed <b>sesame</b> or faveleira <b>oil.</b> Cheeses may have had increased percentages of cis- 9,trans- 11 -CLA due to the supplementation of animal diets with vegetable oils rich in C 18 : 2, such as faveleira and <b>sesame</b> <b>oils.</b> The fatty acid profile of goat cheese did not change significantly {{in response to the}} use of castor oil.

2500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{essential}} fatty acids that you must consume (omega-3 and omega-6). Experts say that you need to eat a balanced amount of omega-3s and omega-6s. However, some estimate that Americans consume twenty times more omega-6s than omega-3s. There is a theory that an imbalance of essential fatty acids may lead to mental disorders such as depression, hyperactivity and schizophrenia, but it still lacking evidences. An omega-3 deficient diet increases omega-6 levels in the brain disrupting endocannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens contributing to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice.
