More generally, the model specifically indicates when a lead is initiated, provides the orientation of the lead, gives the mode of failure, and allows one to numerically determine the width of leads. In addition, the approach allows multiple failure planes, a feature that is necessary to simulate crack branching. Pre-existing planes of weakness such as those formed from previous leads can be incorporated. Sample calculations indicate how such a model can be used for large-scale numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|Sea ice {{models with}} the {{traditional}} viscous-plastic (VP) rheology and very high grid resolution can resolve leads and deformation rates that are localised along Linear Kinematic Features (LKF). In a 1 -km pan-Arctic sea ice- ocean simulation, the small scale sea-ice deformations in the Central Arctic are evaluated with a scaling analysis in relation to satellite observations of the Envisat <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Processor</b> System (EGPS). A new coupled scaling analysis for data on Eulerian grids determines the spatial and the temporal scaling {{as well as the}} coupling between temporal and spatial scales. The spatial scaling of the modelled sea ice deformation implies multi-fractality. The spatial scaling is also coupled to temporal scales and varies realistically by region and season. The agreement of the spatial scaling and its coupling to temporal scales with satellite observations and models with the modern elasto-brittle rheology challenges previous results with VP models at coarse resolution where no such scaling was found.

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{provides}} an amazingly detailed look at sea ice, but {{the level of}} detail {{is so great that}} it is not at first apparent how to utilize the data for improving sea ice data sets and models. A solution to this conundrum is offered in the RADARSAT <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Processor</b> System (RGPS), which takes 400 ScanSAR images every 24 -day cycle and produces gridded products of ice motion, deformation and thickness. These geophysical products can be put to a variety of uses: analyzing new ice climatologies, testing ice models or new ideas about sea ice rheology, and for assimilating into sea ice models. For the first time, we can produce basin-scale estimates of sea ice age and thickness from observations of ice motion in SAR images of the Arctic Ocean. The thickness distribution of sea ice is an essential descriptor of its mass and heat balance. Currently, we have only crude estimates on how much ice there is, how it varies in space and time, where ice is produced and where it melts, and how rapidly it is transported from place to place.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to reduce the error {{generated}} when computing sea ice deformation fields from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) -derived sea ice motion. The method is based on two steps. The first step consists of using a triangulation of the positions taken from the sea ice trajectories to define a mesh on which a first estimate of sea ice deformation is computed. The second step consists of applying a specific smoother to the deformation field to reduce the artificial noise that arises along discontinuities in the sea ice motion field. This method is here applied to RADARSAT <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Processor</b> System (RGPS) sea ice trajectories having a temporal and spatial resolution of about 3 days and 10 km, respectively. From the comparison between unfiltered and filtered fields, we estimate that the artificial noise causes an overestimation of about 60 % of opening and closing. The artificial noise also has a strong impact on the statistical distribution of the deformation and on the scaling exponents estimated with multifractal analysis. We also show that a similar noise {{is present in the}} deformation fields provided in the widely used four-point deformation RGPS data set. These findings may have serious implications for previous studies as the constant overestimation of the opening and closing could lead to a large overestimation of freezing in leads, salt rejection and sea ice ridging...|$|R

When processed with the RADARSAT <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Processor</b> System (RGPS), it provides estimates of sea ice motion and deformation over large regions of the Arctic for extended periods of time. The deformation {{is dominated by the}} appearance of linear kinematic features that have been associated with the presence of leads. The RGPS deformation products are {{based on the assumption that}} the displacement and velocity are smooth functions of the spatial coordinates. However, if the dominant deformation of multiyear ice results from the opening, closing and shearing of leads, then the displacement and velocity can be discontinuous. This presentation discusses the kinematics associated with strong discontinuities that describe possible jumps in displacement or velocity. Ice motion from SAR data are analyzed using this framework. It is assumed that RGPS cells deform due to the presence of a lead. The lead orientation is calculated to optimally account for the observed deformation. It is shown that almost all observed deformation can be represented by lead opening and shearing. The procedure used to reprocess motion data to account for leads will be described and applied to regions of the Beaufort Sea.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe identification of acoustically active pressure ridges in the Arctic Ocean represents {{an important step}} {{in the development of a}} physics based, operational Polar ambient noise model. One method to accomplish this goal is through the use of satellite based remote sensors, specifically synthetic aperture radar (SAR). A proof of concept study was conducted that determined that the RADARSAT <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Processor</b> System (RGPS) produces SAR derived sea ice products capable of quantifying large scale ice deformation that may produce significant levels of low frequency ambient noise. This research also identifies the meteorological forcing that causes the sequence of divergent and convergent events in the ice cover, which results in the creation of open water leads and subsequent generation of noisy pressure ridges. Offshore followed by onshore winds near coasts and land fast ice and atmospheric lows/troughs followed by atmospheric highs/ridges or velocity shear in straight isobaric flow result in significant pressure ridge formation. The RGPS ridging algorithm shows that more ridges exist in RGPS cells exhibiting large cell area changes than in those with small area changes, assuming relatively constant cell heights in all cells. The feasibility of using ice divergence fields generated by Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center's (FNMOC's) Polar Ice Prediction System (PIPS) was evaluated.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{deformation}} of sea ice {{is an important}} element of the Arctic climate system because of its influ-ence on the ice-thickness distribution and on the rates of ice production and melt. New data obtained from the Radarsat <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Processor</b> System (RGPS) using satellite synthetic aperture radar images of the ice offers an opportunity to compare observations of the ice deformation to estimates obtained from models. The RGPS tracks tens of thousands of points, spaced roughly at 10 -km intervals, for an entire season in a Lagrangian fash-ion. The deformation is computed from cells formed by the tracked points, typically at 3 -day intervals. We used a coupled ice/ocean model with ice-thickness and enthalpy distributions that covers the entire Arctic Ocean with a 40 -km grid. Model-only and model-with-data-assimilation runs were analysed. The data assimilation runs were analysed {{in order to determine the}} validity of the comparison techniques and to find the comparisons under the best of circumstances, when many buoy measurements are available for assimilation. This step is necessary because the RGPS and model data differ in spatial and temporal sampling characteristics.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) Explain the relationship between the discontinuous motion of the ice cover and the large-scale, smooth wind field that drives the ice; (2) Characterize the sea ice deformation in the Arctic at different temporal and spatial scales, and compare it with deformation predicted by a state-of-theart ice/ocean model; and (3) Compare RGPS-derived sea ice thickness with other data, and investigate the thinning of the Arctic sea ice cover as seen in ULS data obtained by U.

The points are initially spaced 10 km apart and are organized into four-cornered cells. The area and the strain rates are calculated for each cell for each new observation of its corners. The accuracy of the RGPS ice tracking, area changes, and deformation estimates is {{needed to make the}} dataset useful for analysis, model validation, and data assimilation. Two comparisons are made to assess the accuracy. The first compares the tracking performed at two different facilities (the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the Alaska SAR Facility in Fairbanks, Alaska), between which the primary difference is the operator intervention. The error standard deviation of the tracking, not including geolocation errors, is 100 m, which is the pixel size of the SAR images. The second comparison is made with buoy trajectories from the International Arctic Buoy Program. The squared correlation coefficient for RGPS and buoy displacements is 0. 996. The median magnitude of the displacement differences is 323 m. The tracking errors give rise to error standard deviations of 0. 5 % day 21 in the divergence, shear, and vorticity.

Ice production is of seasonal ice in openings during the winter. 3 -day estimates of these quantities are provided within Lagrangian elements initially 10 km on a side. A distinct seasonal cycle is seen in both zones with these estimates highest in the late fall and with seasonal minimums in the mid-winter. Regional divergence over the winter could be up to 30 %. Spatially, the highest deformation is in the SIZ north of coastal Alaska. Both ice deformation and production are higher in the SIZ: deformation-related ice production in the SIZ (~ 0. 5 m) is 1. 5 - 2. 3 {{times that of the}} PIZ (~ 0. 3 m) - this is connected to ice strength and thickness. Atmospheric forcing and boundary layer structure contribute to only the seasonal and interannual variability. Seasonal ice growth in ice fractures accounts for ~ 25 - 40 % of the total ice production of the Arctic Ocean. Uncertainties in these estimates are discussed. By itself, this deformation-ice production relationship could be considered a negative feedback when thickness is perturbed. However, the overall effect on ice production in the face of increasing seasonal and thinner/weaker ice coverage could be modified by: local destabilization of the water column promoting overturning of warmer water due to increased brine rejection; and, the upwelling of the pynocline associated with increased occurrence of large shear motion in sea ice.

Comparison of the collocated SAR pixels showed that ice-free areas can only be classified under calm wind conditions (less than 3 m/s) and for surface winds greater than 10 m/s based on the backscattering coefficient alone. This is true for pack ice regions during the cold months of the year where ice-free areas are spatially limited and where the capillary waves that cause SAR backscatter are dampened by entrained ice crystals. For nilas, two distinct backscatter classes were found at - 17 dB and at - 10 dB. The higher backscattering coefficient is attributed to the presence of frost flowers on light nilas. Gray and gray-white ice have a backscatter signature similar to first-year ice and therefore cannot be distinguished by SAR alone. First-year and old ice can be clearly separated based on their backscattering coefficient. The performance of the <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Processor</b> System ice classifier was tested against the Landsat derived ice products. It was found that smooth first-year ice and rough first-year ice were not significantly different in the backscatter domain. Ice concentration estimates based on ERS 1 C band SAR showed an error range of 5 to 8 % for high ice concentration regions, mainly due to misclassified ice-free and smooth first-year ice areas.

This <b>geophysical</b> processing system (GPS) will derive ice-motion information by automated analysis of image sequences acquired by radars on the European ERS- 1, Japanese ERS- 1, and Canadian RADARSAT remote sensing satellites. The algorithm consists of a novel combination of feature-based and area-based techniques for the tracking of ice floes that undergo translation and rotation between imaging passes. The system performs automatic selection of the image pairs for input to the matching routines using an ice-motion estimator. It is designed to have a daily throughput of ten image pairs. A description is given of the GPS system, including an overview of the ice-motion-tracking algorithm, the system architecture, and the ice-motion products that will be available for distribution to geophysical data users...|$|R
40|$|This paper applied {{multispectral}} (ETM+/Landsat 7), <b>SAR</b> and airborne <b>geophysical</b> data both {{to aid the}} geologic characterization and {{to highlight}} tracts with potential for iron deposits in the Serra Leste Block, located in the Serra dos Carajás (Pará State, Brazil). The Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) technique was applied to six bands of the ETM+/Landsat sensor/satellite, producing the enhancement of iron-bearing surfaces, SAR data allowed the observation of the macro-topography and lineaments that were also interpreted {{on the basis of}} airborne geophysical and multispectral data. <b>Geophysical</b> and <b>SAR</b> (RADARSAT- 1) data were combined by means of the IHS (intensity-hue-saturation) transform and the products yielded were used to improve the limits of the geologic units and to define targets for iron exploration. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) supervised classification method was applied to a set of selected airborne geophysical images based on the rationale of the iron mineralization descriptive model and geophysical signatures observed at Serra Leste, Using documented iron occurrence as training point for the SAM classification, iron favorability maps were produced and compared against several early maps, proving to be equivalent or superior in accuracy. © 2008 Sociedade Brasileira de Geofísica...|$|R
40|$|This paper applied <b>geophysical,</b> <b>SAR,</b> SRTM {{images and}} {{geochemistry}} {{data to the}} geologic characterization of the Creporizão region, located in the Tapajós Mineral Province (Pará state Brazil), whose gold occurrences are related, mostly, to granites of the Creporizão Intrusive Suite unit. Interpretation of drainage and lineaments were realized based on the SAR-RADAM image, {{as well as an}} analysis of the magnetic lineaments through the first vertical derivative, and determination of gamma-ray spectrometry units. With the geostatistic treatment of the chemistry elements associated with current sediments and soil, maps generated by ordinary kriging were producing, and color combinations of the elements with high correlations. In the case of gold in current sediments, hydrographic sub-basins related to anomalous values in this element were distinguished. In the case of gold in soil, it was observed high potential in the southeast portion of the studied area (using indicator and ordinary kriging) that is also characterized by NE-SW and NW-SE lineaments interpreted in the SAR image. Additionaly, the sequential indicator simulation was utilized to the production of equiprobably prospective scenarios of gold anomalies, and the geochemistry signatures of nine gold occurrences were extracted and associated to the host rocks. It was possible to check that the application of geostatistic techniques in geochemistry data and the integration of these results with remote sensing and geophysical data and/or interpretations can be an useful tool to the gold prospection. The use of the stochastic simulation can guide significantly exploration works, mostly in the first steps of the research, when the geologic knowledge is restrict. Pages: 3173 - 318...|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we explain}} the mechanisms implemented by DLR {{to support the}} GEO Supersite initiative by providing TerraSAR-X data to the community at reduced cost and simplified access procedures. The Supersites are an initiative of the Group of Earth Observations (GEO) to study natural hazards in geologically active regions using information from Synthetic Aperture Radar (<b>SAR),</b> GNSS, <b>geophysical</b> models and other data sources. The data are provided {{in the spirit of}} GEO, ESA, NASA and DLR that easy access to Earth science data will promote their use and advance scientific research, ultimately leading to improved geo-risk modelling and the prediction of hazards. Seven Supersites have been defined initially with different threat mechanisms: Hawaii (volcanic), Vancouver (tectonic), Los Angeles (tectonic), Etna (volcanic), Vesuvius (volcanic), Istanbul (tectonic) and Tokyo (tectonic). Triggered by tragic earthquakes, additional sites such as Port’o Prince (Haiti, 2010) and Tohoku-oki (Japan, 2011) have been recently added to the list. The TerraSAR-X mission is carried out under a public-private partnership (PPP) between the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung; BMBF), the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR) and Astrium GmbH. DLR is responsible for the scientific usage of the data ([URL] and it takes care of design, implementation and operation of the mission. Data for commercial use are made available through Astrium GEO-Information Services GmbH ([URL] The satellite’s total data-collecting capacity is divided equally between science and industry. In order to support research in the geo-risk domain, DLR allocated a quota of TerraSAR-X products to the Geo-supersite intitiative that will be provided free of charge. It mainly utilizes the data provision mechanism in place applicable for tscientific applications (AO) in order to satisfy as well the German Satellite Data Security Act (SATDSiG) as to protect the commercial interests of the PPP. For each Supersite, a dedicated principal investigator takes care of -	justifying the scientific use of the requested data in the AO proposal, -	SAR data acquisition planning, -	negotiation of acquisition requests in case of conflicts with other scientists, -	acquisition planning and -	regular reporting. For the task of data ordering the PI gets a special account in DLR’s Science Service System with low priority but rather large number of scenes free of charge that will used for filling the archive. In order to work with the data, the scientists write a simplified AO proposal with reference to the supersite AO proposal. He may the order a certain number of scenes from the catalogue for free. This mechanism has already proven successful at some supersites and first results are available, e. g. from Hawaii, Haiti and Tohoku-oki. For the latter, a time sequence of TerraSAR-X data is currently being acquired and jointly released to the public by DLR and Astrium GEO-Information Services GmbH in an even more simplified procedure. An overview of DLR’s supersite process and first scientific results are given in the presentation. ...|$|R
