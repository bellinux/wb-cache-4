5|$|Djedkare Isesi (known in Greek as Tancherês) was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, {{the eighth}} and {{penultimate}} {{ruler of the}} Fifth Dynasty in the late 25th century to mid-24th century BC, during the Old Kingdom period. Djedkare succeeded Menkauhor Kaiu and was in turn succeeded by Unas. His relations to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain, although it is often conjectured that Unas was Djedkare's son, owing to the <b>smooth</b> <b>transition</b> between the two.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a <b>smooth</b> <b>transition</b> in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.|$|E

To create a <b>smooth</b> <b>transition,</b> Andy and Helen were married in the first episode with the new title and remained for a few additional episodes before leaving with a move to Raleigh, effectively ending their appearances.

5|$|Muren {{found both}} stop motion and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create a <b>smooth</b> <b>transition</b> from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 1943, {{strike and}} bomber {{production}} {{was to be}} scaled down, and fighter and bomber destroyer production given priority. On 3 August 1943, Milch contradicted this and declared that this increase in fighter production would not affect production of the Ju 87, Ju 188, Ju 288 and Ju 290. This was an important consideration as the life expectancy of a Ju 87 had been reduced (since 1941) from 9.5 months to 5.5 months to just 100 operational flying hours. On 26 October, General der Schlachtflieger Ernst Kupfer reported the Ju 87 could no longer survive in operations and that the Focke-Wulf Fw 190F should take its place. Milch finally agreed and ordered the minimal continuance of Ju 87 D-3 and D-5 production for a <b>smooth</b> <b>transition</b> period.|$|E

The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a <b>smooth</b> <b>transition</b> from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to {{have been used in}} Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting. A second balcony separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the finial top of the minaret.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An {{efficient}} {{representation of}} the (<b>smoothed)</b> <b>transition</b> relation of a synchronous finite state machine (FSM) speeds up the traversal based symbolic verification and the functional simulation of the FSM. When using reduced ordered binary decision diagrams (BDDs), dynamic reordering algorithms are applied {{in order to keep}} the sizes of the BDDs tractable. However, when FSMs are represented by BDDs, the state encoding can be used as an additional optimization criteria. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for state encoding of FSMs that minimizes the BDD representations of the corresponding (<b>smoothed)</b> <b>transition</b> relations. Experimental results show the approach to be very efficient. I. ...|$|R

40|$|Mesh {{optimization}} {{has proven}} to be an effective way to improve mesh quality for arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) simulations. To date, however, most of the focus has been on improving the geometric shape of individual elements, and these methods often do not result in <b>smooth</b> <b>transitions</b> in element size or aspect ratio across groups of elements. We present an extension to the mean ratio optimization that addresses this problem and yields <b>smooth</b> <b>transitions</b> within regions and across regions in the ALE simulation. While this method is presented in the context of ALE simulations, it is applicable to a wider set of applications that require mesh improvement, including the mesh generation process.
