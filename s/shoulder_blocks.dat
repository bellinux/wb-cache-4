5000|$|Named as Coco Savege in Exciting Hour. A [...] "Wild Man" [...] themed wrestler, clearly {{inspired}} by Bobo Brazil. Depicted wearing a Leopard skin and barefoot, he is unique from other opponents in that his attacking style is especially swift. He neither punches nor kicks; rather, {{he is the}} only opponent to use the shoulder block, the same used by the Player. His unorthodox and unpredictable fighting style includes <b>shoulder</b> <b>blocks,</b> coconuts (punches to the head while in a headlock), a Mongolian Chop and Giant Swing Throw as his finishing move, as well as a Body Splash on a downed opponent. He's quite possibly the most difficult opponent to beat in the game.|$|E
50|$|During {{the match}} between Savage and the Warrior, Miss Elizabeth was spotted in the crowd. During {{the course of}} the match cameras kept cutting to her as she grew {{concerned}} for Savage's well being. Despite taking five of Savage's flying elbow drops, Warrior won the match after hitting the Macho King with three jumping <b>shoulder</b> <b>blocks</b> and forced Savage to retire. After the match, Sherri came into the ring and attacked Savage, which prompted Elizabeth to charge into the ring and fight off the former Queen and save Savage. Shocked to see what Elizabeth had done for him, Savage had an emotional reunion with his former manager and held the ring ropes open for her so she could exit, turning Savage into a fan favorite {{for the first time in}} over two years.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test if valence and {{intensity}} dimensions of responses to general programming affect commercial processing in everyday life. Results from analyses on data from a large telephone survey showed that indicators of program-induced valence and intensity significantly affected several advertising processing measures. Intensity had a positive impact on measures of attention and recall, while valence was positively related to attitude toward the advertisement. Next, we investigated the moderating influences of variations in commercial placement on these relations. We found that effects of intensity and valence on commercial processing were stronger for interrupting blocks than <b>shoulder</b> <b>blocks.</b> However, the position of the commercial within the block did not have an impact on these carryover effects. The study on the effects of program responses on the processing of commercials placed at various positions in the program and the block was part of a Ph. D. project on the relationship between media environments and advertising effects conducted at ASCoR. The authors wish to thank John Faasse, Unilever, and Initiative for making the data available for analyses. ...|$|E

50|$|This move is a <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> {{performed}} to an opponent who {{is set up}} on the turnbuckle. The opponent is often resting back first against the turnbuckles. The wrestler can run at the opponent, but normally the wrestler will place his/her shoulder against the opponent and swing their legs back and forth, driving their shoulder into the opponent’s chest, often repeatedly to then gain momentum.|$|R

50|$|A <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> sees {{a wrestler}} strike an {{opponent}} with their shoulder usually ramming their shoulder, by keeping their arm down by their side, into the opponent's shoulder or abdomen of an opponent running towards them. However, often this {{will see a}} larger wrestler stand still and have the other wrestler run towards the larger one to try and execute the move only to get knocked down. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> often is used to display the size and strength of a wrestler, with the larger wrestler challenging another to run off the ropes and hit the move. This usually sees the other wrestler attempt to charge at the larger one several times only to see their attempts have no effect, or get knocked down themselves. A slight variation on this called the body block which is also typically used by large wrestlers, this sees an opponent run at the large wrestler who would simply engulf the charging opponent by swing his/her arms round and forcing the opponent to impact the wrestlers entire body.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} a <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> takedown, this is an attack where an attacking wrestler charges towards a {{standing}} opponent, brings his body {{parallel to the ground}} and drives his shoulder into the opponent's midsection, pulling on the opponent's legs, as in a double leg takedown, and forcing them back-first into the mat. This move has been popularized by many famous wrestlers, such as Goldberg, Edge, Bobby Lashley, Roman Reigns and more.|$|R

5|$|The first main {{match was}} for the WWE Championship, in which {{champion}} Rob Van Dam defended the title against Edge accompanied with Lita. In {{the beginning of the}} match, Edge performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Van Dam outside the ring. Van Dam, however, managed to execute a crossbody on Edge inside the ring, resulting in the two landing {{on the outside of the}} ring floor. Both men took the upper hand in the match, until Van Dam was scripted to knock the referee unconscious. Edge took advantage, as Lita gave him the title. Edge tried to hit Van Dam with the title, but Van Dam dodged the hit as he performed a spinning kick on the title, resulting in hitting Edge's face. Edge, however, got the advantage as he attempted to perform a <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> takedown on Van Dam, while Lita propped a chair on a ring corner. Edge went for the <b>shoulder</b> <b>block</b> takedown, but Van Dam moved out of the way, resulting in Edge to crash head-first onto the chair. Capitalizing on the situation, Van Dam then performed a body splash from the top turnbuckle on Edge, which he followed with a cover and a pinfall, thus retaining the WWE Championship.|$|R
