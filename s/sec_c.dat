40|$|Newly {{synthesized}} proteins are transported {{from the}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi via COPII coated vesicles. SEC 24 is the COPII component {{primarily responsible for}} the recruitment of transmembrane cargoes or cargo adaptors into newly forming COPII vesicles on the ER membrane. Mammalian genomes encode four Sec 24 paralogs (Sec 24 a-d), though {{little is known about}} their comparative functions. Based on protein sequence, SEC 24 A/B are more closely related to one another than they are to SEC 24 C/D. Mice deficient for SEC 24 A exhibit a mild hypocholesterolemic phenotype, and Sec 24 b null embryos die from a specific neural tube closure defect near the end of embryonic development. Through the generation and characterization of a mouse model deficient in <b>SEC</b> 24 <b>C,</b> we demonstrate that <b>SEC</b> 24 <b>C</b> is required during early embryonic development, with SEC 24 C-deficient embryos dying around embryonic day 7. 5. We found <b>SEC</b> 24 <b>C</b> to be dispensable in a number of tissues, likely as a result of compensation by other Sec 24 paralogs. A mouse model of SEC 24 D-deficiency revealed that the requirement for SEC 24 D begins prior to the blastocyst stage. Mice heterozygous for null alleles of <b>Sec</b> 24 <b>c</b> or <b>Sec</b> 24 d, as well as compound heterozygotes, exhibit no phenotypic abnormalities. 	 To determine the extent of functional overlap between <b>SEC</b> 24 <b>C</b> and <b>SEC</b> 24 D, we generated a Sec 24 cc-d allele, in which the <b>SEC</b> 24 <b>C</b> coding sequence has been largely replaced with SEC 24 D. We found that SEC 24 D, when its expression is driven by <b>Sec</b> 24 <b>c</b> regulatory elements, can rescue <b>Sec</b> 24 <b>c</b> null mice from embryonic lethality. However, Sec 24 cc-d /c-d mice die shortly after birth, suggesting that the overlap in function between <b>SEC</b> 24 <b>C</b> and <b>SEC</b> 24 D is incomplete, consistent with the wide range of phenotypes observed in mouse models of SEC 24 deficiency. Taken together, these results indicate that the four Sec 24 paralogs have developed unique functions over the course of vertebrate evolution, but have also maintained some overlap in function...|$|R

40|$|The {{transporters}} for serotonin (SERT), dopamine, and noradrenaline have a conserved hydrophobic core but divergent N and C termini. The C terminus harbors {{the binding}} {{site for the}} coat protein complex II (COPII) cargo-binding protein SEC 24. Here we explored which SEC 24 isoform was required for export of SERT from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Three lines of evidence argue that SERT can only exit the ER by recruiting SEC 24 C: (i) Mass spectrometry showed that a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of SERT recruited SEC 24 C-containing COPII complexes from mouse brain lysates. (ii) Depletion of individual SEC 24 isoforms by siRNAs revealed that SERT was trapped in the ER only if <b>SEC</b> 24 <b>C</b> was down-regulated, in both, cells that expressed SERT endogenously or after transfection. The combination of all siRNAs was not more effective than that directed against <b>SEC</b> 24 <b>C.</b> A SERT mutant in which the SEC 24 C-binding motif (607 RI 608) was replaced by alanine was insensitive to down-regulation of <b>SEC</b> 24 <b>C</b> levels. (iii) Overexpression of a <b>SEC</b> 24 <b>C</b> variant with a mutation in the candidate cargo-binding motif (SEC 24 C-D 796 V/D 797 N) but not of the corresponding mutant SEC 24 D-D 733 V/D 734 N reduced SERT surface levels. In contrast, noradrenaline and dopamine transporters and the more distantly related GABA transporter 1 relied on SEC 24 D for ER export. These observations demonstrate that closely related transporters are exclusive client cargo proteins for different SEC 24 isoforms. The short promoter polymorphism results in reduced SERT cell surface levels and renders affected individuals more susceptible to depression. By inference, variations in the <b>Sec</b> 24 <b>C</b> gene may also affect SERT cell surface levels and thus be linked to mood disorders...|$|R

40|$|The rate-limiting step in {{the transit}} of dietary fat across the {{intestinal}} absorptive cell is its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a specialized ER-to-Golgi transport vesicle, the prechylomicron transport vesicle (PCTV). PCTV bud off from the ER membranes and have unique features; they are the largest ER-derived vesicles (average diameter 250 nm), do not require GTP and COPII proteins for their formation, and utilize VAMP 7 as a v-N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE). However, PCTV require COPII proteins for their fusion with the Golgi, suggesting a role for them in Golgi target recognition. In support of this, PCTV contained {{each of the five}} COPII proteins when docked with the Golgi. When PCTV were fused with the Golgi, the COPII proteins were present in greatly diminished amounts, indicating they had cycled back to the cytosol. Immuno-depletion of Sec 31 from the cytosol did not affect PCTV-Golgi docking, but depletion of Sec 23 resulted in a 25 % decrease. Immuno-depletion of <b>Sec</b> 24 <b>C</b> caused a nearly complete cessation of PCTV docking activity, but on the addition of recombinant <b>Sec</b> 24 <b>C,</b> docking activity was restored.

40|$|In non-centrosymmetric superconductors, spin-orbit {{coupling}} can induce {{an unconventional}} superconducting {{state with a}} mixture of s-wave spin-singlet and p-wave spin-triplet channels, which leads to a variety of exotic phenomena, including anisotropic upper critical field, magnetoelectric effect, topological superconductivity, et al. It is commonly thought that inversion symmetry breaking is substantial for pairing-mixed superconducting states. In this work, we theoretically propose that a new type of pairing-mixed state, namely the mixture of s-wave spin-singlet and d-wave spin-quintet channels, can be induced by spin-orbit coupling even in the presence of inversion symmetry when electrons effectively carry "spin- 3 / 2 " in superconductors. As a physical consequence of the singlet-quintet pairing mixing, topological nodal-line superconductivity is found in such system and gives rise to flat surface Majorana bands.

Remarkably, the quantum group U_h(b) is endowed with a Tannakian equivalence F_b from the braided tensor category of Drinfeld-Yetter modules over b, with deformed associativity constraints given by Phi, to that of Drinfeld-Yetter modules over U_h(b). In this paper, we prove that the equivalence F_b is functorial in b. Comment: 65 pages. Greatly expanded version. Added a) definition and detailed study of admissible Drinfeld-Yetter modules over a QUE (Sec. 2); b) Radford biproduct, and definition of quantum relative Verma modules (<b>Sec.</b> 4); <b>c)</b> <b>Sec.</b> 6 split into Sec. 6 & 7, and added new proof that the EK Tannakian functor is an equivalence; d) Sec. 8 : discussion and use of P.
