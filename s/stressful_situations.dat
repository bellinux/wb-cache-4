5000|$|Emotional {{approach}} coping is {{a psychological}} construct {{that involves the}} use of emotional processing and emotional expression in response to a <b>stressful</b> <b>situation.</b> [...] As opposed to emotional avoidance, in which emotions are experienced as a negative, undesired reaction to a <b>stressful</b> <b>situation,</b> emotional approach coping involves the conscious use of emotional expression and processing to better deal with a <b>stressful</b> <b>situation.</b> The construct was developed to explain an inconsistency in the stress and coping literature: emotion-focused coping was associated with largely maladaptive outcomes while emotional processing and expression was demonstrated to be beneficial.|$|R

50|$|Stress {{may have}} an effect on the recall of {{declarative}} memories. Lupien, et al. completed a study that had 3 phases for participants to take part in. Phase 1 involved memorizing a series of words, phase 2 entailed either a stressful (public speaking) or non-stressful situation (an attention task), and phase 3 required participants to recall the words they learned in phase 1. There were signs of decreased declarative memory performance in the participants that had to complete the <b>stressful</b> <b>situation</b> after learning the words. Recall performance after the <b>stressful</b> <b>situation</b> was found to be worse overall than after the non-stressful situation, where performance differed based on whether the participant responded to the <b>stressful</b> <b>situation</b> with an increase in measured levels of salivary cortisol.|$|R
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that peer support reduces fear during <b>stressful</b> <b>situations</b> such as combat and {{domestic}} violence and may mitigate Posttraumatic stress disorder.

25|$|Brown rats {{also produce}} {{communicative}} noises {{capable of being}} heard by humans. The most commonly heard in domestic rats is bruxing, or teeth-grinding, which is most usually triggered by happiness, but can also be 'self-comforting' in <b>stressful</b> <b>situations,</b> such as {{a visit to the}} vet. The noise is best described as either a quick clicking or 'burring' sound, varying from animal to animal.|$|E

50|$|The major {{effect of}} stress on LTM {{is that it}} {{improves}} consolidation of memory, while it impairs the retrieval of memory. That is, one {{will be able to}} remember information relating to a <b>stressful</b> <b>situation</b> after the fact, but while in a <b>stressful</b> <b>situation</b> it is hard to recall specific information. In a study by Park et al. done on rats, the researchers found that shock induced stress caused the rats to forget what they learned in the phase prior to the shock, but to have distinct memory for where the shock occurred. This negative effect on the retrieval of memories caused by stress can be attributed to cortisol, the stress hormone that is released in stressful situations.A study by Marin et al. demonstrated that stress enhances recall of information reviewed prior to the <b>stressful</b> <b>situation,</b> and that this effect is long lasting.|$|R

25|$|According to the Transactional Model, people {{deal with}} <b>stressful</b> <b>situations</b> by appraisals of {{stressor}} and resources. The primary appraisal {{deals with the}} individual meaning of the specific stressor, which is the care situation in this case. The secondary appraisal analyzes the own abilities and resources to cope with that situation. On this basis, the individual coping efforts are used {{to deal with the}} stressful situation. As per Carver, these efforts can focus on problem management or emotional regulation. Dysfunctional strategies are possible, too. Studies found that a high caregiver burden often comes along with dysfunctional strategies what means activities which don’t solve the problem but worsen it (e.g. self-criticism, substance abuse).|$|E
25|$|Conversion {{disorder}} (CD) is {{a diagnostic}} category {{used in some}} psychiatric classification systems. It is sometimes applied to patients who present with neurological symptoms, such as numbness, blindness, paralysis, or fits, which are not consistent with a well-established organic cause, which cause significant distress, and {{can be traced back}} to a psychological trigger. It is thought that these symptoms arise in response to <b>stressful</b> <b>situations</b> affecting a patient's mental health or an ongoing mental health condition such as depression. Conversion disorder was retained in DSM-5, but given the subtitle functional neurological symptom disorder. The new criteria cover the same range of symptoms, but remove the requirements for a psychological stressor to be present and for feigning to be disproved.|$|E
25|$|Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg contend these {{strategies}} of regulating attachment anxiety {{have very different}} consequences. The security-based strategy leads to more positive thoughts, such as more positive explanations of why others behave {{in a particular way}} and more positive memories about people and events. More positive thoughts can encourage more creative responses to difficult problems or distressing situations. The hyperactivation and attachment avoidance strategies lead to more negative thoughts and less creativity in handling problems and <b>stressful</b> <b>situations.</b> It is notable that the security-based strategy is contingent on a positive response from their attachment. From this perspective, it would benefit people to have attachments who are willing and able to respond positively to the person's request for closeness, so that they can use security-based strategies for dealing with their anxiety.|$|E

25|$|These {{issues have}} been tied to {{grammatical}} processing performance by testing native speakers of English on the same tasks under stressful conditions: there is shown to be difficulty in grammatical agreement when memory capacity is curtailed, important cues in the language when given noisy input, and processing important structures when not given enough time to process input. This shows that knowledge cannot always be automatically and consistently applied under <b>stressful</b> <b>situations</b> without having processing difficulties. However, these issues are not necessarily independent of each other, as low decoding ability of structure could affect processing speed. Overall, individual differences in L2 working memory and decoding ability are correlated to grammaticality judgment accuracy and latencies. However, there is no correlation between speed of processing measure and grammaticality judgment performance, age of arrival correlates with syntactic mastery, and knowledge of vocabulary probably drives grammaticality performance.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study an attempt {{has been made to}} measure the changes {{occurring}} in levels of some neuro-humors, such as catecholamines, serotonin (5 -HT) and acetylcholine in blood and urine, after distension of urinary bladder caused by suppression of urine urge. Distenision of urinary bladder was produced by withholding the urine rabbits and observations were made at hourly intervals. Canges observed in the levels of these neurohumors reveal that withholding of urine is a <b>stressful</b> <b>situation.</b> Inference has been drawn that suppression of urine urge (vegavidharana) acts as a <b>stressful</b> <b>situation</b> and thus the study validates the role of vegavidharan in aetiology of diseases...|$|R

500|$|In November 1983, {{the office}} of the Connecticut state medical {{examiner}} issued a report stating that Slee's death may have been related to stress. The report stated: [...] "This 26-year-old male reportedly collapsed during a group meeting described as a self-improvement seminar. A complete autopsy determined no anatomic cause of death. ... Available history indicates that Mr. Slee collapsed in a situation in which high emotional stress could be expected. Such emotional stress may have neural and hormonal effects that are deleterious to cardiac rhythm." [...] The New Haven Register reported that Chief Medical Examiner Catherine Galvin said that [...] "arrhythmia, an electrical malfunction of the heart, {{is believed to have been}} the cause of Slee's death, but it couldn't be verified". [...] Galvin said that <b>stressful</b> <b>situations</b> can cause such an arrhythmia: [...] "In a stress situation you've got adrenalin pumping into the circulation. That can trigger it." [...] According to the Boston Phoenix, the pathologist that had examined Slee's body stated: [...] "I don’t like the word 'fright', but there are recognized entities of sudden death", though it may not be possible to determine the cause, [...] "where emotions come into play" [...] such as an instance where an individual believes that a curse will harm them. On November 19, 1983, the New Haven Register reported that police were [...] "no longer actively investigating the case", and went on to note that therefore [...] "any connection between Slee's death and his experiences at the seminar" [...] were not likely to be confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|Sexual {{activity}} can {{lower blood pressure}} and overall stress levels, regardless of age. It releases tension, elevates mood, and may create {{a profound sense of}} relaxation, especially in the postcoital period. From a biochemical perspective, sex causes the release of endorphins and increases levels of white blood cells that actually boost the immune system. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to <b>stressful</b> <b>situations,</b> it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, they're regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with <b>stressful</b> <b>situations.</b> [...] A 2007 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 36, (no. 3 (June 2007): 357–68) reported that sexual behavior with a partner on one day significantly predicted lower negative mood and stress, and higher positive mood, on the following day.|$|E
