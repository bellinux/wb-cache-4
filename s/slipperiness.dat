5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road <b>slipperiness.</b> The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, the Docklands Stadium {{has endured}} {{criticism}} over {{the quality and}} suitability of its playing surface, in particular for AFL requirements. It has been criticised by players and coaches for its <b>slipperiness,</b> hardness and lack of grass coverage. The turf has required regular expensive replacement since its inception {{due to a lack}} of sunlight inside the stadium. The turf itself is supplied under contract by HG Turf, whereas the responsibility of laying and managing the turf lies with Docklands Stadium management.|$|E
500|$|After the eleven-year-long Puritan Interregnum, {{which had}} seen the banning of pastimes {{regarded}} as frivolous, such as theatre, the English monarchy was restored to the throne {{with the return of}} Charles II in 1660. Soon after, Charles issued Letters Patent to two parties licensing the formation of new acting companies. One of these went to Thomas Killigrew, whose company became known as the King's Company, and who built a new theatre in Drury Lane. The Letters Patent also granted the two companies a shared monopoly on the public performance of legitimate drama in London; this monopoly was challenged in the 18th century by new venues and by a certain <b>slipperiness</b> in the definition of [...] "legitimate drama," [...] but remained legally in place until 1843. The new playhouse, architect unknown, opened on 7 May 1663 and was known from the placement of the entrance as the [...] "Theatre Royal in Bridges Street." [...] It went by other names as well, including the [...] "King's Playhouse." [...] The building was a three-tiered wooden structure, [...] long and [...] wide; it could hold an audience of 700. Set well back from the broader streets, the theatre was accessed by narrow passages between surrounding buildings.|$|E

2500|$|According to Patrick Macias, an English {{editor of}} the manga, the film was [...] "kind of ignored" [...] at Cannes because of {{competition}} from other high-profile Japanese films. According to a review in Asia Pacific Arts, during the sequence when the father returns to Hiroshima, the film shows [...] "an interaction" [...] of the past, present, and future, which is indicative of [...] "the <b>slipperiness</b> of memory", a technique that [...] "makes more visible and effective the ongoing resonance {{of the past in}} the present" [...] but that [...] "rejects the politics of the bombing" [...] of {{the first part of the}} film. Kumiko Aso won several acting awards in Japan for her role as Minami Hirano.|$|E
2500|$|In The Two Towers, Frodo and Sam confronted Gollum in the Emyn Muil; Gollum nearly strangled Sam, but Frodo subdued {{him with}} his Elvish sword, Sting, which had once belonged to Bilbo. Frodo tied an Elvish rope around Gollum's ankle as a leash, but the mere touch of the rope pained him. Taking pity on the wretched creature, just as Bilbo once had, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore by the [...] "precious" [...] itself, and Frodo {{released}} him. The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, {{made their way to}} the Black Gate, the main entrance to Mordor. Frodo's kindness brought out Gollum's better nature, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. Sam, however, despised Gollum upon sight, and often warned Frodo of the creature's deception and <b>slipperiness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|RDF {{is being}} used to have a better {{understanding}} of road traffic patterns.

This would imply that the best solution would incorporate both fuzzy logic and ontology.|$|E

60|$|There {{had been}} rain, and that spasmodic walk of his was {{enhanced}} by the extreme <b>slipperiness</b> of the footpath.

60|$|When Adam saw Mimi slip, {{he flung}} himself backward, still holding her.

They were all pale except the old diplomatist, who looked both calm and cool. It sustained and cheered Adam and his wife to see him thus master of himself. Both managed to follow his example, to the wonderment of the footmen, who saw the three who had just escaped a terrible danger walking together gaily, as, under the guiding pressure of Sir Nathaniel's hand, they turned to re- enter the house.|$|E
60|$|The {{struggle}} was a desperate one. Served by their higher position, {{and by the}} difficulties which the French encountered from the <b>slipperiness</b> of the ground and their own fierce ardour to attack, Walter and his little band {{for a long time}} resisted every effort. He with his sword and Ralph with his heavy mace did great execution, and they were nobly seconded by their men-at-arms. As fast as one fell another took his place. The breach in front of them was cumbered with dead and red with blood. Still the French poured upwards in a wave, and the sheer weight of their numbers and the fatigue caused by the tremendous exertions the defenders were making began to tell. Step by step the English were driven back, and Walter saw that the defence could not much longer be continued. He bade one of his men-at-arms at once order the archers to cease firing, and, leaving the walls, to take refuge in the keep, and thence to open fire upon the French as they poured through the breach.|$|E
60|$|Then out of {{the gutter}} they clambered and hurried across a wide flat space damp with thawing snow, and for half its extent dimly {{translucent}} to lights that went to and fro underneath. He hesitated at this unstable looking substance, but his guide ran on unheeding, and so they came to and clambered up slippery steps to the rim of a great dome of glass. Round this they went. Far below {{a number of people}} seemed to be dancing, and music filtered through the dome.... Graham fancied he heard a shouting through the snowstorm, and his guide hurried him on with a new spurt of haste. They clambered panting to a space of huge windmills, one so vast that only the lower edge of its vanes came rushing into sight and rushed up again and was lost in the night and the snow. They hurried for a time through the colossal metallic tracery of its supports, and came at last above a place of moving platforms like the place into which Graham had looked from the balcony. They crawled across the sloping transparency that covered this street of platforms, crawling on hands and knees because of the <b>slipperiness</b> of the snowfall.|$|E
60|$|Probably {{the best}} known of all fishes' eggs, however (with the solitary {{exception}} of the sturgeon's, commonly observed between brown bread and butter, under the name of caviare), are the queer leathery purse-shaped ova of the sharks, rays, skates, and dog-fishes. Everybody has picked them up on the seashore, where children know them as devil's purses and devil's wheelbarrows. Most of these queer eggs are oblong and quadrangular, with the four corners produced into a sort of handles or streamers, often ending in long tendrils, and useful for attaching them to corallines or seaweeds on the bed of the ocean. But it is worth noticing that in colour the egg-cases closely resemble the common wrack to which they are oftenest fastened; and as they wave {{up and down in the}} water with the dark mass around them, they must be almost indistinguishable from the wrack itself by the keenest-sighted of their enemies. This protective resemblance, coupled with the toughness and <b>slipperiness</b> of their leathery envelope or egg-shell, renders them almost perfectly secure from all evil-minded intruders. As a consequence, the dog-fish lay but very few eggs each season, and those few, large and well provided with nutriment for their spotted offspring. It is these purses, and those of the thornback and the edible skate, that we oftenest pick up on the English coast. The larger oceanic sharks are mostly viviparous.|$|E
60|$|Without a reply Bray {{walked off}} with the pail, {{stopping}} only in the underbrush to pluck a few soft fronds of fern, part of which he put within the crown of his hat, and stuck the rest in its band around the outer brim, making a parasol-like shade above his shoulders. Thus equipped he passed through the outer fringe of pines to a rocky trail which began to descend towards the stage road. Here {{he was in the}} full glare of the sun and its reflection from the heated rocks, which scorched his feet and pricked his bent face into a rash. The descent was steep and necessarily slow from the <b>slipperiness</b> of the desiccated pine needles that had fallen from above. Nor were his troubles over when, a few rods further, he came upon the stage road, which here swept in a sharp curve round the flank of the mountain, its red dust, ground by heavy wagons and pack-trains into a fine powder, was nevertheless so heavy with some metallic substance that it scarcely lifted with the foot, and he was obliged to literally wade through it. Yet there were two hundred yards of this road to be passed before he could reach that point of its bank where a narrow and precipitous trail dropped diagonally from it, to creep along the mountain side to the spring he was seeking.|$|E
60|$|The old figure made no answer; {{nor could}} Redclyffe be {{quite sure that}} his voice had any effect upon it, though he fancied that it was shaken a little, as if his voice came to it from afar. But it {{continued}} to gaze at him, {{or at least to}} have its aged face turned towards him in the dim light; and this strange composure, and unapproachableness, were very frightful. As his manhood gathered about his heart, however, the American endeavored to shake off this besetting fear, or awe, or whatever it was; and to bring himself to a sense of waking things,--to burst through the mist and delusive shows that bewildered him, and catch hold of a reality. He stamped upon the floor; it was solid stone, the pavement, or oak so old and stanch that it resembled it. There was one firm thing, therefore. But the contrast between this and the <b>slipperiness,</b> the unaccountableness, of the rest of his position, made him the more sensible of the latter. He made a step towards the old figure; another; another. He was face to face with him, within a yard of distance. He saw the faint movement of the old man's breath; he sought, through the twilight of the room, some glimmer of perception in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|So to my tale. There {{was a great}} frost when my Lord bade {{me follow}} him to the water gate near our lodgings in the Strand. When we reached it we were amazed {{to see that the}} Thames was frozen over and many {{citizens}} disporting themselves on the ice--the like of which no man had seen before. There were fires built thereon, and many ships and barges were stuck hard and fast, and my Lord thought it vastly pretty that the people were walking under their bows and cabbin windows and climbing of their sides like mermen, but I, being a plain, blunt man, had no joy in such idlenesse, deeming it better that in these times of pith and enterprise they should be more seemly employed. My Lord, because of one or two misadventures by reason of the <b>slipperiness</b> of the ice, was fain to go by London Bridge, which we did; my Lord as suited his humor ruffling the staid citizens as he passed or peering under the hoods of their wives and daughters--as became a young gallant of the time. I, being a plain, blunt man, assisted in no such folly, but contented myself, when they complayned to me, with damning their souls for greasy interfering varlets. For I shall now make no scruple in declaring that my Lord was the most noble Earl of Southampton, being withheld from so saying before through very plainness and bluntness, desiring as a simple yeoman to make no boast of serving a man of so high quality.|$|E
50|$|Public works {{agencies}} spend {{a sizeable}} {{portion of their}} budget measuring and reducing road <b>slipperiness.</b> Even a small increase in <b>slipperiness</b> of a section of road can increase the accident rate of the section of road tenfold. Maintenance activities affecting <b>slipperiness</b> include drainage repair, snow removal and street sweeping. More intensive measures may include grinding or milling a surface that has worn smooth, a surface treatment such as a chipseal, or overlaying a new layer of asphalt.|$|E

5000|$|Road <b>slipperiness</b> can {{contribute}} to car accidents. In 1997, over 53,000 accidents were caused by slippery roads in the United Kingdom out of an estimated 4,000,000 accidents (or approximately 1.3 per cent) [...] A small change in road <b>slipperiness</b> can have a drastic effect on surface friction: decreasing the coefficient of friction from 0.45 to 0.35, equivalent to adding a dusting of wet snow, increased the accident rate by almost 1000%. As such, road agencies {{have a number of}} approaches to decreasing road <b>slipperiness.</b> Most roads are designed with a convex camber to provide sufficient drainage, thereby allowing surface water to drain out of the road. Trouble sections include entrances and exits of banked outercurves, where the cross slope is close to zero. Unless these sections have a longitudinal grade of at least 0.4-0.5%, the drainage gradient (resultant to crossfall and longitudinal grade) will be lower than 0.5% so water will not run off the road surface. Storm drains may be installed at regular intervals and modern paving materials are designed to provide high friction in most conditions. Permeable paving allows water to soak through the paving material, reducing <b>slipperiness</b> in very adverse conditions.|$|E
50|$|Road <b>slipperiness</b> can be {{prevented}} or delayed by proper pavement design. The aggregate used in the pavement should be selected with care, as certain aggregates such as dolomite may polish, or wear smooth under the action of tires. With asphalt pavements and surface treatments, using too much asphalt or asphalt emulsion can cause bleeding or flushing, a condition where excess asphalt rises {{to the top and}} fills in the road texture. Both problems increase <b>slipperiness,</b> especially when the pavement is wet.|$|E
