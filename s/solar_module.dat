5|$|The solar PV {{market has}} been growing {{for the past few}} years. According to solar PV {{research}} company, PVinsights, worldwide shipment of solar modules in 2011 was around 25 GW, and the shipment year over year growth was around 40%. The top 5 <b>solar</b> <b>module</b> players in 2011 in turns are Suntech, First Solar, Yingli, Trina, and Sungen. The top 5 <b>solar</b> <b>module</b> companies possessed 51.3% market share of solar modules, according to PVinsights' market intelligence report.|$|E
25|$|Adjusting for inflation, it cost $96 per watt for a <b>solar</b> <b>module</b> in the mid-1970s. Process {{improvements}} {{and a very}} large boost in production have brought that figure down 99%, to 68¢ per watt in 2016, {{according to data from}} Bloomberg New Energy Finance.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{cars are}} often fitted with gauges and/or {{wireless}} telemetry, to carefully monitor the car's energy consumption, solar energy capture and other parameters. Wireless telemetry is typically preferred as it frees {{the driver to}} concentrate on driving, which can be dangerous in such a small, lightweight car. The Solar Electric Vehicle system was designed and engineered as an easy to install (2 to 3 hours) integrated accessory system with a custom molded low profile <b>solar</b> <b>module,</b> supplemental battery pack and a proven charge controlling system.|$|E

25|$|Design considerations: Even though {{sunlight}} has no lifespan, PV cells do. The {{lifetime of}} a <b>solar</b> <b>module</b> is approximately 30 years. Standard photovoltaics often {{come with a}} warranty of 90% (from nominal power) after 10 years and 80% after 25 years. Mobile applications are unlikely to require lifetimes as long as building integrated PV and solar parks. Current PV panels are mostly designed for stationary installations. However, {{to be successful in}} mobile applications, PV panels need to be designed to withstand vibrations. Also, solar panels, especially those incorporating glass, have significant weight. In order for its addition to be of value, a solar panel must provide energy equivalent to or greater than the energy consumed to propel its weight.|$|E
