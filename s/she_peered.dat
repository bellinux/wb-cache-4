60|$|But Fanny {{seemed to}} be shocked at my levity. <b>She</b> <b>peered</b> anxiously into the clear night-glooms around us.|$|E
60|$|She too felt {{wide awake}} and {{unconscious}} of fatigue; {{when she reached}} the secluded path beside the river, <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> eagerly up and down, and listened for a sound.|$|E
6000|$|SIMONE. Has that horrid little American girl gone? (<b>She</b> <b>peers</b> down, then, reassured, she blows a kiss to PAUL.) My Romeo! ...|$|R
6000|$|ZOE: Mount of the moon. You'll {{meet with}} a... (<b>She</b> <b>peers</b> {{at his hands}} abruptly) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or {{do you want to}} know? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She came of {{the highest}} landed gentry, yet she was not noble; she was gracious and pure and charitable, of a blameless life and character, insomuch that in these regards was <b>she</b> <b>peer</b> of the best lady in the land." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>peered</b> {{down into}} {{his face as he}} spoke, but made no reply, and he {{conceived}} of her as one burdened with grief and shame and ready for any fate.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't know you, sir;" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> at him, {{trying to}} see {{his face in the}} darkness, for the copse was thick, and {{twilight}} had come on rapidly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, golly!" [...] cried Beatrice, {{coming to}} his side. He {{crouched}} before the oven, <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> over his shoulder. [...] "This is what comes of the oblivion of love, my boy." ...|$|E
50|$|Kang Joon-mo {{worked as}} a stuntman, but due to injury had to quit his job. He comes to Dukchun {{to work as a}} {{temporary}} teacher. Joon-mo meets Bok-hee for the first time when <b>she</b> <b>peers</b> through the window of a classroom in which he's teaching. Joon-mo sees the passion in Bok-hee's eyes and becomes her mentor.|$|R
6000|$|The {{figure of}} CHLOE, {{in a black}} cloak, appears outside in the [...] moonlight; <b>she</b> <b>peers</b> in, moves past, comes bank, hesitatingly [...] enters. The cloak, fallen back, reveals a white evening dress; [...] and that magpie figure stands poised watchfully in the dim [...] light, then flaps unhappily Left and Right, {{as if she could}} not [...] keep still. Suddenly she stands listening.|$|R
50|$|Beth (Lisa Diveney) - Beth is Tyler’s girlfriend {{until the}} end of the third series. She is clever, {{attractive}} and vegetarian. Over the three years she spent as Tyler’s girlfriend, she had her patience put to the test. First, Tyler showed no interest in supporting her horse racing protests, then he put meat before her, and, to top things off, <b>she</b> <b>peers</b> through the window to see Boycie completely naked, thanks to Earl, in Mother Earth.|$|R
60|$|For a time <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> down at {{the dark}} figure wading in the foam below {{as though it was}} the only thing of {{interest}} in the world. Then she turned to Sir Richmond.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the master}} of course {{was unable to find}} them, the effects of hunger {{probably}} blinding his senses. M'liss grew uneasy. At length <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> at him through the leaves in an elfish way, and questioned:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The woman reflected. This {{was surely}} young Mershone's voice. And {{she had no}} excuse to deny him admittance. Quietly she unbolted the door and allowed it to open an inch while <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> at the man outside.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of the daughter of the last Navajo chief, Chief Manuelito, ca. 1901. From the waist up. She sits outside in front of an adobe brick wall. A blanket with a stripe and diamond pattern is pulled around her shoulders and over her lap. She is wearing a dark shirt, long beaded necklaces around her neck, and bracelets on both forearms. Her head is cocked to her left as <b>she</b> <b>peers</b> straight ahead...|$|R
5000|$|Ne no koku (...) is the Hour of the Rat, about midnight. The {{two women}} in the print are {{preparing}} for bed after finishing with the night's festivities. The courtesan at the right has changed into simple nightclothes and is tightening her obi sash with both hands. In a half-rising posture <b>she</b> <b>peers</b> down at the woman to the left, {{who appears to be}} a young courtesan-in-training, is folding up the first woman's uchikake kimono with her chin and both hands.|$|R
5000|$|While {{on holiday}} Gijs tells Hemel that Sophie will {{be living in}} his house and she becomes upset. When she asks her father why he loves Sophie he tells her {{he has nothing to}} hide from her. Hemel tells him that her version of love {{involves}} knowing the same things as the other person. She later tearfully tells him she saw a man commit suicide by jumping off a building. Later on <b>she</b> <b>peers</b> over the edge of a building herself before leaving.|$|R
60|$|The man {{moved back}} a step. He was tall, gaunt, ragged. But not like Cordts! Never would she forget Cordts. <b>She</b> <b>peered</b> up at him. In {{the dim light}} of the few stars she {{recognized}} Joel Creech's father.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] {{observed}} Beth, as <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> out while the train puffed {{up the steep}} grade, [...] "as if we'd arrived {{at the heart of}} a wilderness, where farms are likely to be as scarce as Egyptian temples." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let me look,' said a {{woman with}} heavy copper rings on her wrists and ankles, and <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> at Mowgli under {{the palm of her}} hand. 'Indeed he is not. He is thinner, but he has the very look of my boy.' ...|$|E
50|$|She {{was also}} an actress and {{appeared}} in the film Funny Face. An ash blonde, she was a favorite model of photographer Richard Avedon, {{who served as a}} thinly veiled model for Fred Astaire′s character of Dick Avery in Funny Face. Avedon snapped {{one of the most famous}} photos of Harnett, in which, clad in an evening gown by Grès, <b>she</b> <b>peers</b> at a roulette wheel in a casino in Le Touquet, France. That iconic August 1954 photograph fetched $35,000 when Christie's auctioned it in October 2012.|$|R
50|$|Koenig and {{a rescue}} party barge in, collect Sandra and Carter, and quickly withdraw. Led by the shrieking cave-wife, the cavemen pursue. Consumed by blood-lust, they are easily decoyed to the mysterious ravine, where Koenig and Bergman have {{prepared}} an ambush. Knowing the answer must lie within the mist, they fire repeated near-misses at the cave-people {{to drive them}} into it. The cave-wife is the last to enter. As the vapour engulfs her, <b>she</b> <b>peers</b> at Koenig with recognition and utters her first intelligible word—John. Going round to the other side, Koenig watches as restored Alphans, led by Helena, emerge from the mist.|$|R
6000|$|She {{loved the}} [...] "little house" [...] as {{she called her}} berth, and for an hour <b>she</b> lay <b>peering</b> out at the moon. [...] "It follows us!" [...] she cried out in pleased surprise.|$|R
60|$|The {{elevator}} {{was coming}} down, fortunately, and she descended quickly {{and reached the}} street, where <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> eagerly up and down for the round, plump figure of the little millionaire. But by some strange chance he had already turned a corner and disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me look," [...] said a {{woman with}} heavy copper rings on her wrists and ankles, and <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> at Mowgli under {{the palm of her}} hand. [...] "Indeed he is not. He is thinner, but he has the very look of my boy." ...|$|E
60|$|So he {{went home}} and sat silent that evening. Now, since Thorgrimur Iron-Toe's death, his housewife, Saevuna, Eric's mother, had grown dim of sight, and, though <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> and peered again from her seat in the ingle nook, {{she could not see}} the face of her son.|$|E
6000|$|... "What does {{monsieur}} require <b>she</b> asked, <b>peering</b> forward {{through the}} gloom with some suspicion. For the eightpenny dinners were the scorn of the neighbourhood, and strangers were {{rare in the}} wine shop of Emil Sachs." ...|$|R
6000|$|Slowly, silently, now {{the moon}} [...] Walks {{the night in}} her silver shoon: [...] This way, and that, <b>she</b> <b>peers</b> and sees [...] Silver fruit upon silver trees; [...] One by one the casements catch [...] Her beams beneath the silvery thatch; [...] Couched in his kennel, like a log, [...] With paws of silver sleeps the dog [...] From their shadowy cote the white breasts peep [...] Of doves in a silver-feathered sleep; [...] A harvest mouse goes scampering by, [...] With silver claws and silver eye; [...] And moveless fish in the water gleam [...] By silver reeds in a silver stream.|$|R
60|$|Something darkened {{the parlor}} window as those words were said. A sudden chill ran through him, and he glanced sidelong at the shadow. Rebecca Murdoch had come back. <b>She</b> was <b>peering</b> in curiously at {{them over the}} low window-blind.|$|R
60|$|Breakfast finished, the skipper, who {{had been}} on deck all night, retired to his bunk. The mate went on deck and took charge, {{watching}} with great interest the movements of the passenger as <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> into the galley and hotly assailed the cook’s method of washing up.|$|E
60|$|There {{had been}} no lights or any {{symptoms}} of welcome, but as they pulled down the trunks {{the door opened and}} a little old woman appeared with a candle in her hand, which she carefully shaded from the wind while <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> out into the darkness.|$|E
60|$|The words {{make her}} look round--she had seen no black casket, but as the cats {{continued}} their cry <b>she</b> <b>peered</b> into several corners that had remained unnoticed, and at length discovered a little black box, so small and so black, that it might easily have been passed over.|$|E
50|$|Gwyn (Laia in the Japanese version) joins {{her brother}} on {{the quest to}} find {{the source of the}} {{earthquakes}} after having a nightmare. <b>She</b> can <b>peer</b> into the future through her dreams. Gwyn also inherits her mother's healing techniques and her skill with a bow.|$|R
50|$|The print {{bears the}} title Sugatami Shichinin Keshō, which {{suggests}} it was—or {{was intended to}} be—part of a seven-print series. The young woman in the print is seen from behind, her body cropped off the right edge. Her face appears reflected as <b>she</b> <b>peers</b> into a large mirror with her right hand on her hair. Both her face and {{the nape of her}} neck are visible; the nape of the neck was considered particularly sensual in Edo-period Japan. The subject does not pose like a model, but rather appears relaxed, away from the gaze of the public; Utamaro made many such candid portraits, emphasizing the beauty of the whole body—fingers, the nape of the neck, and such—rather than just the face.|$|R
5000|$|The nymph, coiffed with a vine and nude {{except for}} a thin band of cloth draped just below her hips, stands on her proper left leg and rests her folded right leg on a rock {{formation}} that reaches nearly as high as her hips. She leans far to her right, turning her torso just slightly downward. Her left arm crosses her body to stabilize and support a large urn resting horizontally on the rock, and her right elbow rests on the urn as she lightly supports her chin with her right hand. <b>She</b> <b>peers</b> downward at a small fawn standing below her in frontal alignment with the viewer. Its head and neck crane upward toward the urn, from which a small fountain of water trickles.|$|R
