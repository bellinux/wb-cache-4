5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E
5|$|Lyapunov exponents use {{logarithms}} {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E

5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E

5|$|The BTO {{analysis}} {{was able to}} determine {{the distance between the}} satellite and aircraft with a relatively high degree of accuracy, while the BFO {{analysis was}} able to estimate the heading and speed of the aircraft, but is sensitive to <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> in input data. To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} organization into județe of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia (where {{they were}} termed ținuturi) {{dates back to}} at least the late 14th century. For {{most of the time}} since modern Romania was formed in 1859, the administrative division system has been similar to the French departments one. The system has been changed several times since then, and the number of counties has varied over time, from the 71 județe that existed before World War II to only 39 after 1968. The current format has largely been in place since 1968 as only <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> have been made since then, the last of which was in 1997.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{first in}} a series of case files, this article {{introduces}} the <b>Small</b> <b>Change</b> approach to community development and analyses the Making of Stirchley Park (MoSP) initiative. In 2011 – 2012, the arts led community interest company, Place Prospectors CIC, undertook an arts programme in the south Birmingham neighbourhood of Stirchley in the United Kingdom, one of which was the MoSP, using small-scale artistic interventions to spark long-term improvements in the neighbourhood’s underused public park. The project is an example of the <b>Small</b> <b>Change</b> approach pioneered by the UK development practitioner and academic Prof. Hamdi (2004). The work contributes to the <b>Small</b> <b>Change</b> Forum, a UK research and practice initiative created by community arts organization, Multistory, and the Centre for Development and Emergency Practice (CENDEP) based at Oxford Brookes University, to investigate <b>small</b> <b>change</b> initiatives worldwide (for more information visit: www. facebook. com/SmallChangeForum) ...|$|R
5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> in patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts {{of individuals with}} AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E
5|$|Variations in the toolkit {{may have}} {{produced}} {{a large part of}} the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways. A toolkit gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin's large ground-finch was enlarged by the BMP gene, or when snakes lost their legs as distal-less became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form their limbs. Or, a toolkit gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, distal-less, which controls such diverse structures as the mandible in vertebrates, legs and antennae in the fruit fly, and eyespot pattern in butterfly wings. Given that <b>small</b> <b>changes</b> in toolbox genes can cause significant changes in body structures, they have often enabled the same function convergently or in parallel. distal-less generates wing patterns in the butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene, which are Müllerian mimics. In so-called facilitated variation, their wing patterns arose in different evolutionary events, but are controlled by the same genes. Developmental changes can contribute directly to speciation.|$|E

To prepare for his role as Michael, Luke gained 25 pounds and studied Rockstar's previous games, starting with Grand Theft Auto IV. He considered Michael's characterisation to be an amalgamation of Hugh Beaumont's portrayal of Ward Cleaver in the American sitcom Leave It to Beaver (1957–63) and Al Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana in the 1983 film Scarface.|$|E
