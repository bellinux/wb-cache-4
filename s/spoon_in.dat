5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a <b>spoon</b> <b>in</b> it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E

Between 1952 and 1961, they finished last eight times and won only 35 of 180 matches. In 1962, Parramatta made the finals for the first time; this achievement was repeated for the three following seasons. However, the club slid back down the ladder in the following years, collecting the wooden <b>spoon</b> <b>in</b> 1970 and 1972.

They did not fare well in 2001 or 2002 either, finishing second-last in both seasons; the time spent at the bottom allowed St Kilda to recruit players such as Justin Koschitzke, Nick Riewoldt, Nick Dal Santo and Brendon Goddard, who were mainstays of the team over the following decade. The 2003 season saw a much improved Saints outfit, finishing 11th at the season's end. They scored a notable five-point victory over the eventual three-time premiers Brisbane in Round 11.|$|E

25|$|With the {{competition}} set to expand, Richmond {{made a number}} of misguided moves in 1986. To fill the vacancy left by Richardson, Richmond wooed high-flying West Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond to become president. Bond came with an agenda {{to raise money for the}} club by listing on the stockmarket and relocating to Brisbane. When the latter plan was revealed in the media, a furious reaction from supporters and high-profile club personalities buried the proposal almost immediately. Early in 1987, Bond's tenure at the club ended in farce when he resigned without presiding over a single game. The off-field confusion was reflected in the players' performance as Richmond slumped to only its second wooden <b>spoon</b> <b>in</b> 70 years.|$|E
25|$|After World War II Essex fell off, {{taking their}} first wooden <b>spoon</b> <b>in</b> 1950. During this period {{it was left}} to Trevor Bailey to do all the pace bowling, and he was often {{unavailable}} due to Test calls, whilst spinner Peter Smith was frequently overbowled until he retired in 1951 – thus a strong batting line-up led by Bailey and Doug Insole could seldom win games. Not until 1957 did Essex come back into {{the top half of the}} table, but Bailey and Barry Knight never had support of sufficient class to permit them to reach the top of the table, even when Robin Hobbs became England's last successful leg-spinner late in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war era, despite {{an influx of}} excellent new players, Richmond struggled to make the four, appearing in the finals only once, in 1947.

Under a succession of coaches in the 1950s, With the demands of potential players increasing with each passing year, the club refused to allocate sufficient funds to recruit and they failed to replace star players as they retired.

A letter from her to Thomas Wriothesley on 3 January 1538 advises of Mary's illness ('My Lady's Grace has been sick ever since Christmas'). Even after she was discharged from that position, Lady Kingston's continuing relationship with the King's elder daughter is attested to by gifts from her listed in Mary Tudor's privy purse accounts, including gifts of £4 in May 1540 and a gold <b>spoon</b> <b>in</b> January 1544.|$|E
25|$|Lee's {{new start}} was {{initially}} impeded by a broken leg, suffered while playing football, {{but he soon}} established himself in the team in the 1954 season and was awarded his cap in the 1956 season. A canny right-hander, he made 1,000 runs for eight successive seasons, nudging {{the ball into the}} gaps without often dominating the bowling. He cut loose in the occasional run chase, hitting five sixes off Jim McConnon at Swansea in the 1958 season and five more at Lord's in the 1961 season. In the 1963 season, he became county captain but, with their fast bowler Les Jackson in decline, he had little ammunition to work with.

25|$|In 1948 {{they won}} only seven games, and after {{at one point}} looking like a {{surprise}} minor premiership in 1953 collapsed to never win more than six in a season from 1954 to 1959.

However their finals campaign only lasted one match as they lost to Easts 16–9 in the second semi-final. In the following seasons, they slipped back down the ladder quickly: after beating Easts on 6 July 1963 they did not win again until 25 July 1964. However, the emergence of skillful fullback Les Johns gave them hope, and despite finishing third last in 1966, the next year they made the Grand Final.|$|E
