40|$|AbstractThe paper {{considers}} the flow and heat transfer in coolant flows cooling the fuel rod bundles of nuclear reactors with modified cell-type <b>spacer</b> <b>grids.</b> The <b>spacer</b> <b>grids</b> {{were developed by}} JSC Mashinostroitelny Zavod, Elektrostal, and differ from standard grids in the inclination of the corrugations that contact the fuel cladding outer surface. The coolant flow inside such cells leads to tangential components of the velocity vector formed inside the flow with an orientation {{in accordance with the}} corrugation inclination direction. By arranging geometrically different or identical cells within the grid array, it is possible to generate different secondary flows in the rod bundles downstream of the grid. The paper considers <b>spacer</b> <b>grids</b> that generate two types of secondary coolant flows: around the fuel rods and between the rod rows. The investigation was based on computational fluid dynamics methods with the calculation results validated against aerodynamic test data. Mechanisms of the secondary flow formation downstream of the grids have been described, and the intensities thereof have been quantitatively estimated. Data is presented on the grid flow resistance coefficients at different Reynolds numbers both in conditions of a weakly compressed isothermal air flow and with parameters representative of the VVER- 1000 reactor primary coolants. Intensification of the coolant mixing downstream of the <b>spacer</b> <b>grids</b> was analyzed by a thermal wake method for different boundary conditions.

An experimental study using 6 x 6 and 2 x 2 square lattice rod bundles has been performed to investigate the effects of spacer grids on the heat transfer enhancement during a bottom-reflood phase. The spacer grids improve a turbulent mixing of flow and induces breakup of large droplets into smaller ones. These result in the heat transfer enhancement between the fuel rods and the surrounding fluid. Since the geometry of the <b>spacer</b> <b>grid</b> affects the turbulent mixing and droplet breakup behaviors, three types of spacer grids with different geometry were tested in the present study. In order to investigate the heat transfer enhancement by spacer grids, single-phase steam cooling and droplet breakup by <b>spacer</b> <b>grid</b> were separately investigated. For the convective heat transfer enhancement in singlephase steam flow, the heater rod surface temperatures were measured {{in the vicinity of}} the space grid. In single-phase steam cooling experiment, the heat transfer was enhanced at upstream and downstream of spacer grids. Downstream of the spacer, the heat transfer enhancement decays with the distance from the top end of the <b>spacer</b> <b>grid</b> exponentially. The heat transfer enhancement depends on the Reynolds number as well as the flow blockage ratio. A new empirical correlation was developed in order to account for the effect of the Reynolds number. For the droplet breakup experiment, the sizes and velocities of droplets were measured across the <b>spacer</b> <b>grid.</b> The droplet breakup ratio decreases with increasing the Weber number of the droplet impacting on the <b>spacer</b> <b>grid.</b> The droplet breakup ratio by spacer grids was relatively higher than conventional correlations. dc 201...|$|E

The DCAF is designed to have both internally and externally cooled channels by adopting annular pellet and dual claddings. The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute proposed the DCAF assembly for the Korean optimum power reactor (OPR 1000) which is a 12 x 12 square rod bundle with a rod pitch-to-diameter ratio (P/D) of 1. 08. The pressure loss across the <b>spacer</b> <b>grid</b> specially designed for the 12 x 12 rod bundle is required {{in order to determine the}} inner to outer cooling channel flow split.

One of the limiting factors is the complicated geometry of a <b>spacer</b> <b>grid.</b> It {{leads to the}} computational mesh with high number of cells and with possibility of decreasing quality. Therefore an approach to simulate the flow as precisely as possible and simultaneously in a reasonable computational expense has to be chosen. The goal of the following CFD analysis is to obtain the detailed velocity field in a precise geometry of a chosen part of the TVSA-T fuel assembly. This kind of simulation provides data for comparison {{that can be applied}} in many situations, for instance, for comparison with simulations when a porous media boundary condition is applied as a replacement of the <b>spacer</b> <b>grid.</b> TVSA-T fuel assembly is equipped with combined spacer grids. Combined <b>spacer</b> <b>grid</b> has two functions - support of the fuel pins as a part of assembly skeleton and mixing vanes which ensures coolant mixing. The support part is geometrically very complicated and it is impossible to prepare a good quality computational mesh there.

GTRF problems ac-count for over 70 % of fuel failures of PWR worldwide. Due to its complex dependence on factors such as geometry design of the <b>spacer</b> <b>grid,</b> creep deformation, gap formation and coolant flow, the root mechanism of the GTRF problems is still not well understood. The purpose of this dissertation is to provide a fundamental understanding of how the wear initiates from the con-tact edges and propagates over the entire contact interface, as well as how the key factors such as gap size and excitation frequency affect the wear growth. The geometry design of the <b>spacer</b> <b>grid</b> is a critical factor determining the GTRF wear. Understanding the contact mechanics in the onset of partial-slip and the propagation of wear scar is the basis for geometry optimization. A new wear modeling method in which the geometry is updated by assigning fictitious eigenstrains to a set of surface elements is developed. It is shown that the sensitivity of slip to the geometrical details of a corner is resolved when a finite interfacial shear strength is incorporated with a Coulomb friction law. The wear scar will propagate continuously to the entire contact interface when either an interfacial shear strength or a yielding strength is introduced. As creep plays a similar role as wear in stress relaxation and gap formation, an algorithm is developed to couple wear and creep. The dependence of wear growth rate on the gap and excitation frequency has been also systematically analyzed. It is found that the fuel rod may have three types of vibrational responses: subharmonic, period doubling and chaotic. It is found that there is a critical excitation frequency that leads to the maximum wear growth rate. A concept of system natural frequency is introduced.

40|$|To enhance fuel {{safety and}} to achieve a power uprating, a new concept PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor) fuel, which is called a dual cooled fuel rod, has been studied since 2007. Although there are some {{challenging}} problems about each mechanical component, fuel rod supporting structures are especially dealt within this paper. In the dual-cooled annular fuel rod, an inner flow passage {{as well as an}} outer one is used not only to enhance the fuel safety but to achieve a power uprating through the decreasing fuel center temperature and increasing the heat transfer area between fuel and coolant. As a result, the diameter of dual-cooled fuel rods becomes 1. 6 times bigger than a conventional solid fuel rod and the gap between the annular fuel and the spacer grid’s straps is narrowed. This is a current key issue of fuel rod supports. To accommodate the narrowed gap, spacer grids, such as the cantilever type, hemi-sphere type, circular insertion type, etc., were suggested. For some of these configurations, patents have been applied. The grid springs in a <b>spacer</b> <b>grid</b> play the role of holding the fuel rods in an appropriate position and preventing fuel rods from dropping during normal reactor operation. In the case of the dual cooled fuel rod, the total mass is increased. So, the stiffness of a grid spring has to be increased more than that of a conventional grid spring. However, if the stiffnesses of springs are increased too much, fuel rods can bend due to the prohibition of their axial slip. So, it is necessary to design an appropriate stiffness. In this paper, the minimum spring force to prevent dual-cooled fuel rods from dropping during normal reactor operation is calculated. The spring characteristics of a cantilever type and a hemi-sphere type are predicted. A finite element analysis is carried out by using the commercial code ABAQUS. The analysis results are verified by experiments. Finally, it is checked whether the property of the suggested springs satisfies the minimum required spring force.

40|$|The fuel {{assemblies}} of the Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) are constituted of rod bundles {{arranged in}} a regular square configuration by spacer grids placed along its length. The presence of the spacer grids promote two antagonist effects on the core: a desirable increase of the local heat transfer downstream the grids and an adverse increase of the pressure drop due the constriction on the coolant flow area. Most spacer grids are designed with mixing vanes which cause a cross and swirl flow between and within the subchannels, enhancing even more the heat transfer performance in the grid vicinity.

In addition to this, the effect of <b>spacer</b> <b>grid</b> on the flow structure at different gas and liquid velocities was revealed by local parameter measurements across the spacer grids. ^ A two-group interfacial area transport equation (IATE) specific to rod bundle geometry was derived. The derivation of two-group IATE required certain assumption on the bubble shapes in the subchannels and the bubbles spanning more than a subchannel. It was found that the geometrical relationship between the volume and the area of a cap bubble distorted by rods was similar to the one derived for a confined channel under a specific geometrical transformation. ^ The one dimensional form of the interfacial area transport equation was evaluated against the one dimensional area averaged data obtained in the rod bundle. The model was evaluated for the overall development of the flow structure. The effect of <b>spacer</b> <b>grid</b> was not considered in the model evaluation scheme, in view of the observation from flow regime identification, that the flow structure developed within a short distance downstream of the <b>spacer</b> <b>grid.</b> The evaluation results showed that one-group interfacial area transport model agreed well with the experimental data. However, the two-group model prediction deviate from the experimental data. The model predicted experimental data within 30 % for flow conditions with lower liquid flow rates. The model needs further developments for it to be applicable to a wide range of flow conditions. ...|$|E
50|$|The Nuclear Fuel Factory (FCN) {{is located}} near Resende, state of Rio de Janeiro, {{comprising}} three units, {{and has a}} production capacity of 280 tons of uranium per year. At present, FCN was modernized and produces at the Components and Assembly Unit the fuel rods and fuel elements needed for Brazilian nuclear reactors. The Reconversion and Pellets Production Unit is operating since 1999 with a capacity of 160 tons of UO2 pellets/year. The UO2 reconversion line uses the AUC process. The Nuclear Fuel Factory also produces other fuel element components, such as top and bottom nozzles, <b>spacer</b> <b>grids</b> and end plugs for export demands. Previously, Brazil supplied the uranium, which is transported to Canada where it’s converted into hexafluoride gas, {{and then to the}} United Kingdom for enrichment before it returns to Brazil for fabrication into fuel elements.|$|R

Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used to model the boiling two-phase flow {{in one of the}} PSBT 5 -by- 5 rod bundle tests. The rod bundle with all the spacers was modeled explicitly using unstructured computational grids. The six-equation, two-fluid model with the wall boiling model was used to model the boiling two-phase flows in the bundle. The computed void fractions compare well with the measured data at the measuring plane. In addition to the averaged void data, the CFD results give a very detailed picture of the flow and void distributions in the bundle and how they are affected by solid structures in the flow paths such as the <b>spacer</b> <b>grids</b> and mixing vanes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{critical}} heat flux (CHF) experiments of forced convection boiling were performed to investigate the CHF characteristics of a vertical annular channel with one heated rod and four <b>spacer</b> <b>grids</b> for new refrigerant R- 134 a. The experiments were conducted under outlet pressure of 11. 6, 13, 16 and 20 bar, mass fluxes of 100 - 600 kg/m 2 s, and inlet temperatures of 25 - 40 °C. The parametric trend of the CHF data was well consistent with previous understanding in water. The comparison between the present results with effect of the flow obstacle enhancing CHF and water data in similar geometry shows R- 134 a can be a modeling fluid for simulating water CHF in high pressure and high temperature condition even for annular geometry. The direct observation of flowing bubble behaviors contributes to enhancing our understanding {{on the effect of}} flow obstacles for flow boiling heat transfer. close 3...|$|R
