The ether derivatives also showed enhanced insecticidal activity. When mosquito larvae were treated with the monoterpenoids at sublethal dosages, insect growth and development activity was observed. The enhanced biological activity of the synthetic derivatives of monoterpenoids indicates that optimal chemical structures for insecticides can be possibly elucidated through the study of structure-activity relationships...|$|R

40|$|Xenoestrogens (XEs) are {{chemicals}} {{derived from}} a variety of natural and anthropogenic sources that can interfere with endogenous estrogens by either mimicking or blocking their responses via non-genomic and/or genomic signaling mechanisms. Disruption of estrogens’ actions through the less-studied non-genomic pathway can alter such functional end points as cell proliferation, peptide hormone release, catecholamine transport, and apoptosis, among others. Studies of potentially adverse effects due to mixtures and to low doses of endocrine-disrupting chemicals have recently become more feasible, though few so far have included actions via the non-genomic pathway. Physiologic estrogens and XEs evoke non-monotonic dose responses, with different compounds having different patterns of actions dependent on concentration and time, making mixture assessments all the more challenging.

40|$|Short-term and subchronic vapor {{inhalation}} {{studies have shown}} that there are pronounced differences in the toxicological properties of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) and propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME). Overexposure to EGME has resulted in adverse effects on testes, bone marrow and lymphoid tissues in laboratory animals.

EGME is primarily oxidized to methoxyacetic acid in male rats, while PGME apparently undergoes O-demethylation to form propylene glycol. Since methoxyacetic acid has been shown to have the same <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> as EGME in male rats, the observed differences in the toxicological properties of EGME and PGME are thought to be {{due to the fact that}} the two materials are biotransformed via different routes to different types of metabolites...|$|E

Methodology: Soil samples were collected from different sites in Zaria. A total of twelve Bacillus thuringiensis strains were isolated from the different soil types. This isolates screen for the possession of cry 1, cry 2, cry 3 and cry 4 genes using Polymerase Chain Reaction. Results: Eight of the 12 isolates showed the presence {{of at least one}} cry gene, while the remaining four showed none. Cry 1 was the most frequently detected gene (58. 88 %), followed by cry 2 (16. 67 %), while cry 3 and cry 4 had the least occurrence (8. 33 %). Isolate L 3 had cry 1 and cry 2, L 2 had cry 1 and cry 3 while isolate L 1 had cry 2 and cry 4.

40|$|Interferons (IFNs) are class II cytokines {{that are}} key {{components}} of the innate immune response to virus infection. Three IFN sub-families, type I, II, and III IFNs {{have been identified in}} man, Recombinant analogues of type I IFNs, in particular IFNα 2 and IFNβ 1, have found wide application for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis and remitting relapsing multiple sclerosis respectively. Type II IFN, or IFN gamma, is used principally for the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease, while the recently discovered type III IFNs, also known as IFN lambda or IL- 28 / 29, are currently being evaluated for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis. IFNs are in general well tolerated and the most common adverse events observed with IFNα or IFNβ therapy are “flu-like” symptoms such as fever, headache, chills, and myalgia. Prolonged treatment is associated with more serious adverse events including leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, increased hepatic transaminases, and neuropsychiatric effects. Type I IFNs bind to high-affinity cell surface receptors, composed of two transmembrane polypeptides IFNAR 1 and IFNAR 2, resulting in activation of the Janus kinases Jak 1 and Tyk 2, phosphorylation and activation of the latent cytoplasmic signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT 1) and STAT 2, formation of a transcription complex together with IRF 9, and activation of a specific set of genes that encode the effector molecules responsible for mediating the biological activities of type I IFNs. Systemic administration of type I IFN results in activation of IFN receptors present on essentially all types of nucleated cells, including neurons and hematopoietic stem cells, in addition to target cells. This may well explain the wide <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> IFN associated <b>toxicities.</b> Recent reports suggest that certain polymorphisms in type I IFN signaling molecules are associated with IFN-induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C. IFNγ binds to a cell-surface receptor composed of two transmembrane polypeptides IFGR 1 and IFGR 2 resulting in activation of the Janus kinases Jak 1 and Jak 2, phosphorylation of STAT 1, formation of STAT 1 homodimers, and activation of a specific set of genes that encode the effector molecules responsible for mediating its biological activity. In common with type I IFNs, IFNγ receptors are ubiquitous and a number of the genes activated by IFNγ are also activated by type I IFNs that may well account for a <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicities</b> similar to that associated with type I IFNs including “flu-like” symptoms, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased hepatic transaminases. Although type III IFNs share the major components of the signal transduction pathway and activate a similar set of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) as type I IFNs, distribution of the IFNλ receptor is restricted to certain cell types suggesting that IFNλ therapy may be associated with a reduced <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicities</b> relative to type I or type II IFNs. Repeated administration of recombinant IFNs can cause in a break in immune tolerance to self-antigens in some patients resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies (NABs) to the recombinant protein homologue. Appearance of NABs is associated with reduced pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and a reduced clinical response. The lack of cross-neutralization of IFNβ by anti-IFNα NABs and vice versa, undoubtedly accounts for the apparent lack <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> associated with the presence of anti-IFN NABs with the exception of relatively mild infusion/injection reactions...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of fungal endophytes {{of the genus}} Epichloë in grasses results {{in the production of}} different groups of alkaloids, whose mechanism and biological <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> can differ considerably. Ergot alkaloids, when present in endophyte-infected tall fescue, are responsible for “fescue toxicosis” in livestock, whereas indole-diterpene alkaloids, when present in endophyte-infected ryegrass, are responsible for “ryegrass staggers”. In contrast, peramine and loline alkaloids are deterrent and/or toxic to insects. Other toxic effects in livestock associated with the consumption of endophyte-infected grass that contain ergot alkaloids include the “sleepy grass” and “drunken horse grass” diseases. Although ergovaline is the main ergopeptine alkaloid produced in endophyte-infected tall fescue and is recognized as responsible for fescue toxicosis, a number of questions still exist concerning the profile of alkaloid production in tall fescue and the worldwide distribution of tall fescue toxicosis. The purpose of this review is to present ergot alkaloids produced in endophyte-infected grass, the factors of variation of their level in plants, and the diseases observed in the mammalian species as relate to the profiles of alkaloid production. In the final section, interactions between ergot alkaloids and drug-metabolizing enzymes are presented as mechanisms that could contribute to toxicity...|$|E

Reproductive and developmental toxicity has been observed in all experimental animals tested. Immunotoxic effects occur in mice, rats, and nonhuman primates exposed to low doses of TCDD (7).

Intraperitoneal cisplatin seems to offer some clinical benefit when compared to systemic cisplatin in patients with minimal residual disease after initial surgery. An overview on the role of anthracyclines using data from the Advanced Ovarian Cancer Trialists Group and the Ovarian Cancer Meta-Analysis Project suggested that the addition of doxorubicin significantly improves survival and that the size of this benefit is of a similar magnitude to that of platinum.

40|$|Excess {{serotonin}} in {{the central}} nervous system leads to a condition commonly referred to as the serotonin syndrome, but better described as a <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> - serotonin toxicity. Serotonin toxicity is characterised by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, diaphoresis, tremor, flushing) and changed mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). Serotonin toxicity can be: mild (serotonergic features {{that may or may not}} concern the patient); moderate (toxicity which causes significant distress and deserves treatment, but is not life-threatening); or severe (a medical emergency characterised by rapid onset of severe hyperthermia, muscle rigidity and multiple organ failure). Diagnosis of serotonin toxicity is often made on the basis of the presence of at least three of Sternbach's 10 clinical features. However, these features have very low specificity. The Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria use a smaller, more specific set of clinical features for diagnosis, including clonus, which has been found to be more specific to serotonin toxicity. There are several drug mechanisms that cause excess serotonin, but severe serotonin toxicity only occurs with combinations of drugs acting at different sites, most commonly including a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Less severe toxicity occurs with other combinations, overdoses and even single-drug therapy in susceptible individuals. Treatment should focus on cessation of the serotonergic medication and supportive care, Some antiserotonergic agents have been used in clinical practice, but the preferred agent, dose and indications are not well defined...|$|E

Three epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines (SKOV 3, 420, 429) were exposed to cis-platinum, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide, 5 -fluorouracil, bleomycin, 4 -epidoxorubicin, 4 -HC (activated cyclophosphamide), vincristine, actinomycin D, mitomycin C, and topotecan. Cells were pretreated with either 0 or 1. 2 mM amifostine. Tumor cell kill after 6 days of incubation was measured using the ATP cell viability assay. Paired samples Student's t statistic was used to test the difference in mean ATP levels between drug-treated samples with and without pretreatment with amifostine. Results. SKOV 3 was sensitive to paclitaxel, actinomycin D, 4 -epidoxorubicin, and vincristine. Cell line 420 was sensitive to paclitaxel, etoposide, and 5 -fluorouracil. Cell line 429 was sensitive to paclitaxel and 5 -fluorouracil. There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean ATP levels between drug-treated samples with and without pretreatment with amifostine for each of the sensitive drugs in all three cell lines. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the mean ATP levels in cis-platinum and 4 -HC treated samples with and without pretreatment with amifostine. Conclusions. These results show that at the cellular level amifostine did not protect epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells against tumor cell kill. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{mycotoxin}} ochratoxin A (OTA), an ubiquitous contaminant of {{food products}} endowed {{with a wide}} <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity,</b> affects several functions of mononuclear leukocytes. Monocytes/macrophages {{play a major role}} in fibrin accumulation associated with immune-inflammatory processes through the production of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI- 2). We studied the effect of OTA on TF and PAI- 2 production by human blood mononuclear cells (MNC). The cells were incubated for 3 or 18 h at 37 degrees C with non toxic OTA concentrations in the absence and in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other inflammatory agents. TF activity was measured by a one-stage clotting test. Antigen assays were performed by specific ELISAs in cell extracts or conditioned media and specific mRNAs were assessed by RT-PCR. OTA had no direct effect on TF and PAI- 2 production by MNC. However, OTA caused a dose-dependent reduction in LPS-induced TF (activity, antigen and mRNA) and PAI- 2 (antigen and mRNA) production with > 85 % inhibition at 1 mu g/ml. Similar results were obtained when monocyte-enriched preparations were used instead of MNC. TF production was also impaired by OTA (1 mu g/ml) when MNC were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (98 % inhibition), IL- 1 beta (83 %) or TNF-alpha (62 %). The inhibition of TF and PAI- 2 induction might represent a hitherto unrecognized mechanism whereby OTA exerts immunosuppressant activity. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A new gravel-contact assay using rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, embryos was {{developed}} to assess the toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other hydrophobic compounds. Environmentally realistic exposure conditions were mimicked with a direct exposure of eyed rainbow trout embryos incubated onto chemical-spiked gravels until hatching at 10 °C. Several endpoints were recorded including survival, hatching delay, hatching success, biometry, developmental abnormalities, and DNA damage (comet and micronucleus assays). This bioassay was firstly tested with two model PAHs, fluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene. Then, the method was applied to compare the toxicity of three PAH complex mixtures characterized by different PAH compositions: a pyrolytic extract from a PAH-contaminated sediment (Seine estuary, France) and two petrogenic extracts from Arabian Light and Erika oils, at two environmental concentrations, 3 and 10 μg g− 1 sum of PAHs. The degree and <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> were different according to the extract considered. Acute effects including embryo mortality and decreased hatching success were observed only for Erika oil extract. Arabian Light and pyrolytic extracts induced mainly sublethal effects including reduced larvae size and hemorrhages. Arabian Light and Erika extracts both induced repairable DNA damage as revealed by the comet assay versus the micronucleus assay. The concentration and proportion of methylphenanthrenes and methylanthracenes appeared to drive the toxicity of the three PAH fractions tested, featuring a toxic gradient as follows: pyrolytic[*]<[*]Arabian Light[*]<[*]Erika. The minimal concentration causing developmental defects was as low as 0. 7 μg g− 1 sum of PAHs, indicating the high sensitivity of the assay and validating its use for toxicity assessment of particle-bound pollutants...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian {{target of}} rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-I), {{everolimus}} and sirolimus, are immunosuppressive drugs extensively used in renal transplantation. Their main {{mechanism of action}} is the inhibition of cell signaling through the PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR pathway. This interesting mechanism of action confers to these medications both great immunosuppressive potential and important anti-neoplastic properties. Although the clinical utility of this drug category, as with other antineoplastic/immunosuppressants, is clear, the use of mTOR-I commonly results {{in the development of}} several complications. In particular, these agents may determine severe renal toxicity that, as recent studies report, seems clearly correlated to dose and duration of drug use. The mTOR-I-induced renal allograft <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> includes the enhanced incidence of delayed graft function, nephrotoxicity in particular when co-administered with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and onset of proteinuria. The latter effect appears highly frequent in patients undergoing mTOR-I treatment and significantly associated with a rapid graft lost. The damage leading to this complication interests both the glomerular and tubular area. mTOR-I cause an inhibition of proliferation in podocytes and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tubular cells. Interestingly, all these side effects are mostly reversible and dose related. Therefore, it is unquestionable that these particular drugs should be administered at the lowest dose able to maintain relatively low trough levels, in order to maximize their important and specific therapeutic effects while minimizing or avoiding drug toxicities. Utilization of low dosages of mTOR-I should be encouraged not only in CNI-combined schemas, but also when administered alone in a CNI-free immunosuppressive protocol...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to {{mixtures}} of polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, and the potential health effects of these exposures are uncertain. A subset of this class of compounds produce similar <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> in experimental animals as does 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and these chemicals have been classified as "dioxins. " In this study, we compared the body burdens of dioxins that produce effects in experimental animals to body burdens associated with these effects in humans. Human body burdens were estimated from lipid-adjusted serum concentrations of dioxins, assuming dioxins are equally distributed in body fat and an adult has 22 % body fat. The toxic equivalency factor (TEF) method was used to calculate body burdens of dioxins in humans. These calculations included dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and polychlorinated biphenyls. In the general population, average background concentrations were estimated at 58 ng TCDD equivalents (TEQ) /kg serum lipid, corresponding to a body burden of 13 ng TEQ/kg body weight. Populations with known exposure to dioxins have body burdens of 96 - 7, 000 ng TEQ/kg body weight. For effects that have been clearly associated with dioxins, such as chloracne and induction of CYP 1 A 1, humans and animals respond at similar body burdens. Induction of cancer in animals occurs at body burdens of 944 - 137, 000 ng TCDD/kg body weight, while noncancer effects in animals occur at body burdens of 10 - 12, 500 ng/kg. Available human data suggest that some individuals may respond to dioxin exposures with cancer and noncancer effects at body burdens within one to two orders of magnitude {{of those in the}} general population...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> ocular <b>toxicity</b> {{following}} accidental inoculation of latex of Calotropis procera (Sodom apple) in 29 eyes between January 2003 and December 2006. All patients presented with sudden painless {{dimness of vision}} with photophobia. Twenty-five (86 %) patients had initial visual acuity of less than 20 / 60. All eyes had conjunctival congestion and mild to severe corneal edema with Descemet's folds. Three (10 %) eyes had an epithelial defect, nine (31 %) had iridocyclitis, and seven (24 %) had associated secondary glaucoma. After treatment with topical corticosteroids, antiglaucoma agents, cycloplegics, hypertonic saline and tears supplements, 27 (93 %) eyes recovered completely within 3 – 14 days. After three months, 17 (74 %) out of 23 eyes showed a significant low endothelial cell count compared to the normal fellow eye (P < 0. 001) ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{checkpoint}} inhibitor drugs {{have been approved}} by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in specific types of cancers. While the results are promising, severe immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAEs) have been reported. To conduct a systematic review of case reports describing the occurrence of irAEs in patients with cancer following checkpoint blockade therapy, primarily to identify potentially unrecognized or unusual clinical findings and toxicity. We searched Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed ePubs, and Cochrane CENTRAL with no restriction through August 2015. Studies reporting cases of cancer develop irAEs following treatment with anti CTLA- 4 (ipilimumab) or anti PD- 1 (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) antibodies were included. We extracted data on patient characteristics, irAEs characteristics, how irAEs were managed, and their outcomes. 191 publications met inclusion criteria, reporting on 251 cases. Most patients had metastatic melanoma (95. 6 %), and the majority were treated with ipilimumab (93. 2 %). Autoimmune colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and cutaneous irAEs were the most frequently reported irAEs in ipilimumab treated patients. A broad <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicities</b> were reported for almost every body system. Moreover, well-defined diseases such as sarcoidosis, polyarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica/arteritis, lupus, celiac disease, dermatomyositis, and Vogt-Koyanagi-like syndrome were reported. The most frequent irAEs reported with anti-PD 1 agents were dermatitis for pembrolizumab, and thyroid disease and pneumonitis for nivolumab. Complete resolution of adverse events occurred in most cases. However, persistent irAEs and death were reported, mainly in patients treated with ipilimumab. Our study is limited by information available in the original reports. Evidence from case reports shows that cancer patients develop irAEs following checkpoint blockade therapy, and can occasionally develop clearly defined autoimmune systemic diseases. While discontinuation of therapy and/or treatment can result in resolution of irAEs, long-term sequelae and death have been reported...|$|R
