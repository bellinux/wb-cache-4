This measure originated with Richard, who, in truth, was much disposed to have the institution designated a university, or at least a college. Meeting after meeting was held, for this purpose, year after year.

40|$|Scandals are perplexing social phenomena, {{ubiquitous}} and salient but {{unpredictable and}} inconsistent. They are often {{perceived to be}} the distracting froth of the public domain but they can also be grave affairs with indelible consequences. In Anglophone scholarship, ongoing interest in the study of scandals emerged in the aftermath of Watergate and has since grown {{in the wake of the}} Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. Yet despite the upsurge of interest, a perception persists that the nature of the phenomenon is poorly understood and that a general definition remains elusive. Contrary to such perceptions, a niche literature concerning the nature of scandals has emerged with findings that are of significant use for scholars seeking to study scandals in diverse social domains. To date however, this corpus has not been subjected to a systematic review, the accounts of its leading contributors have not been comparatively analysed, and their findings have not been summarised. In this thesis therefore, I examine this literature, analyse the leading accounts of scandal therein and undertake the task of producing a more general definition and model of scandal for use in social science research. Beginning with the subject matter and methods of the research area hitherto known as Scandology, I find that the field has advanced beyond its original purview and that, today, it ought to be known as Scandal Studies. Herein, I identify John B. Thompon and Ari Adut as the area’s two leading theorists and conduct in-depth analyses of their accounts. I find their respective works to be robust, albeit flawed, and in need of supplementation via the research of fellow contributors Rodney Tiffen and Robert Entman. Hereby, I integrate these four accounts and develop a more general theory of scandal. The result is a refined theory of Thompson’s category of mediated scandals which I define as mediated episodes of conditioned public moral conflict concerning contaminating and provoking transgressions wherein reputations are at <b>stake.</b> <b>Supporting</b> this definition, I present a register of key concepts useful to the study of scandals as well as a model that accounts for how mediated scandals are activated and perpetuated...|$|R
