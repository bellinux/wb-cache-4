500|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of the rapidly urbanizing United States of the 1910s and 1920s, one house from the artificial grid of modern, planned America takes flight in the dream of a woman who has feasted on Welsh rarebit. [...] The Flying House is rendered in meticulous realistic detail. [...] The house is conventional in every respect—until the viewer reaches the attic, where the woman's husband is seen tending an enormous engine. [...] He attaches a propeller to a shaft out front of the house, and tells his wife that his actions are in reaction to their landlord's intention to evict them over nonpayment. [...] He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>plans</b> to [...] "steal the house", and the couple fly away to find a place where their landlord will never find them—a swamp, the ocean, even the moon, where they are chased off by the Man in the Moon with a flyswatter. [...] The film self-consciously directs the viewers to notice the quality and accuracy of the animation when the house takes off into space, calling attention to the [...] "remarkable piece of animation which follows", accurately showing the revolutions of the Earth and Moon and the [...] "beautiful constellation of Orion". [...] The woman becomes anxious that they will become [...] "lost in the sky". [...] In the end, the house is struck by a military rocket, bringing the nightmare to an end as the woman awakens in her bed.|$|E
