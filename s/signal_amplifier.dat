25|$|After {{several months}} of press publicity, leaflet drops, public {{meetings}} etc., captions started appearing on analogue broadcasts from the affected transmitters, warning viewers that the analogue service would shortly be switched off {{and that they would}} need to take action (for Whitehaven, the first large area to switch over, the captions started appearing some 5 months before the BBC Two analogue service was switched off). At about the same time, details of the Switchover Help Scheme were distributed. Although viewers who live outside existing Freeview reception areas were unable to test any digital receiving equipment they had bought at this early stage, test-screens on Ceefax (BBC One & Two) and Teletext (ITV & C4/S4C) page 284 made it possible to determine whether they were likely to need a new aerial or a <b>signal</b> <b>amplifier</b> to receive digital transmissions.|$|E

50|$|Signal {{reception}} is invariably done via a superheterodyne receiver: {{the first}} stage is a tuner which selects a television channel and frequency-shifts it to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF).

50|$|A Driven Right Leg Circuit or DRL circuit is an {{electric}} circuit {{that is often}} added to biological <b>signal</b> <b>amplifiers</b> to reduce Common-mode interference. Biological <b>signal</b> <b>amplifiers</b> such as ECG (Electrocardiogram) EEG (Electroencephalogram) or EMG circuits measure very small electrical signals emitted by the body, often as small as several micro-volts (millionths of a volt). Unfortunately, the patient's body can also act as an antenna which picks up electromagnetic interference, especially 50/60 Hz noise from electrical power lines. This interference can obscure the biological signals, making them very hard to measure. Right Leg Driver circuitry is used to eliminate interference noise by actively canceling the interference.|$|R

Its design specifications called for linear gain along a wide bandwidth (approximately 4 MHz) with low transconductance (13 Millimhos (Millisiemens)) and high sensitivity. This combination of sensitivity, bandwidth and price lead to its popularity in audio amplification systems during the tube era.|$|E
50|$|A {{cellular}} repeater (also {{known as}} cell phone signal booster or amplifier) {{is a type}} of bi-directional amplifier used to improve cell phone reception and address coverage issues. Both indoor and outdoor cellular repeater deployments are possible, but a majority of deployments occur inside buildings where coverage is weakened by attenuation from building materials. A typical repeater system consists of a donor antenna that receives and transmits signal from nearby cell towers, coaxial cables, a <b>signal</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and an indoor rebroadcast antenna.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} stages of the reaction, only a minor amount of the {{catalyst}} is activated. As the reaction proceeds, more acetate is generated, which leads to the formation of more activated complex and progressively faster catalysis. This type of behavior is typical for cascade-type reactions including PCR. Unlike the previous example in which the catalyst produced a <b>signal</b> <b>amplifier,</b> this catalyst is a target amplifier making more copies of the target acetate. Following the reaction by gas chromatography, one observes that the generation of products follows a sigmoidal curve, indicative of a PCR-like cascade reaction system.|$|E

This instrument, commonly known as electroencephalograph, has been of the utmost importance regarding studies on the functioning of cerebral activity during the awakened state of an individual, the sleeping state, emotional states, and during physiological and psychological disturbances. The recorded data, electroencephalogram, are permanent memories of a distinct period of cerebral activity.|$|E

This interaction is measured by the biotransducer which outputs a measurable signal proportional to the presence of the target analyte in the sample.

5000|$|All {{models will}} include a <b>signal</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Even the cheaper home-use models (typically band selective) now provide 20 dB - 50 dB gain {{and many of the}} more {{expensive}} models provide over 50 dB. Excellent high-power models (used for by commercial operators) offer a gain of around 100 dBm (Interference cancellation equipment function is an improvement of the radio isolation between donor and service antenna). However, since decibels are logarithmic a 30 dB gain represents a one thousandfold signal power increase - meaning the total amplification of a repeater with greater than around 50 dB is likely to be useless without a good, well aligned antenna. This is due to the difficulty of filtering the correct signal out from the background noise, which will be amplified equally, and the limiting maximum signal power of the amplifier (for picorepeaters typically from around 5 dBm (3.2 mW)). Standard GSM channel selective repeaters (operated by telecommunication operators for coverage of large areas and big buildings) have output power around 2 W, high power repeaters (e.g., NodeG from Andrew) have output power around 10 W. The power gain is calculated by the following equation: ...|$|E
5000|$|Snarl {{made his}} first {{official}} appearance in the 2006 IDW Beast Wars:The Gathering [...] comic, where it was revealed he was a Maximal protoform from the Axalon. Originally his protoform was recovered by Magmatron's Predacons and infected with a Predacon shell program. Unbeknownst to Magmatron, his technical expert Razorbeast was a Maximal double-agent who modifies the program so {{a significant number of}} those infected emerged as Maximals. After activation B'Boom, Bonecrusher, Optimus Minor, Ramulus, Snarl and Wolfang join Razorbeast. Snarl seemingly serves as the Maximals' technical support, saving Optimus Minor from Drill Bit. Snarl observes Magmatron going after Megatron after hijacking one of the Ark's surveillance drones. He is later tasked by Razorbeast to build a Transwarp <b>signal</b> <b>amplifier</b> from parts scavenged from Ravage's cruiser and the Ark - but at this point the Predacons, led by a resurrected Ravage, attack. Snarl orders the others to buy him time for the signal to succeed. The intervention of other Maximals led by Torca saves them, but Snarl is unsure whether their signal had reached Cybertron before the amplifier burnt out. Snarl and the other Maximals then settle in for the long haul on Earth.|$|E
