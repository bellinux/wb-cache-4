25|$|The Red Devils' {{next game}} was against Arsenal the {{following}} Sunday, in a <b>six-pointer</b> that would either rule Arsenal {{out of the}} title race or bring them right back into it. A United win would put them six points ahead of their nearest league rivals, Chelsea, and nine ahead of Arsenal, and with Chelsea playing the following day, a win was essential {{to put pressure on}} the Blues. Arsenal started the match well, and looked to take the game to United through sheer brute force, attacking with pace and power. Indeed, they created the best chances of the half, United's best opportunity falling to Wayne Rooney, who refused to go down under the challenge of Kolo Touré, before seeing his shot saved by the foot of Jens Lehmann in a one-on-one situation. The first half finished goalless, but it was not long into the second half before the crowd saw the first goal of the game. It was a controversial goal, however, as it seemed that Emmanuel Adebayor had played Cesc Fàbregas' cross into the net with his left arm. Nevertheless, referee Howard Webb gave the goal, seeing nothing wrong with it. Just five minutes later, though, United hit back. Michael Carrick played the ball into the Arsenal penalty area, where it was handled by William Gallas, and the referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty. As expected, Cristiano Ronaldo took responsibility for the penalty, and coolly swept it into {{the left side of the}} net. However, he was made to take the kick again as Park Ji-sung was deemed to be encroaching on the penalty area before the kick. Fortunately, Ronaldo was just as successful with his second attempt, burying the ball in the bottom left-hand corner. In an attempt to force the issue by going for the winner, Alex Ferguson brought on Carlos Tevez and Anderson in place of Park and Scholes. The Reds were cutting it fine, as Van der Sar was forced to make two reflex saves from his own defenders, Wes Brown and Rio Ferdinand. Tevez then sent a warning shot across the Arsenal bow, shooting narrowly wide from 25yards. Then, with 20 minutes to go, Patrice Evra was brought down just outside the Arsenal box. With the Arsenal defence expecting a typical Ronaldo free-kick, they were caught off guard when Owen Hargreaves played an immaculate free-kick over the wall, dipping into the bottom left corner of the goal, leaving Lehmann rooted to his goal line. United continued to press, not giving Arsenal an inch, and though Van der Sar was called on to save a header from Nicklas Bendtner, the Red Devils managed to hold onto their lead and extend their lead at the top of the table. Chelsea, now the only team with a realistic chance of stopping United winning the title failed to reduce the lead to three points the following day, only managing a 1–1 draw at home to Wigan Athletic. They followed this up with a 1–0 win over Everton the following Thursday, reducing the lead to two points with just three games remaining, although United now had a game in hand.|$|E

Rovers only required a draw in their final league match, at home to Mansfield, but were defeated 1 – 0 while both Wycombe and Northampton Town won their own final matches. It meant that Rovers' 94 year consecutive stay in the Football League was over, finishing behind Wycombe only on goal difference.|$|E
50|$|The mid-eighties saw Derry's biggest rivalry {{coming in}} the form of Dublin's St. Patrick's Athletic - a side which {{contained}} former Republic of Ireland international and Middlesbrough defender, Curtis Fleming, TV3 pundit Paul Osam and ex Derry manager, Pat Fenlon. In recent years, Dublin's Shelbourne FC were seen as top-of-the-table rivals with games between the two often being crucial to the ultimate winning of the league. In turn, these games were often very exciting <b>six-pointers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{highlight}} {{of his career}} thus far came on 28 April 2007 in a crucial League Two <b>six-pointer</b> with Macclesfield Town. Procter scored two goals in a 3-2 victory which secured Stanley's Football League status in their first season back after promotion from the Conference.|$|E

5000|$|... "Six-pointer" [...] is a {{sporting}} cliché, particularly used in association football, {{used to describe}} a game between two teams with similar league positions, in leagues that employ a [...] "three points for a win" [...] system. In a [...] "two points for a win" [...] league, the corresponding term is [...] "four-pointer". In a <b>six-pointer</b> game, the result is particularly crucial since the winning team denies three points to the close rival in addition to securing three points for itself.|$|E
50|$|On 28 May 2011 Garry Haylock {{resigned}} {{as the first}} team manager of Hayes & Yeading United, and on 16 June 2011 Nas Bashir was appointed the new manager. In the 2011-2012 season, whilst playing at Kingfield, consistently poor league form meant that the club was relegated back into the Conference South, despite beating the odds to win a relegation <b>six-pointer</b> at Lincoln City, registering a 21st-place finish. They failed to repeat the previous season's FA Cup success, falling in the Fourth Qualifying Round, whilst {{for the third consecutive}} season they were eliminated in the First Round of the FA Trophy.|$|E
50|$|Martins scored six {{goals in}} 12 league games {{during the first}} half of the 2008-09 season before a torn {{hamstring}} ruled him out for several games. It was confirmed on 7 January 2009, that Martins would undergo hernia surgery in Germany the next Monday. He was operated on by renowned specialist Dr. Ulrike Muschaweck. He did make it back in time for the last two games of the season, scoring in a relegation <b>six-pointer</b> derby against Middlesbrough. However, he could not stop Newcastle being relegated to the Championship. He initially reiterated his desire to stay and help the club return to the Premier League for the 2009-10 season, but he eventually left for VfL Wolfsburg. His last game was in a preseason friendly against Leyton Orient, which Newcastle lost 6-1.|$|E
50|$|On 2 December, Southend United {{announced}} they had extended the loan of Yeovil defender Jakub Sokolík until 3 January. Yeovil travelled to Accrington Stanley, {{for the first}} competitive meeting between the two clubs, in the FA Cup second round. After taking the lead through another Jordan Clarke header, a desperately poor second half from Yeovil saw them hanging on for a 1-1 draw and a replay. The 13 December saw the second meeting between Gary Johnson and his son Lee, as Yeovil travelled to Oldham Athletic. Yeovil ran out convincing 4-0 winners with goals from Stephen Arthurworrey, Simon Gillett, Sam Hoskins and Kieffer Moore. After picking up a serious knee injury whilst on loan at Southend United Sokolík had his loan spell cut short at returned to Yeovil. On 16 December, Yeovil faced Accrington at home in their FA Cup Second Round replay, and won the match 2-0 courtesy of two late goals from Simon Gillett and Kieffer Moore, {{to set up a}} third round tie at home against Manchester United. On 20 December, Yeovil's first match of the festive period saw them face Colchester United in a relegation <b>six-pointer,</b> the game was decided late on with Craig Eastmond winning it for Colchester and leapfrogging Yeovil in the table in the process. Boxing Day saw Yeovil travel to Ashton Gate to face league leaders Bristol City, despite Jed Steer saving a first-half penalty from former Glover Kieran Agard in the first half Yeovil went in behind at half time following a Matt Smith header. Yeovil fell further behind after conceding a second penalty converted by Jay Emmanuel-Thomas and despite a first goal for the club from Ben Nugent, with a 35-yard shot, Yeovil lost the game 2-1 and slipped {{to the bottom of the}} league. Yeovil ended 2014 with another <b>six-pointer</b> at home against Leyton Orient losing the game 3-0 and ending the year five points from safety.|$|E

50|$|However, Ndlovu stayed but the 11th-place finish secured {{that season}} was not {{repeated}} in the 1994-95 campaign. Phil Neal was replaced by Ron Atkinson in February. Big Ron was credited with saving the club from relegation {{in the spring of}} 1995, and brought in Gordon Strachan as his assistant. This second significant phase for Ndlovu would once again promise much - the 'new era' of big money signings heralded by Atkinson's appointment saw the arrival of Huckerby, Whelan, Salako and McAllister together with Neal's £2million signing Dion Dublin. Big Ron provided vital impetus early on, but the following season his stylish and classy team sheet rarely 'clicked' in the traditional sense. However, Ndlovu still scored some memorable goals for the Sky Blues during this period, including the first away player to secure a hat-trick at Anfield for 30 years. Other memorable goals in Sky Blue included a vital winning goal away at Wimbledon in a relegation <b>six-pointer</b> and a dynamic last minute rifling winner in a 3rd Round FA Cup tie at West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
50|$|A home tie against Notts County {{began the}} March {{fixtures}} for Colchester, {{with the game}} played on 3 March billed as another <b>six-pointer.</b> Unfortunately for the U's, they were defeated 1-0, leaving them still inside the relegation zone. Macauley Bonne's late effort was cleared off the line by Blair Adams, as Paddy McCourt's 68th minute effort {{proved to be the}} difference between the two teams. Still refusing to play under Humes, Jabo Ibehre was loaned out to League One rivals Barnsley on 6 March until the end of the season. A further defeat followed on 7 March in the U's away trip to Rochdale. Rhys Bennett began proceedings after six minutes for Rochdale, and Colchester old boy Ian Henderson scored against the club for the second time this season ten minutes after the break. Chris Porter made amends for his penalty miss against Doncaster the previous weekend by converting from the spot after another former U's player Michael Rose brought down Gavin Massey in the box on 63 minutes. The game ended 2-1 to Rochdale, leaving Colchester in 22nd position, still two points from safety.|$|E
50|$|Arterial embalming, which {{involves}} the injection of embalming chemicals {{into the blood}} vessels, usually via the right common carotid artery. Blood and interstitial fluids are displaced by this injection and, along with excess arterial solution, are expelled from the right jugular vein and collectively referred to as drainage. The embalming solution is injected with a centrifugal pump, and the embalmer massages the body to break up circulatory clots as to ensure the proper distribution of the embalming fluid. This process of raising vessels with injection and drainage from a solitary location {{is known as a}} single-point injection. In cases of poor circulation of the arterial solution, additional injection points (commonly the axillary, brachial, or femoral arteries, with the ulnar, radial, and tibial vessels if necessary) are used. The corresponding veins are commonly also raised and utilized for drainage. Cases where more than one vessel is raised are referred to as multiple-point injection, with a reference to the number of vessels raised (i.e. a six-point injection or <b>six-pointer).</b> As a general rule, the more points needing to be raised, the greater the difficulty of the case. An injection utilizing both the left and right carotids is specifically referred to as a restricted cervical injection (RCI), while draining from a different site from injection (i.e. injecting arterial fluid into the right common carotid artery and draining from the right femoral vein) is referred to as a split (or sometimes cut) injection.|$|E
50|$|Led by captain Shane Crawford, Australia {{defeated}} Ireland 65-58 in {{the first}} test at Croke Park. Ireland were the superior side {{for much of the}} first half, a flurry of overs from Darragh Ó Sé, Dessie Dolan, Joe Bergin and Ciaran McManus giving them a 21-10 point lead at quarter time. Tempers flared in the second quarter, with David Neitz of Australia sent off for a high shoulder charge on Ireland's Paul McGrane and an all-in-row soon followed, resulting in Evan Kelly of Ireland sent off for an undisciplined punch. An over by Derek Savage in the last minute of the quarter fired Ireland into a 38-19 advantage at half-time. Irish publication Hogan Stand reported that the Aussies looked rattled and the Irish were well on course for victory. The second half saw a complete reversal of fortunes, a sloppy kick out by Irish keeper Peter Burke was swooped on by Matthew Pavlich who ran in and duly slotted home low and hard to get the Australians within ten points. A golden missed opportunity for goal was missed by Padraig Joyce {{and by the end of}} the quarter Australia had closed the gap to two points, trailing 45-43. Forward dynamo Nathan Brown put Australia into the lead early in the final quarter with another classy over and it got worse for Ireland when Daniel Kerr scored another <b>six-pointer</b> after some brilliant combination play with team mates. Despite a clever high ball from Joyce resulting in a 12th-minute goal to Dessie Dolan, it was ultimately a 16th minute over from Brown of Australia which sealed the test match; the visitors winning 65-58.|$|E
50|$|On the {{football}} front, Rangers league campaign {{began with a}} defeat to newly demoted Hearts with the Edinburgh club scoring an extra minute winner. Despite embarking on a nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions, a loss at home to Hibernian left the side trailing Hearts by six-points {{at the top of}} the league by the end of September. Better news for Rangers was the reaching of the League Cup semi-final after a 1-0 win over St Johnstone, being drawn against Celtic which set up the first Old Firm derby in two years. Nevertheless, the club's title charge was effectively ended in November as the side lost a <b>six-pointer</b> match away to league leaders Hearts leaving them nine points behind. The did bounce back the following week in the Scottish Cup registering a 3-0 win over Scottish Premiership side Kilmarnock, however, in the club's third cup competition the team surrendered a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 to fellow Championship team Alloa Athletic in the Challenge Cup. Even with the poor league form and exit in the Challenge Cup, there was no indication of significant pressure on manager Ally McCoist. The effect of the club's financial issues as underlined by the interim results that November, proved the catalyst for McCoist's departure as he became unhappy with the number of staff losing their jobs at Rangers. The situation became too much for McCoist and he tendered his resignation on 12 December which was later confirmed to the London Stock Exchange by the club three days later, with McCoist beginning a 12-month notice period. However, he was to serve less than a week of his notice period before being placed on gardening leave by the board, with his assistant manager Kenny McDowall being appointed interim manager until the end of the season.|$|E
50|$|Transfer {{deadline}} day {{was quiet}} for Yeovil with only the permanent departure of Brendan Moloney to League Two side Northampton Town after {{he was released from}} his Yeovil contract. On 4 February, Gary Johnson was relieved of his duties as first-team manager, after seven years with the club over two spells, and replaced by his assistant and predecessor Terry Skiverton as acting manager. Skiverton's first match in charge was a <b>six-pointer</b> at home against Crawley Town, on 7 February, two second half goals from Gozie Ugwu and AJ Leitch-Smith saw Yeovil win 2-1 and move off the bottom of the table. The following week saw Yeovil suffer back to back away defeats, a 1-0 reverse against Crewe Alexandra, was followed by a 3-0 defeat against Doncaster Rovers which saw the club return {{to the bottom of the}} league. In response to back-to-back defeats Skiverton made four signings midfielder Craig Eastmond joined on a short-term contract until the end of the season, Swansea City players Stephen Kingsley and Josh Sheehan signed on a one-month emergency loans while defender Byron Webster returned to the club on loan from Millwall until the end of the season. In addition to this defender Liam Shephard extended his youth loan from Swansea City until the end of the season. On 21 February, Yeovil stayed bottom of the league after a 2-2 draw against Gillingham, Gozie Ugwu has given Yeovil an early lead before Gillingham fought back to lead 2-1 before Adam Morgan, on his first appearance for almost a year, scored an injury-time penalty to earn Yeovil a point. Yeovil ended the month with a trip to Scunthorpe United, Jamaican winger Joel Grant gave Yeovil the lead on his return from injury before goalkeeper Artur Krysiak suffered a head injury and being replaced by goalkeeping-coach Gareth Stewart. Who right on half time managed to save a Paddy Madden penalty to preserve the advantage, before Hakeeb Adelakun's second-half equaliser earned Scunthorpe a draw.|$|E
50|$|The {{second test}} {{was a far}} more {{competitive}} affair, a brilliant lightning quick first quarter being punctuated with a pre-game brawl and a canine intrusion on the pitch, much to the comic relief of the spectators. Journalists noted how the Australian physicality returned with some more vigorous tackling {{for much of the}} game and it appeared to pay dividends. Despite captain Hird and Ireland's Joe Bergin being sent off as part of the pre-match/early-match fighting, the Australians skipped away to 9-0 lead mid-way through the quarter thanks to some sharp shooting from forward targets Brown and Riewoldt. Ireland though absorbed the Australian pressure and eventually got their running game going, and a frenetic opening quarter finished with some classy scores to Cavanagh and Kennelly. Locked at 12-12 with three quarters to play, the Australians upped the ante in the second quarter, Brown not missing an opportunity up forward and Luke Ball being very unlucky not to score a major <b>six-pointer</b> to stretch the Aussie lead. At half time it was the Australians leading 26-23. The third quarter proved to be the Achilles heel for Australia, early third quarter overs to Joyce and Coulter giving the homesters the lead {{for the first time in}} the match. Austinn Jones and Dolan traded overs, yet a crucial goal mid-way through the quarter by arguably Ireland's best player - Padraig Joyce - gave Ireland an insurmountable 44-35 lead with one quarter to play. Brown continued playing out of his skin in the fourth quarter, notching his seventh over at the halfway mark and being cruelly denied a goal by a decisive Irish block in the dying moments, yet he was the only bright spot in a disappointing tour for Australia. For Ireland, the likes of Alan Brogan and Eoin Brosnan scored overs to push out the lead into double figures and the final two minutes were played out with little resistance from the visitors, leaving captain Joyce to lift the Cormac McAnallen Cup with a 55-41 test match win, an aggregate score of 132-82. Stephen Cluxton's solid performance in goal earned him the medal for Irish player of the series, whilst the majestic Nathan Brown of Australia deservedly won the Jim Stynes Medal.|$|E
50|$|Needing {{to reverse}} a 10-point deficit {{to win a}} fourth series since its {{resumption}} in 1998, all looked rosy for Ireland {{early on in the}} second test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the visitors storming to a 22−4 point quarter time lead. The bulk of the work in the first quarter was done by the likes of Steven McDonnell and Brian McDonald, the former scoring both an over and a goal and the latter netting Ireland's second <b>six-pointer</b> soccer-style after a delicious Benny Coulter cross to the 14-metre goal square. The Australians required decisive action in the second quarter and it was Brent Harvey and Rohan Smith who provided with terrific overs inside the opening seven minutes of the quarter. In tricky conditions and in a low-scoring contest, Ireland's Padraig Joyce scored an over from a free to leave the visitors looking the goods at 30−15 with two quarters to play. A crucial off the ball foul on Harvey was spotted by the umpire early in the third quarter, which resulted in a successful penalty goal for the North Melbourne midfielder. Now ahead on aggregate, the Australians though reverted to sloppy disposal and the Irish responded with another Joyce over and some dominant midfield and scoring play from Steven McDonnell; Irish GAA publication Hogan Stand writing the Armagh ace popped everywhere and his workrate and ability to make marks throughout the third quarter was crucial in keeping Ireland on top. Trailing 44−27 with a quarter to play and down by 7 on aggregate, the Australians superior fitness levels came to the fore at the pivotal moment. Barry Hall, who had been rarely sighted for the first three quarters, could not be kept quiet all night and was a central figure in the final quarter comeback, kicking the first over for the term and running roughshod over the tiring Irish defence. McDonnell soon replied to a David Wirrpanda over for Ireland, yet it was Nathan Brown who showed his leadership and class by notching three crucial overs for Australia, his first coming in the 12th minute from an acutely angled sideline free before his fisted effort (15th) and opportunist strike (17th) conspired to cut Ireland’s lead to just three points, 47 to 44. This proved to be the decisive blow for Ireland, who in the closing stages could only manage a behind to keep Australia at bay and take a consolation test victory by 48 points to 45. The result left Australia to celebrate a 101−94 point aggregate victory, the home side claiming their first ever series victory on home soil. Brent Harvey was awarded the Jim Stynes Medal for Australia.|$|E

50|$|Villa began 2013 with a 2-2 draw against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. Wayne Routledge {{gave the}} Swans an early lead, before an Andreas Weimann strike on {{the stroke of}} half-time brought Villa level. Villa looked to have {{snatched}} a vital win, when they earned an 84th-minute penalty (their first in almost a year) which was converted by Christian Benteke. However, a stoppage time equaliser from Danny Graham made sure the points were shared. The club gained their first win of the new year, as they beat Ipswich Town 2-1 in the FA Cup on 5 January. Villa had to come from behind however, as Michael Chopra's deflected shot gave Ipswich a half time lead. Darren Bent equalised immediately after the break with a goal against his former club and Andreas Weimann booked Villa's place in the fourth round with an 83rd-minute winner. Villa were then drawn to face Millwall at The Den in the fourth round of the FA Cup to be played on 25 January. The first leg of the League Cup semi-final against Bradford City was next for Villa three days later. The match did not go the way Villa would have thought, wanted or hoped for though as they lost 1-3 to the Bantams at Valley Parade. Bradford took the lead early {{in the first half}} as Nahki Wells beat the offside trap to finish neatly past Shay Given after a deflected shot. Matt Duke made a series of inspired saves throughout both halves keeping Villa at bay, before Rory McArdle put Bradford 2-0 up in the 77th minute. Villa pulled a goal back five minutes later through Andreas Weimann, but Bradford regained their two-goal advantage when Carl McHugh fired a header past Given to give Bradford a shock victory and leave Villa with all the work to do in the second leg to reach the final. Villa's League Cup hangover continued as they were beaten 0-1 by fellow strugglers Southampton in a must win <b>six-pointer.</b> Rickie Lambert converted a highly controversial penalty won by Jay Rodriguez, who looked to have gone done with no contact under the challenge of Enda Stevens. This result meant Southampton leapfrogged Villa, who dropped back into the relegation places {{for the first time since}} November. The team then competed in a local derby against West Bromwich Albion, where they threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2. Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor gave Villa a half time lead but Chris Brunt pulled a goal back immediately after the break for the Baggies. They continued to attack, controlling the game, and eventually Peter Odemwingie equalised meaning the points were shared. Villa's misery then continued, as the team was knocked out of the League Cup by fourth-tier Bradford City. After losing 1-3 in the first leg, Villa had to win by two clear goals to take the tie to extra-time. However, they could only manage a 2-1 victory (3-4 on aggregate) and exited the competition as a result. Yet more gloom and doom followed as the team were knocked out of a second cup in four days. after losing 1-2 against Millwall in the FA Cup. Darren Bent gave Villa the lead but Danny Shittu equalised five minutes later for the hosts, with Villa conceding from yet another corner. Just as a replay looked on the cards, John Marquis grabbed the winner for the Championship outfit, to send them through and pile even more pressure onto the extremely fragile Villa team and manager Paul Lambert. Villa's awful January was compounded in their last game of the month, against Newcastle United. Newcastle raced into a 2-0 half time lead after goals from Papiss Cissé and Yohan Cabaye but Christian Benteke pulled a goal back for Villa early in the second half from the penalty spot. However, it was not enough as the Toon held on for the win, despite a major Villa fightback. This result was Villa's fourth home defeat in a row.|$|E
5000|$|The {{opening of}} the January {{transfer}} window, saw Yeovil sign West Bromwich Albion forward Tahvon Campbell on a one-month loan deal, while captain Darren Ward signed a contract extension until June 2017. Yeovil started the new year with a relegation <b>six-pointer</b> at home against third from bottom York City. A first-half penalty from Matthew Dolan earned Yeovil a first league win in seventeen matches. After the match manager Darren Way continued to reshape his squad with Tottenham defender Christian Maghoma returning to Spurs having not made an appearance during his loan spells, while Swansea City midfielder Josh Sheehan's loan spell was cut short.Right back Connor Roberts extended his loan {{until the end of}} the season having been an ever-present in the side until that point, while Way signed young Everton midfielder Liam Walsh on a one-month loan deal.

The winners of the replay were given a potential televised home match against Premier League side Everton in the FA Cup fourth round. On 16 January, Yeovil faced Morecambe. Yeovil had an early chance to take the lead but midfielder Matthew Dolan saw an eighth-minute penalty saved by keeper Barry Roche, despite the miss the Glovers took the lead through captain Darren Ward's first goal for the club, but the lead only lasted five minutes as Yeovil lost the match 2-1. Yeovil's next match saw them face Carlisle United in their third round replay, a match deemed to be worth over £200,000 to the winner. Yeovil took the lead in the first half through Jack Compton's first goal of the club before Antony Sweeney headed in a late equaliser. Following that equaliser a brawl broke out between the two sets of players but despite Carlisle striker Jabo Ibehre [...] "clotheslining" [...] Yeovil keeper Artur Krysiak, the striker escaped with just a yellow card. With the game deep into injury time in the second half Yeovil earned a penalty but striker François Zoko missed to send the game into extra time, the 30 minutes of extra time saw no further goals but two red cards with defender Alex Lacey receiving a red card for a studs-up tackle while Carlisle's Luke Joyce was dismissed for a second bookable offence. The game finished 1-1 after extra time and went to a penalty shoot-out, after eight successful kicks Matthew Dolan saw his penalty saved, for the second match in a row, to allow Mark Ellis to score to send Carlisle through to play Everton in the fourth round. After the game, the club confirmed that Ivorian striker Zoko had signed a new contract {{until the end of the}} season. On 23 January, Yeovil faced Crawley Town and thanks to goals from substitutes Tahvon Campbell and Ryan Bird won 2-1 to record their second consecutive home victory. The following week, striker Mark Beck departed the club on loan to National League side Wrexham until the end of the season, Bournemouth winger Harry Cornick having recovered from his injury rejoined the club on an initial one-month loan deal and West Brom loanee Tahvon Campbell extended his loan until 3 March. Yeovil ended the month with a trip to AFC Wimbledon and despite falling behind twice in the first half a hat-trick from winger Jack Compton earned Yeovil a 3-2 victory. The hat-trick was the first by a Yeovil player since Shaun MacDonald in March 2011, while the game also featured the return of Simon Gillett after more than year out through injury.
