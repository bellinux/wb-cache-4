Iliadis also spent several weeks with the actors in rehearsal. It was Iliadis's hope that space to rehearse their roles, and then time during filming to develop their characters individually, would help them to trust Iliadis as the director more.|$|E
25|$|Durova's {{youthful}} appearance {{hurt her}} chances for promotion. In {{an era when}} Russian officers were expected to grow a mustache <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a boy of sixteen. She transferred away from the hussars to the Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment {{in order to avoid}} the colonel's daughter who had fallen in love with her. Durova saw action again during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. She fought in the Battle of Smolensk. During the Battle of Borodino a cannonball wounded her in the leg, yet she continued serving full duty for several days afterward until her command ordered her away to recuperate. She retired from the army in 1816 with the rank of stabs-rotmistr, the equivalent of captain-lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|Investigators and the {{prosecution}} suggested during pre-trial motions that Muhammad intended to kill his second ex-wife Mildred, who had estranged him from his children. According to this theory, the other shootings were intended {{to cover up the}} motive for the crime, since Muhammad believed that the police would not focus on an estranged ex-husband as a suspect if <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a random victim of a serial killer. Muhammad frequented the neighborhood where she lived during the attacks, and some of the incidents occurred nearby. Additionally, he had earlier made threats against her. Mildred herself made the claim that she was his intended target. However, Judge LeRoy Millette, Jr. prevented prosecutors from presenting that theory during the trial, saying that a link had not been firmly established.|$|E

25|$|The film {{features}} two {{allusions to}} Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on {{the back wall of}} the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember what <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the episode}} [...] "Hairography" [...] in which Rachel is badly made-over by Kurt, Mike Hale of The New York Times noted a popular theme amongst critics for {{negatively}} highlighting the way Glee treats its female characters.

However, he wrote that [...] "it was a bit much when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic." [...] Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh has deemed Rachel's high point on the show romancing of Finn and Puck, commenting: [...] "when we saw Rachel fall for them, she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A, uber-talented, self-involved know-it-all who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships." ...|$|E

McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener."

500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Willa Paskin of New York magazine praised Perry's {{looks in the}} video as [...] "detailed, outlandish, [...] semi-gorgeous rainbow-kabuki". Kara Warner from MTV News also praised her appearance in the video, calling her an [...] "angelic alien princess". She also felt the video was Perry's [...] "most complex, stylized and out-there video production yet". Joseph Brannigan Lynch of Entertainment Weekly felt that West's rap verses helped the song top the Billboard Hot 100, and called the video an [...] "awesomely bizarre sci-fi video, which impressively resists any obvious Spielberg references". Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone described the video as [...] "a sequel to Avatar or a Katy Perry video game", and felt the song and video were [...] "a bold move away from Perry's usual silliness and sexuality". Los Angeles Times described the video as a [...] "sweeping visual manifestation". In a more negative review, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine criticized Perry, saying <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> an [...] "animated video-game character", while saying West was a [...] "non-presence". Cinquemani later went on to say: [...] "It's a step up from bras that shoot whipped cream and fireworks, but this is ultimately Sigimondi's vision, and it's far from her finest five minutes."

500|$|... d. [...] Lucas {{described}} {{the scene on}} Redoutable: In less {{than half an hour}} our ship had been so fearfully mauled that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> little more than a heap of debris. Judging by appearances, no doubt, the Temeraire, now hailed us to surrender and not prolong a useless resistance. My reply was instantly to order some soldiers who were near me to fire back; which they did with great alacrity. At the same moment almost, the main mast of the Redoutable fell on board the English ship. The two topmasts of the Temeraire then came down, falling on board of us. Our whole poop was stove in, helm rudder and stern post all shattered to splinters, all the stern frame, and the decks shot through. All our own guns were either smashed or dismounted by the broadsides of the Victory and the Temeraire...The hull itself was riddled, shot through from side to side; deck beams were shattered, port lids torn away or knocked to pieces. Four of our six pumps were so damaged as to be useless. The quarter-deck ladders were broken, which rendered communication {{with the rest of the}} ship very difficult. Everywhere the decks were strewn with dead men, lying beneath the debris. Out of a crew of 634 men we had 522 hors de combat; of whom 300 were killed and 222 wounded nearly all the officers among them... The batteries and upper decks were practically abandoned – bare of men and were unable longer to offer any resistance. No one who had not seen the state of Redoutable could ever form an idea of her awful condition. Really I know of nothing on board that had not been hit by shot.|$|E
500|$|Abi was {{introduced}} into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006. She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E
500|$|According to {{producer}} Don Hahn, Beaumont's Belle is an [...] "incredibly passive" [...] character, {{the personality}} of whom he likened to those of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, as well as American actress and animal rights activist Doris Day, describing them as women who are [...] "capable, but filling a role that women might fill in the 1950s and 1960s.” The filmmakers painstakingly reworked Belle into a more three-dimensional character by providing her with goals and aspirations beyond romance and marriage, while expanding her passive role into that of a more inquisitive heroine. Determined to have Belle resemble [...] "an unusual Disney heroine," [...] Woolverton deliberately molded her into an independent character {{who is not a}} princess, enjoys books and has little interest in marriage, and worked closely with Ashman to create a proactive heroine [...] "who was a thinker and a reader and she wasn’t about what <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> and she wasn’t a victim." [...] Although Belle being well-read is mentioned in the original fairy tale, it is hardly important to its plot. Thus, Belle's passion for reading was vastly expanded upon, borrowing from both the Little Woman character Jo March and Woolverton's own love of reading to further demonstrate the character's intelligence and open mind. Both Woolverton and O'Hara encouraged the filmmakers to emphasize the intelligent and book-loving aspects of Belle's personality. However, at times the animators struggled to fulfill Woolverton's vision. Originally, Belle was depicted constantly crying throughout her imprisonment; Woolverton resented this, arguing that the character was {{much more likely to be}} either searching for an escape or simply [...] "be intrigued that she was living in an enchanted castle" [...] than crying. [...] "Once everybody realized she wasn’t going to be this typical Disney female, they would go to the extreme ... She became bitchy"; the screenwriter argued that Belle would be [...] "too smart" [...] to act this way. A few years older than The Little Mermaids Ariel, Belles' love of reading makes the character more worldly and mature than her predecessor. Belle is believed by Henn to be [...] "probably" [...] the oldest of Disney's princesses, at 20 years of age.|$|E
