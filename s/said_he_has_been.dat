25|$|Speculation on an {{upcoming}} album by Eminem was reported since mid–2007 from announcements made by artists 50 Cent and Stat Quo, {{former members of}} Shady Records. Also, rapper Bizarre– {{a member of the}} hip hop group D12– stated that the release of the group's third studio album was on hold because Interscope Records wanted to release Eminem's album first. By the end of the year, additional musicians associated with Shady Records– including The Alchemist, Bishop Lamont, Cashis and Obie Trice– had confirmed on different occasions that the rapper was effectively working on a new album. On September 12, 2007, during a call at the radio station WQHT Hot 97, Eminem stated that he was in limbo and was not sure whether he would release any new material in the near future. He then elaborated that at that point he was constantly working in the recording studio and had come to terms with his personal issues.

2500|$|Sahana is an Indian Tamil {{language}} teleserial {{produced by}} K. Balachander. It is a sequel {{of the popular}} film Sindhu Bhairavi which K. Balachander also directed and produced.

2500|$|On February 9, 2009, {{prosecutors}} filed {{a motion}} in federal court to revoke Barry's probation for not filing his 2007 tax return, which violated his probation. According to one prosecutor, Barry has not filed his taxes eight of the last nine years. Barry said the reason he did not file his taxes is because of distractions from his medical problems, although he noted that there is [...] "no excuse" [...] for not filing. In an interview, Barry <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> undergoing four-hour dialyses {{three times a week}} as treatment for a problem with his kidney. At that point, a kidney donor had been identified, but the operation had yet to be scheduled. On February 17, WTOP-FM reported that, according to Barry's attorney, Barry had filed his federal and District tax returns for 2007. The same day, Barry was admitted to Howard University Hospital to prepare for a kidney transplant the next day. Barry was released from the hospital on February 27, but he was readmitted on March 2 due to large amounts of air in his abdominal cavity and also due to Barry's complaints of serious pains, both of which were caused by the combination of medications Barry was taking after the operation. Barry was released from the hospital on March 6. On April 17, 2009, the prosecution withdrew their request to revoke Barry's probation.|$|E

60|$|Being asked, Whether he {{has reason}} to believe the sixty lacs of pagodas was all {{principal}} money really and truly advanced to the Nabob of Arcot, or a fictitious capital, made up of obligations given by him, where no money or goods were received, or which was increased by the uniting into it a greater interest than the twelve per cent expressed to be due on the capital? he said, He {{has no reason to}} believe that the sum of sixty lacs of pagodas was lent in money or goods to the Nabob, because that sum he thinks is of more value than all the money, goods, and chattels in the settlement; but he does not know in what mode or manner this debt of the Nabob's was incurred or accumulated.--Being asked, Whether it was not a general and well-grounded opinion at Madras, that a great part of this sum was accumulated by obligations, and was for services performed or to be performed for the Nabob? he said, He has heard that a part of this debt was given for the purposes mentioned in the above question, but he does not know that it was so.--Being asked, Whether it was the general opinion of the settlement? he said, He cannot say that it was the general opinion, but it was the opinion of a considerable part of the settlement.--Being asked, Whether it was the declared opinion of those that were concerned in the debt, or those that were not? he said, It was the opinion of both parties, at least such of them as he conversed with.--Being asked, Whether he {{has reason to}} believe that the interest really paid by the Nabob, upon obligations given, or money lent, did not frequently exceed twelve per cent? he said, Prior to the 1st of August, 1774, he had had reason to believe that a higher interest than twelve per cent was paid by the Nabob on moneys lent to him; but from and after that period, when the last act of Parliament took place in India, he does not know that more than twelve per cent had been paid by the Nabob, or received from him.--Being asked, Whether it is not his opinion that the Nabob has paid more than twelve per cent for money due since the 1st of August, 1774? he said, He has heard that he has, but he does not know it.--Being asked, Whether he has been told so by any considerable and weighty authority, that was like to know? he <b>said,</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> so informed by persons who he believes had a very good opportunity of knowing it.--Being asked, Whether he was ever told so by the Nabob of Arcot himself? he said, He does not recollect that the Nabob of Arcot directly told him so, but from what he said he did infer that he paid a higher interest than twelve per cent.|$|E
