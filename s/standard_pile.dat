40|$|Pile {{foundations}} are a {{frequently used}} foundation technique in Belgium. Installation coefficients for <b>standard</b> <b>pile</b> types {{are described in}} Eurocode 7 and the national annex. These installation coefficients are determined and based on empirical research. Unfortunately not every specific pile type is mentioned in Eurocode 7. This paper starts {{with a description of}} the screw pile technique with grout injection and typical specifications of the performed CPT’s and SLT’s. Test results of CPT’s and SLT’s are demonstrated and analyzed. The bearing capacity of two screw piles is calculated based on 2 CPT results according to Eurocode 7 and the national annex. The bearing capacity of the screw piles is measured through 2 SLT’s. Comparing both calculated and measured analyzes, results in a global installation coefficient. Theories of Fellenius and Chin are used to calculate the stress/strain distribution in the piles. As a result, the global installation coefficient can be divided in an installation coefficient for the pile base and the pile shaft according to Eurocode 7 and the national annex. The influence of the grout injection on the shaft resistance is demonstrated. To complete, a critical reflection on the calculated installation coefficients and different methods of analysis is done. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of a new aeration system on the biopile performance was investigated. The purpose was to increase biodegradation efficiency by optimising airflow through the pile. During a 1 -month field trial, {{the performance of a}} new system using two perforated vertical pipes with wind-driven turbines was compared with that of a <b>standard</b> <b>pile</b> configuration with two horizontal perforated pipes. Both piles were composed of a similar mix of diesel- contaminated soils, woodchips, compost and NPK fertiliser. Hydrocarbons were recovered using solvent extraction, and determined both gravimetrically and by gas chromatography. Total heterotrophs, pH and moisture content were also assessed. Air pressure measurements were made to compare the efficiency of suction in the pipes. Results {{at the end of the}} experiment showed that there was no significant difference between the two piles in the total amount of hydrocarbon biodegradation. The normalised degradation rate was, however, considerably higher in the new system than in the standard one, suggesting that the vertical venting method may have improved the efficiency of the biological reactions in the pile. The pressure measurements showed a significant improvement in the suction produced by the new aeration system. However, many factors other than the airflow (oxygen supply) may influence and limit the biodegradation rates, including moisture content, age of contaminants and the climatic conditions. Additional experiments and modelling need to be carried out to explore further the new aeration method and to develop criteria and guidelines for engineering design of optimal aeration schemes in order to achieve maximum biodegradation in biopiles...|$|E

This year saw the outbreak of the First Samnite War, and Corvus was dispatched to the warfront, where he won a bruising and bloody victory over the Samnites at the Battle of Mount Gaurus. He followed this up with another victory at the Battle of Suessula, where he crushed the remnants of the Samnite army after their defeat at Mount Gaurus. After the second victory, he had some 40,000 shields of the abandoned and killed and 170 enemy <b>standards</b> <b>piled</b> up before him on the battlefield. After these victories Corvus returned to Rome to celebrate his second triumph, reportedly the most impressive that the Romans had yet witnessed up to that time.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{establishment}} of a model factor for the calculation of the ultimate limit state (ULS) bearing capacity of piles in compression from Ménard pressuremeter tests results. First, the requirements of Eurocode 7 are presented: calculation methods used for pile foundations must be validated against the results of static load tests and a model factor can be introduced to reach a target safety. This model factor is meant {{to take into account the}} scatter of the calculation model, whereas the spatial variability of the ground properties is dealt with by means of statistical methods. Then an analysis of a database of 174 full-scale static pile load tests carried out by the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chausées (LCPC, now called IFSTTAR), over the last 40 years, mainly in France, is performed and a new calculation model is established based on pressuremeter test results. Finally, the calibration procedure for deriving the model factor used in the recent French <b>standard</b> for <b>pile</b> design following Eurocode 7 is explained using two approaches: one compares the dispersions of the former and new calculation models and the other performs statistical analysis combining the scatter of the calculation model and the spatial variability of ground properties.

They are also used to create {{foundations}} {{for a variety of}} project types, including highway, bridge and transmission tower projects.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} the estimating settlements of bored piles foundation {{on the site}} of the Elektrenai power plant, Lithuania. The bored piles foundation supports equipment of the power plant consisting of the gas turbine, the steam turbine and the generator. The piling solution was adopted for the following reasons: i) the insufficient capacity of the soil to support great stresses over it; ii) high requirements of slab settlements and bearing capacity with regard to the main equipment in power plant.). For settlement calculation five methods were employed, such as Bowles [1] and Schmertmann methods [2, 3], the method described in EN 1997 - 2 [4 – 6] and NEN 6743 [7], and finite element method applied in Plaxis 3 D Foundation package. The results obtained by applying these methods where compared with experimental results on construction site. The experiment results were acquired from static load test of one test pile and four reaction piles. Piled foundation was evaluated through immediate settlement analysis and included analysis of the soil data from cone and dynamic penetration tests, boreholes and laboratory tests. Soil properties were estimated from site investigation of the Elektrenai power plant and soil exploration program according to Lithuanian <b>standards.</b> <b>Pile</b> settlement analysis showed that settlement value was 13. 5 mm (pile toe settlement), and settlement value of elastic deformation of pile from vertical compressive loads was 2. 1 mm, for the most conservative situation. For such structure, foundation settlement should not exceed 16 mm. Because the Elektrenai power plant has high reliability requirements, piles diameter of 880 mm and 29 m long were finally carried out to endure overall loads...|$|R

40|$|Vibro-driven piles can {{potentially}} become cost-reducing alternatives to <b>standard</b> impact-driven <b>piles</b> for {{offshore wind turbine}} support structures. If these foundations are {{to be used to}} support jacket sub-structures, their bearing behaviour in tension has to be explored. In a novel geotechnical testing facility two large-scale vibro-driven piles for jacket sub-structures have been axially tested in tension. In this contribution the experimental tests are thoroughly described and the test results are presented. The applicability of standard CPT methods in predicting the tensile bearing capacity of the piles is evaluated against the experimental results. In addition, a simplified 2 D axisymmetric numerical model is adopted to interpret the initial stiffness of the pile-soil interaction. As also pointed out in previous studies the ultimate resistance of the piles turns out to be significantly smaller than the CPT method prediction. Furthermore, as expected, set-up and pre-loading effects are seen to be beneficial to the tensile bearing behaviour of the pile...|$|R

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, a {{successful}} drilling and sampling project was performed to assess the highly radioactive contaminated vadose zone adjacent to and beneath the 241 -SX- 108 Single-Shell Tank (SX- 108 SST) located at the Hanford Site in Washington State. The drilling and sampling effort was designed to retrieve contaminated samples where cesium- 137 concentrations could be at a theoretical maximum concentration of 108 pCi/g. Handling of drill cuttings at this concentration was not an option, because dose rates to workers would have been several R/hr. A special drill rig and drilling and sampling system were designed, constructed, and fully tested to advance a casing string {{at an angle to}} collect periodic samples without damaging the SX- 108 SST, generating any unnecessary wastes, or exposing workers to excessive radiation. The drilling method used was a driven closed-end casing with a removable tip. An industry <b>standard</b> diesel <b>pile</b> driver was selected to advance the casing. A removable internal drill string was designed to provide access for sampling tools and to provide additional energy to the tip of the drive casing during its advancement. The drill rig used a remote-controlled articulating mechanical arm to maneuver casing and split-spoon samplers, avoiding direct worker contact with contaminated components or samplers. A lea...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{analyze the}} {{dynamical}} {{behavior of the}} usual one dimensional sand pile model which actually describes the physical {{situation in which the}} pile is submitted to the uniform blow of a unidirectional wind. In the first step the Lagrangian formalism is investigated, showing that the stationary action principle does not select in a unique way the path which satisfies either the minimal or the maximal action principle. This drawback is solved making use of the information (Shannon) entropy which enables one to determine the unique path in which at any time step the entropy variation is minimal (adiabatic) or maximal (anti-adiabatic). A cellular automata (CA) model describing this sand pile behavior is introduced, and the consequent deterministic dynamic is compared with the entropy results, showing that also in this case there are some drawbacks. Moreover, it is shown that our CA local rule is a particular case of some <b>standard</b> CA sand <b>pile</b> models present in literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{problem of}} a beam on an elastic foundation has long been of practical interest to geotechnical engineers, because it provides a framework for computing deflections not only of foundations, but also of vertically oriented laterally loaded piles. The supporting soil can be modelled as an elastic medium, which can be calibrated to represent the stiffness of the soils adjacent to the beam (or pile). The objective {{of this paper is}} to study the influence of spatially random soil stiffness on deformations of transversely loaded homogeneous piles and beams, using a combination of finiteelement analysis, random field theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Following code validation against alternative solutions, the method investigates how the statistically defined soil stiffness (mean, standard deviation and spatial correlation length) influences the mean and <b>standard</b> deviation of <b>pile</b> or beam deflection. The goal of such an approach is to estimate the probability of deflections exceeding some design threshold. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{preliminary}} research is to study the precision of pile foundation position compared to its original predetermined location. The deviations of pile foundations (precast piles), which {{is defined as the}} lateral displacement of the pile head, were collected from as-built drawing documents that were prepared after the piling activity at each project has completed. The precision of the pile foundation position is evaluated using available Standards such as British Standard, Canadian Standard, and Indian Standard. Those three <b>standards</b> employing maximum <b>pile</b> head movement of 75 mm, except for Canadian standard that allows lateral dislocation up to 150 mm, when the measurement were taken after the entire piling activity of a project has been done. The results of 19 projects that employing pile foundations with dimension ranging from 250 mm to 600 mm, show that about 40 % pile with diameter of 600 mm and about 60 % pile with diameter 500 mm deviated lateraly less than 75 mm. While for pile with diameter ranging from 250 mm to 450 mm, between 65 % to 70 % were driven in the tolerance of 75 mm from its original design location. In other words, it can be concluded that the deviation of pile location influenced by pile dimension. The bigger the dimension of piles the smaller the percentage of piles driven in the 75 mm tolerance from its designed locatio...|$|R
2500|$|He then {{consulted}} with a distillation expert, James A. Moffett, who was operating the Camden {{branch of the}} Standard Oil Company of Parkersburg, Moffett was convinced that dye manufacturing could be profitable and invested money in Bloede & Rathbone. [...] Dye manufacturing was organized as a separate entity named the American Aniline Works. [...] The founders of the new company had little dye making experience so they read German texts on the subject. There was no money left for new equipment, {{so they had to}} rely on scrapped equipment they obtained from the <b>Standard</b> Oil junk <b>pile.</b> [...] Instead of a heavy cast iron nitrator, an old boiler shell with a capacity of 1,000 gallons (3785 Litres) was fitted with a central shaft of horizontal wrought iron paddles. [...] The valve regulating the flow of acid into the nitrator was operated by a wire several hundred feet away. The operator would periodically run close enough to the nitrator to read the thermometer and run back to safety. [...] Cooling was accomplished by running cold spring water over the top and sides of the nitrator, keeping the reaction within a range of five degrees Fahrenheit. This procedure resulted in 7,000 to 8,000 pounds (3175 – 3628kg) of nitrobenzene per batch. In 1883 he established himself in Baltimore as a chemist and manufacturer of chemical products; and decided that there was a wide field for improvement in the methods then in use in chemical factories. Applying his skills he made tremendous advances in the chemistry business, mainly in the methods of dyeing cotton fabrics; and between 1890 and 1895 he obtained 15 or 20 patents for his chemical processes, {{one of the most important}} patents being his process for the dyeing [...] "sun-fast", unfading shades.|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} {{over time in}} bearing capacity of displacement piles is often found in the field. This phenomenon is called pile set-up. The increase is predominantly caused {{by an increase in}} shaft resistance and is observed even until 1000 days after installation. In the Dutch situation, a proposed tightening of the design <b>standard</b> for <b>pile</b> foundations makes the need to understand this phenomenon relevant. It is thought that pile set-up and group effects can contribute to the bearing capacity of piles and it would be worthwhile to incorporate them into the design standards. Although there are some ideas on the mechanisms that play a role there is no quantitative model to describe this mechanism. From literature the bearing capacity seems to increase linearly with the logarithm of time, however, the results depict a large scatter. It is assumed that a lot of factors influence pile set-up. This thesis depicts the results of a study on the possibility of simulating pile set-up in sand by means of centrifuge model testing. Conditions of this type of physical models can be controlled and makes them very useful for parameter studies. This study presents relevant literature about pile set-up. The presumed mechanisms behind the phenomenon and influencing factors are discussed. Because set-up is only observed for displacement piles, installation effects are also investigated. It is believed that the governing mechanism behind pile set-up is to some extent rearrangement of sand grains. Some literature indicates that long-term set-up is already present minutes and hours after installation. This allows investigating the set-up mechanisms under controlled conditions in a centrifuge. A pilot test is performed with the geotechnical centrifuge of Deltares. Two test series are run to investigate the set-up of a single pile and a group pile until 1000 minutes after installation. Two instrumented piles are tested several times during the run. Special attention is given to the installation and the surface roughness of the piles. Two different installation methods are applied: monotonically jacking and pseudo-driving. From the test results, it cannot be concluded if it is possible to simulate pile set-up in sand, observed in the field, by means of centrifuge model testing. Increases in shaft friction are observed for the jacked pile, as well as the cyclically installed pile. However, it is unlikely that these changes are only due to the factor of time. It is believed that the imposed pile displacements (test boundary conditions) disturb the results to a great extent. Clear influences of the installation of neighbouring piles are observed. It is recommended to perform following tests force-controlled. Perhaps longer lasting tests are needed. It is advisable to vary with soil homogeneity, soil uniformity and pile diameter in further model investigations. All of these parameters can influence the degree of set-up. Future research should also focus on field studies. Geo-engineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Four {{instrumented}} sites, with a {{total of}} 14 instrumented piles, have been analysed to understand the structural behaviour of the piles and the geotechnical behaviour of the stabilised slopes. Vibrating wire strain gauges are used for the calculation of the bending moment applied to the piles, while inclinometers are used to measure the displacements. A review of the instrumentation has been carried out and a methodology for processin and analysing strain gauges data has been developed. Concrete is a material with a complex behaviour. Shrinkage, creep, cracking, temperature variations, strength and modulus of elasticity of concrete are critically analysed to understand their influence on the concrete pile behaviour and on the function of the strain gauges. The results show that creep and shrinkage effects can be neglected in underground reinforced concrete structures in saturated clay, while cracking effects and temperature variations have to be analysed case by case. A correction method has been developed to consider the difference between the coefficient of thermal expansion of the strain gauges and that of the concrete. Two types of pile have been analysed, <b>standard</b> reinforced concrete <b>piles</b> and circular concrete-filled steel tubular piles. A review of their behaviour in bending that considers the development of cracking is presented. Two methods for the calculation of bending moment in the piles have been developed taking into account realistic stress/strain curves and the effects of concrete cracking. The bending moment results are compared with the inclinometer profiles using an improved version of an existing curve fitting method. The comparison shows good agreement between the two instrument results. A critical analysis of the pile/soil behaviour has been carried out comparing the results from the instrumented sites with theoretical mechanisms for landslide stabilising piles presented elsewhere. The results show a good match with the theoretical mechanisms as well as showing that the slopes have been successfully stabilised. Other observations have been made during analysis of the monitoring data. These include the seasonal effects of climate and vegetation on stabilised slopes and the structural effect of the external grout ring in laterally loaded circular concrete-filled steel tubular pile...|$|R
