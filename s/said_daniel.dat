He said such criticism showed it is [...] "open season to kill us". [...] "We're happy to live our lives in anonymity, just quietly in our neighbourhoods in our low-key way. We're quite happy to have our beliefs questioned, ethically debated, and points of religion looked at. That's not a problem. We don't mind being criticised. We don't even mind being despised because of it. But once it starts to be charged that we're acting criminally, we're acting illegally, we're acting immorally, we're acting against society, then we felt that we really had to put our point of view. We felt that it wasn't fair to our members," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Daniel</b> Hales to The West Australian.|$|E

2500|$|Daniel began preaching on his own, drawing {{surprisingly}} large crowds. However, Rev. John George Schmucher approached Daniel {{and convinced}} him that he needed a formal education in Lutheranism. For {{a year and a}} half, Daniel walked five miles every week through the very thick Penn's Woods to York to recite to the elder Schmucker. However, in time, this manner of instruction only whetted his taste for an even better education in the Lutheran ministry, so he sold his home and moved his family to Gettysburg to begin his full and regular course of theological study in the Lutheran Theological Seminary there as preparation for his work in the ministry. He studied there {{for two and a half}} years under the seminary's founder, Rev. Samuel Simon Schmucker, who later <b>said</b> <b>Daniel</b> was [...] "one of the most diligent and successful students that the Seminary ever had."

2500|$|There {{have been}} some new {{openings}} by the United Arab Emirates {{as reported in the}} media. In an article in USA Today Arabs try outreach to Israel, U.S. Jews, 2007, it is reported that: [...] "Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia, are making some of their most public overtures ever to Israel and American Jews in an effort to undercut Iran's growing influence, contain violence in Iraq and Lebanon and push for a Palestinian solution. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have stepped up contacts with Israel and pro-Israel Jewish groups in the USA. The outreach has the Bush administration's blessing: Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said six Arab States of the Persian Gulf and Egypt, Jordan and Israel are a new alignment of moderates to oppose extremists backed by Iran and Syria. She has said an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal would weaken militants such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Saudi and Arab states' contacts with Israelis and American Jews go back more than a decade but have never been so public. Arab countries have treated Israel as a pariah since it gained independence in 1948 (require source and not personal opinion). Most Arab countries ban travel to Israel, investment there and other commercial ties with the Jewish state and routinely refer to it as the [...] "Zionist entity" [...] (require source and personal opinion).
