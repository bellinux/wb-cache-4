50|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{telegraph}} it was possible to simultaneously collect data, such as surface temperature and sea-level pressure, to draw <b>synoptic</b> weather <b>charts.</b> With Charles Todd's appointment as Postmaster General to the Colony, he trained not only his telegraph operators, but also his postmasters as weather observers. These observers provided valuable data points that, in combination with telegraphed observations from the other colonies (including New Zealand), showed the development and progress of weather activity across {{a large part of the}} Southern Hemisphere. Todd's best known feat was his construction management of the Overland Telegraph from Adelaide to Port Darwin. This line of communication was critical to his capacity to create continent-wide <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> as the telegraphic observations from the Outback enabled the connection of data points on the east coast of Australia with similar data points on the west and southern coasts. These continent-scale isobaric lines allowed Todd and his staff to draw <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> that in the early 1880s had a greater breadth than any (known) <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> drawn elsewhere in the world.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{critical}} question {{related to a}} possible secular trend in the Sun’s total magnetic flux and consequently in solar irradiance is {{the total amount of}} magnetic flux present on the Sun and how it is distributed between active regions and the quiet Sun. NSO/Kitt Peak <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> have in the past been used to estimate the total flux and the fraction of the flux in active regions and in the quiet Sun. Since a single pixel of these <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> is much bigger than individual small-scale magnetic elements and opposite polarities may be present within the same pixel, some magnetic flux escaped notice. Here we estimate the fraction of the magnetic flux escaping detection in Kitt Peak <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts.</b> By artificially reducing the spatial resolution of MDI full-disc and high-resolution magnetograms we study the influence of the resolution on the measured total magnetic flux. Noise in the data poses the main difficulty to this approach and is carefully studied. It is concluded that {{at least half of the}} magnetic flux in the quiet Sun remains undetected in Kitt Peak <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> and that the total flux present on the solar surface at maxima of activity is around twice the flux present at activity minima...|$|R

50|$|The folios {{grew out}} of Todd’s desire to inform the colonists of South Australia of the immense size of weather systems and that in {{southern}} Australia, they generally progressed from west to east and not {{from east to west}} as commonly assumed by the early colonists. To accomplish this, Todd displayed daily the last 6 synoptic charts for public viewing then bound and stored them in the folios.The Todd weather folios consist not only of synoptic charts, but also include clippings from newspapers detailing weather statistics and events for all the eastern colonies of Australia. Newspapers from Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne were collected as they came off the inter-colonial trains and were processed for pasting up next to the corresponding <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The early cursive was {{the medium}} {{in which the}} {{minuscule}} forms were gradually evolved from the corresponding majuscule forms. Minuscule writing was therefore cursive in its inception. As the minuscule letters made their appearance in the cursive writing of documents, they were adopted and given calligraphic form by the copyists of literary texts, so that the set minuscule alphabet was constituted gradually, letter by letter, following {{the development of the}} minuscule cursive. Just as some documents written in the early cursive show a mixture of majuscule and minuscule forms, so certain literary papyri of the 3rd century, and inscriptions on stone of the 4th century yield examples of a mixed set hand, with minuscule forms side by side with capital and uncial letters. The number of minuscule forms increases steadily in texts written in the mixed hand, and especially in marginal notes, until {{by the end of the}} 5th century the majuscule forms have almost entirely disappeared in some manuscripts. This quasi-minuscule writing, known as the [...] "half-uncial" [...] thus derives from a long line of mixed hands which, in a <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart</b> of Latin scripts, would appear close to the oldest librariae, and between them and the epistolaris (cursive), from which its characteristic forms were successively derived. It had a considerable influence on the continental scriptura libraria of the 7th and 8th centuries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{streams in}} the Menai Strait are {{affected}} by winds outside in the Irish Sea. With a strong north or north-westerly wind both the rate and duration of the southwest-going ebb are increased, and the southwest-going ebb may begin {{quarter of an hour}} earlier. The 0600 <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart</b> showed a stationary deep depression west of Norway with a secondary low in the North Sea, and a high steadily closing the west coast of Ireland, which could be expected to result in an increasingly strong northwesterly wind in the Irish Sea. But in the shelter of the Plas Newydd mooring, there was no indication of this. At 0800 as the wind was being recorded in Conway's logbook as northerly force 1-2 (2 to 5 knots), only 13 miles away on station off Point Lynas it was being recorded by the Liverpool pilot boat as northwesterly force 6 (22 - 27 knots) and her noon entry was NW force 7, (28 - 33 knots) while during the morning Bidston Observatory was recording gusts up to 49 knots (storm force 10). The Investigating Subcommittee was later to express its surprise that Captain Hewitt had left the Plas Newydd mooring without a weather forecast, and [...] "had no knowledge of the stormy conditions prevailing at sea at the time Conway was to make the passage" [...] since it was local knowledge that in such weather [...] "abnormal conditions might be encountered." [...] In addition to the tide generated streams in the Menai Strait there is also a non-tidal current, the Southwest Residual, a dynamic reaction which directly reflects wind stress in the Irish Sea. The north-westerly mean wind speed of 16 meters per second at sea that day would enhance the Residual by 15 cm per second, increasing the strength of the southwest-going ebb at Plas Newydd by as much as 3 knots.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic flux {{synoptic}} charts {{are critical}} for reliable modeling of the corona and heliosphere. Until now, however, these charts were provided without any estimate of uncertainties. The uncertainties are due to instrumental noise in the measurements and to the spatial variance of the magnetic flux distribution that contributes to each bin in the <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart.</b> We describe here a simple method to compute synoptic magnetic flux maps and their corresponding magnetic flux spatial variance charts {{that can be used}} to estimate the uncertainty in the results of coronal models.

Oil droplet coalescence, which was expressed as a relative variation in the percentage of oil droplets with a diameter of > 30 μm, proved to be an time-dependent phenomenon only; the pseudo zero-order kinetics modelling was statistically significant, where the coalescence rate constant was equal to 0. 033 min− 1.
