5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as <b>sibutramine</b> or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity.|$|E
25|$|The {{concomitant}} use of <b>sibutramine</b> {{and drugs}} which inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, may increase plasma levels of <b>sibutramine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> (Reductil or Meridia) is an {{anorectic}} or appetite suppressant, {{reducing the}} desire to eat. <b>Sibutramine</b> may increase blood pressure and may cause dry mouth, constipation, headache, and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> has {{a number}} of {{clinically}} significant interactions. The concomitant use of <b>sibutramine</b> and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs, such as selegiline) is not indicated, as it may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a somewhat rare but serious adverse drug reaction. <b>Sibutramine</b> should not be taken within two weeks of stopping or starting an MAOI. Taking both <b>sibutramine</b> and certain medications used in the treatment of migraines—such as ergolines and triptans—as well as opioids, may also increase the risk for serotonin syndrome, as may the use of more than one serotonin reuptake inhibitor at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Some illegal {{weight loss}} {{products}} imported into Ireland {{have been found}} to contain <b>sibutramine.</b> Similar concerns have been raised in Australia, where illegal imported supplements {{have been found to}} contain <b>sibutramine,</b> resulting in public alerts from Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{issued an}} alert stating that some {{counterfeit}} versions of Alli sold over the Internet contain no orlistat, and instead contain the weight-loss drug <b>sibutramine.</b> The concentration of <b>sibutramine</b> in these counterfeit products {{is at least}} twice the amount recommended for weight loss.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> {{does not}} affect the {{efficacy}} of hormonal contraception.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> has {{usually been}} used {{in the form of the}} {{hydrochloride}} monohydrate salt.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011, the FDA {{warned that}} 20 brands of dietary {{supplements}} were tainted with <b>sibutramine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> can {{substantially}} increase {{blood pressure}} and heart rate in some patients. Therefore, regular monitoring needs to be performed.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other serotonergic {{appetite}} suppressants like fenfluramine, <b>sibutramine</b> and its metabolites {{have only}} low and likely inconsequential {{affinity for the}} 5-HT2C receptor.|$|E
25|$|On January 21, 2010, the European Medicines Agency {{recommended}} {{suspension of}} marketing authorizations for <b>sibutramine</b> {{based on the}} SCOUT study results.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> {{has been}} used to produce {{appetite}} suppression for the purpose of attaining weight loss in the treatment of patients with obesity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> is {{reported}} to be a prodrug to two active metabolites, desmethylsibutramine (M1; BTS-54354) and didesmethylsibutramine (M2; BTS-54505), with much greater potency as MRIs.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010 the FDA {{added a new}} {{contraindication}} {{for patients}} over 65 years of age {{due to the fact}} that clinical studies of <b>sibutramine</b> did not include sufficient numbers of such patients.|$|E
25|$|Abbott Laboratories {{announced}} on October 8, 2010 {{that it is}} withdrawing <b>sibutramine</b> from the US market {{under pressure from the}} FDA, citing concerns over minimal efficacy coupled with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> is well absorbed {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract (77%), but undergoes considerable first-pass metabolism, reducing its bioavailability. The drug itself reaches its {{peak plasma level}} after 1 hour and has also a half-life of 1 hour. <b>Sibutramine</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4 into two pharmacologically-active primary and secondary amines (called active metabolites 1 and 2) with half-lives of 14 and 16 hours, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations of active metabolites 1 and 2 are reached after three to four hours. The following metabolic pathway mainly results in two inactive conjugated and hydroxylated metabolites (called metabolites 5 and 6). Metabolites 5 and 6 are mainly excreted in the urine.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{having a}} {{mechanism}} of action similar to tricyclic antidepressants, <b>sibutramine</b> has failed to demonstrate antidepressant properties in animal studies. It {{was approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 1997 for the treatment of obesity.|$|E
25|$|Methylene blue is a {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), and if infused intravenously at doses exceeding 5mg/kg, may precipitate serious serotonin toxicity, serotonin syndrome, if combined with any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., duloxetine, <b>sibutramine,</b> venlafaxine, clomipramine, imipramine).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> and its two active N-demethylated {{metabolites}} may {{be measured}} in biofluids by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Plasma levels of these three species are usually in the 1–10 μg/L range in persons undergoing therapy with the drug. The parent compound and norsibutramine are often not detectable in urine, but dinorsibutramine is generally present at concentrations of >200 μg/L.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{medications}} currently {{approved for}} the treatment of obesity in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends medications for obesity be discourage. Orlistat and <b>sibutramine</b> may be helpful in managing moderate obesity in adolescence. Metformin is minimally useful. A Cochrane review in 2016 concluded that medications might reduce BMI and bodyweight to a small extent in obese children and adolescents. This conclusion was based only on low quality evidence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> was {{originally}} developed in 1988 by Boots in Nottingham, U.K., and marketed by Knoll Pharmaceuticals after BASF/Knoll AG purchased the Boots Research Division in 1995, and was most recently manufactured and marketed by Abbott Laboratories before its withdrawal from most markets. It {{has been sold}} {{under a variety of}} brand names including Reductil, Meridia, Siredia, and Sibutrex. It is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Many {{medications}} {{may have}} been incorrectly thought to cause serotonin syndrome. For example, some case reports have implicated atypical antipsychotics in serotonin syndrome, but it appears based on their pharmacology that {{they are unlikely to}} cause the syndrome. [...] It has also been suggested that mirtazapine has no significant serotonergic effects, and is therefore not a dual action drug. Bupropion has also been suggested to cause serotonin syndrome, although as {{there is no evidence that}} it has any significant serotonergic activity, it is thought unlikely to produce the syndrome. In 2006 the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an alert suggesting that the combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptan medications or <b>sibutramine</b> could potentially lead to severe cases of serotonin syndrome. This has been disputed by other researchers as none of the cases reported by the FDA met the Hunter criteria for serotonin syndrome. The condition has however occurred in surprising clinical situations, and because of phenotypic variations among individuals, it has been associated with unexpected drugs, including mirtazapine.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010 Health Canada {{advised the}} public that illegal [...] "Herbal Diet Natural" [...] had been found on the market, {{containing}} <b>sibutramine,</b> which is a prescription drug in Canada, without listing <b>sibutramine</b> as an ingredient. In October 2010 FDA notified consumers that [...] "Slimming Beauty Bitter Orange Slimming Capsules contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient <b>sibutramine,</b> a prescription-only drug which is a stimulant. <b>Sibutramine</b> is not listed on the product label." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{higher number}} of {{cardiovascular}} events has been observed in people taking <b>sibutramine</b> versus control (11.4% vs. 10.0%). [...] In 2010 the FDA noted the concerns that <b>sibutramine</b> {{increases the risk of}} heart attacks and strokes in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
2500|$|On December 30, 2010 the FDA {{released}} a warning regarding [...] "Fruta Planta" [...] dietary products, which {{were found to}} contain undeclared amounts of <b>sibutramine.</b> The recall stated that [...] "there is NO SAFE formula on the US market and that all versions of Fruta Planta contain <b>sibutramine.</b> All versions of the formula are UNSAFE {{and should not be}} purchased from any source." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 22, 2008, the United States Food and Drug Administration {{issued an}} alert to {{consumers}} naming 27 different products marketed as “dietary supplements” for weight loss, that illegally contain undisclosed amounts of <b>sibutramine.</b> In March 2009, Dieter Müller et al. published {{a study of}} <b>sibutramine</b> poisoning cases from similar Chinese [...] "herbal supplements" [...] sold in Europe, containing as much as twice the dosage of the legally licensed drug.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2010 the MHRA in the UK {{issued a}} warning {{regarding}} [...] "Payouji tea" [...] and [...] "Pai You Guo Slim Capsules" [...] which {{were found to}} contain undeclared quantities of <b>sibutramine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> {{has been}} {{withdrawn}} from {{the market in the}} United States, the UK, the EU, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and Colombia. [...] Its risks (non-life-threatening myocardial infarction and stroke) have been shown to outweigh the benefits.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan {{was noted}} for {{his love of}} fine food and wine. He was battling a weight problem {{for several years and}} had been taking Reductil (<b>Sibutramine),</b> a [...] "slimming pill", which he said was {{effective}} and safe. Ryan conceded in his autobiography that he drank too much for his own good.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sibutramine</b> is a monoamine reuptake {{inhibitor}} (MRI) that, in humans, {{reduces the}} reuptake of norepinephrine (by ~73%), serotonin (by ~54%), and dopamine (by ~16%), thereby increasing {{the levels of}} these substances in synaptic clefts and helping enhance the serotonergic action, in particular, is thought to influence appetite. Older anorectic agents such as amphetamine and fenfluramine force the release of these neurotransmitters rather than affecting their reuptake.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sibutramine,</b> {{formerly}} {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Meridia among others, is an appetite suppressant which has been discontinued in many countries. Until 2010, it was widely marketed and prescribed as an adjunct {{in the treatment of}} obesity along with diet and exercise. It has been associated with increased cardiovascular events and strokes and has been withdrawn from the market in several countries and regions including ...|$|E
2500|$|Between January 2003 and November 2005, a large randomized-controlled [...] "Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes" [...] (SCOUT) {{study with}} 10,742 {{patients}} examined {{whether or not}} <b>sibutramine</b> administered within a weight management program reduces the risk for cardiovascular complications in people {{at high risk for}} heart disease and concluded that use of silbutramine had a RR 1.16 for the primary outcome (composit of nonfatal MI, nonfatal CVA, cardiac arrest, and CV death).|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{are ongoing}} into reports of sudden death, heart failure, renal failure and {{gastrointestinal}} problems. Despite a 2002 petition by Ralph Nader-founded NGO Public Citizen, the FDA made no attempts {{to withdraw the}} drug, but {{was part of a}} Senate hearing in 2005. Similarly, David Graham, FDA [...] "whistleblower", testified before a Senate Finance Committee hearing that <b>sibutramine</b> may be more dangerous than the conditions it is used for.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} 34 {{products were}} recalled by the FDA on April 22, 2009, further underscoring {{the risks associated}} with unregulated [...] "herbal supplements" [...] to unsuspecting persons. This concern is especially relevant to those with underlying medical conditions incompatible with undeclared pharmaceutical adulterants. In January 2010, a similar alert was issued for counterfeit versions of the over-the-counter weight loss drug Alli sold over the Internet. Instead of the active ingredient orlistat, the counterfeit drugs contain <b>sibutramine,</b> and at concentrations at least twice the amount recommended for weight loss.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States {{orlistat}} (Xenical) {{is currently}} {{approved by the}} FDA for long-term use. It reduces intestinal fat absorption by inhibiting pancreatic lipase. Rimonabant (Acomplia), a second drug, works via a specific blockade of the endocannabinoid system. It has been developed from the knowledge that cannabis smokers often experience hunger, which {{is often referred to}} as [...] "the munchies". It had been approved in Europe for the treatment of obesity but has not received approval in the United States or Canada due to safety concerns. The European Medicines Agency in October 2008 recommended the suspension of the sale of rimonabant as the risks seem to be greater than the benefits. <b>Sibutramine</b> (Meridia), which acts in the brain to inhibit deactivation of the neurotransmitters, thereby decreasing appetite was withdrawn from the United States and Canadian markets in October 2010 due to cardiovascular concerns.|$|E
