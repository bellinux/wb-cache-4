5|$|Barycentric <b>subdivision</b> is {{an example}} of a <b>subdivision</b> rule with one edge type (that gets {{subdivided}} into two edges) and one tile type (a triangle that gets subdivided into 6 smaller triangles). Any triangulated surface is a barycentric <b>subdivision</b> complex.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subdivision</b> rules {{can easily}} be {{generalized}} to other dimensions. For instance, barycentric <b>subdivision</b> is used in all dimensions. Also, binary <b>subdivision</b> can be generalized to other dimensions (where hypercubes get divided by every midplane), as in the proof of the Heine–Borel theorem.|$|E
5|$|A <b>subdivision</b> rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is {{represented}} by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite <b>subdivision</b> rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called <b>subdivision</b> complexes for the <b>subdivision</b> rule. Given any <b>subdivision</b> complex for a <b>subdivision</b> rule, we can subdivide {{it over and over again}} to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E

5|$|College {{football}} is the third-most popular sport in the United States, behind professional baseball and professional football. The NCAA, the largest collegiate organization, {{is divided into three}} Divisions: Division I, Division II and Division III. Division I {{football is}} further divided into two subdivisions: the Football Bowl <b>Subdivision</b> (FBS) and the Football Championship <b>Subdivision</b> (FCS). The champions of each level of play are determined through NCAA-sanctioned playoff systems; while the champion of Division I-FBS was historically determined by various polls and ranking systems, the <b>subdivision</b> adopted a four-team playoff system in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has a <b>subdivision</b> rule, {{with some}} tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The <b>subdivision</b> rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The <b>subdivision</b> rule describes that pattern.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{a finite}} <b>subdivision</b> rule is a {{recursive}} way of dividing a polygon or other two-dimensional shape into {{smaller and smaller}} pieces. <b>Subdivision</b> rules in a sense are generalizations of fractals. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals. <b>Subdivision</b> rules {{have been used in}} architecture, biology, and computer science, {{as well as in the}} study of hyperbolic manifolds. Substitution tilings are a well-studied type of <b>subdivision</b> rule.|$|E

50|$|The {{districts of}} Peru (Spanish: distritos) are the third-level country <b>subdivisions</b> of Peru. They are <b>subdivisions</b> of the provinces, {{which in turn}} are <b>subdivisions</b> of the larger regions or departments. There are 1,838 districts in total.|$|R
5|$|<b>Subdivision</b> {{surfaces}} in computer graphics use <b>subdivision</b> rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These <b>subdivision</b> surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark <b>subdivision</b> surface) take a polygon mesh (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas. Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a <b>subdivision</b> {{of the old}} mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).|$|E
5|$|The quasi-isometry {{properties}} of the history graph can be studied using <b>subdivision</b> rules. For instance, the history graph is quasi-isometric to hyperbolic space exactly when the <b>subdivision</b> rule is conformal, {{as described in the}} combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem.|$|E
5|$|A two-laned Ninth Line curves {{northeast}} after {{crossing and}} being crossed by two separate railway tracks (the Canadian Pacific (CP) Havelock <b>Subdivision</b> and the Canadian National Halton <b>subdivision)</b> and becomes Donald Cousens Parkway, expanding to four lanes and travelling {{along the eastern}} fringe {{of the community of}} Box Grove, alongside which it was built in the mid-2000s. On the west side is a new residential <b>subdivision,</b> while on the east side beyond the CP Havelock <b>subdivision,</b> which the road parallels, is the completely undeveloped Bob Hunter Memorial Park. After passing Box Grove Bypass, where for some time the route ended, the road also becomes known as Box Grove Collector Road (BGCR). The route intersects 14th Avenue (York Regional Road71) and continues as before, eventually curving north and meeting Copper Creek Drive while departing from the railway tracks and park. It passes a supercenter before an interchange with Highway407, where it crosses over the toll route.|$|E
