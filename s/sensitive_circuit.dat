40|$|Purpose: To {{establish}} an imaging approach {{to visualize the}} 100 -mu m-thick hippocampal neuron-generating dentate granule cell layer (DGCL) consistently within a clinically feasible magnetic resonance (MR) imaging duration and to assess its sensitivity by quantifying the likelihood {{that it will be}} detected in healthy young adults. Materials and Methods: The study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. All subjects provided written informed consent. Ten healthy volunteers (five male subjects, five female subjects; mean age, 26 years +/- 6 [standard deviation]) were imaged at 7. 0 T by using a 24 -element head coil array with three-dimensional T 1 -weighted MR imaging for anatomic reference, followed by T 2 *-weighted gradient-echo (echo time, 25 msec; repetition time, 944 msec) imaging at 232 -mu m in-plane resolution (0. 05 -mm(3) pixels) in coronal and sagittal slabs (17 sections at 1 mm thick) over the hippocampus in 14 minutes. The entire study took 45 minutes. Results: The DGCL was consistently visible in all 10 enrolled subjects. All larger subfields were visible in excellent detail and contrast in every subject. Conclusion: The spatial resolution and tissue contrast at high field strength (7. 0 T) MR imaging can be used to consistently reveal hippocampal morphology down to 100 -mu m subfields within a clinically acceptable imaging duration.

The potassium phosphate buffer was a Newtonian liquid. The resonance frequency of the oscillating quartz shifted down about 900 Hz by contacting with the buffer. An immobilized-antibody layer on the quartz surface behaved like a rigid mass when immersed in the buffer solution. ^ The quartz crystal with immobilized antibodies was characterized in various solutions containing antibody-coated paramagnetic microspheres and varying concentrations of Salmonella typhimurium (102 − 108 cells/ml).

40|$|Space {{exploration}} and {{the rapid growth}} of the satellite communications industry has promoted substantial research into the effects of ionising radiation on modem electronic technology. The enabling electronics and computer processing has seen a commensurate growth in the use of radiation for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in medicine. Numerous studies exist in both these fields but an analysis combining the fields of study to ascertain the effects of radiation on medically implantable electronics is lacking. A review of significant ground level radiation sources is presented with particular emphasis on the medical environment. Mechanisms of permanent and transient ionising radiation damage to Metal Oxide Semiconductors are summarised. Three significant sources of radiation are classified as having the ability to damage or alter the behavior of implantable electronics; Secondary neutron cosmic radiation, alpha particle radiation from the device packaging and therapeutic doses of high energy radiation. With respect to cosmic radiation, the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>circuit</b> structure within a typical microcomputer architecture is the Random Access Memory(RAM). A theoretical model which predicts the susceptibility of a RAM cell to single event upsets from secondary cosmic ray neutrons is presented. A previously unreported method for calculating the collection efficiency term in the upset model has been derived along with an extension of the model to enable estimation of multiple bit upset rates. An Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator is used as a case example to demonstrate model applicability and test against clinical experience. The model correlates well with clinical experience and is consistent with the expected geographical variations of the secondary cosmic ray neutron flux. This is the first clinical data set obtained indicating the effects of cosmic radiation on implantable devices. Importantly, it may be used to predict the susceptibility of future implantable device designs to cosmic radiation. The model is also used as a basis for developing radiation hardened circuit techniques and system design.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{miniaturization}} {{technology has been}} increasing over the last decades. Consumer electronics end-users often, if not always, go for more functionality and practicality. This is translated into systems that are more complex and yet smaller in size such as smart cellular phones and portable audio/video systems. System on Chip (SoC) is still a solution preferred by many. The SoC comprises of many different circuit blocks that fall into two categories namely analog/RF and digital. The integration of the analog/RF circuitry and digital circuitry on the same silicon substrate has yet another challenge to cope with. The noise generated from the switching activity of the digital circuitry is injected into the silicon substrate, which then can propagate to the sensitive analog/RF circuitry. Such substrate noise can significantly degrade the functionality of the analog/RF circuitry, thus deteriorating {{the performance of the}} entire electronic system. In this thesis, a method to isolate the noise generating circuit block from the noise <b>sensitive</b> <b>circuit</b> block is proposed and demonstrated. The proposed method is based on through-substrate trench isolation scheme to suppress the substrate noise. The idea behind this isolation scheme is to create a full through-substrate trench that physically separates the noise agressor from the victim. This idea is very simple and effective. The through-substrate trench is achieved by means of wafer-level packaging (WLP) technology and consists of only a few additional fabrication steps that can readily be incorporated in the WLP processing flow. In a few words, it can be described as follows: the silicon substrate is first bonded to a spacer substrate, e. g. AF- 45 glass or High-Resistivity Polycrystalline Silicon (HRPS). Then, the bonded wafer stack is turned upside down before being thinned down. The next step is to create the through-substrate trench by means of KOH etching. At this stage, we now have an air-filled through-substrate trench. This isolation scheme can be further improved by metalizing the trench resulting in a backside metal plane. The backside metal can then be connected to ground to drain the substrate noise. This is called grounded-metalized through-substrate trench. In this work, we have successfully fabricated and measured several devices, i. e. control device (without isolation), air-filled trench device, and metalized trench device. At 50 MHz air-filled trench provides around 55 dB isolation with respect to control device, whereas the metalized-trench provides additional isolation of 7 dB. At 10 GHz air-filled trench provides around 10 dB isolation with respect to control device, whereas the metalized-trench provides additional isolation of 23 dB. At 40 GHz air-filled trench provides around 2 dB isolation with respect to control device, whereas the metalized-trench provides additional isolation of 20 dB.

Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The input impedance of some poorly-designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary {{over the course of}} a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some <b>sensitive</b> <b>circuits</b> under test.|$|R

Second, if the ferrite is so designed, it can produce an additional loss in the form of resistance in the ferrite itself. The ferrite creates an inductor with a very low Q factor. [...] This loss heats the ferrite, but normally it is a negligible amount of heat.
