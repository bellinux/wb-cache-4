25|$|A {{program was}} {{initiated}} by Bletchley Park to design much faster bombes that could decrypt the four-rotor {{system in a}} reasonable time. There were two streams of development. One, code-named Cobra, with an electronic <b>sensing</b> <b>unit,</b> was produced by Charles Wynn-Williams of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) at Malvern and Tommy Flowers of the General Post Office (GPO). The other, code-named Mammoth, was designed by Harold Keen at BTM, Letchworth. Initial delivery was scheduled for August or September 1942. The dual development projects created considerable {{tension between the two}} teams, both of which cast doubts on the viability of the opposing team's machine. After considerable internal rivalry and dispute, Gordon Welchman (by then, Bletchley Park's Assistant Director for mechanization) was forced to step in to resolve the situation. Ultimately, Cobra proved unreliable and Mammoth went into full-scale production.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the connected target coverage (CTC) problem in wireless heterogeneous sensor networks (WHSNs) with multiple <b>sensing</b> <b>units,</b> termed MU-CTC problem. MU-CTC {{problem can be}} reduced to a connected set cover problem and further formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. However, the ILP problem is an NP-complete problem. Therefore, two distributed heuristic schemes, REFS (remaining energy first scheme) and EEFS (energy efficiency first scheme), are proposed. In REFS, each sensor considers its remaining energy and its neighbors’ decisions to enable its <b>sensing</b> <b>units</b> and communication unit such that all targets can be covered for the required attributes and the sensed data can be delivered to the sink. The advantages of REFS are its simplicity and reduced communication overhead. However, to utilize sensors’ energy efficiently, EEFS is proposed. A sensor in EEFS considers its contribution to the coverage and the connectivity to make a better decision. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to consider target coverage and connectivity jointly for WHSNs with multiple <b>sensing</b> <b>units.</b> Simulation results show that REFS and EEFS can both prolong the network lifetime effectively.

40|$|This minireview {{describes}} the main developments of electronic tongues (e-tongues) and taste sensors in recent years, with {{a summary of}} the principles of detection and materials used in the <b>sensing</b> <b>units.</b> E-tongues are sensor arrays capable of distinguishing very similar liquids employing the concept of global selectivity, where the difference in the electrical response of different materials serves as a fingerprint for the analysed sample. They have been widely used for the analysis of wines, fruit juices, coffee, milk and beverages, in addition to the detection of trace amounts of impurities or pollutants in waters. Among the various principles of detection, electrochemical measurements and impedance spectroscopy are the most prominent. With regard to the materials for the <b>sensing</b> <b>units,</b> in most cases use is made of ultrathin films produced in a layer-by-layer fashion to yield higher sensitivity with the advantage of control of the film molecular architecture. The concept of e-tongues has been extended to biosensing by using <b>sensing</b> <b>units</b> capable of molecular recognition, as in films with immobilized antigens or enzymes with specific recognition for clinical diagnosis. Because the identification of samples is basically a classification task, there has been a trend to use artificial intelligence and information visualization methods to enhance the performance of e-tongues.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{years has}} {{witnessed}} a {{growing interest in}} wireless structural monitoring as a low-cost alternative to tethered monitoring systems.

40|$|Impedance {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} proven {{a powerful tool for}} reaching high sensitivity in sensor arrays made with nanostructured films in the so-called electronic tongue systems, whose distinguishing ability may be enhanced with <b>sensing</b> <b>units</b> capable of molecular recognition. In this study we show that for optimized sensors and bio-sensors the dielectric relaxation processes involved in impedance measurements should also be considered, in addition to an adequate choice of sensing materials. We used <b>sensing</b> <b>units</b> made from layer-by-layer (LbL) films with alternating layers of the polyeletrolytes, poly(allylamine) hydrochloride (PAH) and poly(vinyl sulfonate) (PVS), or LbL films of PAH alternated with layers of the enzyme phytase, all adsorbed on gold interdigitate electrodes. Surprisingly, the detection of phytic acid was as effective in the PVS/PAH sensing system as with the PAH/phytase system, in spite of the specific interactions of the latter. This was attributed to the dependence of the relaxation processes on nonspecific interactions such as electrostatic cross-linking and possibly on the distinct film architecture as the phytase layers were found to grow as columns on the LbL film, in contrast to the molecularly thin PAH/PVS films. Using projection techniques, we were able to detect phytic acid at the micromolar level with either of the <b>sensing</b> <b>units</b> in a data analysis procedure that allows for further optimization.

40|$|The {{integration}} of nanostructured films containing biomolecules and silicon-based technologies is a promising direction for reaching miniaturized biosensors that exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity. A challenge, however, {{is to avoid}} cross talk among <b>sensing</b> <b>units</b> in an array with multiple sensors located on a small area. In this letter, we describe an array of 16 <b>sensing</b> <b>units</b> of a light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS), which was made with layer-by-layer (LbL) films of a poly(amidomine) dendrimer (PAMAM) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), coated {{with a layer of}} the enzyme penicillinase. A visual inspection of the data from constant-current measurements with liquid samples containing distinct concentrations of penicillin, glucose, or a buffer indicated a possible cross talk between units that contained penicillinase and those that did not. With the use of multidimensional data projection techniques, normally employed in information visualization methods, we managed to distinguish the results from the modified LAPS, even in cases where the units were adjacent to each other. Furthermore, the plots generated with the interactive document map (IDMAP) projection technique enabled the distinction of the different concentrations of penicillin, from 5 mmol L− 1 down to 0. 5 mmol L− 1. Data visualization also confirmed the enhanced performance of the <b>sensing</b> <b>units</b> containing carbon nanotubes, consistent with the analysis of results for LAPS sensors.

40|$|Abstract — A {{sensor node}} with {{multiple}} <b>sensing</b> <b>units</b> is usually unable to process simultaneously the data generated by multiple <b>sensing</b> <b>units,</b> thereby resulting in event misses. This paper presents a collaborative task scheduling algorithm, called CTAS, to minimize event misses and energy consumption by exploiting power modes and overlapping sensing areas of sensor nodes. The novel idea of CTAS lies {{in that it}} employs a two-level scheduling approach to the execution of tasks collaboratively at group and individual levels among neighboring sensor nodes. CTAS first implements coarse-grain scheduling at the group level to schedule the event types to be detected by each group member.
