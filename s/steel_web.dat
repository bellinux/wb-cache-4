Ten smaller sliding ventilation shutters of similar design are evenly spaced in the curved facade, five {{on either side of the}} double doors. At the rear ground level of the woolshed is another central double sliding door, clad in corrugated iron.Internally, the woolshed has two levels - the main floor, high-set, of timber construction, and semi-circular; and a much smaller ground level floor, of concrete, along the rear, straight wall. There are no internal wall or roof linings, leaving the shed structural components clearly visible. The woolshed has a steel superstructure, with a central pillar that sits directly under the apex of the roof; located at the mid-rear point of the top roof tier. <b>Steel</b> <b>web</b> trusses radiate out from the central pillar over a clear space of 70 feet (21.3 metres).

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} bridges with corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>webs</b> {{have emerged}} as one of the promising bridge forms. This structural form provides excellent structural efficiency with the concrete flanges primarily taking bending and the corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>webs</b> primarily taking shear. In the design of this type of bridges, the flexural ductility and deformability as well as strength need to be carefully examined. Evaluation of these safety-related attributes requires the estimation of full-range behaviour. In this study, the full-range behaviour of beam sections with corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>webs</b> is evaluated by means of a nonlinear analytical method which uses the actual stress-strain curves of the materials and considers the path-dependence of materials. In view of the different behaviour of components and the large shear deformation of corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>webs</b> with negligible longitudinal stiffness, the assumption that plane sections remain plane may no longer be valid. The interaction between shear deformation and local bending of flanges may cause additional stress in flanges, which is considered in this study.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{simulating}} the structural response of composite bridges with corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>webs.</b> Numerical modelling methods with various model dimensionalities {{have been widely used}} in the simulation of this type of structure. Among these methods, one-dimensional finite element model can satisfactorily capture the general reponse but it fails to give the stress result in the structure, which is necessary for refinement design. Also, the intensive computation and convergence issue of 3 D solid model make this model less attractive, though it might be more capable of accurately simulating the local response of composite bridges. The spatial grid model is proposed as a simple but accurate solution to model the general and local responses of the composite bridges with corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>webs.</b> In this model, top slabs, bottom slabs and webs are characterized by orthogonal beam elements, wherein the stiffness of these beam elements are determined by the principle of equivalent displacements. For simplicity, the corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>webs</b> were modelled by steel plates of the same depth as the original webs. The folding effect of the corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>webs</b> was simulated by the reduction of the elastic moduli of the longitudinal element for webs.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the design}} of most bridge girders with {{composite}} girders composed of steelâ€“concrete composite plate girders, {{an opening in the}} steel girder is often used to provide passage for utility ducts and pipes. This results in significant savings in material and construction costs. So it is necessary to study the effect of an opening in the web steel on the behavior of the composite girders if the designer wishes to provide adequate opening in the structural elements without reducing its load carrying capacity. In this paper, a non-linear finite element analysis has been done to analyze the deflection in the steel section and internal stresses in the concrete slab for continuous composite girders with a single rectangular opening in the <b>steel</b> <b>web.</b> ANSYS computer program (version 15) has been used to analyze the three-dimensional model.

The parametric analysis was executed to investigate the width, height, and position of the opening in one span on the behavior of a composite girder under vertical load. The results indicated that when the width of opening is less than 0. 05 of length of a single span and the height is less than 0. 15 of the <b>steel</b> <b>web,</b> the deflection and internal stresses increased less than 10 % comparing to continuous composite girders without an opening...|$|E
40|$|The wide {{application}} of corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>web</b> bridges {{has led to}} a rising demand on accurate tools to analyze this type of structures. Current computational models for these analyses are mainly related to those models using 2 D (or 3 D) beam elements, solid (shell) elements. Despite the modelling simplicity, beam models can predict the overall structural behavior but failed to provide a refined response on local areas. On the other hand, the elaborated models are better at capturing the local response. However, they are faced with computation and convergence difficulties. To fill this gap, this paper investigates a new model to analyze the structural behavior of corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>web</b> bridges. In this model, the concrete slabs and corrugated steel webs are simulated by the grid composed of 3 D beam elements. Specially, the folding effects of the webs are simulated by modifying the mechanical parameters of the longitudinal elements in the grids of beams. The performance of the model is studied by comparing the results from it and those from solid models. These comparisons include the vertical deflections in the longitudinal direction and the vertical deflections in the transverse direction at midspan and one-fourth point of the span. In addition, the normal stresses and the shear stresses due to different loadings are investigated.

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} bridges with corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>webs</b> {{have emerged}} as one of the promising bridge forms. However, the presence of prestressing tendons and shear-deformable corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>webs</b> with negligible axial stiffness complicates the formation of plastic hinges under applied loading to failure.
