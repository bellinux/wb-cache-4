5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that of his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E
5|$|European {{dominance}} was at {{the forefront}} of United's agenda during the 1997–98 season. Having failed to take their chances in a semi-final against eventual champions Borussia Dortmund in 1996–97, Ferguson was resolute to go one <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> emulate Matt Busby's success of 1968, quashing any talk that his team was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|Although {{designed}} {{by one of}} Square's development teams in Japan, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre's appeal through Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Square had already released several Final Fantasy spinoffs in North America, including the first three titles in the SaGa series as Final Fantasy Legend, and the first Mana series game as Final Fantasy Adventure, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square's executives cited the alleged difficulty of RPGs as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking {{various aspects of the}} main series' gameplay. The American release of Final Fantasy IV was altered to make the game simpler, for example. Mystic Quest was to take this one <b>step</b> <b>further,</b> <b>and</b> the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.|$|E

25|$|As a theatre {{educator}} {{as early}} as 1973, Raj Bisaria suggested to the State Government that he should start a semi-professional repertory theatre in Uttar Pradesh, in 1974 the State Government went a few <b>steps</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> requested him to evolve a scheme for establishing a drama school, which would function as a full-fledged academy of dramatic arts.|$|R
5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 a new {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated, aiming at {{straightening}} the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3% deficit or the 60% debt rules. By {{the end of the}} year, Germany, France and some other smaller EU countries went a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> vowed to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and enforceable fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the EU treaties. On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it.|$|E
5|$|There was broad {{agreement}} between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force {{if necessary to}} enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided United States {{foreign policy in the}} Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties to arbitrators.|$|E

60|$|He {{went on a}} few <b>steps</b> <b>further,</b> <b>and</b> paused {{before the}} Province House. No range of brick stores had then sprung up to hide the mansion of the royal {{governors}} from public view. It had a spacious court-yard, bordered with trees, and enclosed with a wrought-iron fence. On the cupola, that surmounted the edifice, was the gilded figure of an Indian chief, ready to let fly an arrow from his bow. Over the wide front door was a balcony, in which the chief justice had often stood, when the governor and high officers of the province showed themselves to the people.|$|R
60|$|The wild storm lasted MORE THAN A WEEK, without ceasing; {{but on the}} 17th, Couttet, {{with several}} guides, left the cabin and succeeded in making the ascent. In the snowy wastes near the summit they came upon five bodies, lying upon their sides in a reposeful {{attitude}} which suggested that possibly they had fallen asleep there, while exhausted with fatigue and hunger and benumbed with cold, and never knew when death stole upon them. Couttet moved a few <b>steps</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> discovered five more bodies. The eleventh corpse--that of a porter--was not found, although diligent search was made for it.|$|R

60|$|Hastening {{towards the}} {{entrance}} to the creek, the unfortunate pair entered the bushes, through which they pushed with some difficulty, until they gained a spot sufficiently secluded for their purpose, when they observed that they had passed through a belt of underwood, beyond which there appeared to be an open space. A few <b>steps</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> they came out on a sort of natural basin formed by the creek, in which floated a large boat of a peculiar construction, with very piratical-looking lateen sails. Their astonishment at this unexpected sight was increased by the fact that on the opposite bank of the creek there stood several men armed with muskets, which latter were immediately pointed at their breasts.|$|R

25|$|A phonetic {{conversion}} goes one <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> {{attempts to}} depict all phones in the source language, sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions {{not found in}} the target script. In practice such a representation almost never tries to represent every possible allophone—especially those that occur naturally due to coarticulation effects—and instead limits itself to the most significant allophonic distinctions. The International Phonetic Alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription.|$|E
25|$|The Fire Precautions Act had {{relied on}} codes and guides for its implementation, and the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations had changed {{that a little}} by {{introducing}} risk assessment {{as a way of}} complying, but because the requirement for a fire certificate was never repealed, the guides and codes were still used as a prescriptive means of applying the law. The RR (FS) O took this one <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> implemented fully a risk assessment based regime.|$|E

In contrast to Kautz's approach where the plan library is explicitly represented, Lesh and Etzioni's approach enables automatic plan-library construction from domain primitives. Furthermore, they introduced compact representations and efficient algorithms for goal recognition on large plan libraries.|$|E
25|$|Pope Paul VI {{opted for}} a {{significantly}} shorter ceremony. As with all other modern coronations, the ceremony itself was only symbolic, as the person involved became Pope and Bishop of Rome the moment he accepted his canonical election in the papal conclave. The two subsequent popes (John Paul I and John Paul II) abandoned the monarchial coronation, opting instead for a coronation-less investiture. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI took a <b>step</b> <b>further</b> <b>and</b> removed the tiara from his papal coat of arms, {{replacing it with a}} mitre.|$|E

According to Andy Kellman of Allmusic, the new label [...] "saved the band's life, as the members believed that they were too challenging for anyone else to understand or care for." [...] Kellman commented that, [...] "disorienting, confusing, and highly schizophrenic, the challenging releases were in direct contrast to the prevailing Britpop scene of the time," [...] taking [...] "A.R.
