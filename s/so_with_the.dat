A member of the Staff at Streatham, who later had the opportunity to know the English educational world very well once said that, as a Headmistress Miss Bassett was in a class by herself.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a {{haberdashery}} together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City.

A website entitled TrekUnited.com was set up to raise funds for a fifth season, but failed to do <b>so</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> money refunded after the unsuccessful campaign. A total of $32 million had been raised. Several years later, the possibility of a fifth season was still being discussed with Braga suggesting that fans could prompt Netflix into producing a new season of Enterprise by watching the existing four seasons on the service. This resulted in a Facebook campaign set up to promote the idea of a fifth season.|$|E

5|$|A. pinnatum and {{the other}} three tree waratah species lie in the {{subtribe}} Embothriinae, along with the true waratahs (Telopea), Oreocallis and the Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red flowers that are terminal (arising at the ends of branches), and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predates the splitting of the supercontinent Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers suggest that they are bird-pollinated, and have been so since the radiation of nectar-feeding birds such as honeyeaters in the Eocene. Triporopollenites ambiguus is an ancient member of the proteaceae known only from pollen deposits, originally described from Eocene deposits in Victoria. The fossil pollen closely resembles that of the Tasmanian waratah (Telopea truncata), A. pinnatum and Oreocallis grandiflora. Cladistic analysis of morphological features within the Embothriinae showed A.pinnatum to be the earliest offshoot within the genus and sister to the other three species. Along with members of other genera in the Embothriinae, A.pinnatum has crimson pollen, while the other three Alloxylon species have yellow pollen. Hence {{it is likely that the}} ancestral pollen colour was red, and remained <b>so</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> emergence of the genus Alloxylon, yet changed to yellow after the divergence of A.pinnatum.|$|E
5|$|By August 1977, discussions {{had been}} held with the main cast from The Original Series, {{as well as some}} of the actors who had played {{recurring}} characters. While none had been signed at the time, Roddenberry expressed confidence that they could do <b>so</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of Leonard Nimoy, who had stated that he would not return to television. However, Nimoy said separately that the first offer he received from Roddenberry for Phase II was only for the pilot and then guaranteed appearances in two out of every 11 episodes that followed, which he rejected. Nimoy and Roddenberry were not on good terms, following a legal suit launched by the actor against Paramount over merchandising rights featuring his likeness; Roddenberry had refused to support Nimoy in the case. There was also a problem with the return of William Shatner: owing to the pay he was to receive for the pilot and the first thirteen episodes, the network wanted a contingency plan to replace him afterwards. Shatner was aware at the time that the plan was either to reduce his appearances after the initial episodes and reduce his ongoing fees, or to kill off the character permanently if he refused the pay cut. Negotiations began with Shatner on June 10, but it was not until September 12 that his return was announced.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did <b>so</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E
5|$|When news of {{the siege}} reached Spain, Philip IV gave orders to {{assemble}} a relief fleet. Second-hand goods were purchased in the Netherlands and extraordinary levies were carried out across the country. The command of the expedition was entrusted to the Portuguese loyalist Miguel de Noronha, Count of Linhares, who was Captain General of the Galleys of the Mediterranean, and therefore supreme commander of the Spanish naval forces of this sea. He received orders to sail to Orbetello in command of 22 men-of-war of the Silver fleet and the Dunkirk squadron; the later providing 8 frigates. At least 3,300 soldiers were brought aboard these ships for the relief. Linhares' second in command was Admiral General Francisco Díaz de Pimienta, who displeased by his always secondary role, had recently resigned, claiming ill health. While Pimienta would {{be in charge of}} the sailing ships, Linhares would do <b>so</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> galleys. Once at sea, the Spanish fleet was joined off the Sardinian Cape Carbonara by 18 galleys from the squadrons of Naples, Sardinia, Genoa, and Sicily, which drove up its strength to 22 galleons and frigates and 30 galleys. Grand Admiral Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé, Admiral de Maille Brézé, in the meantime, could be reinforced by the divisions of Montade and Saint-Tropez, and was able to oppose Linhares and Pimienta with 24 sailing ships and 20 galleys.|$|E
