40|$|The {{analysis}} of variance procedure {{was used to test}} each of the hypotheses. Three of the hypotheses were rejected at the. 05 level of significance. Under the neutral story format, ego-involved subjects rated their behavior more positively than did role-taking subjects. Under the positive story format, ego-involved subjects rated their behavior more negatively than role-taking subjects. This difference was not in the anticipated direction. Under the positive story format, intentional story subjects rated their behavior more positively than accidental story subjects. The following null hypotheses for the neutral story condition failed to be rejected: there would be no <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the behavior ratings of subjects presented an intentional story format and subjects presented an accidental story format; {{and there would be no}} <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> behavioral ratings of male and female subjects.

50|$|Although our {{original}} {{intention was to}} ascertain under which conditions detailed flowcharts were most helpful, our repeated negative results have led us to a more skeptical opinion of the utility of detailed flowcharts under modern programming conditions.

In some cases the mean scores for the non-flowchart groups even surpassed the means for the flowchart groups. We conjecture that detailed flowcharts are merely a redundant presentation of {{the information contained in}} the programming language statements. The flowcharts may even be at a disadvantage because they are not as complete (omitting declarations, statement labels, and input/output formats) and require many more pages than do the concise programming language statements.|$|E
50|$|The MOS is {{expressed}} as a single rational number, typically in the range 1-5, where 1 is lowest perceived quality, and 5 is the highest perceived quality. Other MOS ranges are also possible, depending on the rating scale {{that has been used}} in the underlying test. The Absolute Category Rating scale is very commonly used, which maps ratings between Bad and Excellent to numbers between 1 and 5, as seen in below table.Other standardized quality rating scales exist in ITU-T recommendations (such as P.800 or P.910). For example, one could use a continuous scale ranging between 1-100. Which scale is used depends on the purpose of the test. In certain contexts there are no <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> ratings for the same stimuli when they are obtained using different scales.|$|E
50|$|Most simply, {{they can}} be {{presented}} as a table, displaying coordinates that show the most significant differences in activity between tasks. However, differences in brain activity are more often shown as patches of colour on an MRI brain 'slice', with the colours representing the location of voxels that have shown <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> conditions. The gradient of color is mapped to statistical values, such as t-values or z-scores. This creates an intuitive and visually appealing means of delineating the relative statistical strength of a given area of activation. Recently, an alternative approach has been suggested, in which the statistical map is combined with {{the map of the}} original difference in brain activity (or, more generally speaking, with the original contrast) and colorcodes are attributed to the latter.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} studies into Spiritual Healing {{illustrate}} how {{the design of the}} study can introduce experimenter bias into the results. A comparison of two studies illustrates that subtle differences {{in the design of the}} tests can adversely affect the results of one. The difference was due to the intended result: a positive or negative outcome rather than positive or neutral. A 1995 paper by Hodges & Scofield of spiritual healing used the growth rate of cress seeds as their independent variable in order to eliminate a placebo response or participant bias. The study reported positive results as the test results for each sample were consistent with the healers intention that healing should or should not occur. However the healer involved in the experiment was a personal acquaintance of the study authors raising the distinct possibility of experimenter bias. A randomized clinical trial, published in 2001, investigated the efficacy of spiritual healing (both at a distance and face-to-face) on the treatment of chronic pain in 120 patients. Healers were observed by [...] "simulated healers" [...] who then mimicked the healers movements on a control group while silently counting backwards in fives - a neutral rather than should not heal intention.
