He reached the highest live rapid rating in history after the tournament, and was at that point ranked No. 1 in all three disciplines simultaneously. However, Carlsen lost his No. 1 blitz ranking after he had a weak <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> the World Blitz Championship, and was unable to retain his World Blitz Champion title, losing it to Alexander Grischuk.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{severe weather}} was ongoing {{at the start}} of April 27 and {{continued}} for the entire day virtually unbroken. For the <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> a row, the SPC issued a high risk of severe weather for the Southern United States, and late that morning the SPC increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions for tornadoes became increasingly favorable for an extreme tornado outbreak.|$|E
5|$|California was {{admitted}} as a U.S. state on September 9, 1850. The admission act made {{no reference to}} Native American land rights. On their <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> office as California's first Senators, John Fremont and William M. Gwin introduced bills to extinguish all aboriginal title in California. On September 30, 1850, Congress passed an amended version of Fremont's bill appropriating $25,000 and authorizing the President to appoint three commissioners to negotiate treaties with the tribes of California. By January 1852, eighteen treaties had been negotiated, representing {{about one-third of the}} tribes and bands in the state. The state legislature strongly opposed the Indian reservation policy pursued by the treaty and lobbied the federal government to instead remove the Indians from the state entirely. Because Fremont and Gwin represented the key swing votes between the Whig and Democratic parties, none of the treaties were ever ratified and all were classified.|$|E

5|$|After Australia {{had been}} bowled out for 249 {{in the first}} innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge, Lindwall's high paced swing yielded 5/57 and cut England down for 144. However, Australia were then bowled out for only 123, leaving England 228 for victory. They were 1/120 with Lindwall wicketless as rain curtailed the match. In the Second Test at Lord's, England had reached 1/177 at stumps on the <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> reply to Australia's 346. The {{following}} day, Lindwall yorked rising star Tom Graveney and took 5/66 to restrict England to a lead of 26 runs. In Australia's second innings, Lindwall scored the fastest half-century in Ashes history. He took just 48 minutes to reach the mark, with two sixes and five fours. The match was drawn with Lindwall taking 2/26 in the second innings. Lindwall had helped to reduce England to 3/12 at stumps {{on the fourth day}} after removing Don Kenyon and Hutton with the new ball, but defiant batting on the final day saved the English. The Third Test was again drawn due to heavy rain, with Lindwall failing to pass double figures in either innings and taking 2/30 in the first innings. Hassett won the toss for the fourth consecutive Test at Headingley and sent England into bat. In front of his home crowd in Yorkshire, Hutton was yorked second ball from a pacy inswinging yorker. Lindwall produced a display of fast and accurate pace bowling, taking 5/54 from 35 overs as England managed only 169. After Australia took a 97 run lead, Lindwall took 3/104 to help leave the tourists with a victory target of 177. This was not before dour English all rounder Trevor Bailey attempted to stone-wall an Australian victory by batting for over four hours for 38 runs. Along with Miller, the pair took 14 wickets between them, displaying their pivotal role in Australia's bowling attack, especially {{in the absence of the}} injured Johnston, who was unavailable for most of the tour. Hutton ordered Bedser and Bailey to bowl leg theory from a long run, sending balls down the leg side to prevent the Australians from scoring. England held on for a draw with Australia 30 runs short when time ran out. The teams met at The Oval for the deciding Test and Australia could manage 275 after winning the toss with Lindwall striking a quickfire 62 noted for an array of off drives to top score and push the total to respectability. Lindwall then took 4/70 but it was not enough to prevent England taking a 31 run lead. Australia collapsed for 162 in the second innings, with the Surrey spin twins of Jim Laker and Tony Lock taking nine wickets between them. This left England 132 to win, something they achieved with eight wickets intact. Lindwall was unable to remove any of the Englishmen.|$|E

On the <b>second</b> <b>day,</b> <b>in</b> conditions still favouring the batsmen, 5 wickets from Alan Richardson and 4 from Melvyn Betts saw the visitors crumble to 232. Only Craig Spearman passed 30 for Gloucestershire, as he spent 144 minutes making 69. Middlesex were 93 for 3 in their second innings at stumps.|$|E
25|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} Fremont area began on June 6, 1795, when Mission San José was founded by the Spaniard Father Fermin de Lasuen. The Mission was established {{at the site of}} the Ohlone village of Oroysom. On their <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> the area, the Mission party killed a grizzly bear in Niles Canyon. The first English-speaking visitor to Fremont was the renowned trapper and explorer Jedediah Smith in 1827. The Mission prospered, eventually reaching a population of 1,887 inhabitants in 1831. The influence of the missionaries declined after 1834, when the Mexican government enacted secularization.|$|E

On August 22, IBF president Daryl Peoples announced that they would be dropping the mandatory <b>second</b> <b>day</b> weigh <b>in</b> for unification fights, meaning neither fighters are required to participate, however they would still encourage them to do so. It was reported that Álvarez would earn a base minimum $5 million and Golovkin would earn $3 million, before any shares of the revenue are added to their purses.|$|R

25|$|According to the Train's log, 30 September was {{a special}} day. It was the <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> a row that the base had not been shelled by Turkish artillery. Of course, they would {{make up for the}} {{oversight}} on 1 October, but for the sailors it was a welcome reprieve. While the Train wasn't itself involved in actual fighting, it was constantly shelled and bombed by Turkish forces. It was a common sight at Suvla to see 40 British soldiers under the direction of a RAN Petty Officer, working to bring supplies ashore during rough weather. The soldiers would openly look forward to returning to their trenches where they at least had the ability to shoot back at anyone who attacked them.|$|E
25|$|Having {{already at}} least drawn the series, England's first innings was slow {{with an average}} run rate of only 2.58 per over. England managed to hit 149/2 before succumbing to a run total of 238 {{on the first day}} of the test. Australia's {{response}} was marginally better, with Chris Rogers hitting a century to contribute to his team's 270 run innings amidst bad light on the <b>second</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> the third innings Australia were unable to prevent Ian Bell from securing his third century of the series by the close of the third day. England obtained 330 all-out, leaving a chase target of 298. In the fourth innings England dismissed Australia's batting order for 224 by the end of the fourth day to secure an unassailable 3–0 lead in the series.|$|E
25|$|Match {{reports were}} scarce in the 1750s but were {{becoming}} {{more common in the}} 1760s and it is known that Hampshire defeated Kent at Broadhalfpenny in 1768, their outstanding batsman John Small scoring more than 140 runs in the match. Scores were higher then than in earlier times and matches were tending to go into a <b>second</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> 1770, a Sussex lawyer called John Baker left an account in his diary of a match between Hambledon and the Surrey club Coulsdon which lasted two days. Baker came from Chichester, a journey of twenty miles taking four hours on horseback. He wrote how he went to Petersfield for overnight accommodation.
