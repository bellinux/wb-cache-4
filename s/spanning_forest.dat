25|$|It is {{possible}} to test whether a graph is bipartite, and to return either a two-coloring (if it is bipartite) or an odd cycle (if it is not) in linear time, using depth-first search. The main idea is to assign to each vertex the color that differs from the color of its parent in the depth-first search forest, assigning colors in a preorder traversal of the depth-first-search forest. This will necessarily provide a two-coloring of the <b>spanning</b> <b>forest</b> consisting of the edges connecting vertices to their parents, {{but it may not}} properly color some of the non-forest edges. In a depth-first search forest, one of the two endpoints of every non-forest edge is an ancestor of the other endpoint, and when the depth first search discovers an edge of this type it should check that these two vertices have different colors. If they do not, then the path in the forest from ancestor to descendant, together with the miscolored edge, form an odd cycle, which is returned from the algorithm together with the result that the graph is not bipartite. However, if the algorithm terminates without detecting an odd cycle of this type, then every edge must be properly colored, and the algorithm returns the coloring together with the result that the graph is bipartite.|$|E

An {{application}} {{is a new}} proof of the Chebotarev-Shamis forest theorem telling that det(1 + L) {{is the number of}} rooted <b>spanning</b> <b>forests</b> in a finite simple graph G with Laplacian L. We can generalize this and show that det(1 + kL) is the number of rooted edge-k-colored <b>spanning</b> <b>forests.</b> If a forest with an even number of edges is called even, then det(1 −L) is the difference between even and odd rooted <b>spanning</b> <b>forests</b> in G. 1. The forest theorem A social network describing friendship relations is mathematically described by a finite simple graph. Assume that everybody can chose among their friends a candidate for “president ” or decide not to vote. How many possibilities are there to do so, if cyclic nominations are discarded? The answer is given explicitly as the product of 1 + λj, where λj are the eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian L of G. More generally, if votes can come in k categories, then the number voting situation is the product of 1 + kλj. We can interpret the result as counting rooted <b>spanning</b> <b>forests</b> in finite simple graphs, which is a theorem of Chebotarev-Shamis. In a generalized setup, the edges can have k colors and get a formula for these rooted <b>spanning</b> <b>forests.</b> While counting subtrees in a graph is difficult [15, 12] in Valiants complexity class #P, Chebotarev-Shamis show that this is different if the trees are rooted. The forest counting result belongs to spectral graph theory [2, 5, 7, 21, 17] or enumerative combinatorics [10, 11]. Other results relating the spectrum of L with combinatorial properties is Kirchhoff’s matrix tree theorem which expresses the number of spanning trees in a connected graph of n nodes as the pseudo determinant Det(L) /n or the Google determinant det(E + L) with Eij = 1 /n 2. counting the numbe...|$|R
