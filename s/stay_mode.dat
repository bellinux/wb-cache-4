30|$|Much of {{our initial}} {{knowledge}} about IAH and ACS originates from patients with specific {{conditions such as}} ruptured aortic aneurysms, abdominal trauma, severe burns and severe acute pancreatitis [8 – 11]. These diagnostic groups, however, account for a minority of admissions in most ICUs. Although we have learned much about the pathophysiology and treatment of IAH from these studies, the true prevalence, impact on outcome, and risk factors of IAH remain to be clarified. To avoid bias from the preselection of patients, one should seek studies where all consecutive ICU admissions, independent of diagnosis, length of <b>stay,</b> <b>mode</b> of ventilation, etc. were included and the epidemiology of IAH addressed. We {{are not aware of}} any study meeting these criteria.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the type of cancer that {{develops}} from breast tissue; it is mostly common in women and {{it is one of the}} most studied diseases, largely because of its high mortality (second to lung cancer). However, it occurs in males also. This article presents a statistical study of the distribution of age, gender, length of <b>stay,</b> <b>mode</b> of diagnosis, status (dead or alive) after treatment and the location of breast cancer among 300 patients admitted in the University of Ilorin teaching hospital, Ilorin, Nigeria. The study covers a period of five (5) years; from 2011 to 2016 and logistic regression was used to perform the basic analysis in this study. It was discovered that the age of patients and the location of the breast cancer (right or left) contributes significantly to the survival of the patients. However, early detection and treatment of the disease is highly encouraged. This study also recommends that awareness should be taken to the grassroots and males should not be excluded from this discussion.

AimsThe {{aim of this study}} was to examine the demographics of the population served by the surgical department in a tertiary referral centre in the west of Ireland and to examine whether increasing age had an influence on morbidity, mortality and length of stay. MethodsData pertaining to all surgical admissions over a 6 -month period between was collected prospectively using an ACS-NSQIP based proforma. Data collected included patient age, gender, operative intervention, in-patient length of <b>stay,</b> <b>mode</b> of admission and complications related to their admission. ResultsA total of 2209 patients were admitted under the care of the general, vascular and breast services in our centre over a 6 -month period between August and January. Two thousand and nineteen patients had complete data collected. The average age was 50. 37 years (± 23. 62), with 24. 12 % (n =  533) older than 70 years. Only 12. 31 % of patients aged younger than 70 years experienced morbidity, compared to 25. 10 % of older patients. It was shown that there was a stepwise increase with complication rates and hospital in-patient stay across each decade of increasing age. Multivariate analysis showed those factors most predictive of a complication to include emergency admission, major or complex major surgical intervention, female gender and age. Length of stay was also found to have a positive correlation with increasing age (Spearman's Rho, p <  0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{specialised}} clinics {{for multiple}} pregnancies are recommended by several Obstetrics and Gynaecology governing bodies, studies examining outcome {{before and after}} introduction of such clinics remain few, were performed predominantly in North America in the 1990 s, and either amongst dichorionic twin pregnancies only or where chorionicity was not specified. Our objective, in the modern setting with twins of known chorionicity, was to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies before and after commencement of a consultant-led, multidisciplinary twins clinic (TC). METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 513 women, with birth of twins at ≥ 20 weeks' gestation, January 2007 to November 2011, at a metropolitan tertiary maternity hospital, Sydney, Australia. Demographic, pregnancy, and outcome data were obtained from hospital databases. Women receiving TC care (2009 - 2011) were compared to those receiving general antenatal clinic (ANC) care (2007 - 2010) and private care (2009 - 2011). Other models of care were excluded. Main outcome measures were total maternal inpatient <b>stay,</b> <b>mode</b> of birth, gestational age at birth, and neonatal nursery admission. RESULTS: 286 women {{were included in the}} main analyses: 84 attended ANC, 101 TC, and 101 a private obstetrician. TC women had similar demographics to ANC women and were slightly younger than private patients. TC women had lower Caesarean section rates (55 % vs. 70 % ANC and 76 % private, p[*]=[*] 0. 008) and fewer late preterm (34 [*]+[*] 0 - 36 [*]+[*] 6 weeks) births, (26 %TC vs. 44 % ANC and 41 % private, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Median maternal inpatient stay was shorter in TC than ANC (7 vs. 8 days, p[*]=[*] 0. 009) and similar to private (7 days). Nursery admission rates were higher in private patients (67 % vs. 49 % ANC and 47 % TC, p[*]=[*] 0. 001) and average birthweight lower (2283 g vs. 2501 g ANC and 2496 g TC, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Within a single centre, maternal and neonatal twin pregnancy outcomes varied significantly by model of care. Introducing a specialised twins clinic in our setting decreased Caesarean section rates, late preterm birth, and inpatient stay compared to ANC. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|This mixed methods {{research}} study provides {{an analysis of}} patients' psychological and practical reasons for attending the Cairns Hospital Emergency Department (ED) (P 3 ED study). The research has four main aims: to provide an analysis of current and recent trends in utilisation of the Cairns Hospital ED; to estimate the rate of GP-type patients presenting to the Cairns Hospital ED; to identify the psychological and practical reasons for people attending the Cairns Hospital ED; and to consider alternative models of care to potentially reduce presentations to the ED. The study was undertaken by the Centre of Nursing and Midwifery Research, James Cook University in collaboration with both the Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service and the Far North Queensland Medicare Local (the research funders). The principle rationale for the study was {{the increasing number of}} ED presentations at the Cairns Hospital, above Queensland average per annum increases, and an interest in investigating consumers' motivations in attending the Cairns Hospital ED. The {{research study}} has multiple datasets. Firstly, survey data form study participants, defined as consenting patients presenting to the Cairns Hospital Emergency Department from 13 March - 11 April 2014. Consenting patients undertook a 52 item survey instrument administered via iPads, with the assistance of research assistants (3 rd/ 4 th year nursing students and 4 th/ 5 th/ 6 th year medical students). Secondly, focus groups were held post-ED presentation providing data from 16 focus group participants in total. Willing participants left contact details for follow up to participate in focus groups which were held in April-May 2014 at Smithfield, Cairns North, and Edmonton Community Health Centres. Thirdly, Emergency Department Information System (EDIS) data from 2010 - 2014, including the period of the survey administration represents the third dataset. This data provided a range of data items for all ED presentations over the period, notably age, gender, postcode, triage category, length of <b>stay,</b> <b>mode</b> of arrival, referral status, ICD code. For the one month survey period the EDIS data was matched to the survey data via Medical Record Number (MRNs). MRNs were collected in a log casebook {{at the time of the}} iPad survey and were later matched to the MRNs provided with the EDIS data for the survey month only and for those survey participants that consented to have their medical record accessed (relating to that visit only). This created a fourth dataset - a matched dataset of EDIS and survey data for consenting survey participants only, for the period 13 March - 11 April 2014. Key findings of the study were the following: 1. The most significant increase in ED presentations in the past four years has occurred among adults (16 - 74 yrs); 2. Lack of consumer confidence in primary health care services based on the public perception that many health conditions are "too complicated" for such services is potentiating ED presentations; 3. The increase in ED presentations can be partially linked to acute exacerbations of chronic disease; 4. While parents of young children have good access to GP services, the ED is often considered the 'best place' for medical care. Analysis of the data gathered in the P 3 ED project has highlighted a number of 'red flag' issues around ED use in the Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service district. Further work is needed to provide a targeted and more detailed analysis of the existing dataset and an expansion of the dataset to include other sources of information, with a view to supporting projects, people and services that will ease pressure on the ED and strengthen current models of service delivery. Three additional areas are recommended for further investigation: the establishment of a minor injuries clinic, the development of an electronic patient decision making support system, and strategies to prevent exacerbations of chronic disease that lead patients to present to the ED...|$|E

By using duty-cycle protocol, the system achieves better energy efficiency compared to no duty-cycle solution (CSP with ARPEES). In the first 10 s of our simulations (initial phase of default configuration and configuration with B-MAC), the duty cycle is disabled for network initialization. During this interval, the power consumption {{is much higher than}} duty-cycle period. Result from this simulation shows that B-MAC has slightly better power consumption compared to two other cases. It {{is important to note that}} at any time, most of the nodes in network are in ACTIVE state and the total energy consumption of network is caused mainly by consumption of ACTIVE nodes. This consumption depends on the ratio of duration of transceiver in RX mode/duration of transceiver in IDLE mode. This ratio of CSP using B-MAC is very low because each node only needs to <b>stay</b> in RX <b>mode</b> to complete a CCA. In CSP, transceiver has to <b>stay</b> in RX <b>mode</b> to wait for a complete MAC packet. Therefore, the ratio of CSP using B-MAC is shorter than that of CSP.|$|R
